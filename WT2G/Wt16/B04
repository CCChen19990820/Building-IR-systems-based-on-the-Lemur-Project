<FONT  SIZE=-1><P><I>&quot;The idea came to mind as a complete thought, 
as clearly as the first order to go to New York. And 
along with it came into my mind the picture of a house 
where these new kids would come. A really nice house, 
all their own, where they would be 
welcomedwelcomed and loved. They could live in their house any time 
they wanted to.  The door would always be open; 
there would always be lots and lots of beds, and clothes 
to wear, and a great big kitchen.&quot;

<a name="1">
<BR>
<DD>In 1963 Dave Wilkerson wrote<I> The Cross and the 
Switchblade,</I> in which he recounted his experiences just a few years earlier 
in New York City.  Rev. Wilkerson was a self-described 
&quot;country preacher&quot; from Philipsburg, a small town in western 
Pennsylvania.  He was married with two children and pastoring a church 
in Philipsburg in 1958.  Rev. Wilkerson saw a story in 
<I>Life</I> magazine about seven gang youths in New York on trial for murder 
and suddenly felt a compelling urge to go to New York and help 
the boys.  
<P>Rev. Wilkerson took many leaps of faith, often unsure as 
to where he would turn next or who would pay tomorrow's bills.  
He met many gang members in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at first 
not knowing how he could help.  His ministry began to spread 
the good news that  homeless, destitute youths were loved and 
could have a better life. It has never departed from that central theme. 
 Often young people only needed someone to show them love 
and caring and lead them to a local church.  Others, however,  
fought in gangs, prostituted themselves, and turned to heroin for comfort. They needed more than just a message, they needed a home 
and constant attention.  
<P>Rev. Wilkerson dreamed of establishing such a home, a 
dream that came true in 1960.  With $100 in the bank, he agreed 
to purchase a large but neglected red-brick Georgian house.  
This house became the first Teen Challenge Center.  From that 
house 20 lowly-paid young workers coordinated efforts to 
evangelize the city's roughest neighborhoods, and to take in youths  
who needed extra attention.  Despite incidents of  stabbings 
and beatings, these workers remained devoted to  those they served. 
<P>The home saved many lives from gang violence and heroin. 
 Rev. Wilkerson believed that the only way to get and 
keep someone off heroin was to have that person receive the baptism 
of the Holy Spirit.  This religious experience is the central focus 
of many Pentecostal denominations.  The baptized Christian 
is taught to &quot;walk with the Holy Spirit,&quot; in close personal 
contact with God.  Rev. Wilkerson found that those who were 
baptized with the Holy Spirit no longer craved heroin.  
<P>
As Rev. Wilkerson was finishing his book, a new Teen 
Challenge Center was opening in Chicago, using the same methods 
as New York Teen Challenge.  In the epilogue he draws this 
lesson: &quot;The Holy Spirit is in charge.  As long as He remains in 
charge, the program will thrive.  The minute we try to do things by our 
own power we will fail.&quot;  Teen Challenge now operates 130 
centers nationwide. 
<P>
The Teen Challenge model is founded on a religious 
component that actually reverses the usual dynamic of religious 
rehabilitation programs.  The usual religious rehabilitation program 
aims to end drug and alcohol abuse  through a religion-based program. 
 Teen Challenge starts with discipleship training which 
battles man's sinful nature and has the side-effect of eradicating drug 
and alcohol abuse.  Teen Challenge firmly sees itself as a 
discipleship training program, and not a drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation program. 
<P>
Still, Teen Challenge focuses its ministry on those whose 
lives will be short and miserable if their addiction is allowed 
to continue. As patterns of addiction have evolved, Teen 
Challenge has changed its focus from teenagers to adults, but the 
philosophy remains the same.  The purpose of the program is not to 
&quot;rehabilitate&quot; in the usual sense of returning the individual to a 
previous state.  The goal  is to create a new person from the olda 
person who does not need addictive substances because he has 
found contentment in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. 
<P>
<BR>
<a name="2">
<P>
<B>A Growing Program</B>
<P>
Teen Challenge began in 1958 with the tiny but 
powerful ministry of one person who felt the call to leave his 
small-town parsonage for the streets of New York City.  Thirty-eight 
years and thousands of lives later, Teen Challenge is a major 
force among adolescents and adults who have addictive 
problems, and thousands will proudly declare that Teen Challenge 
has  given them a life they never thought possible--a happy life 
free from addictions. 
<P>
As of 1995, Teen Challenge had 130 centers in the 
United States, including Puerto Rico, and a total staff of over 1,500.  
One hundred eleven of the centers are residential. They have a 
 a total capacity of 2,877 and an average occupancy of 2,666. 
 Over 1,000 former addicts completed the program last year. 
<P>
Teen Challenge is also involved in other forms of 
counseling. It answered over 100,000 telephone crisis calls in 1995 
and held almost 14,000 drop-in counseling sessions.  Teen 
Challenge reached 839,000 people in jails, schools, churches, and community 
meetings.
<P>
But drug and alcohol addiction touches the lives of millions of Americans, 
and the mission of Teen Challenge is far from accomplished. 
<P>
<BR>
<a name="3">
<P>
<B>The Nature of Addiction</B>
<P>
Addictions are hard to define because factors such as 
&quot;tolerance,&quot; &quot;physical dependence,&quot; and &quot;reinforcement&quot; are part 
of the equation.  The complexity of defining &quot;addiction&quot; is 
compounded by social, political, and economic factors. 
Addiction to drugs and alcohol is also a medical matter. 
<P>&quot;Addiction,&quot; is not the same as &quot;physical dependence.&quot; 
 Physical dependence is how the body reacts when it lacks a 
drug to which  it has become accustomed.  Heroin has a high rate 
of physical dependence, causing all sorts of physical 
reactions when the body is deprived of it. They are often so violent 
that the addict, for the sake of maintaining bodily equilibrium, 
returns to drug abuse.  Cocaine and marijuana, on the other hand, create 
a relatively low rate of physical dependency. The body does not 
react violently to withdrawal.  Nevertheless, they also are addictive.   
<P>
Cocaine and marijuana are also similar in that they have low 
rates of &quot;tolerance.&quot;  That is, a user 
can take the drug repeatedly over a short time, yet not build up a 
resistance to its effects  Low tolerance rates also mean that the 
user can quit and return to drug use without needing more of it 
to achieve the same high.  For drugs with high tolerance rates, such 
as heroin, tolerance is the second devil working with physical 
dependence.  As the user builds up tolerance, quitting becomes 
more difficult, because the amount to which the user is addicted is 
constantly increasing, giving rise to 
increasingly violent physical reactions upon withdrawal.   
<P>
&quot;Reinforcement&quot; also helps to conceptually define 
addiction.  Used pharmacologically it  refers to whether an 
animal will work for a drug, and how hard and long the animal 
will work.  Animal experiments are not always good predictors 
of human behavior, but in this case the concept seems to apply. 
 Humans will work for a specific dose of a particular drug 
 administered in a particular way.  As the dose, and 
more importantly, method of administration change, the degree 
of reinforcement may also change.  Thus, while dependence 
and tolerance are physical changes in the body, reinforcement is 
a behavioral change. It is affected by social and economic 
factors, drug availability, and how the drug is administered.  
<P>
Therefore, to define &quot;addiction&quot; biologically, one must 
consider a number of factors that contribute to reinforcement and 
 dependence.  One should, furthermore, not forget that 
alcohol is a drug.  Alcohol has a low tolerance rate, a high 
physical dependency rate, and a mid-range rate of reinforcement.  Does 
the high physical dependence contribute to reinforcement?  
No doubt it does, but there are so many other factors that it is 
hard to say that physical dependence creates reinforcement, much 
less addiction.
<P>
With so many variables and causes, modern science 
cannot develop a medical or scientific formula for &quot;curing addiction.&quot; 
It is Teen Challenge's conviction that drug and alcohol abuse 
are products of man's distance from God which must first be 
overcome.
<P>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="4">
<B>The Teen Challenge Method</B>
<P>
Teen Challenge is considered by outsiders to be a religious 
program for the recovery of alcohol and drug addicts, but leaders 
of the movement would disagree with that definition. To them Teen Challenge offers a 
new alternative to rehabilitationso different that it is not 
rehabilitation at all, but a training program for Christian 
discipleship that helps to cleanse away the old human nature and with it 
the addiction.
<P>
Teen Challenge declares its mission is &quot;to evangelize 
people who have life-controlling problems and initiate the 
discipleship process to the point where the student can function as 
a Christian in society, applying spiritually motivated 
Biblical principles to relationships in the family, local church, chosen 
vocation, and the community.  Teen Challenge endeavors to help people 
become mentally sound, emotionally balanced, socially adjusted, 
physically well, and spiritually alive.&quot;
<P>
This mission is developed by various methods, including counseling 
 based on a standardized three-volume collection of class 
materials, &quot;Personal Studies for New Christians,&quot; by David Batty.  The 
counselor barely touches on issues of drugs or alcohol.  Instead, the new 
resident is taught lessons from the Bible on character, life-styles and 
Christian conversion.  Furthermore, the student is encouraged to read other 
Christian books in order to benefit spiritually and emotionally, but also to 
gain practical reading skills.  &quot;God's Plan for the Family&quot; is the subject of 
one class that concentrates on Biblical models of marriage 
and parenthood.   There are also lessons that deal with the 
temptation to leave the program that residents occasionally feel.
<P>
The overall goal of counseling is to prepare a person to 
enter a Christian life-style.  Discussion of drugs or alcohol is  rare. 
 Instead, the patient is taught a new approach to life, as well 
as encouraged to let go of a painful past.  Not only are 
the counseling sessions geared toward the realization of a new 
life-style, but the overall structure of the program, from the first 
day in the center to the reentry program for ex-residents, is 
geared to developing a Christian life-style and world view.  
<P>
Teen Challenge centers consider themselves part of 
the larger Christian church.  Teen Challenge centers are the 
branch of the Church that concentrates on 
&quot;ministry to acutely hurting people.&quot;  This 
is accomplished  through a  five-step process.  The first phase is evangelism.  
Once someone is converted, crisis intervention may be neededthe second step.  
Then, individuals are placed for a three to four month stint in residential induction 
centers.  Beyond this, the student moves to the fourth phase, residence for at least eight months in a training center.  The final step is re-entry, which helps students 
to readjust to society.  
<P>
The residence programs are centered around 
discipleship training with prayer, counseling, Bible reading, worship, 
work activity, meals, meditation, and recreation.  These activities 
are structured around five types of therapy.  In work therapy 
the resident learns the value of work as well as a vocational skill. 
 Group therapy involves the resident living with three others. 
All must take joint responsibility for the upkeep of their room. 
 There are also groups that meet on specific issues, according 
to the needs of the residents.  In individual therapy the goal is 
to &quot;join head and body&quot;to make the student aware of reality 
and  wanting to live in it. Music is another powerful source 
of therapy.  Residents join in worship through music, and in 
the process are drawn into its themes.  The final type of therapy 
is recreational therapy.  Outdoor events and exercise teach 
residents how to use their free time without relying on drugs.  
<P>
The long-range goal of residence and therapy is to move 
the &quot;ex-addict&quot; to the &quot;non-addict&quot; stage. 
 The resident is already an ex-addict upon entry into the program.  
However, he may still relapse into addiction. The final stage of 
non-addiction is achieved when the resident no longer has the desire to use  drugs 
or alcohol.  
<P>
The re-entry programthe final step of Teen Challenge's five 
step processensures that the ex-addict can complete the transition to 
non-addict.  Because it may take years to reach the non-addict stage, Teen 
Challenge stays in touch with many former addicts upon their graduation 
from the program, using the re-entry program to aid them in adjusting to 
the real world.  The focus of re-entry is to help the former addict 
establish healthy relationships with non-addicts and secure employment.  
<P>

<P><B>How Do you Spell Success?</B>
<P>
Teen Challenge's growth in its short history speaks 
volumes about the power of its ministry.  But these numbers are 
merely an outward sign of its effectiveness and high success rate.
<P>
Teen Challenge of Chattanooga, Inc. conducted an 
alumni survey between 1992 and 1994.  The survey was directed by 
Dr. Roger Thompson, head of the Criminal Justice Department 
at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.  All the 
alumni surveyed spent their 3-4 month third phase of the program in 
 the Teen Challenge residential induction center in 
Chattanooga sometime between 1979 and 1991.  They then transferred 
to phase four, the training center, at either Cape Girardeau, 
Missouri or Rehrersburg, Pennsylvania.  The survey had a 
50% response rate. 
<P>
The survey's findings are very impressive.  
Eighty-eight percent of those responding named Teen Challenge as 
the treatment program most beneficial in their lives.  Sixty 
percent continued their education after graduation from the program. 
 Sixty percent became members of a local church, and 
76% attended church regularly.  Seventy-two percent were 
employed.  Seventy-six percent were free from the court 
system, quite a reversal from the 60% who were in the court 
system upon entering the program.  Ninety-two percent claimed 
that Teen Challenge had a great impact on their lives.  
Eighty percent credited their ability to abstain from drugs to a 
personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  The statistic that speaks 
volumes, however, is the abstention rate.  A full 67% of 
respondents were completely abstaining from drugs and alcohol.  
<P>
The Chattanooga results are impressive but not surprising. 
 They echo the results found in 1975 by the Department 
of Health, Education, and Welfare.  Dr. Catherine Hess, 
M.D., formerly the assistant chief of the Cancer Control Program 
of the U.S. Public Health Service  studied the class of 
1968 entering the Brooklyn Teen Challenge, who went on 
to Rehrersburg Teen Challenge for their training center phase. 
<P>
Much like in Chattanooga, seventy-two percent of 
graduates continued their education after graduation from Teen 
Challenge.  Seventy-five percent of the graduates were 
currently employed.  Eighty-seven percent of graduates required 
no further treatment after graduating from Teen Challenge.  
Sixty-seven percent regularly attended church.  Only 30% had 
been arrested since graduating.  Moreover, in a statistic 
strikingly similar to the Chattanooga study, 67% of the graduates 
proved themselves drug-free by urinalysis.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<P>
<B>Changed Lives</B>
<P>
Perhaps the most powerful evidence of a changed life lies 
not in numbers, but in the stories of those whose very lives 
were saved by Teen Challenge.  One such life is that of  James Heurich. James 
began sipping his parents' beers at an early age. His father was an alcoholic. By the age 
of 15, James was drinking bourbon, smoking marijuana, and sniffing up to 20 tubes of glue in a single day.  &quot;My 
younger brother, whom I had started out on drugs, became a heroin addict.  I remember 
the night he died in his sleep in the bed next to mine.&quot;  
<P>
The funeral of James' brother was conducted by the director of the 
Philadelphia Teen Challenge. He prayed with Heurich's father.  After 
37 years of alcoholism, Mr. Heurich put down the bottle forever. 
 For the next eight months, Philadelphia Teen Challenge 
reached out to James Heurich who had entered the program.  James 
is now an ordained minister and Executive Director of San 
Antonio Teen Challenge.  
<P>
John Douglas is another young man whose life was 
changed by Teen Challenge.  He declared in <I>American 
Horizon</I> that, &quot;[i]f Christ had not impacted my life through Teen Challenge, 
I would most likely be dead or locked up.&quot;  Tortured by 
drugs, John knew that he wanted to end his addiction, and he found 
a way out in Teen Challenge.  John entered the Teen 
Challenge program at age 17.  For the first ten days, he was still 
hallucinating from LSD flashbacks.  The patient and caring 
staff finally broke through John's haze, and he completed the 
entire program.  Today John is married with two children, and 
he owns a roofing business.  He credits Teen Challenge with 
his current happy life. 
<P>
These individuals are representative of countless 
others throughout America who share three common attributes.  
They are substance abusers whose lives had been destroyed by 
their habits.  They had tried unsuccessfully to kick their 
habits through various secular programs.  And they have 
found comfort and life control through a structured religiously 
focused treatment programTeen Challenge.
<P>
There is something else that unites them.  The programs that have made the difference between life and death for them are 
at risk.  As long as States exercise licensing authority in ways 
that undermine or corrupt the viability of these programs, a cloud 
of uncertainty will hang over these much-needed organizations. 
<P>At a time when we worry who will help the unfortunates if 
the safety net is removed, we should make it easier for 
these programs to operatenot harder. At a time when concern 
over drug and alcohol abuse is growing, we should foster 
private, voluntary, faith-based programs by removing the state 
licensing requirements that hold such potential for abuse.  This 
will entail a state-by-state examination of the many laws that 
govern drug and alcohol treatment.  Arduous though this task may 
be, it will allow these institutions to become building blocks in 
the creation of a civil society of free and responsible individuals.

<B><I>Texas State Authorities Raise Obstacles to Teen Challenge Success</B></I>
<P>
The Alamo was a vivid backdrop and symbolic frame 
of reference for dozens of protesters.  In the crowd of 
largely low-income individuals picketing on a mid-July day 
in 1995, many held signs calling for an end to 
government oppression.  Robert Woodson of the National Center 
for Neighborhood Enterprise, the event organizer, 
exhorted the crowd to take a stand against tyranny, not just 
for themselves, but also for those whose ability to control 
their own lives was threatened by an imperious 
government agency.  This event focused the eyes of the nation on 
Texas where a struggle between  state officials and a small 
faith-based drug and alcohol treatment facility offered 
crucial insight into one of the most important challenges 
facing voluntary self-help programs in America.
<P>
The villain in this story and the object of the 
protesters' wrath is the Texas Commission for Alcohol and 
Drug Abuse (TCADA), which exercises licensing authority 
over all drug and alcohol treatment centers in the state.  
TCADA had recently notified the San Antonio chapter of 
Teen Challenge, the local affiliate of the nationally 
acclaimed drug and alcohol treatment program, that it needed 
a license to continue providing treatment for addiction.  
The fact that San Antonio Teen Challenge had provided 
these service since 1977 was irrelevant to TCADA.
<P>
Under Texas law, any organization that offers 
treatment for drug and alcohol addiction needs a license, and 
TCADA enforced this requirement vigorously.  In order to obtain 
a license, Teen Challenge would have to adopt a 
program that TCADA deemed appropriate.  Not 
surprisingly, TCADA's requirements were different from, and in 
key ways antithetical to, Teen Challenge methods.  So 
Teen Challenge was faced with a stark choice: become a 
creature of the state or halt its program.
<P>
The plight of Teen Challenge came to the attention 
of Marvin Olasky, who published an op-ed in the 
<I>Wall Street Journal</I> in August of 1995 exposing TCADA's 
heavy-handed tactics to a national audience.  At the same time, 
the Institute for Justice offered to represent Teen 
Challenge. The Institute threatened a lawsuit using the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act to challenge TCADA's 
authority to impose licensing conditions that interfered with 
Teen Challenge's fundamental tenets of faith practiced in 
its drug and alcohol treatment.
<P>
The Institute for Justice began negotiations with 
Texas Governor George W. Bush and with TCADA.  As 
negotiations proceeded, the Institute contacted 
<I>NBC Nightly News</I> and encouraged them to report the story of the 
tension between a group dedicated to self-help through faith 
and secular licensing requirements of a state agency that 
undermined that faith.  NBC soon produced an <I>American 
Agenda</I> feature that was highly favorable to Teen Challenge.  
Not long thereafter, TCADA signed a consent order that 
allows Teen Challenge to continue to operate as it has 
historicallywithout a license. In addition, Governor Bush 
appointed a task force whose members included Teen 
Challenge representatives to review Texas laws and 
regulations and propose reforms that will recognize the importance 
and efficacy of faith-based treatment programs.  
<P>
Although this situation came to a happy resolution, it 
is but one episode in an ongoing saga of how states 
exercise licensing authority to the detriment of voluntary 
self-help drug and alcohol treatment programs, particularly those 
of a faith-based nature.  For as social work and 
psychiatry have exerted their professional presence in this field, 
their secular methodology has become increasingly 
incorporated into licensing requirements imposed by states.  
Teen Challenge has faced similar issues in Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, and Florida in recent years, all of which have 
been resolved at least temporarily so as to allow Teen 
Challenge to continue. But the issue of licensing has left 
unresolved the underlying tension between secular and 
faith-based methods.

<P>
 <B><I>Some of the Alternatives</B>
<P>
<P>Alcoholics Anonymous:</I> The modern era of alcohol 
and drug treatment began with Alcoholics Anonymous.  
AA was founded in 1935 by William Wilson, &quot;Bill W.&quot; 
and Robert Holbrook Smith, &quot;Dr. Bob.&quot;  The founders 
believed that the only way to sobriety was to give one's 
life to a Higher Power.  AA treated alcoholism as a 
disease without cure, but with remission.  That remission can 
be maintained only by hard work and moral support, 
and many find that support through AA.  Explosively 
successful from the beginning, AA has grown to over a 
million members, with 67,000 local chapters, plus Al-Anon 
and Alateen, support groups for loved ones and teenage 
children of alcoholics. 
<P>
Alcoholics Anonymous is famous for its 12-step 
method, a method used by many drug and alcohol treatment 
and support groups today.  The 12 steps alcoholics must 
follow to put an end to their alcoholism have a religious 
dimension.  They include such steps as asking God to 
remove one's shortcomings, prayer and meditation, and a 
spiritual awakening. Many attribute the success of AA to its religious natureto the admission that alcoholism can not 
be conquered without the intervention of a Higher Power.
<P>
<I>Medical Model</I>: The general consensus among drug 
and alcohol treatment experts is that alcoholism is a disease.   
 This concept, began with AA and spread to Yale's 
Center of Alcohol Studies, founded in the 1930s.  The Center 
set the pace for medical research and intervention into 
alcoholism by training alcoholism counselors.  The 
disease concept of alcoholism has since that time been the 
leading paradigm in the field.  It has evolved from AA's 
simple concept of  addiction as a lasting condition that one 
must never quit fighting to alcoholism as a medical and 
psychological condition that can be studied empirically.  
Drug abuse, which has exploded in recent decades, has 
therefore been approached by the same model.  
<P>
<P><I>Drug and Psychological Therapy: </I>Drug and alcohol 
addiction are predominantly treated by medical and 
psychological methods.  Most rehabilitation centers follow 
the &quot;Minnesota Model,&quot; which employs drug treatment 
only for detoxification.  The centers often incorporate AA's 
12 steps with inpatient treatment.  The Model integrates 
self-help counseling, involves the family directly and 
continuously, and employs aftercare, or continued contact with 
the patient after graduation from the program.  The 
centers often incorporate AA's 12 steps into the treatment, with 
the first five steps occurring in the inpatient stage, and 
the remaining seven in aftercare. 
<P>
Of all the drug treatments for alcohol, the most popular 
is disulfiram, which goes more commonly by its brand 
name, Antabuse.  Physicians initially treat patients by giving 
them the drug followed by alcohol.  The patient 
experiences acetaldehyde buildup, which induces vomiting, nausea, 
a drop in blood pressure, and a pounding heart.  The 
patients often feel that they will die right there in the doctor's office. 
 Motivated by fear and a regular dosage of Antabuse, 
the patient refrains from drinking alcohol.  
<P>
The second most popular method of drug treatment 
for alcohol is conditioned-reflex treatment.  This 
treatment originated in 1940 when Dr. Walter Voegelin began 
treating alcoholics with Pavlovian conditioning.  The 
physician injects a drug that induces nausea.  Just before the 
patient feels the effects of the drug, the physician gives the 
patient alcohol.  The violent physiological reaction becomes 
associated with alcohol in the patient's mind, and the patient 
will not drink alcohol for several months.  The interim time 
is used for rehabilitation and psychological treatment.
<P>
Psychotherapy has also been used for alcoholics, 
but without good results.  Better results have been attained 
by combining drug therapy with group therapy, 
rehabilitation clinics, and the Minnesota Model.  
<P>
Drug addiction has been treated in similar ways.  
Perhaps the most common medical method of countering 
drug addiction is detoxification.  Detoxification involves 
administering an opiate or barbiturate to the patient at 
regular intervals and slowly reducing dosages.  An 
in-hospital detoxification usually takes two weeks, while an 
outpatient detoxification takes four to six weeks. Detoxification 
is successful in temporarily stalling addiction so that 
other treatment may be administered, but rarely causes 
long-term cessation of drug use without other interventions. 
<P>
Psychiatric hospitals are sometimes used in 
conjunction with detoxification.  Psychiatric hospital programs 
vary: elements include the frequency of patient-psychiatrist 
contact, the focus of daily activity, whether individual or 
group, and the use of psychiatric drugs.  Psychiatric 
hospitalization is good for those with serious mental disorders, but 
it is not particularly successful or cost-effective for those 
with no such disorder.
<P>
Psychiatric drugs, among others, are also used in 
outpatient therapy.   However, the more popular form of 
outpatient therapy is drug maintenance.  Drug 
maintenance therapy differs from detoxification in that it requires 
a much longer term of treatment, focusing on one of 
three areas: (1) treating withdrawal symptoms and cravings, 
(2) creating high cross-tolerance so that the addict can 
no longer feel any &quot;high&quot; from using the illicit drug, and 
(3) maintaining abstinence by drug antagonists, which 
neutralize the effects of the addictive drug.  The best 
known drug maintenance therapy is methadone, which is used 
as a substitute for heroin.  It can be given in doses to 
either treat cravings or to create cross-tolerance.  Methadone 
has met with mixed results, as have most types of drug 
maintenance therapy.
<P>
Besides medical treatments, psychological and 
social treatments are also used for drug addictions. 
Psychological treatments include psychotherapy, behavior 
therapy, and group therapy.  The classical Freudian 
psychotherapy has not been effective in treating drug addiction.  
Behavior therapy, in which the patient unlearns maladjusted 
behavior and relearns functional behavior, has been more 
successful.  Group therapy, which entails three different 
kinds of therapy, has been yet more successful, but with 
some mixed results.  Group therapy involves couples, 
families, and encounter groups.  Encounter groups bring 
addicts together to emotionally struggle through and work 
out their problems, a method that is definitely effective in 
the short-run, but with uncertain effects over long periods 
of time.  
<P>
Social intervention takes a different route.  Some 
groups, like Alcoholics Anonymous, maintain self-help 
programs with addict support groups run by ex-addicts.  
Others, known as &quot;day care&quot; centers, involve the addict in 
a daytime program.  Therapeutic communities are like 
day care centers, except that the addict lives in the community. 
 They vary tremendously, but all have the same 
basic phases of admission, residence, and post-residence 
reentry into society.  The residence phase involves a 
structured program that modifies the environment of the 
patient, assigning work tasks and holding group meetings.  
The results of such programs are very mixed.

<center><h2>INSIDE THE GREEN MAFIA: THE BIG ENVIRONMENTALIST GRANTMAKERS</h2>
<h3>by Jonathan Adler</h3></center>
<p>
Environmentalism today is Big Business.  By some estimates, the 
environmental movement commands revenues of nearly one-half billion
dollars annually, and at least a dozen of its organizations have
annual budgets in excess of $20 million. Notwithstanding environmentalist
claims, this wealth is not an accurate indicator of grass-roots
support.  Membership levels at many environmental groups have
been static or fallen in recent years, and membership dues provide
less than half of a typical group's funds, although they remain
a significant source of revenue.  The major environmentalist groups
headquartered in Washington, DC look elsewhere for the vast sums
they require to support their large staffs and expensive advocacy
campaigns.  Corporations, government agencies and private philanthropic
foundations now provide major grant support to the movement. 
This report will focus on the role of foundation support.  (For
a full discussion of the environmental movement see Jonathan Adler,
Environmentalism at the Crossroads, Capital Research Center, 1995,
299 pages.)
<P>
According to a 1992 study conducted by the Conservation
Fund, private foundations account for approximately one-fifth
of environmental group funding.  By virtue of their concentrated
funding, foundations have become highly influential in the environmental
movement.  However, more than money is involved.  When an environmental
group receives active foundation assistance, the financial reward
is only the most tangible aspect of support.  As the Conservation
Fund study concludes:
<P>
The importance of foundations goes well beyond the
giving of money.  Leaders depend on foundations for programmatic
ideas, information on productive  networking with other groups,
occasional technical support, and the sense of legitimacy and
prestige that comes with foundation grants.  Well-funded organizations
gain the attention of policymakers simply by virtue of the recognition
they receive from national grant makers.
<P>
In recent years foundation funders have moved from
behind the scenes.  Not content to be silent partners, grantmakers
have discovered that they can coordinate lobbying and set the
agenda of diverse environmental groups by coordinating the distribution
of foundation grants.  This is the enviable role of the Environmental
Grantmakers Association, a so-called &quot;affinity group&quot;
of the Council on Foundations.  An EGA conference brochure puts
it this way:  &quot;In 1987, a group of environmental grantmakers
met in Washington, D.C. to discuss common interests and to learn
about each other's specific programs.&quot;  Among the group's
stated purposes: &quot;To promote recognition that the environment
and its inhabitants  are endangered by unsustainable human activities;&quot;
&quot;To facilitate communication, foster cooperation, and develop
collaboration among active and potential members;&quot; and &quot;To
increase the resources available to address environmental concerns.&quot;

<P>
In January 1995, EGA had 182 members from private,
corporate, and community foundations.  Housed in the offices of
the Rockefeller Family Foundation in New York City, EGA's &quot;Management
Committee&quot; in 1994 included representatives from eight foundations
-- Island,Nathan Cummings, Surdna, C.S. Mott, Compton, Bullitt,
MacArthur, and Hewlett -- and one corporation, Apple Computer.
 EGA members meet annually at retreats and conferences, share
information on grantmaking, and strategize about how to achieve
environmental goals.  As the leftist magazine Mother Jones has
noted, &quot;By deciding which organizations get money, the grant-makers
help set the agenda of the environmental movement and influence
the programs that activists carry out.&quot;  EGA coordinator
Donald Ross, a director of the grantmaking Rockefeller Family
Fund, asserts that &quot;funders have a major role to play&quot;
in determining the environmental policy agenda.  
<P>
At EGA's 1994 annual meeting many members agreed
to devote more funds to issues of population and consumption,
a theme of the meeting.  Topics at the 1992 annual retreat included
&quot;Population and the Environment,&quot; &quot;Environmentally
Responsible Investing,&quot; &quot;Environmental Education, K-12,&quot;
&quot;Environment and Spirituality,&quot; and &quot;1993, Year
of Indigenous Peoples.&quot; Few of EGA's professional grantmakers
know how their organizations' founders created the wealth they
freely dispense.  Indeed, they do not seem to appreciate how the
free enterprise system makes wealth accumulation possible.  In
his keynote address to the 1992 EGA retreat, zoologist and environmental
author David Suzuki offered a remarkable commentary that illustrates
how intellectually disconnected environmentalists are from the
wealth of their foundation patrons.  Suzuki observed:
<P>
Economics is a very chauvinistic invention -- and
I don't mean male chauvinist -- it is a species chauvinistic idea.
 No other species on earth, and there may be 30 million of them,
has had the nerve to put forth a concept called economics, in
which one species, us, declares the right to put value on everything
else on earth, in the living and non-living world.
<P>
Although some EGA members are less radical in their
analysis and prescriptions, the organization has helped steer
environmental grantmaking leftward toward more government control
over the economy.  Today most foundation giving for &quot;environmental
protection&quot; is used to prop up nonprofit organizations that
have become key parts of a Washington establishment dedicated
to continued expansion of the regulatory state.  Profiles of some
of the most powerful grantmaking foundations supporting the environmental
cause follow:<BR>
<P>
<a name="pew"> 
<h4>THE BIGGEST AND BADDEST:
THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS</h4><BR>
<P>
Pew appears to be the largest environ-<BR>
  mental grantmaker.  In 1993 alone it <BR>
  donated $35 million to green causes.  As a leader in the field
it even goes so far as to conceive of projects for environmental
groups to undertake in order to attract funding from other private
foundations.  Pew's funding focuses on three areas: global climate
change, pollution prevention, and forest and marine conservation.
 It also has launched major programs to promote public advocacy
and civic participation in government policymaking and it supports
&quot;environmental education&quot; using the school curriculum
and Boy Scout style recruiting to mobilize children for the cause.
<P>
Pew funds have also spurred development of new tactics
including the formation of environmental coalitions and regional
campaigns.  A recent $150,000 Pew grant to a project named the
Global Action Plan for the Earth seeks to &quot;support the development
and delivery of a program educating children about how to live
environmentally sustainable lives.&quot;  Another grant of $120,000
over two years went to the Humane Society of the United States
(HSUS) to support a project entitled &quot;Theological Education
to Meet the Environmental Challenge.&quot;  It is aimed at influencing
seminaries and divinity schools on population and environmental
issues.  HSUS, contrary to popular belief, does not run animal
shelters.  It is an animal rights advocacy organization that opposes
hunting, circuses, rodeos, and marine mammal parks.  Its officers
have recently come under fire for using the society to promote
their private financial interests.
<P>
The scope of environmental support by the Pew Charitable
Trusts may be gauged by a review of grants it made in 1995: 
<P>
Alaska Conservation Foundation (15 months)      $470,000
<P>
American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy
(2-years)   $325,000 
<P>
Aspen Institute (9 months) $1,015,000 
<P>
Business for Social Responsibility Education Fund
    $200,000 
<P>
Chesapeake Bay Foundation (2 years)      $200,000
<P>
Christian Environmental Association (2 years)   
  $175,000 
<P>
Christianity Today (18 months) $175,000 
<P>
Environmental Defense Fund $110,000 
<P>
Environmental Information Center (2 grants)     
$986,000 
<P>
Greater Yellowstone Coalition (2 years)      $600,000
<P>
National Audubon Society (4 grants, 2 years)    
 $2,015,000
<P>
National Religious Partnership for the Environment
(18 months)   $323,000 
<P>
Natural Resources Defense Council (9 months)    
 $625,000 
<P>
Sierra Club Foundation (2 grants, 9 months)     
$1,125,000
<P>
Worldwatch Institute (2 years) $200,000 
<P>
World Wildlife Fund (3 grants, 2 years)      $1,360,000
<BR>
<P>
In 1988, the Foundation established the Pew Fellows
Program in Conservation and the Environment.  Rather like the
MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius grants,&quot; this program was
intended to fulfill what Pew identified as &quot;a critical need
to identify and support a new generation of scholar-scientists
who would apply their special knowledge and skills directly to
pressing environmental problems.&quot;  The Foundation annually
awards ten three-year $150,000 fellowships.  More recently, however,
Pew has changed its definition of likely recipients, and the fellowships
now encompass &quot;outstanding scientists, researchers and conservation
activists.&quot;  Why the change?  Perhaps because Pew fellowships
increasingly go to environmental activists with limited scientific
credentials.  Recent Pew Fellows include Michael J. Bean and David
S. Wilcove of the Environmental Defense Fund, Johanna H. Wald
of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Victor M. Sher of the
Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, and Carl Safina of the National
Audubon Society. 
<P>
One current Pew scholar is Theo Colburn, a zoologist
at the World Wildlife Fund and co-author of Our Stolen Future,
a controversial new book which alleges that synthetic chemicals
may be responsible for such developmental and reproductive problems
in humans as low sperm counts, impotence, and homosexuality. 
Another Pew scholar is Donella Meadows, co-author of the infamously
wrong 1972 doomsday report The Limits to Growth. Another Pew Fellow
is Reed F. Noss, who established the radical Wildlands Project
with Earth First! founder Dave Foreman.  The Wildlands project
is an effort to &quot;restore&quot; over half of the United States
to its &quot;natural&quot; condition.  Its mission statement says:
<P>
"We live for the day when grizzlies in Chihuahua
have an unbroken connection to grizzlies in Alaska; when gray
wolf populations are continuous from New Mexico to Greenland;
when vast, unbroken forests and flowing plains again thrive and
support pre-Colombian populations of plants and animals.&quot;
<P>
Pew Fellows are nominated by 37 &quot;leaders in
the conservation  field&quot; who each submit two candidates.
 Candidates must then apply for a fellowship.  The  nominators
include many representatives from environmental organizations
that are recipients of Pew funds, including the Worldwatch Institute,
World Wildlife Foundation, Natural Resources Defense Council,
Environmental Defense Fund, and the National Audubon Society.
 Beginning in 1996, Pew Fellows will be selected who focus on
the &quot;sustainable utilization&quot; and conservation of marine
resources. 
<P>
Pew Fellow Michael J. Bean, chair of the wildlife
program at the Environmental Defense Fund, currently directs the
Pew Scholars Program, and he sits on the Advisory Committee that
evaluates applications.  That committee also includes Zero Population
Growth founder Paul Ehrlich, sustainable development guru Herman
E. Daly, author of the no-growth Steady-State Economics, and Kathryn
Saterson of the World Wildlife Fund. 
<P>
Another ambitious Pew project is Environmental Strategies,
since renamed the Environmental Information Center.  Conceived
in 1993 by Joshua Reichert, Pew's environmental director and a
veteran of the movement, its stated mission is to help environmental
groups &quot;conduct public education campaigns on priority national
environmental issues&quot; and &quot;to improve the campaigning
skills of national, regional and local environmental groups.&quot;
In truth, the Environmental Information Center is controlled
by a mixed board of environmental and foundation leaders and it
is supposed to act as a &quot;command center&quot; coordinating
lobbying by Washington, D.C. environmental advocacy groups.  &quot;We
started [the Environmental Information Center] because no organization
was doing what we thought needed to be done,&quot; Reichert told
writer Mark Dowie.  But others disagree.  Reflecting the resentment
that environmental groups must feel at attempts by funders to
control their agenda, Jim Maddy, then president of the League
of Conservation Voters, responded, &quot;The idea that what we
need right now is yet another organization to perform the function
of a headquarters doesn't strike me as the solution to our problems.&quot;
<P>
Pew supplied the Tides Foundation with a two-year,
$650,000 start-up grant to administer funds to get the Center
going.  The W. Alton Jones Foundation added $125,000 and the Rockefeller
Family Fund supplied another $60,000.  Last year, Pew gave the
Center close to $1 million.  The Environmental Information Center
is meant to sell policies, not provide research or analysis. 
As Reichert has explained, &quot;I don't want someone who knows
the facts, or can articulate them persuasively.  I want someone
who wants to win and knows how.&quot;  The ideal project leader,
he told Dowie, would be Clinton campaign consultant James Carville.
<P>
The Center claims that its D.C. office is &quot;the
'war room' for a massive public education campaign to alert Americans
that the new majority in Congress is teaming up with powerful
special interests to roll back 25 years of environmental protections.&quot;
 To broaden support for environmental regulation, it is trying
to build coalitions with local government officials, religious
leaders, and &quot;children's advocacy groups.&quot;  The Center
has been particularly active in promoting the work of the Evangelical
Environmental Network, a spin-off of the liberal Evangelicals
for Social Action, a group that argues that the Endangered Species
Act is biblically ordained. According to the Network, &quot;the
threat to the Act threatens the core of our faith.&quot;  The
Environmental Information Center's has also been an ardent opponent
of the House Republicans' &quot;Contract With America.&quot; 
<P>
The Center's 501(c)(4) lobby, the American Community
Protection Association, has campaigned against the Contract's
property-rights legislation by running ads in publications like
Roll Call, a Washington, D.C. biweekly newspaper that focuses
primarily on the internal operations of Congress.  &quot;'Takings'
provisions would interfere with state and local decision making
and could inflict new and unlimited funding mandates on state
and local governments.&quot;  In fact, the provisions, which provide
compensation for government actions diminishing property values,
apply only to federal laws and explicitly exempt federal rules
that reinforce state and local laws, including common-law protections
of public health and safety.  By targeting a publication widely
read by members of Congress and their staffs, the advertisements
must influence how they will think about property rights legislation.
<BR>

<h4>MONEY LAUNDERED BY
THE TIDES FOUNDATION</h4><BR>
<P>
The Tides Foundation is a unique 
funder of environmentalist causes. 
Founded in 1976 by activist Drummond Pike it aims &quot;to link
diverse individuals seeking  social justice, creative new approaches
to economic enterprise, and an enlightened stewardship of our
national environment.&quot;  In particular, &quot;The Foundation
is interested in supporting efforts which demonstrate the value
of sustainable agricultural techniques, groups working to promote
the preservation of the Earth's remaining wetlands and rainforests,
and the struggles of indigenous people around the world who have
pioneered ways of `living gently' on the land.&quot;
<P>
Tides is no traditional foundation. Legally, it
is a grantmaking charity, not a philanthropic foundation.  In
practice, this means that Tides is both a grantmaker and a grant-taker,
raising money in order to support assorted projects undertaken
by those who come to it.  Tides' money comes from other foundations,
individual and corporate grants, and even government sources.
 This dual role gives Tides an unusual place among foundation
funders of environmental groups.
<P>
The Tides Foundation's division of activities reflects
its twin purposes: grantmaking and project management.  This peculiar
structure enables it to handle so-called &quot;pass-through&quot;
grants for those who want to keep their contributions secret.
 Tides will work with donors to channel their funds to preferred
causes.  Typically, donors give a minimum of $25,000 annually
to Tides.  At the donor's direction, Tides will then steer these
funds to the donor's chosen cause, whether or not it is affiliated
with Tides, and it will charge a percentage service fee.  Tides
is widely credited with having provided the grant that enabled
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) to hire Fenton Communications,
a public relations firm, to promote NRDC's alarmist report on
the pesticide Alar.  Many donors choose this way of working with
Tides because it can provide them with total anonymity.  &quot;Anonymity
is very important to most of the people we work with,&quot; Tides
president Drummond Pike explained to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
<P>
The management side of Tides, known as the Tides
Center, became a separate entity in April 1996.  It helps small
start-up groups handle their organizational affairs.  This projects
management task is the heart of Tides' work.  These start-up group
projects are technically adjuncts of the Foundation because they
use Tides' non-profit status as their own.  This spares new groups
from the chore of completing IRS paperwork to achieve independent
tax-exempt status.  It also enables them to benefit from the Tides'
oversight and managerial expertise.  Tides can offer new groups
practical experience in managing particular programs.  It can
help them select a health insurance provider and other outside
contractors.  Funding is channeled through Tides, which charges
a percentage fee for its services.  These fees pay for Tides'
operating expenses. 
<P>
Groups that work with Tides commend the concept.
 &quot;I think it is a bargain for a small start-up organization
to not have to worry about a lot of the vital details of becoming
an institution that Tides can take care of for you,&quot; commented
Kenneth Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group (EWG),
a current Tides Project.  EWG raised about $1.3 million in 1994
and paid Tides approximately $65,000 in service fees.  The Environmental
Information Center also relied on the Tides Center before its
obtained independent non-profit status. 
<P>
In 1994 Tides distributed $11 million in grants.
 These went to an assortment of causes, only some of which were
environmental.  Tides' environmental-related grants listed in
its 1994-5 annual report include the following:<BR>
<P>
Animal Welfare Institute  $19,106 
<P>
Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes     
$17,816 
<P>
Environmental Action Foundation $15,000 
<P>
Environmental Support Center $25,000 
<P>
Environmental Working Group $46,909 
<P>
Essential Information  $149,3000 
<P>
Friends of the Earth  $260,000 
<P>
Greenhouse Crisis Foundation $50,000 
<P>
Greenpeace, USA  $22,309 
<P>
Rainforest Action Network $32,532 
<P>
Rocky Mountain Institute $20,000 
<P>
In 1994, Tides projects received an additional $22
million from outside foundations, individuals and corporations.
 In 1993, nearly one-third of the Tides Center's 180 projects
dealt with the environment.  These included the Student Environmental
Action Coalition, the Institute for Deep Ecology Education, and
the Biotechnology Working Group.  Current environmental projects
include, among others, the Environmental Working Group, the Military
Toxics Project, the Biotechnology Working Group, Biodiversity
Action Network, Forest Guardians, the Environmental and Economic
Justice Project, and the Institute for Global Communications,
which operates the EcoNet on-line computer network.
<P>
In the spring of 1996, the two sides of Tides formally
separated.  Both, however, moved into a former hospital complex,
renamed the Thoreau Center for Sustainability, located at San
Francisco's historic Presidio National Park, which anchors one
side of the Golden Gate Bridge (Tides leases the complex from
the National Park Service).  Tides's moving and renovation costs
for the Thoreau Center were approximately $5 million. Tides created
a special for-profit subsidiary that took advantage of tax breaks
provided for historical preservation.
<P>
Besides Tides, the Thoreau Center houses other nonprofit
organizations, several of which are Tides projects.  Center tenants
include the Energy Foundation, Institute for Global Communications,
Military Toxics Project, Social Venture Network, and the California
office of the Wilderness Society.  Tides employs about 300 staff
in its offices at the Presidio, in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere.
<BR>
<P>
<a name="catalysts">
<h4>OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL
'CATALYSTS'</h4><BR>
<P>
Pew and Tides are not alone in acting 
as catalysts to create new environmental
groups and campaigns.  For example, in 1982 the John D.
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation provided a $15 million grant
to launch the World Resources Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based
nonprofit research organization which consults for governments
and for nongovernmental organizations around the world, especially
in developing nations, and which focuses on such global issues
as population, climate and sustainable development.  WRI's first
president was the ubiquitous James Gustave &quot;Gus&quot; Speth,
a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, former head
of President Jimmy Carter's Council on Environmental Quality (where
he oversaw production of the Global 2000 report which predicted
imminent resource exhaustion), and currently head of the United
Nations Development Program (see &quot;Making Americans Pay: The
MacArthur Foundation's Plan For A Global IRS&quot; in Foundation
Watch, vol.I, no.8).  
<P>
Speth has been a prominent exponent of the concept
of &quot;sustainable development&quot; and he has focused his
attention on energy-related issues.  Following the Persian Gulf
conflict, for instance, Speth, then at WRI, called for a new national
energy strategy.  Writing in the Los Angeles Times, he demanded
contradictory policies that would &quot;guarantee an affordable
supply of energy&quot; while increasing taxes on fossil fuels
because &quot;at the root of our problem is America's addiction
to cheap energy.&quot;  WRI's annual revenues, almost $14 million
in 1994, have since come from such private grantmakers as the
Joyce, Charles Stewart Mott, Rockefeller and Surdna foundations
and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
<P>
<P>
<a name="ford">
<h4>FORD'S BETTER IDEA</h4><BR>
<P>
Just as MacArthur established WRI, the 
Ford Foundation is credited with founding
in 1952 Resources for the Future, the foremost nonprofit
environmental research organization in Washington, D.C.  Ford
also provided in 1970 the seed money for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the environmental litigation group known for
the Alar scare which alleged potential health threats from pesticide
residues on apples.  Ford has provided major funding for most
of the environmental organizations that use litigation to achieve
changes in public policy, including the Sierra Club Legal Defense
Fund, Environmental Defense Fund, and Southern California Center
for Law in the Public Interest. <BR>
<P>
<a name="heinz">
<h4>HEINZ'S 57 VARIETIES
OF ENVIRONMENTALISM</h4>
<P>
The Heinz Endowments have become 
another major player in 
environmental grantmaking.  They put up $20 million in 1995 to launch
the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment in
memory of the late Pennsylvania Republican Senator H. John Heinz
III. Theresa Heinz, the Senator's widow and a vice-chairman of
the Environmental Defense Fund, has made the environment a central
concern of the Heinz Endowments.  Upon announcing the Center's
establishment Theresa Heinz ,by now remarried to U.S. Senator
John Kerry (D-MA) (who did not give a penny to charity in 1995),
explained, &quot;This center will be a middle ground where the
major stakeholders in environmental policy can be jointly challenged
to think long-term and to forge a durable consensus for action
based on sound scientific and economic principles.&quot;  The
Center's president is William Merrell, a distinguished oceanographer,
and its board includes Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental

Beginning in 1994, the Endowments announced recipients
of the Heinz Awards.  In 1994, the winners of the Heinz Award
for the Environment were the doomsayers Paul and Anne Ehrlich,
who were cited for &quot;their thoughtful studies of difficult
environmental issues.&quot;  Paul Ehrlich is the author of the
1968 book The Population Bomb, which proclaimed that &quot;The
battle to feed all of humanity is over...In the 1970s the world
will undergo famines - hundreds of millions of  people are going
to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon
now.&quot;  The Ehrlichs recently co-authored a sequel, The Population
Explosion which predicted more of the same.  Paul Ehrlich is also
the founder of Zero Population Growth, an organization dedicated
to the global control of population.  According to Heinz, the
Ehrlichs' &quot;prescriptions, sometimes misrepresented as draconian,
are rooted in the same Judeo-Christian principles that are the
source of the Ehrlichs' profound ethic of stewardship.&quot; 
Of course, the Ehrlichs' predicted population &quot;die-backs&quot;
have never occurred. 
<P>
The 1995 Heinz Award went to Dr. Herbert Needleman,
guru of the &quot;get-the-lead-out&quot; movement.  Needleman,
a pediatrician and child psychologist, is the founder of the Alliance
to End Childhood Lead Poisoning and the author of several controversial
articles on lead's impact on children.  All scientists recognize
that exposure to lead can have a serious impact on child development.
 Needleman, however, has maintained that the impacts occur at
levels lower than is generally accepted by many experts.<BR>

<h4>ROCKEFELLER'S GREEN
FAMILY VALUES</h4>

<P>
The Rockefeller Family Fund (RFF) is
a veteran funder of environmental 
causes.  Founded in 1967, the Fund has over $44 million in assets
and is organized into five programs: Citizen Education and Participation,
Economic Justice for Women, Institutional Responsiveness, Self-Sufficiency,
and the largest program, Environment.  RFF is but one of several
Rockefeller family foundations supporting environmental causes.
 The Rockefeller Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, American
Conservation Association, and Jackson Hole Preserve together contributed
over $12 million to environmental causes in 1992 (John D. Rockefeller,
IV, a member of the Rockefeller family, has a vacation home in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming in which President Clinton has vacationed).
<P>
The Rockefeller Family Fund is the most prominent
of these in the area of environmental giving.  While RFF grants
are made to &quot;organizations which traditionally enjoy popular
support, such as universities, museums, hospitals, or endowed
institutes,&quot; the Fund also supports &quot;advocacy programs
that are action-oriented and likely to yield tangible public policy
results.&quot;  Moreover, it seeks to promote &quot;progressive&quot;
causes while countering the &quot;political right.&quot;  Most
of its environmental giving is of this sort. 
<P>
One particular interest of the Rockefeller Family
Fund is encouraging &quot;whistleblowing&quot; [i.e., snitching]
and environmental activism [i.e., politics] by civil servants.
 As RFF director Donald Ross explained in a 1994 letter to members
of the Environmental Grantmakers' Association, the group whose
work he helps coordinate:
<P>
Underlying many successful news releases, lawsuits,
and blockbuster reports and testimony is information provided
by insiders: public employees who rejected conformity, abandoned
the get-ahead, go-along philosophy of government service and blew
the whistle.  Whistleblowing is always important, but it becomes
even more so when public policies are in dispute.
<P>
Toward this end, the Fund in 1993 supported the
Government Accountability Project ($60,000) and Association of
Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics ($20,000), two
nonprofits that promote whistleblowing, particularly when it produces
litigation.  As Ross notes, &quot;The one-two punch of inside
whistleblowers and outside litigators remains potent.&quot; 
<P>
Among the environmental groups that received RFF
grants in 1994 were the following: 
<P>
Alaskan Conservation Foundation $40,000 
<P>
Center for Auto Safety  $25,000 
<P>
Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes     
$30,000 
<P>
Clean Water Action  $25,000 
<P>
Clean Water Fund  $25,000 
<P>
Environmental Information Center $30,000 
<P>
Environmental Support Center $30,000 
<P>
Friends of the Earth Foundation $25,000 
<P>
Mineral Policy Center  $25,000
<P>
Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet      $30,000
<P>
Ozone Action, Inc.  $30,000
<P>
Western Ancient Forests Campaign $30,000 
<P>
<P>
Other Rockefeller foundations also support organized
environmental activism.  In 1992, the American Conservation Association
gave $90,000 to the Natural Resources Defense Council, $90,000
to the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, and $75,000 to the Wilderness
Society. In 1992, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund supported the
Worldwatch Institute ($525,000), American Farmland Trust ($1,000,000),
and Environmental Law Institute ($120,000 [3-year]). In 1993,
the Jackson Hole Preserve funded the Greater Yellowstone Coalition
($20,000), National Wildlife Federation ($10,000), and National
Park Foundation ($125,000).<BR>

<h4>KEEPING UP WITH
W. ALTON JONES</h4>
<P>
<P>
The W. Alton Jones Foundation is 
devoted exclusively to two issues, &quot;to 
protect the Earth's life-support systems from environmental
harm and to eliminate the possibility of nuclear war.&quot;  Like
the Pew Charitable Trusts, the foundation is the product of oil
industry wealth.  In 1995 it made grants of nearly $20 million,
with over 60 percent going to environmental organizations and
causes.  Although based in Charlottesville, Virginia the Jones
Foundation is well-connected to Washington, D.C.'s environmental
establishment.  Debra Callahan, the newly appointed president
of the League of Conservation Voters, was formerly the foundation's
environmental grass-roots coordinator.  Foundation director John
Peterson Myers is a former senior vice president at the National
Audubon Society.  George Perkovich, a foundation program director,
was a prominent defender of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary who
was widely criticized for using outside consultants to evaluate
media coverage of her Department.
<P>
W. Alton Jones's &quot;Sustainable World Program&quot;
provides funding for environmental groups.  Foundation boilerplate
says it &quot;supports efforts that will ensure that human activities
do not undermine the quality of life of future generations and
do not erode the Earth's capacity to support living organisms.&quot;
 According to the Foundation, this is achieved through &quot;a
tight focus on issues whose resolution will determine how habitable
the planet remains over the next century and beyond.&quot;The
W. Alton Jones Foundation has become intimately tied to the campaign
against synthetic chemicals that, it is claimed, may damage human
and animal hormone systems.  This campaign, largely based on speculative
claims and anecdotal evidence, was boosted by publication in 1996
of the book Our Stolen Future.  Co-author John Peterson Myers
is a director of the foundation.  Another co-author, Theo Colburn
of the World Wildlife Fund, had been a foundation staff scientist.
 Our Stolen Future calls for a dramatic reduction in chemical
use and far stricter regulatory controls on industry.  The authors
urge consumers to buy only organic vegetables and to stop microwaving
food in plastic containers.  Many scientists reject as unproven
the book's central charge that hormone-disrupting chemicals are
a major public health risk, and the book's claims have been criticized
in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
<P>
In 1995 W. Alton Jones Foundation made environmental
grants to:
<P>
<P>
Alliance to Save Energy (2 years) $150,000
<P>
Conservation International Foundation (2 years) 
      $325,000 
<P>
Environmental Law Institute (2 years)      $200,000
<P>
Environmental Working Group (2 grants)      $245,000
<P>
Friends of the Earth (2 years) $200,000
<P>
Mothers &amp; Others for a Livable Planet      $75,000

<P>
Southern Environmental Law Center (2 years)     
$100,000
<P>
Taxpayers for Common Sense Foundation      $75,000
<P>
Union of Concerned Scientists (2 years)      $300,000
<P>
Wilderness Society  $100,000 
<P>
World Resources Institute (2 years) $200,000<BR>
<P>
Like many of the other environmental grantmakers
the Jones foundation has encouraged environmental advocacy groups
to cooperate with one another and coordinate their policy objectives.
 These efforts &quot;usually take the form of coordinated grants
to multiple institutions, each of which focuses on one or more
components of an overall campaign. . . .&quot; Once an initiative
is underway, the Foundation accepts grant proposals from organizations
that want to participate.  The Jones Foundation has also supported
non-environmental groups engaged in environmental work.  For instance,
in 1993 the Foundation made a $15,000 grant to the National Taxpayers
Union Foundation to oppose environmentally-destructive corporate
subsidies.  <BR>

<h4>GREEN GIVING BY 
THE 'MOUTH OF THE SOUTH'</h4><BR>
<P>
The Turner Foundation is perhaps the 
newest foundation to dedicate big 
money to environmental issues.  Media mogul Ted Turner hopes
his foundation, launched in 1990, will become the largest philanthropy
devoted to environmental and population issues.  In 1994 it gave
$5 million to environmental causes, a figure sure to climb.  Unfortunately,
the cable pioneer who once prided himself on his feisty independence
of mind (he tried to take over CBS with Senator Jesse Helms in
the 1980's) now seems to have fallen victim to conventional thinking
about the environment and population. Turner explains, &quot;We
are literally in a fight to save the humans.&quot;  He told the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;I see the whole field of environmentalism
and population as nothing more than the survival of the human
species.  I have wanted to have some bumper stickers made up saying,
`Save the  Humans.'  At the bottom of it all, we are trying to
save ourselves.&quot;  
<P>
The executive director of the Foundation is Peter
Bahouth, former head of Greenpeace USA, widely regarded as the
most radical of the major environmental organizations.  Greenpeace
is well known for its high-profile campaign to end whaling worldwide.
 It also has called for a complete phase-out of all chlorine chemicals,
including those used to manufacture pharmaceuticals and sanitize
water supplies.  Bahouth echoes the contemporary attitude that
the environment must be conserved not for man's use, but for nature's
own sake.  In his view, the environmental challenge &quot;is to
expand our collective sense of care and return responsibility
towards not just our extended human family, but to other living
species as well.&quot;  The stated goals of the Foundation are
&quot;preventing damage to the natural system&quot; and &quot;supporting
innovative institutions committed to protecting the  Earth's natural
systems and ensuring a sustainable and better world for all its
inhabitants.&quot;
<P>
Turner Foundation grants are targetted to the issues
of energy, protection of forests and other habitat, population,
and water and toxics.  &quot;Nearly 300 groups representing a
broad range of approaches received grants from the Turner Foundation
in 1995,&quot; says Bahouth.  &quot;Most are small groups of citizens
who are concerned about their communities and want to make them
better places to live.&quot;  The Foundation has made several
environment-related grants to leftist organizations like the Institute
for Policy Studies and Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR).
<P>
Favoring &quot;sound population policies,&quot;
the foundation has funded a campaign aimed at teen pregnancy in
Georgia, where it is headquartered.  According to Bahouth, &quot;The
vision of this work is, 'All teens are entitled to a healthy adolescence,
free of unwanted and unplanned pregnancies, and characterized
by hope and opportunity for a productive future.&quot;  In 1995
population grants recipients included Concerned Women for Family
Planning, Georgia Population Initiative, Population Action International,
Catholics for a Free Choice, The Center for Reproductive Law &amp;
Policy, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Families First,
and the  League of Women Voters Population Coalition.  The Turner
Foundation does not publish the amounts of its grants.  Other
1995 grant recipients were the following:
<P>
Alliance for the Wild Rockies, American Rivers,
American Wildlands, Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Center for
International Environmental Law, Earth Island Institute, Environmental
Media Services, Environmental Working Group, Friends of the Earth,
 Government Accountability Project, Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative
Museum &amp; Library, Land Trust Alliance, Mineral Policy Center,
Native Forest Council, Oregon Natural Resource Council, Ozone
Action, Pacific Rivers Council, Rainforest Action Network, Rocky
Mountain Institute, Safe Energy Communication Council, Southern
Environmental Law Center, Union of Concerned Citizens Wildlands
Project, Worldwatch Institute<BR>

<h4>SHE WHO PAYS THE PIPER 
CALLS THE TUNE</h4>
<P>
As grantmakers focus their giving on 
particular issues and policy strategies 
they have little by little begun to direct the environmental
advocacy agenda.  &quot;The foundations want to get something
for their money,&quot; charges Jeff St. Clair, editor of Wild
Forest Review.  &quot;They're out for control,&quot; he told the
Newhouse News Service, &quot;They want to control the policy and
political agenda of the environmental movement.&quot;  
<P>
During the 1980s, the Kendall Foundation  pressured
the largest environmental advocacy organizations into coordinating
their efforts through the so-called &quot;Group of 10&quot; meetings
of the major environmental groups.  Today the Environmental Grantmakers
Association operates from Rockefeller Family Fund offices.  &quot;As
often the sole source of funds for broad public outreach, grantmaking
becomes the focal point for inter-organizational cooperation,&quot;
the Pew Charitable Trusts' Joshua Reichert has explained. 
<P>
Pew is one of the most active foundations trying
to manage environmental advocacy (for more on Pew see &quot;Buying
Press Coverage: How Pew's Civic Journalism Project Put Newspapers,
Radio and Television Stations On the Payroll,&quot; Foundation
Watch vol.I, no.7).  For instance, in 1992 Pew and the W. Alton
Jones Foundation created Americans for the Ancient Forests, to
campaign against logging on public lands in the Pacific Northwest.
Pew also tried to organize a national campaign to pressure the
U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to change forest
land management practices.  In 1993 it set aside $12 million to
create Earth Force, an environmental activist organization for
kids _ a sort of environmental Boy Scouts.  Earth Force was created
without consulting groups like the National Wildlife Federation
that already had extensive programs for children.
<P>
In 1991, Pew joined with the Rockefeller Foundation
and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to provide
$20 million to create the Energy Foundation, which promotes local
and regional regulatory policies on energy conservation and use
of low-energy-use technologies.  By pooling their resources, the
three foundations have been able to ensure that funding in this
area is focused on a single policy agenda.  The three foundations
have committed to fund the Energy Foundation for at least a decade.
 In 1993 the Energy Foundation made grants to the Environmental
Defense Fund of Texas ($500,000), Center for Neighborhood Technology
($150,000), 1,000 Friends of Oregon ($237,000), and Environmental
Action Foundation ($14,000). Environmental groups complain that
foundations are &quot;the tail wagging the dog.&quot;  Some charge
that Pew interfered with their attempt to prevent reform of the
Endangered Species Act by cutting off funds meant for the Endangered
Species Coalition and funding the Environmental Information Center
instead.  The Coalition's head, former Congressman Jim Jontz,
claims Pew forced him and the Coalition out of the campaign to
&quot;protect&quot; the Endangered Species Act. 
<P>
Pew executive director Rebecca Rimel acknowledges
the fear that foundations have their own priorities.  She told
The Chronicle of Philanthropy, &quot;Because by nature we are
insulated institutions, it's very hard for us to get candid and
direct feedback from the field.  So it's very easy for us to maybe
choose the wrong issue or go down the wrong road strategically.&quot;
Yet even though environmental groups gripe about foundation direction,
grantmakers report that they are overwhelmed with proposals at
the slightest indication  that they may have funds available for
particular projects.  Grassroots activist Sam Hitt explained the
paradox to High Country News: &quot;When Pew steps in, it's like
a death star in the solar system.  They set up their own gravitational
field and everyone begins to revolve around them.  I've watched
activists go through this dance of making themselves look fundable
to Pew by altering their priorities to meet Pew's goals.  I've
had it with those guys.&quot;<BR>

Re: Vol. I, no.4 article on Opera.
[&quot;Why did a reclusive widow give the Washington Opera eighteen

<P>
Seems an odd place to find anti-NEA
sentiments. 
<P>
There is no question that the very
modest support USA has given to support of the Arts through NEA
has contributed to a growth in the arts especially dance and perhaps
Opera too etc. 
<P>
The pittance given has never been the
main support of any organization, in an era of high crime it seems
crazy to cut back on arts support.

One toilet didn't kill defense. Does
a bad grant kill the NEA?

EDITOR'S NOTE
<P>
<i>The
September-October issue of Foundation News and Commentary contains
an item about the Rockefeller Foundation's response to our request
for interviews which should interest readers of Foundation Watch.
[&quot;The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism,&quot;
vol. I, no. 4].</I>
<P>
<I> Denise Gray-Felder, director of
communications for the Rockefeller Foundation told the house organ
of the Council on Foundations that she had asked &quot;people&quot;
who had heard of our publication whether to provide interviews
with foundation president Peter C. Goldmark, Jr. and arts and
humanities program director Alberta Arthurs. They &quot;agreed
with the foundation's decision to refuse to be interviewed.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Gray-Felder, who told Foundation
News that she found our article &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;very
inaccurate,&quot; defended her decision not to present Rockefeller's
point of view: &quot;I have never done that in my 20-year public
relations career. It was a hard decision to make; it turned out
to be the right decision for us.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Gray-Felder and Foundation News
failed to note that we interviewed Dr. John Robert Evans, former
Chairman of the Board of the Rockefeller Foundation; Daniel P.
Garcia, a foundation trustee; and a number of other board members
who asked to remain anonymous. Not one of our interview subjects
has noted any inaccuracies in the story.</I>
<P>
<I> As for what Grey-Felder called bizarre,
we can only note that our account was based on published listings
in the Foundation's annual report.</I>
<P>
<I>The Rockefeller Foundation has given
grants to the late &quot;Tongues Untied&quot; filmmaker Marlon
Riggs; New York's Franklin Furnace, venue  for a pornographic
event by &quot;Scarlet O;&quot; Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis,
which hosted Ron Athey's HIV-positive slicing and dicing torture
performance; and Santa Monica's Highways, where Athey also performed
as well as &quot;NEA Four&quot; strippers Tim Miller and Karen
Finley, as well as another peformance artist describing &quot;sex
with Newt's mom.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>We agree with Gray-Felder that such
organizations are bizarre. Even more bizarre has been the decision
of the Rockefeller Foundation to fund them.</I>

<center><h2>Why did AFL-CIO chief George Meany help Warren Carroll 
found Christendom College in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley?</h2><BR>
</center>
<center><h3>by Ann Marie Temple</h3></center>
<blockquote>
<p>Warren Carroll may be the most successful 
man in Virginia for he is one of the lucky 
few who can say that he is doing what he 
believes in every day of his life. 
Carroll is the founding president of Christendom College, 
a small liberal arts college tucked away in 
Virginia's picturesque Shenandoah Valley. Ten years ago 
he resigned his office to teach history full time at 
the college. He is an author and editor of numerous 
histories and biographies, including two books on 
the origin and history of the Communist Revolution 
and a newsletter tracking international resistance to 
communist insurgency.  He is currently at work on a 
multi-volume history of Western Civilization.  Many 
professors today view the past as a complex web of events that require periodic reinterpretion to fit 
current politically correct doctrines. But unlike 
most modern historians, Carroll teaches that 
individuals, not economic or social forces, are the shapers of 
history.  During the 1960s Carroll saw the Western 
tradition systematically abandoned as his fellow 
historians revised the past.  He concluded the only 
hope for a renaissance lay in America's youth. In 
1977, Carroll decided to change how history was 
taught by making history himself. He founded 
Christendom College.
<p>
Carroll insists history majors at Christendom
take at least one class on the history of 
revolutionary movements, either the French <BR>
Revolution or the Communist 
Revolution, and encourages his students to read 
<I>Witness</I>, the autobiography of Whitaker Chambers. It was after 
reading this book as a graduate student in 1954 that 
Carroll became a dedicated anti-communist. Carroll 
graduated from Bates College and received his doctorate 
in history from Columbia University. He is a 
prolific writer: in addition to two books on the Russian 
revolution, <I>1917</I> (Christendom Press, 1981) and 
<I>70 Years of the Communist Revolution</I> (republished as 
<I>The Rise and Fall of the Communist 
Revolution</I>, Christendom Press, 1995), Carroll established the 
<I>Freedom Fighter</I> newsletter to track &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; 
activity throughout the world.  From 1985-1990, this 
publication covered the Afghan resistance, the 
Nicaraguan freedom fighters, and African anti-communist 
movements.  Carroll believes the revolutionary 
impulse remains alive and will continue to cause conflict. 
He thinks the best response is a strong defense of 
the Western tradition. He recently completed <I>The 
Last Crusade</I> (Christendom Press, 1996), a book 
about 1936, the first year of the Spanish Civil War.  

<BR>
Carroll has always been politically and socially
conservative. However, he arrived at a new perspective
after 1968.  He came to understand that modern 
societies were the battleground for the conflict between those who 
recognize objective realityand those committed to skepticism and 
moral relativism.  In 1967 Carroll was working in California politics 
and was not religious.  &quot;Technically, I was a Deist,&quot; he says. Then 
he married Anne Westhoff, a devout Catholic whom he met in 1962.  
 In 1968, the United States was facing what Carroll considers 
its greatest internal turmoil since the Civil War.  He calls the era 
a &quot;wild saturnalia&quot; and &quot;the height of the revolutionary 
movement, the rejection of all values and principles.&quot;  That year he 
converted to Catholicism and it became the key event in his life. The 
Carrolls moved to Washington in 1970.  His wife Anne began working 
for <I>Triumph</I>, a conservative Catholic magazine founded by 
Brent Bozell, William F. Buckley, Jr.'s brother-in-law. In 1973 
Carroll left politics and joined Anne at the magazine. 
<P>
<P><I>Triumph</I> hosted an annual six week summer institute at the 
Escorial, Philip II's palace outside Madrid.  The summer 
program was designed to introduce American students to the 
traditional liberal arts (history, literature, philosophy, political 
science, theology) in the physical context of a conservative and 
religious civilization.  Carroll taught American students in the Spanish 
program.  There, the &quot;person around whom all else revolved&quot; was 
Dr. Frederick Wilhelmsen, professor of philosophy and political 
science at the University of Dallas. In 1956, while teaching at 
UCLA, Wilhelmsen had organized 2,000 students to go to the aid of 
the Hungarian freedom fighters.  (They were stopped at the Los 
Angeles airport by authorities.)  Wilhelmsen was a strong influence 
on Carroll as he developed the curriculum of  the  new college.  
Teachers and students in the <I>Triumph</I> program in Spain eventually made 
up the nucleus of Christendom College.  
<P>
<P>With <I>Triumph</I>'s demise in 1975, Carroll decided to found 
a college that would emulate medieval universities 
by reinforcing the traditions of Western Civilization. 
Students at Christendom major in one of the traditional 
liberal arts:  English, Philosophy, Theology, Political Science, 
History, French, or Classical Languages.  All students must complete a 
core curriculum, including Christian doctrine, moral theology, and 
several semesters of philosophy.   By the 60's and 70's many 
American Catholic colleges had weakened their religious identity.  
Carroll saw a need for a college that would be uncompromisingly 
Catholic. And so as <I>Triumph</I> published its last issue in the summer 
of 1975, Carroll began making plans.  Thomas Aquinas College 
in Santa Paula, California, had been founded a few years earlier  
but Carroll thought more was needed: &quot;Bad as things had become, 
I was sure that a country as big as this could support at least 
two, especially on opposite sides of the country.&quot;  Money seemed to 
be the greatest obstacle. <I> </I>In order to maintain its 
independence, Christendom College does not receive money from the 
Church, although the Arlington, Virginia diocese is supportive and 
provides a chaplain.  Carroll likewise refused federal funding, 
even student loans. The college has grown with the support of  
loyal donors and benefactors among the Catholic laity.  As time 
has passed, money has not proved to be the main problem, 
and Christendom recently raised funds to build a new common 
room and chapel.   &quot;We always had more people who wanted to teach 
at Christendom College than we had places,&quot; says Carroll. Dr. 
Jeffrey Mirus, who wrote for <I>Triumph</I> and later taught history 
and literature as one of Christendom's founding faculty, says he 
was always struck by Carroll's ability &quot;to keep his eye on the goal.&quot; 
 Carroll was amazed to discover that his real challenge was 
finding students who saw the value of a classical education.  He had 
decided he would not start the college unless he had 25 initial 
applicants; he found 26.  But even finding pupils became easier, 
especially after the college received accreditation in 1986. Last year the 
 the college enrolled some 200 students.
<P>Admissions are selective, and the college is on the John 
Templeton honor role and has the highest rank from 
the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching.  Students come from all over the U.S, and 
from Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Hungary, and  Ireland.  All 
of the professors are practicing Catholics and make a 
yearly declaration of loyalty to the teachings of the Church.  
The school has a midnight curfew and a strict dress code 
(shirts and ties for men, knee-length skirts or business pants 
for women), along with sanctions against alcohol in 
student rooms and intervisitation between men's and women's 
dormitories.  These rules are enforced by older students 
appointed as  Resident Assistants under the direction of a 
Dean of Students.  Many applicants are frightened away 
by Christendom's strict rules, high standards and small 
size, but students consider  these to be advantages. The key 
social event of the year is the St. Patrick's Day party, 
with traditional Irish music and dancing performed by 
teachers, students, alumni, and even children of alumni.  Senior 
Cary McCoy says, &quot;It's like a big family event.  All the 
alumni come and everyone is eating and singing together.  
Dr. Carroll gets up and sings and everybody cheers.&quot;  
Graduate Lorraine Overbeck comments, &quot;Christendom is the 
only place where I can leave my purse in the cafeteria, 
come back a day later and find it where I left it with 
everything still in it.&quot;  
<P>
<P>Christendom's first classes were held in temporary class
rooms in Triangle, Virginia leased to Carroll by the
local Catholic parish.  Carroll had no idea where 
to move his college but had faith that God would send a 
solution.  His prayers were answered.  
<I>Triumph</I> had held a final weekend seminar in a lodge on the Shenandoah River 
owned by the AFL-CIO  and used for training Latin American 
labor organizers.  The manager was a friend of the magazine. 
 In 1979, the AFL-CIO decided to sell the property, but 
the asking price was too high for Carroll. Miraculously, the 
retired Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle was able to help.  
O'Boyle was a friend of George Meany, longtime AFL-CIO 
president.  The Cardinal persuaded Meany to lower the price 
by more than one third. After contacting a long list of 
prominent Catholics and friends of <I>Triumph</I>,  enough money 
was raised for the down payment.  Christendom College 
permanently relocated  in Front Royal, Virginia, 60 miles west 
of Washington. 
<P>
<P>Carroll considers his determination to be the legacy of
his earliest ancestor in America,  Englishman James 
Warren, who was captured at the battle of Dunbar 
fighting for King Charles II against Oliver Cromwell.  
Warren was shipped off to America as an indentured servant 
and obtained land in Maine. Carroll's ancestral home is on 
the site of the original &quot;Warren Garrison.&quot;   Carroll's 
great-grandfather, Robert Carroll was killed in the Civil War 
fighting for the Union at the Battle of Cedar Creek in 1864, 
a few miles from Christendom College. Like his battling 
Yankee ancestors, Christendom's founder has committed 
his lifetime to fighting -- this time on the side of  Catholic 
tradition. Today he lives and writes in Manassas, teaching 
a full load of history courses in Front Royal.  All his 
classes rest on the premise that history is the story of people.  
&quot;All this talk about trends and forces and so on . . . doesn't 
make any sense; these things are not real, they're 
imaginative themes.  People are the great reality in history and they 
are the ones who make it.&quot;  Carroll himself has 
demonstrated by his own actions that he is one of those people.
<P>

College, 134 Christendom Drive, Front Royal, VA 22530.

<br>
<font  size=+2><b>E</b></font>very year, on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, parish 
priests are told to collect money for the Campaign for Human 
Development (CHD).  The Campaign is the anti-poverty program of the U.S. Catholic 
Conference, and it collects $13 million annually from parishes across the 
country. Since its founding in 1970, CHD has raised more than $250 million.  
Grant recipients must meet several criteria:  Funded projects must benefit 
poverty groups by addressing &quot;basic causes of poverty&quot; and must &quot;effect 
institutional change&quot;; projects must &quot;contribute to 
a more integrated and mutually understanding society&quot;; &quot;members of the 
poverty group must have a dominant voice in the project&quot;; and finally, &quot;CHD 
funded projects must conform to the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.&quot; 
(CHD 1994-95 Annual Report)      
<p>Despite these reassuring criteria, it might surprise the average Catholic 
to see what sort of organizations his CHD donations are funding.  While 
specifically funded projects may be innocuous enough, some recipient groups are 
fighting against the &quot;moral teachings of the Catholic Church.&quot;  Organizations 
receiving thousands of dollars from the Campaign for Human Development 
officially cooperate with groups like the National Organization for Women, Planned 
Parenthood, and the Feminist Majority Foundation, among others.  These 
groups advocate abortion, gay and lesbian activism, and other causes condemned by 
the Catholic Church.  Other CHD-funded groups focus on politically liberal 
issues such as gun control, cuts in defense spending, increases in welfare 
programs, and socialized medicine.  While there is no Catholic position on these issues, it 
is doubtful that every parishioner donating money to the Campaign for Human 
Development intends his contribution to support these causes.

<B>JEDI Women</B>
<br>
One of the most troubling things about CHD has been its persistent habit 
of funding organizations closely associated with and in some cases directly 
supportive of  the pro-abortion movement.  Despite the repeated revelation 
of these incidents, by the Capital Research Center and others, the practice 
continues.
<P>Justice, Economic Dignity and Independence for Women of Salt Lake 
City (JEDI Women) received a CHD grant of $20,000 in 1995.  In April 1996, 
JEDI Women officially endorsed the National Organization for Women's &quot;Fight 
the Right&quot; March in San Francisco, marching alongside such groups as: 
Catholics for a Free Choice; D.C. Coalition of Black Lesbians, Gay Men and Bisexuals, Inc.; Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund; National Abortion &amp; Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL); 
Feminist Majority Foundation; Planned Parenthood Federation of America; and 
Zero Population Growth.  According to NOW, the purpose of the march was to 
show that &quot;the majority of people denounce 
the divisive hate-mongering of the right-wing; and will  with our time, money 
and votes  actively support affirmative action; economic justice; abortion 
rights and reproductive freedom; civil rights for people of color; lesbian, gay and 
bisexual rights and efforts to end violence 
against women.&quot;

		pro-abortion movement.
</pre>
<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<p>
Speakers at the march included Gloria Steinem, Feminist Majority 
Foundation President Eleanor Smeal, and Phil Wilson, founder of the National Black 
Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum.  Prominent signs and banners read: &quot;Fight 
the Radical Right&quot;; &quot;Spread Love:  Hug a Queer&quot;; and &quot;Get Your Rosaries Out 
of My Ovaries.&quot;
<p><i>Organization Trends</i> asked Timothy Collins, CHD's acting director, 
about CHD's support for groups participating in this march.  Collins responded 
that &quot;CHD cannot control every project we fund.&quot;  
<p>The Fight the Right March was not JEDI Women's only association 
with pro-abortion and gay rights activism.  JEDI Women is one of 17 members 
of UPNET, the Utah Progressive Network of Salt Lake City, founded in 1993.  
Other members of UPNET include: Planned Parenthood Association of Utah; 
Pro-Choice Coalition of Utah; Parents, Families, Friends of Lesbians &amp; Gays; 
Utahns for Choice/Student Coalition; and Utah NOW.  A brochure published by 
UPNET explains the purpose of the coalition:  &quot;UPNET organizations are 
committed to actualizing a vision of Utah as a 
place where all people, whatever their gender, race, national origin, veteran's 
status, affectional orientation, age, physical 
or mental ability, or religious beliefs, have the freedom to live their lives fully, 
without fear of violence, discrimination, or economic deprivation.&quot;
<p>The UPNET Education Fund holds its meetings each month at the 
Planned Parenthood Association of Utah Community Meeting Room.  
<p>JEDI Women was profiled in the Spring 1996 issue of the 
<i>Utah Progressive News</i>, the newsletter of UPNET. 
 In the same issue, an article entitled &quot;Utah Legislature Passes 
Anti-Choice Bills&quot; complains of legislation 
requiring women to receive counseling 24 hours prior to an abortion and to watch a 
video on fetal development.  The article expresses relief that a bill to ban partial 
birth abortion &quot;was watered down to the point of being ineffectual.&quot;  The issue 
also featured a report on efforts by UPNET to &quot;support the efforts of students in 
local high schools to form support clubs in which students can be open about 
their sexual identity.&quot;  The article notes 
that UPNET has &quot;played a major role in opening dialogue in Utah about gay 
youth specifically, and homosexuality, generally.&quot;
<p>The 1996 UPNET Member Organization Calendar includes: &quot;April 1: 
Utah State Liberal Appreciation Day&quot;; 
&quot;April 5: Planned Parenthood benefit&quot;; 
&quot;May 18: Pro-Choice Coalition Workshop&quot;; &quot;June 9:  Utah GAY PRIDE DAY: 
 Come Out!  Come Out!  Wherever You Are!&quot;; and &quot;June 29:  NOW 
National Conference in Las Vegas.&quot;

<b>Working 9 to 5</b>
<br>
JEDI Women is not the only CHD grant recipient to support causes that 
do not &quot;conform to the moral teachings of the Catholic Church.&quot;  (Indeed, what 
is striking is the ease with which one finds such groups.)  9 to 5/Working 
Women, <br>
was profiled in the Campaign for Human Development 1994-95 Annual Report. 
 Ellen Bravo, national director of 9 to 5, is quoted as saying:  &quot;CHD was the 
one place you could go to get money for organizing.  That was what we 
believed we needed to be doingorganizing, reaching out to the largest sector of 
the workforce which was clearly being discriminated against and had no 
public voice . . . CHD was really there for us, and we couldn't have made it 
without them.&quot;
<p>Milwaukee 9 to 5, Inc., recently received $35,000 from CHD for its 
Wage Replacement for Family Leave Project. Sounds nice, but what else does 9 to 
5 do?  In February, Ellen Bravo, representing 9 to 5, spoke at Expo `96 
for Women's Empowerment in Washington, D.C.  The Feminist Majority 
Foundation was the primary sponsor of the Expo, and other sponsors include the 
pro-abortion political group EMILY's List, NARAL, National Abortion 
Federation, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, National Association for Women, 
National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, Planned 
Parenthood Federation of America, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
(PETA), Women's Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), and Zero 
Population Growth.  Prominent speakers at the Expo were Eleanor Smeal of 
the Feminist Majority Foundation, Bella Abzug of WEDO, Gloria Steinem, 
founder of <i>Ms. Magazine</i>, and Patricia Ireland of NOW.  Singer Helen Reddy 
performed, &quot;I am woman, hear me roar.&quot;  The Expo was not an isolated incident 
for 9 to 5/Working Women; in April, the group joined Jedi Women in 
endorsing NOW's Fight the Right March.

<b>FLOC:  The Road to Beijing</b>
<br>
The Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) was also profiled in 
CHD's Annual Report, and FLOC President Beldamar Velasquez received the 
CHD Development of People Award in 1992.  According to 
<i>Dignidad</i>, the organization's newsletter, FLOC 
works with WEDO and Greenpeace on the steering committee for the National 
Coalition for Health and Environmental Justice, set up after a 1995 
environmental summit in Albuquerque. WEDO is known as a radical supporter of abortion 
and population control programs. WEDO invited Beatriz Maya, the FLOC 
representative at the summit, to attend the Non-Governmental Organizations Forum 
on Women, which was held in conjunction  with the U.N.'s Women's 
Conference in Beijing, China.  

<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<pre>
		An influential group of experts in Roman Catholic church law has 
		concluded that ordaining women as deacons in the church
		would be in keeping with Catholic theology and past 
		practice.  &quot;Some &quot;inroad.&quot;
</pre>
<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<p>
Maya described the forum in an article entitled 
&quot;ACTIVISM! Breaks Out in Beijing,&quot; 
explaining the negotiations over the conference's Platform for Action.  She included 
the Church in her complaints over &quot;strong conservative opposition&quot; to women 
and their work at the conference.   Maya points out that Argentinean 
women, working for &quot;the right to a safe 
abortion,&quot; are unhappy  that &quot;the Catholic 
Church had forced the government to include [Church] representatives in the 
official delegation and were backing off all promises.&quot;  She went on to assure her 
readers that in spite of these &quot;challenges,&quot; 
the Platform for Action &quot;made significant advances on . . . sexual and 
reproductive rights.&quot;<br>
<p><i>Flocista</i>, another newsletter put out by FLOC, recently hired a new 
Assistant Editor and Development Team member, Alexander Goodrum. The newsletter 
announced that Goodrum &quot;comes to FLOC from many years working for 
grassroots movements fighting for African-American justice and equality, 
international peace and justice, and equality for 
gay, transsexual and lesbian Americans.&quot;  
<p>Like FLOC, the Center for Community Advocacy (CCA) of Salinas, 
CA, was founded to work with farmworkers, and it recently received $35,000 
from CHD.  According to CCA, the group is &quot;Dedicated to improving 
farmworker housing conditions and helping farmworkers help themselves.&quot;  
CCA provides a number of access services to other organizations and boasts about 
its &quot;strong network of contacts.&quot;  
Planned Parenthood is one of the groups CCA &quot;collaborated and provided . . . 
access services to.&quot;  The author<b><i> 
</b></i>obtained this information in a ten minute 
conversation with the CCA director, and found the same information in a CCA abstract. 
 Certainly CHD grantmakers should have access to the same information.
<p>
<a name="poverty">
<b>Escaping Poverty</b>
<br>People Escaping Poverty Project (PEPP) of Fargo, ND, has 
received $60,000 from CHD in the last two years.  PEPP is a liberal organization that 
cooperates with a variety of leftist activists.  Curious readers might visit the 
PEPP web site, http://www.und.nodak.edu/org/PEPP/mission8.htm. They will find 
links to &quot;PEPP Activist pages.&quot;  One of 
the activists is &quot;Leftist Leon,&quot; whose 
home page displays four photos of Rush Limbaugh, with swastikas on his 
forehead, in various states of decay and distortion. Click on &quot;Join PEPP and 
Fight for Justice&quot; and find a detailed 
account of PEPP &quot;associates&quot; illegally 
plastering &quot;Tax the Rich&quot; signs throughout 
downtown Washington, D.C., complete with photographs.  Captions to the photos 
are revealing:  &quot;The first `hit' of the 
evening in a traditional location. . . . We were ostensibly on our way down 16th 
Street to Lafayette Park. . . ; a large contingent of aimlessly loitering and wandering 
police forced us to make other plans.&quot; Another photograph bears the 
following description:  &quot;One of the city's 
many newspaper vending boxes . . . takes a direct hit downtown.  This particular 
box dispenses every Washingtonian's favorite rightist Moonie rag, the 
<i>Washington Times</i>.&quot;
<p>According to the activists, this &quot;Tax the Rich&quot; vandalism occurred on 
the fifth anniversary of their &quot;first wheatpasting, . . . to coincide with 
actions in protest against the Persian Gulf War that were going on in DC 
during January and February 1991.&quot;
<p>Under the heading &quot;Progressive Links that inspire us,&quot;  the PEPP 
homepage gives a direct link to &quot;The 
Progressive Directory.&quot;  PEPP also provides an 
&quot;Activist Resource Page.&quot;   This invites readers to view a &quot;Calendar of 
Ann Arbor-area Progressive/Left events and meetings&quot; and &quot;Jay's Leftist and 
`Progressive' Internet Resources Directory.&quot;  The index of PEPP's &quot;Activist 
Resource Page&quot; includes &quot;Anti-War Activism&quot;; 
 &quot;Left Parties (U.S)&quot;; &quot;Lesbian / 
Gay Resources&quot;; and &quot;Marxist Writings / Socialist Revolution.&quot;  Back at the 
PEPP homepage, the heading &quot;Politics&quot; 
leads to another &quot;progressive link&quot; that 
inspires PEPP.  Clicking here, the reader will find 45 links to what they call 
&quot;inspiring&quot; organizations such as the 
Feminist Majority Foundation, conservatively incorrect, 
<i>Mother Jones</i> Magazine, The Progressive Populist, Left Links, 
and The Anarchy Organization. 
<p>PEPP is closely associated with several other groups in the 
Fargo-Moorhead area, most notably the Women's Network of the Red River Valley.  
The Women's Network leases an office from PEPP, and has been cooperating 
with PEPP since the mid-1980's.  The author<b><i> 
</b></i>spoke with Duke Schempp, Director of PEPP, who assured us that the 
groups share &quot;issues and information.&quot;  In 
a follow-up letter, Schempp included brochures and a newsletter of the 
Women's Network and wrote &quot;We are all 
working together to address a variety of issues in our community.&quot;

<p>
The Network's mission statement begins, &quot;The Women's Network is a feminist, pro-choice 
organization.&quot;  The group's newsletter, <i>Whystling 
Womyn</i>, advertises &quot;feminars,&quot; and readers are invited 
to shop at the Women's Network:  &quot;A variety of items are for sale 
including `Choice' and `Uppity Women Unite' t-shirts.&quot; Another section, entitled 
&quot;Inroads,&quot; states that &quot;

<a name="oppo">
<b>Opposition to Defense Spending</b>
<br>Issues of feminism, abortion rights and gay and lesbian rights pose 
the clearest instances in which CHD-funded organizations are at odds with the 
moral teachings of the Catholic Church.  But many CHD recipients are also 
involved in politically liberal causes.  And 
Catholic donors might not support CHD if they were more familiar with these 
organizations.  Baltimore Jobs with Peace has received $55,000 from CHD in the 
last two years.  Jobs with Peace exists primarily to fight federal defense 
spending and, according to Jobs with Peace, 
&quot;continually strives to make connections between poverty and military spending.&quot; 
 Jobs with Peace led other Baltimore organizations in forming the 
Baltimore Peace Network, &quot;a long term network for action.&quot;  According to Jobs 
with Peace, &quot;In its short history, the 
Network has already tackled issues such as hand-gun control and the use of nuclear 
power to fuel space exploration vehicles.&quot;  
<p>The Baltimore Jobs with Peace newsletter describes the activities and 
accomplishments of Jobs with Peace and the Baltimore Peace Network.  It 
features articles calling for the abolition of all nuclear weapons and contrasts 
&quot;Cuts passed in the House&quot; (&quot;500 million 
cut from the Clean Water Act&quot;) with &quot;Pentagon Pork&quot; (which includes money 
for B-2 stealth bombers, military helicopters and improvements to the National 
Guard and Reserves).  A half-page of the newsletter proclaims:  &quot;Boycott French 
Products . . . Join the worldwide protests against French products until France 
reverses its decision to resume nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific.&quot;  
<p>In an article entitled &quot;Little Guns Demand Activists' Attention, Too!,&quot; a 
Jobs with Peace board member describes the &quot;cynical pitch&quot; of the &quot;gun lobby&quot;  
which &quot;piously pleads that gun control endangers the civil rights of Americans.&quot;  
According to the newsletter, this &quot;cynical pitch . . . benefits only the arms 
manufacturers, the political right wing, and the corporate culture which spawns 
them both.&quot;  The article continues:  &quot;The 
more `respectable' pushers invoke the `constitutional right to bear arms' another inaccuracy.  But a growing army of 
right wing extremists get right down to cases.  They speak openly of a need to 
protect their homes against `government invasion,' which will destroy America's 
patriotic ideals!&quot;

<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<pre>
		Were parishioners who gave money to CHD told their 
		contributions would be going to support socialized medicine and 
		to fight the Contract with America?
</pre>
<hr width=50% align=center size=3>
<p>
The article continues:  &quot;Of course, this not-so-subtle racist code implies that 
the growing ranks of the unemployed and the homeless, especially the 
minorities, will one day invade the homes of the `haves,' and must be stopped by a 
fully armed and prepared citizenry.  Blowing up an occasional Federal building 
evidently helps test that `preparedness.' But whatever the disingenuous patter 
for free access to handguns and automatic weapons, the results are indisputable: 
 blood on the streets in the economic ghettos of America  a kind of 
genocide on the poor  an extension of the `Contract on America' in its most 
murderous form. . . . Military and domestic 
violence have an insidious link in the fantasy of 
the gun as arbiter.&quot;
<p>The article concludes by referring to the &quot;gun lobby&quot; as &quot;the enemy&quot; and 
as the &quot;merchants of death, whose sales pitch is world power through fire power!&quot; 
 Aside from its fallacious and fevered rhetoric, the Jobs with Peace 
article raises the question of why the U.S. Catholic Conference is funding 
overtly political, left-wing organizations 
involved in volatile issues that have no 
connection to the causes or interests of the 
Catholic Church.

<a name="acorn">
<b>ACORN:  Still Going Strong</b>
<br>A longtime recipient of CHD grants, the Association of Community 
Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), claims to work for the poor by 
organizing unemployed workers and fighting for laws &quot;that require employers to hire the unemployed.&quot; In the last two years, 
CHD has given $784,000 to ACORN.  ACORN endorsed the Fight the Right March 
and sponsored the Feminist Majority Expo.  Maude Hurd, President of ACORN, 
and Marilyn Ashley, Director of Training, both spoke at the Expo.  ACORN's 
 involvement with pro-abortion, feminist groups is only the latest episode in 
a history of left-wing activism.  <i>Organization 
Trends</i> has reported on ACORN's antics in the past: coercing 
businesses into compliance by threatening legal action, pressuring financial regulators, 
picketing small businesses, and harassing public figures.  Banks are prime targets. 
 ACORN pressures them to increase set-aside loans for favored groups 
by threatening to use the federal Community Reinvestment Act against 
financial organizations that refuse to comply with its demands.  ACORN activist 
Cynthia Mason summed up the group's policy when she said:  &quot;The lesson is that . . 
. when you do an action like that, you know you have the powerand 
that's what its all about.&quot;
<p>ACORN has been fighting for a minimum wage increase, but ACORN's 
leaders have apparently ceased to believe their rhetoric.  ACORN received 
press attention earlier this year for filing 
for exemption from paying minimum wage to its own employees in California.  
As cited in an article by Richard B. Berman of the Employment Policies 
Institute, ACORN supports the minimum wage because it improves the standard of 
living of workers and &quot;employment levels increase.&quot;  However, ACORN 
doesn't want to pay minimum wage to its own workers because, according 
to ACORN's legal brief, &quot;. . . the more that ACORN must pay each individual 
outreach workereither because of minimum wage or overtime 
requirementsthe fewer outreach workers it will be able to hire.&quot;    In other words, 
ACORN continues to fight for a minimum wage increase knowing it will cause more 
unemployment.  ACORN's legal brief explains that &quot;California's minimum 
wage laws as applied to Plaintiff [ACORN] affect the quality and quantity of 
staff which Plaintiff can retain.&quot;  Is the 
Campaign for Human Development comfortable with this kind of hypocrisy?

<b>Senior Citizens Threaten War</b>
<br>Massachusetts Senior Action Council (MSAC) is another politically liberal 
organization receiving CHD funds.  MSAC's own publication exposes 
the group as radically liberal, bordering on socialist.  The back page of the 
MSAC Spring 1996 newsletter is taken up by an ad for &quot;A Forum on Consumer / 
Provider Advocacy Featuring Ralph Nader.&quot;

<p>  
The Winter 1995-96 edition of the newsletter describes the MSAC Convention, 
where &quot;conventiongoers . . . resolved to advocate for a single-payer national 
health care system.&quot;  Kip Tiernan, a speaker at the convention, announced, &quot;We're 
madder than hell and we're just not going to take it any more.&quot;  The &quot;theme&quot; of 
the convention was &quot;`Defending Our Lives:  Fight the Cuts!  Rip up the 
Contract!'&quot; and posters read, &quot;`Newt!  WE 
DID NOT SIGN YOUR CONTRACT!'&quot;  MSAC President Madeline Therrien 
said, &quot;If the right wing wants war, it is war they will get.&quot;  In another article, 
MSAC Vice-President Oscar Farmer describes the proposed Republican budget as 
&quot;fascism.&quot;  
<p>MSAC is not shy about its politics.  Several Democratic state 
representatives have placed ads in the MSAC newsletter, in which many of the 
articles condemn the Republican party or Republican members of Congress.  In 
one article Kip Tiernan complains that &quot;The medical cuts being offered by the 
Republicans . . . will cost local hospitals 71,000 jobs. . . . But it will be great 
news to the privatizers [of health care].&quot;  
Proposed health care reforms are called &quot;a perverse, greedy method of 
re-distribution.&quot;  The article reveals that MSAC wants a Canadian-style health care 
system, and it lauds Hillary Clinton's early plans for universal health care.  
Defenders of CHD deny that this kind of activism is political.  Yet would they argue 
that MSAC is not political?  Were parishioners who gave money to CHD told 
their contributions would be going to support socialized medicine and to fight the 
Contract with America?
<p>A close look at CHD recipient groups paints a disturbing picture.  Catholic 
parishioners are donating millions of dollars to fringe groups that place political 
organizing above charity.  These groups are motivated not so much by a desire 
to good as they are by an unwavering faith in the welfare state.  Disconnected 
from reality, they remain wedded to the redistributionist policies of the 1960s. 
 Even worse, in far too many cases they involve themselves in causes hostile 
to Catholicism.
<p>The Campaign for Human Development is seriously negligent in 
examining the goals, leadership and activities of 
the groups receiving CHD funds.  Moreover, it is clear that CHD staff 
and directors are oblivious to economics and recent history.  Like the groups 
they bankroll, they are dedicated to a discredited collectivist vision.  For them, the 
era of big government will never end.
<p>CHD betrays a trust in accepting money from loyal but unsuspecting 
parishioners to use for projects that most Catholics would not otherwise support. 
 There is now talk that the bishops are considering reforming the Campaign.
<p>The Catholic Conference has been engaged in a protracted search for a 
new CHD executive director.  It is imperative that Catholics make known their 
displeasure with this failed program.  On Sunday, November 21, parishioners 
should drop a note to their bishop in the collection basket, and save their 
hard-earned dollars for a more worthy cause.

The Republican Platform adopted at the party's August convention in San Diego includes a plank supporting passage of legislation to prohibit federal grantees from engaging in advocacy activities.  Last year, Congress was unable to pass such a measure -- sponsored by Republican Reps. David McIntosh (IN), Ernest Istook (OK), and Robert Ehrlich (MD).  The new Congress that takes office in January can be expected to address the issue again.
<hr width=33% align=left size=3 noshade>
Rep. John Doolittle has introduced a resolution that amends the rules of the House to require witnesses at committee hearings to submit statements identifying federal grants or contracts received during the past two fiscal years.

More tales from the timid:  Efforts to abolish the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), long a source of funds for the radical left, suffered a serious setback on July 23 when 56 Republicans joined Democrats to defeat an attempt to cut the LSC budget by nearly 50 percent.  Instead of reducing funding, the House voted to increase spending from $141 million to $250 million.  Among the big government Republicans voting for the increase were:  Charles Canady (FL), Jon Fox (PA), Steve Gunderson (WI), Martin Hoke (OH), Bill McCollum (FL), John Porter (IL), and Curt Weldon (PA).

Roger Charles, the reporter who broke the story on Admiral Jeremy Boorda's right to wear combat decorations, has been fired from his job with the <b>NATIONAL SECURITY NEWS SERVICE</b>, the left-wing agency that feeds anti-military stories to media organs like the <I>Washington Post</I> and <b>ABC News</b>.

According to a recently released General Accounting Office report, Agriculture Undersecretary Ellen Haas, formerly head of <b>PUBLIC VOICE FOR FOOD AND HEALTH POLICY</b>, frequently exceeded per diem rates on government travel expenses.  The report cites six instances were Haas stayed at five-star hotels, running up expenses well beyond what the government allows.  In addition, the report alleges that Haas hired a former Public Voice associate at an inflated salary.  The GAO report says Segal-Goodis, who was hired to run the Team Nutrition program, exaggerated her earnings and misrepresented on her application that she received a college degree from a Florida community college.

<b>PRO VITA ADVISORS</b> has examined reports published by the <b>INTERFAITH CENTER ON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY</b>, a coalition of 275 religious communities, agencies, pension funds, health care systems, and dioceses, to see what issues excite ICCR's members, over 80 percent of whom are Roman Catholic related groups.  Out of 185 shareholder resolutions, 41 dealt with tobacco.  Other issues included nuclear energy, the environment, international lending, and &quot;global corporate accountability.&quot;  &quot;The issues were varied and the resolutions imaginative,&quot; says <I>The Advisor</I>.

<P>
<dd>&quot;Don't go anywhere alone.  Always take somebody 
with you when you're walking in the neighborhood.  We'll 
have bathrooms in the Boys and Girls club.  You can use them 
at lunchtime.  Don't go into anybody's apartment.&quot;  Mary 
Lyman Jackson, a small woman with a marked southern 
accent, wearing jeans and a t-shirt is addressing her troops. It's 
a muggy summer morning in Washington D.C. and a 
hundred volunteers have turned out for  one of Exodus Youth 
Services' urban clean-up days. Mary thanks everyone for coming, 
and assures them that, despite the ominous sound of the 
liability release forms, nothing bad is going to happen.  &quot;These 
people are my friends,&quot;  she shouts, &quot;they're my family.  They love 
us, and they'll welcome us.  They're really looking forward to 
our coming.  This is a high spot in the year for them.&quot;
<dd>She introduces a priest, who reads the gospel from 
yesterday's Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, then raises his hands in 
blessing over the assembled group, sprinkling them with holy water 
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  She 
urges people to car pool because parking is scarce where they 
are going.  In that amazing process by which confusion 
becomes order, in five minutes everybody is in a van, and a 
procession of vehicles pulls out of the parking lot, following 
&quot;Streetside,&quot; an enormous RV with a garish design on its side.
<dd>The Festival of Hope, 1996, for Langston Terrace 
has begun.  Exodus Youth Ministries is in full swing.  
<P>
<P><CENTER>*   *   *</CENTER><BR>
<dd>An exodus is usually about leaving.  This Exodus is all 
about entering:   Exodus Youth Services Inc. enters the inner city 
of Washington, D.C., that the people may go forth out of 
slavery and into the promised land.   Every Tuesday, Thursday, 
and Friday night since 1987, Streetside has been driven through 
the streets of Washington, D.C. Once parked it is a staging 
ground from which Exodus volunteers talk about God's love and 
help local residents find in Him freedom from the slavery of 
poverty and drugs and violence.  
<dd>&quot;We're an ecumenical Catholic ministry serving the 
poorest of the poor in the Nation's Capital,&quot; says Mary Lyman 
Jackson, 39, the President of Exodus and widow of its founder, 
Rev. K. Logan Jackson.  &quot;We're a 50l(c)(3) [nonprofit], 
incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia, and we 
focus on serving children and families in the metropolitan 
Washington area, particularly the homeless, runaways, latchkey 
children, and refugees.  Our main mission is to bring the gospel 
of Our Lord Jesus Christ to the poor so they come to know 
Him as their personal Lord and Savior, and then get them into a 
local church.&quot;
<dd>During the eleven years that Exodus has existed, 
seminarians from every denomination with a theological school in 
the nation's capital have done internships or volunteered 
with Exodus Youth Ministries. They have overcome their 
own fears, and learned to love.  One year, Logan Jackson received Goodwill Industries of America's Edgar J. Helms Award 
for outstanding service.  In 1990, Logan was honored by 
<I>Washingtonian</I> magazine as &quot;Washingtonian of the Year.&quot;    
<dd>Letters of appreciation and testimony about Exodus, 
from Episcopal, Lutheran, Catholic, Moravian, and 
non-denominational seminarians fill the ministry files. All have learned 
from Exodus.
<dd>Not all the letters of endorsement are from religious 
organizations and leaders.  Edwin J. Feulner, President of the 
Heritage Foundation, describes himself as &quot;increasingly 
enthusiastic about its ministry.&quot;  <I>Dallas Morning 
News</I> columnist William Murchison has written that Mary Lyman Jackson 
&quot;is entitled to that special awe attending what our sad, 
sordid world accounts sacrifice.&quot;  
<P>
<P><a name="poor">
<B>The Poorest of the Poor</B><p>
<dd>Exodus has written a Streetside Catechism, which aims 
to teach the truths of the Catholic Faith, based on Scripture, 
the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and the lives of the saints. 
 It is geared toward the illiterate and marginalized.  It 
targets everyone older than two years of age.  Written by two 
professors of theology, one at Catholic University and one at 
the Franciscan University of Steubenville, it awaits an 
<I>Imprimatur</I> from Cardinal Hickey, and it will then be distributed 
nationwide. 
<dd>Another Exodus publication is the &quot;Streetside 
Epistles.&quot; These are weekly letters of hope that evangelize 
residents without telephones that the van doesn't get to visit.
<dd>Right now, Exodus is working with over 4000 individuals 
in five neighborhoods: Langston Terrace NE, Adams 
Morgan NW, Morton Street/Georgia Avenue NW, Potomac 
Gardens SE, and Stanton Dwellings SE.  These are areas 
largely forgotten by the rest of the world, with the exception of 
Adams Morgan, a diverse neighborhood with many trendy 
African and Caribbean restaurants.  
<dd>&quot;The only hassling we ever get is from tourists in 
Adams-Morgan, who don't want to see the poor,&quot; says Mary Lyman. 
 &quot;They just want an exotic dinner.  Druggies don't bother us. 
 Usually they come and ask us to pray for them.  There was 
one who was the drug lord in a neighborhood.  He'd jump start 
the van whenever it needed it.  He didn't want us to pray 
for him...once I ran half a block after him, yelling at him to 
hold still so I could pray for him....  He protected us fine.  He's in 
jail now for bouncing checks.&quot; 
<dd>When your clients are so far down that the drug lords feel 
protective of them, you know you are working with the poorest 
of the poor. These are the ones who fall through the cracks of 
other systems, the ones who are &quot;unreachable&quot; and unreached, 
the ones whose problems are so overwhelming that no 
bureaucrat would touch them.  
<dd>The District of Columbia is bankrupt;  these days one 
cannot even be sure that the trash will  be picked up, let alone any 
more sophisticated service performed.  Back in 1986, the D.C. Task 
Force on Runaway and Homeless Youth admitted that &quot;No real 
`system' of services to runaway and homeless youth currently exists. . . 
Services are neither coordinated, consistently available nor easily 
available to those who need them.&quot; And things have only gotten 
worse since then.
<dd>But Exodus gets help where it can. When necessary it 
works with other agencies and ministries in the Washington area 
for referrals and outreach, food, clothing, furniture, shelter, 
job placement and training, emergency groceries and rent, funerals, adoptions, physical and mental health care, and dentistry.
<P>
<P><a name="pics">
<B>The Pictures Tell the Stories</B><p>
<dd>Logan Jackson incorporated the ministry in 1986 and 
with a large grant from the Bingham Foundation of Louisville 
he bought &quot;Streetside,&quot; a large recreational vehicle.  
Originally, the vehicle had &quot;Health Screening and Referrals&quot; printed on 
its side, as Exodus had doctors travelling with its 
volunteers, looking to physical needs while they tended to the soul. 
But Exodus got out of the healthcare business when the 
D.C. Government started something similar.
<dd>The Exodus home office is a rented old frame house 
in suburban Maryland, perhaps one of the summer 
cottages which constituted Old Town Gaithersburg a hundred 
years ago.  It is worn, and the floors are bare, but it is neat and clean. 
 While I was there, a truck pulled up with lawnmowers, and 
a crew of teenage boys began to mow the lawn.  Mary 
Lyman knows them by their first names; they are from a 
landscape company owned by a friend.  Is the work done 
<I>pro bono</I> or for pay?  &quot;I don't know,&quot; she says absently. &quot;I forget what 
the arrangement is this summer.&quot;   Her attention is on the 
pictures that line the walls of the staircase--pictures of Exodus 
volunteers helping kids with arts and crafts, doing puppet shows, 
standing with arms around people, praying.  Sometimes Mary 
Lyman calls it &quot;friendship evangelism.&quot;  
<dd>The pictures often tell harrowing stories. &quot;That boy sitting 
in the Greyhound bus was a refugee.  He had come across 
the border with his dad in a cattle car and gotten separated,&quot; 
Mary Lyman told me.  &quot;Somehow the boy had wandered all the way 
to Washington alone; and one night, speaking no English, he 
walked up to our great big RV.  Exodus found his dad; the picture 
was taken as he was leaving D.C. on his way back to him.&quot;
<dd>The two sullen-looking punks are upper-middle class runaways. 
 &quot;Lots of it is peer pressure, but a lot of it is because of 
emotional abuse.  It's not a political statement, it's an actual way of life.  Once they get on the street, 
they get into prostitution, drug trafficking...  Their life 
expectancy is three years....   If there isn't an intervention within the 
first weeks on the street, they develop neuroses from the 
pressure, the lack of sleep, lack of nourishment, despair.  
They're exposed to things they've never seen before.  They get 
STDs too.&quot; 
<dd>There's an eviction scene, a small boy's face distorted with grief as he watches 
his kitten being taken away by an Animal Control warden.
<dd>There's a bed, shoved into a corner between two dirty walls.  The bed is 
piled high with crumpled laundry.  &quot;Sometimes they just wear clothes until they're too dirty, then they 
go down and get more, because they can't afford the soap 
and laundry expenses.&quot;  Does Exodus give away clothing?  
&quot;We have in the past, but not now.  They can go other places to 
get it for free.&quot;
<dd>A bearded man, with a child in a backpack, looks straight 
out at the camera.  &quot;He was a contractor, but his clients didn't 
pay up, so he lost his house.  He lived out of his car, with his six 
kids and pregnant wife ....  
<dd>&quot;If families go into shelters, the shelters will split up 
the husbands and wives.  There was a case in '88, a woman had 
left an abusive husband, and she and her kids were in the 
welfare hotel with  300 other kids.  We got her into counseling.  
We went to court to get her custody of those kids.  Exodus 
had arranged for a Christian transitional living arrangement 
in Virginia.  The day before the court date, D.C. welfare took 
her kids away from her....  She was suicidal....&quot;
<dd>When Exodus is involved in cases of abuse, they find 
the mother and children a safe place, arrange for medical care 
and emergency money, find psychological support, and then 
a home in Washington, Maryland or Virginia.  &quot;We have 
quite a network,&quot; Mary Lyman smiles.  
<dd>There is a picture of two little girls, toddlers, on a 
bare mattress. &quot;Their mom has HIV, and according to her 
will, when she dies, those girls will be mine.&quot;
<dd>A picture of a little girl with an eager expression on her face. 
 &quot;She was left toddling in a stairwell when she was two. 
 Nobody ever saw her mother again.&quot;  
<dd>&quot;We're child advocates.  We go to local police, courts, 
and so on, on behalf of children when no one else will.  We do 
the same type of work as a guardian <I>ad litem 
</I>in court proceedings.  There was a 17-year old boy who had a heart attack, and he 
was diabetic.  He was at Greater Southeast Hospital, which is 
not where you'd want to be with that problem.  Children's 
Hospital has a much better cardiology unit.  I talked to more people 
than I can remember to get it arranged so he could be transferred....&quot;
<dd>There are pictures of young adults sharing their faith 
with street youths; a young man earnestly talking with four 
toddlers on a streetcorner.  &quot;When the children come to the van, 
we make the sign of the cross on their forehead in oil, seal them 
in the sign of the cross, and tell them `You belong to God, 
you have dignity as a child of God.'  They line up to be prayed 
with, even the Muslims.  They begin to know that God loves them. 
<dd>&quot;We started out being good-works oriented.  And then 
the Lord really showed us that the needs of these people were 
so drastic, the only thing that would really work is Jesus.  Jesus 
is the way of rescuing them from the kingdom of darkness....  
Our primary focus is spiritual, to bring them to Jesus, to 
incorporate them into the Body of Christ, to disciple them and help 
them give their lives to the Lord.&quot; But doing that cannot be 
separated from the work of meeting the material, medical, and 
physical needs of the people.
<dd>In the waiting room and office--once a living 
room--a large framed poster proclaims in bright primary colors 
the names of God: &quot;And thou shalt call His name Jesus, Prince 
of Peace, Mighty God, Wonderful Counselor, Holy One, 
Lamb of God...&quot;
<dd>There is also a picture of Logan Jackson, the founder 
of Exodus Ministries, on a sidewalk next to Streetside, in 
a wheelchair with a headrest, surrounded by street people. 
<dd>Logan had Lou Gehrig's disease, and he progressively 
lost the use of his entire body.  At the time that picture was 
taken he could not even move his head and could speak only in 
a whisper, but he was there praying with them and 
encouraging them.  Mary Lyman nursed him around the clock for 
ten months before he died.  &quot;When you have that disease, 
ultimately you die of suffocation, which is how Jesus is thought to 
 have died on the cross.  He had a very special relationship 
with Jesus, but especially at the end.&quot;  The end came for Logan 
on June 9, 1993.  His wife, Mary Lyman, had been named head 
of the ministry by its board of directors in 1990. 
<P>
<P><a name="logan">
<B>Logan and Mary Lyman Jackson</B><p>
<dd>While Exodus was still recovering from the strain of 
Logan's illness and death,  his 17-year old son, Mercer Jackson, 
almost died. On February 10, 1995 Mercer was in a car accident 
that broke his cheekbone, eye socket, jaw, shoulders, wrist,  
leg, and every rib.  Before the accident, two colleges had 
offered Mercer lacrosse scholarships.  It took a long time for him 
to recover, and it hit the family hard.  But the ministry rolled 
with the punches.  &quot;Everybody helped out,&quot; says Mary Lyman.  
A friend, John Boughton, who had been running a ministry 
in Bosnia, was visiting at the time.  He cancelled his return 
to Bosnia to temporarily take charge of Exodus.  A team of 
girls recently graduated from the Franciscan University 
of Steubenville were doing some missionary work with 
Exodus at the time, and they stayed on.  Volunteers abounded, and 
the work continued.
<dd>Mercer is back in school again, John Boughton has gone 
on to seminary, and Mary Lyman runs the ministry from her 
home and the office.
<dd>Eileen Jones, director of Streetside, marvels at how well 
the system works.  &quot;No matter where Mary Lyman is, that's 
where the phone rings.  If she's home, the phone rings there; if 
she's here, it rings here.  She doesn't tell people where she's 
going to be, they just seem to know.&quot;  Mary Lyman has a beeper, 
and the people on the street have her numbers.  They call her 
to encourage her sometimes.  But they usually call to ask for help. 
<dd>During Logan's illness, neither Logan nor Mary Lyman 
had time for fundraising and money became tight.  They 
didn't know where the next dime would come from.  But it seems 
as though that experience confirmed God's pleasure with 
the ministry.
<dd>&quot;We had a George Mueller experience,&quot;  Mary 
explains. &quot;He started orphanages in England in the 1800s, and he 
wasn't much at asking for money.  He would pray and pray and 
pray, and orphans would come in the thousands.  He would pray 
and pray, for days sometimes, and then the money would come in. 
 So from March to June, 1990, we prayed and prayed, and 
we literally received checks to the penny for everything 
the ministry needed.  Volunteers kept coming and the 
ministry went through a spiritual transformation.  We became 
explicitly Christian rather than interfaith, which was how we 
started out.&quot;  
<dd>The ministry's total revenues for 1994 were $136,016; 
for 1995, $173,501.   Currently, Exodus has two paid staff 
positions. Eileen Jones, director of Streetside, fills one of them 
and there's an opening for an administrative assistant. The 
ministry has 30 regular volunteers. Several thousand others, if 
you count the schools, civic organizations, and parishes that 
help with special projects pitch in over the course of a year.   
And then there are the volunteers in the neighborhoods and on 
the streets.  They contribute a significant part of the work to 
events like the Festival of Hope in Langston Terrace.  Big days 
like that are organized in every season.  
<dd>Two teachers from a school a half hour away came by 
the office during this reporter's visit.  They celebrated the end of the school year, and carried in boxes of mustard and mayonnaise packets, sodas leftover from the teachers' party, and 
a few plastic bags with clothes--items the kids never 
claimed from Lost and Found all year, they said, sort of sheepishly. 
 Obviously, they had been to Exodus  before.  They're 
probably in the category of friends, rather than volunteers. No 
one registered the items when they left.  They were not logged 
in. It is possible that Exodus might have more volunteers than 
it realizes.  
<dd>Occasionally, Exodus has had involuntary volunteers, 
people referred by courts to do mandatory community service.  
&quot;We had a Congressman once.  Then there was this skinhead 
who was assigned to us by a judge.  He sat in the office for three 
days and didn't say a word.  We prayed with him most of those 
three days, and after that, he opened up and told us his story of abuse. 
 When the community service was finished, he stayed on as 
a volunteer.&quot; 
<dd>Still, there is the need for money.  The rent has to be 
paid, gasoline has to be bought, repairs must be completed, the grass must be mowed. 
 Where does it come from?  Exodus is in the Combined Federal Campaign 
and the Catholic Network of Volunteers.  According to its audit report, 
contributions make up the lion's share of revenues, with in-kind donations 
adding about 25%.  The donations come from individuals, corporations, and 
foundations.  Exodus maintains a house list, and about once 
every quarter, it sends out fundraising letters.  They bring results,  
but it's not a top priority:  &quot;If we're supposed to be doing a 
letter, and someone dies, we do the funeral instead,&quot; says 
Mary Lyman.  
<dd>The books show contributions from corporations like 
Phillip Morris and Hechingers, a chain of super-hardware stores in 
the Washington area.  There are lots and lots of in-kind 
contributions, of course.  And some foundations such as the 
Abell Foundation and the George E. Coleman Jr. Foundation 
also contribute.
<dd>Mary Lyman gets restless talking finances.  &quot;I can be 
a businesswoman, or I can be an evangelist,&quot; she says.  &quot;If I 
talk like a businesswoman,  I can tell you we'll come close to 
our projected budget.  We could do a business analysis, but it's 
not going to mean beans, because that's not how God works. 
 When I talk as an evangelist, I can tell you that this ministry 
has survived not on human cleverness but on God's providence.  
If God wants us to expand, He sends us a little more; if He wants us to 
cut back, He sends us a little less.&quot;
<dd>Yes, she knows that there are professional ways, proven ways of 
raising money.  &quot;I try to do it,&quot; she acknowledges.  &quot;But it's not 
systematic.  We don't have a full-time Director of Development.  We 
have volunteers.  I'll get a phone call, with someone recommending I go 
visit someone.  And nine times out of ten, when I meet with corporate 
executives, they give us money.  But I'm not making a concerted effort at it.  
I fit it in.  If I did it, we'd probably have a lot of money.  But the way 
it works, when there have been things I've felt the Lord wanted us to do, 
the money comes.  And when there are ideas, and I'm not sure God wants 
us to do them, then he holds back the money.  The unique thing about us 
is that we pray for the funds.&quot; 
<P>
<P><a name="called">
<B>Called By God</B><p>
<dd>While praying for funds is unusual,  the ministry's 
beginnings were unique as well.  
<dd> Logan Jackson was a quiet man, a gentle priest at St. James 
 Episcopal outside Louisville.  At the seminary, he had 
been known to his classmates as a conservative. In the diocese 
he was known in the same way--as someone not prone to 
flights of fancy. 
<dd>His wife, Mary Lyman was living on a five-acre horse 
farm, busy with three babies, ten Welsh Corgis, and her career as 
a concert pianist, when Logan heard God telling him in 
prayer that he should leave everything and seek first His kingdom 
by helping children. The only other time Logan had ever 
heard from the Lord so clearly was in his calling to be a priest.  
<dd>They could tell that God was softening their hearts.  And 
so they left, not knowing where they were headed.  
Logan's bishop,  however, thought it was their heads that had gone 
soft and offered to pay for psychiatric counseling.  Their 
families thought the bishop's offer should be considered.
<dd>But the Jacksons  were determined. They put their 
belongings in storage and lived in an abandoned Anglican convent 
in Tennessee for six months while Logan travelled around, 
visiting such places as Covenant House in New York City, 
the Seattle Rape Center, and Boston's Bridge Over 
Troubled Waters.  It was there that he conceived the idea of the 
&quot;Streetside&quot; van, and along the way, God told him Washington, D.C. 
was where He wanted him.  So they moved into the city, 
and initially ministered from their home. Logan would bring 
the street to their house, and Mary Lyman would teach.
<dd>They had an office in a rundown neighborhood in 
Washington, but after a while they learned it wasn't realistic to 
expect the poor to come to them.  It was a better use of time and 
money to go directly to the poor.  When they found out that Logan 
was dying, they moved out of the city to Gaithersburg--a suburb 
at the end of the Washington Metrorail  system.  It was 
cheaper, and it seemed a better place to be.  Along the way, each 
member of the family had spontaneously been drawn to 
Catholicism, and they converted as a family in 1992.  For Logan, it was 
in no way a rejection of his Episcopalian identity, but rather 
a fulfillment of it, a way to experience closer communion 
with the Lord whose sufferings he was already sharing in his body.

<B>Langston Terrace Clean-up</B><p>
<dd>A  short drive down North Capitol Street and across H 
Street brings the caravan of vehicles to Langston Terrace, the 
nation's oldest public housing development.  It contains 308 units.  
The three-story flat-roof brick buildings are somewhat 
overgrown with nondescript shrubs, and the playground features 
socialist-realist concrete sculptures and is uninviting. But the place 
is not as littered with trash as it used to be.  Mary Lyman 
offers the explanation that Exodus has been coming here 
regularly for eight years, and you can see in the neighborhood what 
is reflected in the hearts and minds of the residents:  &quot;If you 
know you're worth something, you want your environment to 
look like something.&quot;
<dd>At ten o'clock in the morning the streets are for the 
moment bereft of people.  Exodus has come for a Festival of Hope. 
The day will include free food, landscaping services, and 
activities for neighborhood residents and their children. Teams 
assemble and orders are given.  Blue, Red, Green, Peach, 
and Black teams line up to unload plants from the 
heavily-laden Streetsideit takes a good twenty minutes to do the job.
<dd>A local politician strolls up to try to wheedle some 
landscaping services for Carver Terrace, which adjoins Langston. 
&quot;I'm from the Mayor's office,&quot; he says in a tone of intimacy which 
he expects to bring results.  Mary Lyman comes out of the van 
to negotiate. She explains why she can't oblige him.  In the end, 
she hands him a flat of impatiens, and he leaves happy.  &quot;These 
people are my family, they'd kill me if I didn't keep my word.&quot;    
Obviously she is familiar with the ways of local politicians.
<dd>The landscaping teams start raking through grass that hasn't been cut all summer, and around rusted chain link fences rolled around their posts.  It would have been easy to remove 
the useless chain link, but it required a tool that no one had. 
There's lots of broken glass, but surprisingly few cigarette butts. 
Two local boys, maybe seven or eight years old, ask if they can help. 
 A few mothers emerge from the buildings to go to the 
mailboxes, then disappear again.  A teenage boy and his 
little brother, maybe eight years old, leave an apartment building, the big brother 
adjusting a key on a chain around the neck of his sibling.  They separate as they 
go down the sidewalk, away from the people who have come to clean up their 
neighborhood.
<dd>The work continues.  Mary Lyman distributes shovels, with a warning 
&quot;Don't let anybody get hold of them but you.  We'll never see them again.&quot;  A 
local man who runs a rehab program teaching landscaping skills to ex-prisoners 
arrives with his truck, on which are lawnmowers and edgers.  
The power tools are manned by a volunteer skilled in 
operating such equipment and an older man, who drove a van of 
young folks down from New Jersey for the day.
<dd>A priest working with Exodus is on the sidewalk, 
praying with three women.  Janice McCree, the President of the 
local Residents' Council, leads a volunteer team leader to the Council's offices, which are to be painted that afternoon.  
The Council is in the basement of a building, through a 
padlocked steel grate door.  There are two air conditioners in the 
offices, which run the length of the basement.  One doesn't work at 
all, the other works well, but it drains inside rather than out.  
A steady stream of water drips down the wall and puddles on 
the floor.  Later, when the wall has been painted, the water drips down 
through the fresh paint, and a milky-colored pool collects on the floor.  
<dd>Walking down the sidewalk with Janice is an experience.  She 
makes eye contact with everyone, no matter their age, and she knows their 
names. They all return the eye contact and speak respectfully to her.  
Janice says she has lived in Langston Terrace for 34 years.  Later in the 
day, she shows me pictures of her son's wedding.  He's a teacher at 
Towson State College in Maryland.  Her daughter is an entertainer, 
presently in Spain.  With a son and daughter on the road to  middle-class lives, 
why is she still living in Langston Terrace?  Her leadership and 
influence at Langston Terrace are answer enough.  
<dd>The basement of another building houses the Langston/Carver Case Management and 
Community Building Project, &quot;a collaborative effort of the 
Department of Health and Human Services and the D.C. 
Housing Authority,&quot; according to a posted flyer.  This basement 
is divided into smaller rooms, and features file cabinets 
and tables filled with AIDS/HIV information, and meeting 
announcements such as one for a baby care training 
evening sponsored jointly by Georgetown University and 
Children's Hospital.  Volunteers come through looking for a 
bathroom facility.  There is a toilet and sink, and they take turns 
holding the door closed for each other. There is no toilet 
paper, however, and no towels. 
<dd>During lunch break, the landscaping team carries 
their shovels to the courtyard and suddenly life seems to abound.  Children are all over the place.  Mothers stand in clumps.  
A few adult males have appeared.  &quot;The ones who are addicted 
to crack will be thin, so thin.  Their face will have a gray, 
pasty color to it.  They'll be standing around out of focus,&quot; 
Mary says.  Some match that description.  
<dd>Exodus has barbecue grills fired up on which are sizzling 
hot dogs and hamburgers for the residents.  But volunteers 
eat prepared sandwiches from long bread bags.  Enormous 
plastic bags of cut watermelon and trashcans filled with ice and sodas 
 round out the meal.  For forty minutes volunteers relax on 
steps and on the base of the 1940s concrete sculpture which some 
say is an elephant, some a mountain lion.  The feast for 
the residents continues through the afternoon, long after the 
volunteers have gone back to work.  The Yellow team starts up 
the arts and crafts program after lunch, manning the puppet stage. 
 The drama is the story of the Good Samaritan in street 
dialect, using animal hand puppets. 
<dd>The front yards of rowhouses comprise the sides of 
the courtyard.  Most are neglected, though a few show signs of 
past effortsa rose bush, or some planters.  Off to one corner of 
the courtyard, though, is a front lawn as green and tidy as any 
in a posh suburb.  A table is set up in front of the door, in the 
shade of a large tree, and a family--men and women and 
children--seem to be playing cards.  The children do not mingle 
with those running and screaming in the courtyard.  The adults 
seem to have their own food, their own entertainment.  One 
wonders what accounts for the difference.  That scene of 
domestic stability and contentment is probably close to the vision FDR had when he opened the Langston Terrace.  But unfortunately it is the exception.
<dd>Mary Lyman circulates through the crowds, speaking 
with everybody, greeting most by their first name, familiarly, 
comfortably.  Everybody knows her.  She gets smiles from 
everyone, as do the volunteers she's with.
<dd>&quot;The first time I went on the streets with my husband, 
God transformed me.  It was around Dupont Circle, and a 
homeless man was dying.  I was crying, I didn't know what to do, it 
was my first time.  The homeless guys put their hands on me and prayed over me.  I'd never heard speaking in tongues before.  But that day, my solidarity with the poor started.  The 
poor bring us Jesus.  We don't bring Jesus to them.  We pray, 
we catechize, we do the social worker stuff too.  But on that 
first night, I became their little sister.  I have learned so much 
from the poor, they have given me so much joy....&quot;<BR><BR>

<center><h2>MAKING AMERICANS PAY: THE MACARTHUR FOUNDATION'S PLAN FOR A GLOBAL IRS</h2>
<h3>by Cliff Kincaid</h3></center>
One of America's largest foundations, the $3 billion John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, has moved ever leftward in recent years.  From the increasingly bizarre choices of recipients for its celebrated "genius" awards to the funding of Parliamentarians for Global Action, MacArthur Foundation grants have come to exemplify "progressive philanthropy" at its most cutting-edge.
Many MacArthur programs fund predictable if radical attempts to shape policy and opinion on public issues.  MacArthur, for instance, funds the far-left Institute for Policy Studies ($650,000 in 1993) for the purpose of developing "A New U.S. Foreign Policy for the 21st Century." Other programs, however, have staked out new ground.  One new endeavor is the field of "international governance" to which the foundation committed $1,589,902 in 1994.  It is the focus of the Foundation's Peace and International Cooperation Program.<p>
At first glance "international governance" might appear to imply support for the programs of the United Nations and its affiliated institutions.  But a closer look suggests something more.  A review of MacArthur Foundation annual reports and MacArthur-funded organizations discloses findings that are certain not to please American taxpayers.<p>
 To finance an expansion of the U.N.'s military, environmental and population control programs the MacArthur Foundation is leading a chorus of voices that over the last several years has been advocating the imposition of international taxes on the United States and other countries.  "International governance" has become a euphemism for encouraging nonprofits, governments and international bodies to undertake projects, task forces, conferences, seminars, monographs, reports and other activities that will help build a constituency for world government that will be supported by ordinary American citizens through payments to an international version of the I.R.S.<p>
MacArthur is careful not to use the term "world government" to describe this ambitious agenda.  But the projects underwritten by the foundation, in particular the private Commission on Global Governance, are partly designed to give the U.N. an independent taxing authority.  If successful, the cash-strapped world body would have the wherewithal to become a full-fledged government and it would become independent of U.S. influence.<p>
Of course, this is a sensitive topic that is subject to countless qualifications and preconditions.  Warnings of "world government" are easily dismissed as fever swamp fantasies.  But those who follow foundation grantmakers notice that they increasingly seek to fund "global solutions" to problems that do not suffer interference by national sovereignty, constitutional limits, individual rights or private property ownership.<p>
The MacArthur Foundation refused to respond to our inquiries.  Asked to comment on global taxes and MacArthur's grant to the Commission on Global Governance, Ray Boyer, communications director for the foundation, declared, "We choose not to do an interview with Foundation Watch."  The "no-comment" may reflect MacArthur's uneasiness over previous Capital Research Center disclosures of its activities.  CRC visiting fellow Martin Morse Wooster, in his work The Great Philanthropists & the Problem of "Donor Intent,"  described the foundation's failure to honor the intentions of its benefactor, John D. MacArthur, whose $3 billion fortune is being used to further the goals of individuals and groups for which its founder had no documented sympathy.  A champion of free enterprise, MacArthur intensely disliked government bureaucracies and regulations and opposed attempts to restrict economic development.<p>
Yet the MacArthur Foundation has underwritten groups that are dedicated to more taxes, more public spending and more regulation of the private sector.  The Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) is only the most radical example of this trend.  IPS sympathies for leftist revolutionaries, apologies for communist tyranny, and strident attacks on U.S. foreign and domestic policies were notorious before the collapse of Communism.  The current interest in "international governance" by grantmakers like MacArthur merely represents the worm's turn in new-plowed soil. The impulse to create new international bureaucracies that impose proscriptions and issue mandates is irrepressible.<p>
Direct MacArthur funding of international institutions, including the U.N. and its controversial conferences, is substantial.  For example, in 1992 the foundation directly provided $225,000 to the U.N. Office of the Secretary General "in support of United Nations Peacemaking and Peacekeeping Activities."  It gave $20,000 for the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs and $300,000 to the U.N. Development Program (more on this later). MacArthur gave $235,000 for the 1995 U.N. Conference in Cairo on Population and Development, where the U.N. and the Vatican wrangled over abortion policy.  It gave $102,000 for the U.N.'s 1994 Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, capital of a country that controls women's childbearing.  MacArthur also funds the U.N. Association of the United States (UNA-USA).  The premier nonprofit supporter of the United Nations received $565,400 in 1992.
Certainly the foundation's board of directors should realize that waste, fraud and abuse pervade the organization.  The November 1995 Reader's Digest provides a convenient summary of the organization's problems in an article entitled "The United Nations is Out of Control." One U.N. staffer managed to embezzle  $560,000 before getting caught.  Even Madeleine Albright, U.S Ambassador to the U.N., has admitted that she cannot "justify to the taxpayers of my country some of the personnel arrangements, the sweetheart pension deals, the lack of accountability, the waste of resources, the duplication of effort and the lack of attention to the bottom line that we often see around here."<p>
In spite of such problems, the MacArthur Foundation's committment to international governance reflects unquestioning support for the U.N., its agencies, and their mission.  As described in MacArthur's 1994 annual report, the promotion of international governance means "encouraging attention to transnational relations, multilateral agreements, and international institutions crucial to managing and mediating future conflicts."<p>

<h4>MACARTHUR'S  GLOBAL I.R.S. IN YOUR FUTURE</h4>
In 1993 the MacArthur Foundation gave $500,000 to the peculiarly-named Commission on Global Governance. This private group also received financing from foreign governments, including the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Canada, Denmark, India, Indonesia, and Switzerland.  The government of Japan arranged for the Commission to receive funding from "two United Nations trust funds."
Of 28 members on the Commission, two are Americans:  Barber Conable, the former World Bank president who was earlier a Republican congressman from New York, and Adele Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation. [See box] The Commission was charged with conducting an "in-depth review of institutions involved in global and regional cooperation."  From September 1992 to October 1994 it held a series of meetings which resulted in an extraordinary report entitled "Our Global Neighborhood."  If implemented, the report's recommendations would end national sovereignty as we know it.  "In certain areas," the report argues, "sovereignty must be exercised collectively, particularly in relation to the global commons."<p>
Most of the 410 page report discusses ways of strengthening U.N. authority in world affairs, such as by creating a U.N.-sponsored criminal court. The Commission on Global Governance is quite straightforward in explaining how these activities will be financed.  It declares that global taxation will be required.  The summary of "Our Global Neighborhood" announces:
<blockquote><i>It is time for a consensus on global taxation for servicing the needs of the global neighborhood.  A start must be made in establishing schemes of global financing of global purposes, including charges on the use of global resources such as flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean fishing areas and the collection of revenues agreed globally and implemented by treaty.  An international tax on foreign currency transactions should be explored as one option, as should the creation of an international corporate tax base among multinational corporations.</i></blockquote>
The section which deals with global taxes is only five pages long.  However, these pages are the most explosive.  Americans should take a particular interest in this section.  Our nation was born from a tax revolt and we can be expected to bear the major burden of the Commission's tax schemes. Conscious of this history, the Commission warns that it will not be easy to enact global taxes.  Taxes are generally unpopular and, the Commission observes, "even a tightly knit group such as the European Union  has not advanced far in tax raising powers."  But aware also of the example of the successes of the international environmental movement and the proliferation of U.N. peacekeeping missions around the world, the Commission voices the hope that: 
<blockquote><i>The time could be right, however, for a fresh look and a breakthrough in this area.  The idea of safeguarding and managing the global commons -- particularly those related to the physical environment -- is now widely accepted; this cannot happen with a drip-feed approach to financing.  And the notion of expanding the role of the United Nations is now accepted in relation to military security.</i></blockquote>

<h4>DOES 'INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE' MEAN WORLD GOVERNMENT?</h4>
The Commission indicates that it does not favor locating the taxing power within the U.N.  It prefers instead a system by which member states would adopt a treaty or convention to impose taxes worldwide.  Yet it urges that proposals for global taxes be "initiated in the UN system" and negotiated and approved by the U.N. General Assembly before member-states ratify them through an international agreement. Once the specific recommendations of the Commission are understood, the terms "international governance" and "global goverance" make sense.  "International governance" doesn't have the clarity of "world government," but it means the same thing.<p>
In a January 1996 BBC interview U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali publicly embraced global taxation.  He advocated a "light international tax" to pay for U.N. operations.  Such a tax would give the organization "independence."  The Secretary-General declared, "I will not be under the daily financial will of the Member States."  Asked whether the tax was likely, he replied, "It takes time.  I am sure that we will win in the end and that we will obtain from the international community [recognition] that we need to have our own income."<p>
Boutros-Ghali provided additional detail in a January 1996 lecture at Oxford University.  In order for the U.N. to "operate on a secure and steady independent financial foundation," he proposed "measures for consideration."  These included a fee on speculative international financial transactions, a levy on fossil fuel use or its pollution; a small earmarked portion of the anticipated decline in world military expenditures; a stamp tax on international travel and travel documents; or a separate levy on global currency transactions.  Boutros-Ghali added, "Finding the right formula will be a project of vast importance for the future of the international community.  It will be the role of the Secretary General to bring this project to successful fruition in the twenty-first century."
The report of the Commission on Global Governance is careful to deny that global taxes to fund U.N. operations constitutes world government.  "As this report makes clear," declared Commission co-chairmen, Sir Shridath Ramphal, former Secretary-General of the [formerly British] Commonwealth, and Ingvar Carlsson, Prime Minister of Sweden, in their foreword to the document, "global governance is not global government.  No misunderstanding should arise from the similarity of the terms."  But Richard Hudson, executive director of the Center for War/Peace Studies, is skeptical.  The disclaimer, he suspects, masks the real potential that the U.N. and its associated agencies can become instruments of world government.  Hudson, editor of the group's Global Report, wrote, "The possibility of a rational debate on the issue of 'world government' has been muddied in the past few years by the introduction into the international dialogue of the term 'global governance' by the Commission on Global Governance."<p>
Hudson said he asked one-time senior U.N. official Sir Brian Urquhart, a member of the Commission, what "global governance" meant.  Urquhart responded, "Nobody knows what it means.  I was opposed to that name and suggested instead something like Commission on Global Management.  The term governance doesn't even exist in French or Spanish."<p>
Hudson says he suggested to Commission co-chairman Ramphal that "global governance" was an oxymoron for "global government" and that Ramphal replied, "Well, maybe we need some oxymorons."  Hudson may have confused a euphemism for an oxymoron, but his point was understood.  If MacArthur President Adele Simmons and the other members of the Commission on Global Governance believe in world government, shouldn't they say so?  Their report calls for global taxes and a World Court which will have compulsory jurisdiction over the nations of the world.  Unfortunately, MacArthur Foundation communications director Ray Boyer refuses to discuss the matter with Foundation Watch.<p>

<h4>BUILDING INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL TAXATION</h4>
The U.N. has been more forthcoming about its ideas.  Peter Hansen, the former executive director of the MacArthur-funded Commission, was named U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs under Boutros-Ghali.  In this capacity, Hansen gave a presentation last September before a pro-U.N. group, the National Assembly on the United Nations and the U.S.  His talk, "Alternative Sources of Financing the UN System," described ideas for new "money raising approaches" for the U.N. as "very, very persuasive," and he favorably cited proposals for a carbon tax and a tax on international currency transactions. "It is time to take some action here," he declared. Even before Boutros-Ghali's public statements endorsing global taxes, economist Jan Tinbergen was writing in a 1994 Human Development Report of the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), "Mankind's problems can no longer be solved by national governments.  What is needed is a World Government."  Tinbergen added, "This can best be achieved by strengthening the United Nations system."<P>
The head of the UNDP is James Gustave Speth.  As president of the nonprofit World Resources Institute and a member of Bill Clinton's transition team, Speth coordinated the incoming Administration's environmental appointments.  In 1982 he founded WRI with the help of a $15,000,000 grant from  the MacArthur Foundation. In the fall of 1994 UNDP administrator Speth endorsed global taxation.  Anticipating the March 1995 U.N.-sponsored World Summit for Social Development to be held in Copenhagen, Speth declared in a speech:
<blockquote><i>Indeed, we have a unique opportunity to strike some new global compacts in the Social Summit next year in Copenhagen.  The [1994 UNDP Human Development] Report offers several concrete proposals...A global human security fund -- financed from global fees such as the 'Tobin tax' on speculative movements of international funds, an international tax on the consumption of non-renewable energy, global environmental permits and a tax on arms trade...These proposals demand a great deal from the international community.  But they are all doable.</i></blockquote>
The 1994 Human Development Report, issued by Speth's UNDP, was explicit.  It said:
<blockquote><i>...[A] serious search should begin for new sources of international funding that do not rely entirely on the fluctuating political will of the rich nations.  Global taxation may become necessary in any case to achieve the goals of global human security.  Some of the promising new sources include tradable permits for global pollution, a global tax on non-renewable energy, demilitarization funds and a small transaction tax on speculative international movements of foreign exchange funds.</i></blockquote>
The 1994 Human Development Report went even further.  It added details on the taxes on energy and international currency transactions that it proposed: 
<blockquote><i>A second logical source of funds for a global response to global threats is a set of fees on globally important transactions or polluting emissions....One is a tax on the international movements of speculative capital suggested by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics....[It] could raise $150 billion a year...Another is a global tax on energy: a tax of $1 on each barrel of oil (and its equivalent on coal) during 1995-2000 would yield around $66 billion a year.</i></blockquote>

<h4>THE TOBIN TAX</h4>
The 1994 Human Development Report featured an article by James Tobin, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize for Economics.  Tobin estimated that his proposal could produce revenues of $1.5 trillion a year: 
<blockquote><i>An international uniform tax would be levied on spot transactions in foreign exchange...The revenue potential is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year for the 0.5% tax...It is appropriate that the proceeds of an international tax be devoted to international purposes and be placed at the disposal of international institutions.</i></blockquote>
Proposals for global taxes were seriously offered and debated  at the March 1995  World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen.  One leading proponent was France's late president, Socialist Francois Mitterand, who spoke to the conference just a few months before his death.  <i>The New York Times</i> reported, "He supported a proposal to tax speculative international currency transactions as [a] way of raising money for development...President Mitterand...said he had no illusions about the difficulty of establishing a tax on financial transactions.  But he challenged the audience of more than 115 government leaders to make a real commitment." <i>The Washington Post</i> also took note of the "Tobin Tax":  "Another idea, proposed by James Tobin, an American who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1981, called for a tax on speculative currency transfers to raise funds for development aid.  A tax on short-term currency deals as small as 0.05 percent, U.N. officials say, could raise as much as $150 billion a year  and produce the added benefit of discouraging disruptive financial speculation." <P>
	The UNDP's follow-up 1995 Human Development Report referred to the ongoing "global human development debate" which had led to "concrete policy proposals" on taxes.  It added that these include "finding new sources of funding for global human security, such as the 'Tobin Tax' on international speculative movements of currency or internationally tradable permits for global emissions. At the recent World Summit for Social Development, proposals such as the 20:20 compact [a proposal for international financial assistance to poor countries] and the Tobin tax attracted widespread interest from many quarters." In an April 1995 article endorsing global taxes in <i>Choices</i>, the official organ of the UNDP, UNDP historian Ruben Mendez proposes a variation on the Tobin tax.  He urges that a "Foreign Currency Exchange" be established as a U.N. agency to "generate vast revenues" for the world body and declares, "It is time to make an intellectual quantum leap, and to look beyond the nation-state for new, innovative and independent transnational sources of funds."<P>
	Mendez had earlier endorsed the Tobin Tax in a 1993 report to the Commission on Global Governance.  But in the 1995 article he expressed his fear that the Tobin Tax was unworkable because "formidable obstacles stand in its way."  He explained, "Foreign exchange transactions are often loose and informal.  They leave no 'paper trail' by which they can be monitored and taxed." By contrast, Mendez' "Foreign Currency Exchange" (FXE) would operate as foreign securities exchanges do, but by offering lower rates they would be less expensive.  The FXE would be a "publicly-owned entity" run by the U.N.  A 1.0 percent rate for fees and commissions could generate $840 million a day, he claimed. Former <i>Forbes</i> magazine staff reporter Steven Solomon provides another variation on the theme in his book <i>The Confidence Game</i> (Simon & Schuster, 1995).  Solomon urges formation of a "world economic directorate" to manage national economies and adoption of a global tax on international currency transactions.  The Solomon version brings in $13 trillion a year.<P>
	"Such great sums," he enthuses, "could be used to pay the cost of administering new financial regulations.  Some could be turned over to the Basel club [i.e. central bankers] to pursue interventions to stabilize currencies and to carry out lender of last resort missions.  Some could finance the World Bank for economic development, or an IMF that might be restructured to evolve into a world central bank and seat of a genuine world economic directorate."  In a footnote, Solomon acknowledges that his proposal is a variation of the Tobin Tax.<P>

<h4>MORE CLEVER TAX SCHEMES</h4>
Because foundations understand that no single commission or report is adequate to build support for political change, they fund a variety of approaches.  The Ford Foundation, for instance, which contributed to the support of the Commission on Global Governance, also subsidized a 1994 study, <i>Renewing the United Nations System</i>, by former U.N. officials Erskine Childers and Brian Urquhart, a Commission member. Their report notes that "a range of international taxation schemes" have been proposed, including a "United Nations surcharge" on arms sales, land-mines, the international movement of currencies, international trade, international air and sea travel, and the production of materials such as petroleum and hydro-carbons, and raw mineral commodities.  Despite their sympathy for global tax proposals, Childers and Urquhart acknowledge that, "Schemes for additional financing of the UN are...easy to suggest but would not be at all easy to implement."  Nonetheless, they cannot stop themselves from making an additional proposal to designate: <i>one day in each year as 'United Nations Communication Day,' when all postage charges and telephone calls (and a fraction of broadcasting advertising revenues?) would carry levies accruing to the UN, with special public information on the world organization.</i><P>
Childers and Urquhart realistically warn that for all global tax proposals, "Each member-government would have to agree to levy any such taxes, and collect and transfer them to approved parts of the UN System.  Thus, international taxation revenue would essentially rise through and stay under the control of member-governments."  Cleverly, they devise an alternative that has worked for state governments and Indian tribes, and propose an annual "United Nations lottery, administered by a special authority under the Secretary-General," and licensed by member-states.<P>
It would be a mistake to dismiss these ideas with ridicule or to assume that they are purely hypothetical.  In one key area the U.N. already has made progress in securing global taxing authority.  The Law of the Sea Treaty provides for a precedent-setting Seabed Authority.  As the MacArthur-funded United Nations Association (UNA-USA) notes, "Only the Seabed Authority created by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which entered into force in late 1994, has authority today to directly collect international revenues to finance its activities."  The treaty, to which the U.S. is not yet a party, is awaiting U.S. Senate ratification and its prospects are uncertain.<P>

<h4>WHAT SHOULD AMERICA DO?</h4>
One should not take comfort in the belief that Senate ratification of international treaties is a fool-proof block against global taxes.  The U.N. Charter is not entirely clear about how the organization will be financed.  Article 17 only says that the General Assembly should consider and approve the budget of the organization and that the expenses "shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly."  Moreover, the third part of Article 17 says that the General Assembly "shall consider and approve any  financial and budgetary arrangements with specialized agencies..." And Article 29 says "The Security Council may establish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance of its functions."  These might well be tax-raising agencies and they conceivably could be established by a vote of the permanent members of the Security Council.<P>
Fortunately, the U.S. Constitution remains a bulwark against bureaucratic inventiveness.  Even if the Executive branch supported a Security Council proposal and even if the U.S. Senate ratified an international treaty, the Constitution says bills to raise taxes must originate in the U.S. House of Representatives.  At least for the moment, it is unlikely that the House will listen to foundation grantmakers and international bureaucrats on this issue. In 1996 now Republican Presidential contender Bob Dole and Senators Jesse Helms and Judd Gregg formally requested the General Accounting Office (GAO) investigate the status of these proposals.  Congressional hearings have been promised by Senator Helms.  The Senators threatened legislation to cut off all funds to the U.N. if the world body attempts to implement global taxes.<P>
The reaction of the Clinton Administration has been fascinating and yet predictable.  Quickly responding to the Boutros-Ghali speech, the State Department issued a strong statement through spokesman Nicholas Burns headlined: "U.S. Opposition to Worldwide Tax to Support the U.N."  It said: 
<blockquote><i>The United Nations does not have the authority to impose or collect any form of tax, and the U.S. Government would not consent to any proposal to grant it such authority. The United States continues to believe that the best way to ensure adequate and predictable funding for the United Nations system is through reforms which result in a fair system of financing, and which reduce overall costs and allow reinvestments of savings in areas of high priority to member states.  An approach to fundraising that involved any form of international tax would be inconsistent with the intergovernmental nature of the organization and could undermine the sovereignty of member states.</i></blockquote>
The Clinton Administration is now on the public  record opposing Boutros-Ghali's proposal for global taxes. But there is no hint here that one of the Administration's top people at the UN, James Gustave Speth,  favors just that initiative.<P>
As head of the U.N. Development Program, Gus Speth has been encouraging the global tax schemes that the State Department says it opposes.  Speth was appointed to his U.N. post at the urging of the Clinton administration. Luckily, the United States is still a constitutional republic, and despite the best efforts of the MacArthur Foundation, the prospect of increasing taxes to pay for the United Nations runs counter to the tax-cutting message of this year's presidential campaign. The anti-tax feeling among the American citizenry is not hard to understand.  And apparently growing opposition to Boutros-Ghali in the U.N. might also delay the establishment of an international  I.R.S. This is understandable. Imagine the reaction of the MacArthur Foundation if someone were to propose a hefty levy on tax-exempt foundations to support a  project of which it apparently did not approve -- such as strengthening American sovereignty.<P>

<center><h2>GLOBALLY MINDED MACARTHUR 'GENIUSES' REFLECT PAROCHIAL CONCERNS</h2>
<h3>by Martin Morse Wooster</h3></center>
<p>
In keeping with a global pattern of thinking,  the MacArthur Foundation in past years has given its genius awards to such planet-minded environmentalists as Stephen Schneider, Paul Ehrlich,  Amory Lovins, and Lester Brown -- each of whom has put international obligations to the Lonely Planet ahead of the national rights of the United States.  The 1996 laureates of the MacArthur Fellows Program fit this familiar pattern. Just as in the past, a third of the twenty-one fellows are scientists, a third are avant-garde artists, and a third are leftist activists.  As usual, conservatives, traditional artists, and entrepreneurs have been shunned.
<p>
The MacArthur Fellows Program is a relatively small part of the MacArthur Foundation's activities. MacArthur awards $142 million in annual grants but only some $7.6 million to its "geniuses."  Fellows typically receive about a quarter of a million dollars for a period of five years, with the exact amount determined by age.
<p>
Despite its relatively small budget the Fellows program generates much of MacArthur's publicity.  Because private foundations make so few grants to individuals the MacArthur Fellows program seems more exceptional than is actually the case.   It would be a routine occurrence if the MacArthur Foundation awarded five-year, $250,000 grants to Self-Help, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Scribe Video Center, YouthBuild U.S.A., and the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild.  But because the foundation gives grants directly to the presidents  of these organizations--Martin Eakes, Robert Greenstein,  Louis Massiah, Dorothy Stoneman, and William Strickland--the grants appear bold and unconventional, even though these recipients will almost certainly use their prize to enrich the organizations they created.
<p>
Though fifteen of the 1996 MacArthur Fellows work for organizations, there's still a veneer of rugged individualism about the program.  "Old John D. MacArthur would perhaps be horrified by some of the labor organizers and activists who have gotten his money," essayist Richard Rodriguez noted in a 1994 article in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>.  "Yet, there remains about the MacArthur prizes a faith that is deeply Protestant, individualistic, and capitalistic.  Give the artist big money and you will create big art."  Or, as.J. Roderick  MacArthur, son of the founder of the foundation, announced in a 1979 interview in <i>Forbes</i>,"Like the Renaissance princes, we'll find Michelangelo."
<p>
But where is he? If the MacArthur Foundation has made any review of the program, it has never made them public. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981 as an untenured member of the Yale faculty and free-lancer Tina Rosenberg was awarded a  MacArthur fellowship in 1987 at age 27 to write an interesting book about Latin America. But the Gates and Rosenberg cases are unusual. They won their MacArthurs when they were young and untenured.
<p>
It is  more typical for a MacArthur recipient to be a tenured university professor.  This year, for example, nine of the Fellows are professors, and seven of these nine are full professors, who have tenure. As <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Elizabeth Venant observes, the MacArthur Fellowship "has not redirected the work or lives of most winners with full-time university jobs." Most of the professors Venant interviewed used their MacArthur  windfall to finance an IRA, help pay for the college education of their children, or as a down payment on a house.  Confirming this finding, <i>The New York Times</i> reported that 1996 winner Rebecca Goldstein would use her money to pay her daughter's Harvard tuition and consolidate her debts, a boost for a family with an annual income of over $100,000 and a retirement portfolio "well into the six figures".
<p>
Four of the 1996 MacArthur Fellows are 50 or over, and seven others are between 45 and 49.  When Roy Hoopes interviewed MacArthur recipients who were 50 or over for the AARP's <i>Modern Maturity</i>, he found the MacArthurs primarily served to generate income from lecture fees and assignments.  Some of the people Hoopes interviewed regretted that they did not receive the award when they were younger and hungrier.  
<p>
When J. Roderick MacArthur was dying of cancer in 1984, he predicted that it would take a decade for the effects of the MacArthur Fellowships to be made clear.  Now that it has been 15 years since the MacArthur Fellowships were started, it is clear that the MacArthurs have made much less of a difference than most people expected when the program was launched in 1981.  A few young scholars have used their MacArthurs to produce interesting work and many older MacArthur winners have had a more comfortable retirement.  Yet in spite of the help of more than 1,000 anonymous talent scouts who have nominated Fellows (but whose names have never been disclosed to the public), the MacArthur Foundation has failed to find anyone as talented as Michelangelo.
<p>
If the MacArthur Fellows primarily reward obscure leftists, the lustre of the prizes will dim, particularly since many of the current fellows' achievements are quite arcane.  How many people eagerly await 1996 MacArthur Fellow Allan Berube's forthcoming book, <i>Shipping Out:  Gay Life and Activism on the Great Luxury Liners</i>?  The MacArthur Fellows program is, at its heart, a philanthropic enterprise that borders on farce.  The story is not tragic or heroic, but comic. It is the tale of an unclothed emperor of the charitable world, an emperor now wishing to spread its influence and prestige through the mechanism of global taxation for the United Nations.

<center><h3>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</h3></center>

Regarding Robert Huberty's recent review of <i>The Legacy of Inherited Wealth: Interviews With Heirs</i>, we would like to correct an inaccurate impression that Mr. Huberty creates about The Inheritance Project.
<p>
Much of this review is to be commended. It astutely outlines the common emotional patterns which mar the lives of the heirs featured in our collection. It is, in fact, the careful analysis contained in the first part of the review which makes the reviewer's logical leap at the end so glaring.
<p>
From among the seventeen heirs included in this book, Mr. Huberty selects three who have supported what he calls "radical causes" in their charitable giving. He takes exception to their philanthropic choices, arguing that "heirs who contribute to radical causes that prevent the accumulation of wealth overcome the conditions that leave them feeling guilty. The resulting condition leaves everyone poorer."
<p>
Mr. Huberty is certainly entitled to his opinion about what constitutes good or bad philanthropy.  However, when he equates the choices some of our subjects have made with the goals and philosophy of our organization, he makes a leap which we find both mystifying and unethical. To accuse The Inheritance Project of "discouraging heirs from becoming true philanthropists" is to seriously misrepresent us. We do not espouse any particular approach to philanthropy. We believe that the simple act of sharing one's resources has both outer value as well as inner merit, the latter perhaps known only to the heart of the giver.
<p>
In writing this book, The Inheritance Project aimed to represent as many different experiences as possible. We interviewed more than forty heirs before we published the book, and each of them described a unique set of attitudes towards wealth and toward philanthropy. Some said they give to the traditional institutions valued by their parents, some favored grassroots causes, and some were too paralyzed to think about philanthropy at all.  We neither judge nor side with any one of them.
<p>
The Inheritance Project has put together presentations on philanthropy for a wide range of groups, from the Council on Foundations to the more progressive Impact Project. More than anything, we are interested in helping heirs to untangle their confusion about their wealth so that they can more effectively use it to benefit others. If that means, in Mr. Huberty's opinion, that we are discouraging heirs from true philanthropy we can only offer our humble apologies.<p>

In Foundation Watch (volume 1, number 5) it is reported that the Council on Foundations is an enthusiastic supporter of affirmative action.  But if that is the case, why do men outnumber women on their board of directors when women outnumber men in the general population?
<p>
More important, why are women and men chosen from elitist circles and not from the rank-and-file they claim to represent?  Because any group that dines on "pecan chicken mousse in bouchees" is not exactly known to associate with the Big Mac crowd. Is this not an example of classism at its worst?

And by the way, what are bouchees?

<center><h2>
Why Did a Reclusive Widow Give the Washington Opera Eighteen Million Dollars?
</h2></center>
<center><h3>by Shayna Cook</h3></center>
<p>
Betty Brown Casey surprised the nation's capital last March when she donated eighteen million dollars to buy the Woodward and Lothrop department store.  Casey made a gift of the magnificent downtown flagship of the now-bankrupt chain so that the building could be transformed into a world class Opera House by the year 2000.  Mrs. Casey attends the Opera regularly, and her hope is that the new facility will provide both "a world-class opera house in the nation's capital" and "a center for the musical arts that will be available to literally thousands of children in this community,"  according to an Opera spokeswoman. The new facility will seat 2,100 in its main theater and include offices, a rooftop restaurant, and space for its educational programs.  Livingston Biddle, President Carter's Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts and longtime Opera Board member, praised Casey's move, describing the arts patron as "dedicated, committed to excellence in the arts, tenacious and bold."  Her lawyer Brendan Sullivan, who represented Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair, says Mrs. Casey is "an extraordinary woman who possesses a strong character and an exceedingly generous heart."
<p>
Charitable and cultural contributions have consistently been Casey's personal concerns.  Preferring privacy to acclaim, she had maintained a low profile for years while giving millions to various charities in the Washington, D.C.  metropolitan area.  Her timing has been perfect. World-renowned tenor Placido Domingo was delighted to declare on his first day as Artistic Director, "It's really, really tremendous.  It is a wonderful decision and a great day for the Washington Opera."   Now the Opera will have to raise $100 million to complete the facility and chances look very good indeed. Attendance has averaged 98 percent over the last eleven seasons, and the Opera receives $4 million in private contributions annually from friends all around the world who have spent time in diplomatic assignments.  With the addition of Domingo (one of PBS's "Three Tenors") to the cast, demand for tickets has been unprecedented.  Domingo's singing, acting, and conducting make him "a true renaissance man in music," says Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper. Newsweek called him "the King of Opera." Domingo has Opera in his blood. As a child he worked for his parents' opera  company in Mexico City.
<p>
This fall the star tenor will star in the Washington Opera's season opener: Antonio Carlos Gomes' Il Guarany, an Indian extravaganza directed by German film dirctor Werner Herzog (Aguirre, Wrath of God).  Excited at the new management and new repertorie, the Opera's education director Debra Blount declares Domingo "is the best ambassador for opera there is."  In a recent appearance on Conan O'Brien's late night television show, the enthusiastic and personable Domingo persuaded the entire studio audience to sing along with him.
<p>
Casey's own life has been in many ways as dramatic as one of Domingo's productions.  In 1955 she married Eugene B. Casey, a prominent New Deal Democrat who worked for Presidents Roosevelt and Truman and at one time owned more real estate than anyone in the United States. Surely she suffered from reminders that her husband went to jail for tax-evasion in 1946 (and was pardoned by President Truman in 1951). After her husband's death in 1986,  Casey endured her own personal ordeals, including a bomb planted in her Mercedes in 1990 as an attempt on her life and a bitter 1993 lawsuit from ten of her late husband's grandchildren from previous marriages over her inheritance.
<p>
Despite the Opera's obvious successes, it had to overcome opposition from the notoriously difficult D.C. government.  The city's Zoning Commission had restricted the use of the Woodies building to retail in order to generate tax revenues for the city.  Attracting business was a worthy objective, but two other department store buildings still remained empty  and downtown. One commissioner, Howard Croft,  protested the interjection of culture into a panhandler-ridden area of the city: "Art for whom? . . . Downtown [should be] for all the people who live in the metropolitan area."  Luckily for the Opera, Croft was defeated by a vote of 4 to 1 on July 1 when the Commission met and approved the building renovation. Officials at the Opera are quick to rebut Croft's contention that opera is elitist.  Opera deals with universal human themes of passion and suffering, and "every culture enjoys music and storytelling," spokeswoman Suzanne Stephens points out.  The field of Opera rewards musical and dramatic talents regardless of financial background.  In the words of executive director Patricia L. Mossel, opera "cuts across all economic and age barriers."  The Washington Opera makes its performances accessible through English surtitles and extensive community outreach programs.  Currently such programs reach 20,000 students in D.C., Virginia, and Maryland annually.With the new facility more students will be able to participate in Opera programs: from trying on costumes and waving a conductor's baton to meeting the performers and attending a performance.  On the verge of bankruptcy, DC schools are eliminating music and arts from their curriculum.  So, the Opera sends performers and docents to some of the district's poorest schools.  According to Blount, "the only negative comments we get from the children is that they wanted to see more."
<p>
Exposure to opera at such a yound age increases the odds that some of the children will grow to be opera fans.  Domingo contends that he can see young people in the audience from the stage, and is constantly searching for young potential artists: he sponsors a singing competition in Mexico City that seeks out fresh talent.  Domingo, described by Opera insiders as "the most accessible human being," is determined to keep the Washington Opera open to its DC neighbors.  He will personally make sure that tickets are distributed to the underprivileged.
<p>
And there is sure to be demand because in America today, the art form is thriving.  "There is an explosion of opera in the United States," Stephens says.  She vows that any non-fan can be converted, no matter how old they are: "My answer to them is to find the right opera."  And if the sell-out crowds provide any evidence, the Washington Opera has put on "the right opera" for many people.  The Opera operates purely though popular appeal to individual ticketholders and donors.  Unlike some European houses, the Washington Opera does not depend on public funds. It receives no subsidy from any state agency, and a $72,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts accounts for merely .017 percent of total contributed revenue.  The example of the Washington Opera has given the lie to  NEA lobbyists who claim cutting federal funding of the arts will undermine the survival of art itself.  According to Stephens, "The NEA has never been a large percentage of our budget . . .we have learned to go about surviving and thriving without it."  Thanks to the sterling example of Betty Brown Casey and the artistic brilliance of  Placido Domingo, the Washington Opera will do its part to help the nation's capital survive and thrive as well.

<font size=+1><b><i>June 1996</i></b></font>
<H2>Why did a nice young composer <br>like Frederick Stocken<br> become the British musical establishment's<br> hated heckler?</H2>
<H3>by Laurence Jarvik</H3>
<p>
<a href="#lament">Lament for Bosnia went to the top of the charts...</a><br>
<a href="#irk">In March, 1994, irked at the realization...</a><br>
<a href="#press">The press was not nice to Stocken.</a><br>
<a href="#future">What does the future hold?</a><br>
<p>
Frederick Stocken calls himself "Britain's most backward-looking composer."  Born in 1967, Organ Scholar at Cambridge University's St. Catherine's College and a graduate of Chetham's School of 
Music, the prize-winning Fellow of the Royal College of Organists is a composer of  organ works, songs, 
wood quintets, string quartets, an oratorio, and a violin concerto.  Stocken is best-known for his lush string 
composition Lament for Bosnia (Chatsworth CD, 1993).  A private commission by wealthy English arts 
patron Todd Longstaffe-Gowan, the piece was recorded by The Strings of the New Queen's Hall Orchestra 
under the direction of John Lubbock, using gut strings instead of metal to allow for a greater warmth of 
tone. The recording session took place at EMI's  Abbey Road studios made famous by The Beatles. 
<p>
Soon he was dubbed "one of the most promising talents of his generation" by Malcolm Williamson, Master of the Queen's Musick. Williamson said of Stocken's composition, "As music becomes more 
complex and unintelligible, it is refreshing to find a composer who is producing music which is clear, 
profound, free-flowing, and superbly composed."  Stocken said that he composed the Lament "not only for 
artistic reasons, but also to raise money for the victims." Stocken and his publisher had arranged for a 
portion of the sales to go directly to "Feed the Children," a British charity which has been aiding refugee 
families in the former Yugoslavia since 1992. In this effort, Stocken combined a commitment to traditional 
British romanticism in the manner of Ralph Vaughn Williams with his own personal belief in private 
charity and private support for the arts. The Evening Standard praised Stocken fulsomely, declaring,  "At 
last a young English composer has chosen to write accessible, beautiful music which is unashamedly 
passionate and melodic."  The Spectator music critic declared, "It is music which makes me believe that a 
new Sibelius or a new Elgar has been born. Try it."

on a double bill with Samuel Barber's Adagio for String Orchestra, and the set became the number one best selling CD in London's Tower Records by early 1994. Shortly 
thereafter, Stocken began work on a violin concerto, which he planned to dedicate to Margaret Thatcher.  
But there were some clouds on Stocken's horizon. Stocken had discovered composers who wrote 
hummable melodies are black-balled by the British musical establishment. He learned this lesson the hard 
way, after he was rejected by the Royal Academy of Music with the comment: "We do not use key 
signatures here at the Academy." Stocken later acidly retorted such a remark was "equivalent to being 
turned down by an art college with the comment: 'We do not use perspective here at the Slade.'"Denied 
acceptance by the official guardians of his chosen field, Stocken plotted his next move.
<P>
<a name="irk"></a>
<CENTER><H3>In March, 1994, irked at the realization...</H3></CENTER>
that the very musical competitors  who had black-balled him enjoyed substantial taxpayer subsidies through the BBC and the Arts Council for what he considered atonal "modernist plink-plonk," 
Stocken placed a classified advertisement in The Spectator. It gave his home telephone number and read: 
"THE HECKLERS: Too afraid to boo at Modern Music? Join The Hecklers and provoke change." The 
target was an April 14, 1996 performance of Sir Harrison Birtwistle's 1989 opera Gawain. Birtwistle is the 
most prominent living composer in Britain, knighted by the Queen and recipient of an estimated $350,000 
in annual support from British institutions. <p>
Stocken took on this pillar of the musical establishment directly, 
declaring his compositional efforts to be "sonic sewage." Stocken then published a manifesto in The 
Evening Standard announcing "this evening, The Hecklers will rise to their feet, a militia for melody" as 
Birtwistle's opera Gawain "squeaks and splutters to a close at the Royal Opera House."  The event, Stocken 
told Culture Watch, "was a very feeble protest." With about two dozen colleagues, he politely waited until 
the performance had ended, stood up, and booed. The small group of protesters sitting in the top balcony 
were overwhelmed by the standing ovation the opera received from the cream of British society in the 
stalls, the cheering led by no less a personage than the chairman of the British Arts Council himself, Lord 
Gowrie.
<P>
<a name="press"></a>
<CENTER><H3>The press was not nice to Stocken. </H3></CENTER>
He was damned as a "Thatcherite," called a "self-appointed cultural policeman," 
and his group labelled "a group of young fogeys" by Classical Music, which 
concluded in an editorial that "Mr. Stocken and his bunch of halitosis-ridden hoorays are not the first [to 
protest concerts]...it was very popular with the Nazis." On May 2nd The Times condemned Stocken and his 
Hecklers as "The Red Guards of Taste" and declared "Sir Harrison...is the finest modern British composer, 
some would say of all time..." Stocken's support was slight:  a column by Miranda Jackson in Classical 
Music, an elliptical comment by Prince Charles in favor of melody, an editorial in the Journal of the 
Institute of Economic Affairs, and an article in the Sydney Morning Herald pointing out that Australians 
know that Italians boo opera all the time were all he could show in his defense. Perhaps wary of a 
controversy on unfamiliar terrain, Thatcher declined to attend the upcoming premiere of her concerto and 
Stocken has removed her name. (However,  Minister for National Heritage Virginia Bottomley will attend.) 
<p>
Yet despite the establishment's disapproval, Stocken's protest has struck a chord with the music-going 
public. British concertgoers now boo modernist performances. In August, 1995 they booed Birtwistle's 
Panic when the BBC orchestra performed it at the Proms in Royal Albert Hall. Just this April, they booed a 
modernist staging of Verdi's Nabucco -- portraying the Babylonian captivity in Auschwitz -- at the Royal 
Opera House, an incident reported on the front page of The Times. Stocken did not in attend. Instead he 
was at work on a new composition, a Mass. Stocken recently converted to Roman Catholicism at the 
Brompton Oratory where his Mass will be performed. Stocken says he wishes to dedicate his music "to the 
service of the Church" and to private patrons.  
<P>
<a name="future"></a>
<CENTER><H3>What does the future hold?</H3></CENTER>
As Washington Post music critic Tim Page told Culture Watch when asked about the Birtwistle vs. Stocken debate, "If this guy just manages to stick 
around, he'll probably be one of the old fogeys himself, someday."

<p>
Kathleen Teltsch, who covered the philanthropy beat for The New York Times from 1979 to 1994, was 
interviewed upon her retirement by a writer for Foundation News and Commentary, a publication of the 
Council on Foundations.  She told the following story about her initiation into the world of nonprofit 
organizations. <p>
	Herb West, then president of the New York Community Trust, welcomed Teltsch's new 
assignment and took her to lunch, giving Teltsch what she considered "practical, much-needed advice."  
The advice was also in the form of a story.  It concerned the experienced foundation hand who greeted a 
young executive to his first foundation job by telling him, "Welcome to the field: you'll never eat a bad 
meal or hear an honest word." <p>
	Such is the reputation of philanthropy as understood by a correspondent of the most prestigious 
American daily newspaper.  And perhaps no organization better embodies the "field" than the Council on 
Foundations, the premier organization in American philanthropy.  Headquartered in Washington, DC, the 
Council serves over 1500 grantmaking foundations in the U.S. and abroad, helping them learn from one 
another and representing their interests to Congress and the agencies of government.  The grantmakers who 
are members of the Council hold an estimated $100 billion in assets. <p>
	Last month, the Council held its annual convention in Atlanta.  It was called "Philanthropy, 
Democracy, Participation: Work in Progress" and it met from April 22nd through April 24th at the Atlanta 
Marriott Marquis hotel.  The Marriott, a John Portman-designed 1671-room behemoth whose pod-like 
glass-enclosed express elevators speed guests through a 50-story indoor atrium, is home to the city's largest 
hotel ballroom (28,826 square feet).  And it was filled to the rafters when former President Jimmy Carter 
graced the convention's opening ceremonies, speaking to what Atlanta Constitution writer Dan Hulbert 
called "deep pockets." <p>
	No shrinking violent, Carter took the opportunity to openly pitch programs, including the troubled 
"Atlanta Project" supported, Carter mentioned, by Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service, Mariott Hotels, and 
Delta Airlines, among others. Carter also plugged the more successful, religiously-inspired Habitat for 
Humanity, and the Task Force on Disease Eradication, which with help from Precision Fabrics in 
Roanoake, Virginia  has indeed helped successfully eliminate guinea worm disease. He also put in a word 
for "Erasing the Stigma of Mental Illness," a favorite cause of former First Lady Rosalyn Carter.<p>
	Carter concluded, "I hope in the next few days you will consider a few of the things I've said and 
how we, together, can go on to greater things." It was an effective fundraising speech, and received 
tumultous applause. <p>
<P>
<a name="bread"></a>
<CENTER><H3>BREAD AND CIRCUSES</H3></CENTER>
Foundation Watch was there, too, and found Teltsch's characterization of philanthropic discourse - and diet - to be entirely 
accurate.  The convention's opening ceremonies were organized by the Host Committee for the 1996 
Olympics. The food, described by Constitution writer Hulbert as "a buffet wonderland," was indeed 
plentiful and delicious.  It was organized around the theme, "A Taste of the South."  [See box on page four..]  Foundation executives were greeted by Chinese Lion Dancers and the Hotlanta Dixieland Jazz 
Band as they mingled at the bar exchanging business cards.  Once seated at dinner, they were entertained 
by a program meant for "an influential cadre of out-of-towners" and intended to "create future funding 
opportunities for Atlanta arts groups," according to the Constitution.<p>
	The evening's entertainment was predictably multicultural and politically correct.  Its deficiencies 
in taste would foreshadow the Council's vision of philanthropy, one which would unfold during the 
subsequent days' conference sessions.
<p>        Instead of high culture, Council guests were subjected to high modernism:  the Atlanta Ballet 
performed "Read My Hips," an apparent allusion to President Bush's ill-fated promise to the electorate.  
The number featured dancers clad in black leotards engaged in what appeared to be Greco-Roman 
wrestling choreographed to a techno-pop beat. 
<p>         Mercifully, the duo of Cephas and Wiggins, Piedmont blues musicians, followed for a musical 
interlude.  They did a creditable job getting the notably rythmically-challenged crowd in a festive mood.  
Unfortunately, they were followed by some dreadful local theatre groups, including the "Cotton Patch 
Gospel" which made fun of Baptists.    
<p>        A most remarkable number was then performed by South Africa's Soweto Street Beat Dance 
Company.  "Upiyane" featured male dancers in African masks and loincloths leaping to drum beats.  After 
the techno-pop of the predominantly white Atlanta Ballet, the number provoked uneasy memories of the 
Jim Crow South among some in the audience, recollecting the delight white audiences once took in 
displays of black athleticism and imagined primitivism.  That the sterotypical number was imported from 
the country to which former Council on Foundations president James Joseph had been posted as American 
Ambassador made its selection seem ironic for the capital of the "New South."
<p>        Indeed, had the program organizers not possessed impeccable liberal credentials, the race-
consciousness of the evening's entertainment might have incited more than grumbles and muttering.
<P>
<a name="racial"></a>
<CENTER><H3>THE RACIAL POLITICS OF PHILANTHROPY</H3></CENTER>
What followed over the next several days in Atlanta had a similar tone and texture.  The lectures, panel 
discussions and symposia sponsored by the Council on Foundations seemed bent on purifying the work of 
philanthropy through ever more refined racial filters.  Modern philanthropy is troubled by appearances and 
anxious to ward off misunderstandings that it does much to create.  Hence, no act of generosity is so simple 
that it may not appear to be racially patronizing.  No call for assistance so heartfelt that it may not strike 
some as arrogant.<p>
	For instance, a panel discussion "exploring issues of democracy and civil life and the elements of 
effective civic participation" followed President Carter's speech. [For more on this topic, see Foundation 
Watch vol.I, no.1, "PBS's National Issues Convention."]  This was chaired by Roger Wilkins, who keeps 
the flame of the Great Society lit from a professorial sinecure at George Mason University.  The panel 
discussants were Elaine Jones, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; Raul Yzaguirre, president of 
the National Council of La Raza; Patsy Mink, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from 
Hawaii; William Kristol, editor of  The Weekly Standard; Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Hudson 
Institute; and gaiashkibos, a "Consultant and Technical Advisor to Tribal Governments" who is a "Member 
of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians" from Couderay, Wisconsin and 
who begged the audience not to think of Indians as rich because many tribes are entitled to many billions 
of dollars in legalized gambling revenues.
<p>        Wilkins' introduction of the panelists began with pointed remarks linking "white males" to 
conservative politics.  Of course, there are Black, Hispanic and Asian conservatives just as there are white 
male liberals.  But Wilkins was content to indulge in stereotyping, and then allowed other panelists to make 
casually disparaging remarks about the political proclivities of white males. 
<p>        The racial routine was played out in other panels at the Council on Foundations convention.  
White males were selected to represent the voice of conservatism.  They included Father Richard John 
Neuhaus, founder of the journal First Things and John Von Kannon, a vice president and treasurer of The 
Heritage Foundation. The message was clear: white male conservatives were the ruling class, reminders of 
the realm of privilege that foundations were mobilized to fight.  As such they might occasionally be on 
display, but they were excluded from the real political work of the convention. 
<p>        Nuts-and-bolts issues such as voter registration, dealing with the media, and responding to the 
"Istook Amendment," the proposal by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) to prohibit advocacy by federal grantees, 
were handled in more action-oriented sessions.  Members of OMB Watch, the Advocacy Institute, the 
Center for Public Integrity and other liberal advocacy groups used these sessions to organize their forces 
and plan strategies.  This was particularly true for the pre-conference sessions of the so-called "affinity 
groups."  [See box on the California Civil Rights Initiative on page 6]. 
<p>        If the conference program had featured Dinesh D'Souza, Christina Sommers or Thomas Sowell it 
might have ignited real fireworks.  But the conference organizers preferred a dialogue of the deaf.  When 
Hudson's Leslie Lenkowsky told Mark Rosenman of the radical Union Institute that private grantmakers 
should compensate for spending cuts in federal programs, the audience responded with silence.  However, 
Rosenman's defense of the status quo was praised and his remarks were echoed by many in the audience, 
which included Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark.  [See Foundation Watch vol.1, no.5. 
"The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism" for more.]

<CENTER><H3>NOT TRUE BELIEVERS, JUST BUREAUCRATS</H3></CENTER>
Reflecting on his convention experience, WeeklyStandardeditor William Kristol told Foundation Watch,  
"It was in a certain way a comedy of philanthropic correctness. I was confirmed in my sense that liberalism 
was exhausted, that they're not true believers - they're just bureaucrats."
<p>        "This is good news and bad news," he added.  "They don't have much of an answer when you ask: 
'Why don't you judge by results?'  But the institutional momentum is hard to penetrate."
<p>        Heritage's John Von Kannon was struck by the way the members of the Council on Foundation's 
mispronounced the name Istook.  "They called him "Ish-took."  They pronounced the name like a Nazi war 
criminal."  However, Von Kannon says he was pleased to speak to the convention.  "I went up to 
[moderator] Judy Woodruff and said, "I want to thank you for not attaching an ideological label to The 
Heritage Foundation."  I even met a man who came up to me afterwards, saying he was delighted to find 
another conservative there."
<p>        The stultifying and politically correct nature of the Council on Foundations has been often noted.   
Dr. Marvin Olasky, author of The Tragedy of American Compassion, has published two scathing analyses 
of the Council on Foundations for Capital Research Center.  A 1985 monograph in Capital's Studies in 
Philanthropy series concluded that "Council leaders over the years have been consistently liberal, and the 
programs they have informally advanced have been consistent with that ideology."  Referring to the 
Council's fear of isolated and un-networked philanthropy by eccentric millionaires, Olasky observed, 
"There are worse things than Lone Ranger foundations - one is a nonprofit octopus." 
<p>        Eight years later Olasky revisited the Council in Philanthropically Correct: The Story of the 
Council on Foundations, the fourteenth monograph in the Capital series. Attending the national conference, 
which was held in Chicago, Olasky interviewed a number of Council members and officials.  His 
conclusion became even more bleak:  "The Council on Foundations' utopian search for perfect systems 
derives from hatred of man as he is.  And this is not philanthropy at all."
<p>        And in 1995 The New Republic sent writer David Samuels to cover the Council on Foundations 
annual convention in San Francisco.  His lengthy article, The Failure of American Foundations: 
Philanthropical Correctness, recalled Olasky's descriptions.  Said Samuels, "To wander the halls of the 
council-sponsored conference in San Francisco is to see the cartoon pages of William Bennett and Dinesh 
D'Souza brought spectacularly to life...A startling shift in foundation funding has occurred, away from 
research and toward the support of advocacy groups and the kinds of social service programs best 
accomplished by government and private charity."  In other words, the Council on Foundations was a Pied 
Piper leading philanthropists away from philanthropy.  
<P>
<a name="blood"></a>
<CENTER><H3>NEW BLOOD, SUBTLE CHANGES</H3></CENTER>
Samuels' essay was indicative of the new critical attitude that the press and Congress were taking toward 
philanthropy. It was one of a number of developments which had a measurable effect on the Council on 
Foundations. 
<p>        The article had appeared just as Congress began debating the "Istook Amendment," the proposal 
to insure that government grants to nonprofit organizations did not end up indirectly subsidizing political 
activities.  That amendment, opposed by the Council on Foundations, when combined with The New 
Republic piece, and scandals surrounding the United Way and New Era Foundation,  had far-reaching 
consequences.
<p>        Veteran Council president James Joseph, a Yale-educated minister in the United Church of Christ, 
resigned in 1995 after fourteen years in office to take a Clinton appointment as ambassador to South 
Africa.  He was followed in retirement this year by Council board chair Marjorie Craig Benton, the wife of 
Benton Foundation president Charles Benton and a trustee of the leftist Bernard Van Leer Foundation of 
the Netherlands.  The Van Leer Foundation  has funded Israeli organizers of "Peace Now" demonstrations 
(as well as Israeli peace advocates who urge Jews to "forget" the Holocaust).
<p>
Those replacing Joseph and Benton seem to be politically better connected and more savvy about 
what a Republican Congress and a "triangulating" President will expect from the nonprofit sector.  Yet 
despite their mainstream credentials and careful acknowledgement of a new political climate, Skip Rhodes 
and Dorothy Ridings continue to articulate a liberal vision of philanthropy's purpose.
<p>
The incoming chairman of the Council on Foundations board was born and raised in Berkeley, 
California. Rhodes is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley.  He joined Chevron in 1959 and 
has served in a number of positions, including marketing, antitrust litigation, business planning, 
government affairs, and public affairs.  Since 1986 he has been manager of Chevron's $45 million annual 
corporate contributions program.  (It is rated 4.88 out of a possible 8 - a "gentleman's C" - by Austin Fulk 
in the most recent edition of Capital's annual directory, Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy.) 
<p>         Rhodes told Foundation Watch that Chevron maintains an affirmative action program, a smoke-
free workplace, a recycling program, and actively participates in the Ms. Foundation's annual "Take Your 
Daughter To Work Day."  He added that the company was "considering" adding a "Take Your Son To 
Work Day" but had not considered a co-educational experience.
<p>        Rhodes argues that his chairmanship of the Council on Foundations "shows the inclusiveness plus 
the plurality of the membership."  He was on the board of directors only three years before being elected to 
the chairmanship this year. Rhodes took the job "because it was an opportunity to help the sector and to 
help my company."  Mixing with many foundation officials enables Rhodes to "network" and to "learn 
how others do it."  He says the activity of "sharing best practices" is a "win-win situation."  It will "expand 
my education."  
<p>        Rhodes told Foundation Watch that he hopes to rebut the anti-corporate feeling of some 
foundation officers, and he expressed pleasure that President Carter in his address had praised American 
business for its philanthropy.  Carter had applauded DuPont, which provided special filters at no cost to 
eliminate water-borne parasites such as the guinea worm in the Third World. The Chevron executive noted 
that as the first corporate officer in a decade to head the Council, he represented a minority group - 
corporate America - which accounted for only ten or twelve percent of its membership. He said he is 
grateful for the opportunity, but did not know if fears of Congressional action and the controversy over 
politically correct philanthropy were a factor in his selection.

<CENTER><H3>RIDINGS TO THE RESCUE</H3></CENTER>
Replacing James Joseph as president on February 5th was Dorothy S. Ridings, the editor of  Knight-
Ridder's Bradenton [FL] Herald.  Born in Charleston, West Virginia in 1939, Ridings is married to a 
businessman, Donald J. Ridings, and is the mother of two.  She earned journalism degrees from 
Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism and the University of North Carolina.  Ridings has been 
affiliated either as a board member or consultant with four major foundations - the Ford, Benton, Mary 
Reynolds Babcock, and John S. and James L. Knight Foundations.  
<p>        Most importantly, Ridings was president of the League of Women Voters and chair of its 
501(c)(3) Education Fund from 1982-86.  Proclaiming itself nonpartisan, especially when it seeks sole 
sponsorship of the presidential debates, the League spends about $5 million annually promoting liberal 
positions on policy issues under the guise of good government.  Described in 1992 as "just another liberal 
special interest group" by The Wall Street Journal, the League has opposed term limits and school choice, 
and supported gun control and regulatory mandates.  In 1994 it joined former House Speaker Thomas 
Foley in a legal challenge to a term limits measure that was approved by Washington state voters.  The 
action was a factor in Foley's defeat.
<p>        Ridings has promised to make the Council more open and accountable.  Her conference keynote 
address urged grantmakers to be more forthright about their activities and more accessible to the press.  
Why has she made this her goal?
<p>        "The perception was that organized philanthropy was an elitist activity," Ridings told Foundation 
Watch.  "I think a lot of grantmakers have not been media savvy and have been less than forthcoming for 
no reason other than they don't know what to do." 
<p>        The former newspaper executive confesses that some foundation leaders have not welcomed 
opportunities to explain their actions to the larger public. "There are those who say, 'That's not for us.' for 
reasons of family wealth or personal safety, or not wanting to be self-aggrandizing."  But Ridings seeks to 
reassure grantmakers that she is "not saying we all have to march to the same drummer."  Rather, she 
argues, "We ought to talk about what we do.  And the people whose work we fund ought to talk about what 
they do. We really have an obligation to help our grantees tell their story better."
<p>        Asked if a policy of openness, like Gorbachev's perestroika might not bring with it the risk of 
public disapproval, Ridings was confident.  She told Foundation Watch, "I'm a real believer in being open 
to people. It's more risky that way but in the long run it serves you better.  We're in a public business and 
we say we operate under the public trust."
<p>        Ridings says she believes the Istook amendment is a "symptom" of the "overall climate of 
distrust" surrounding philanthropy.  She hopes the Council can "become catalysts for a more open, 
encompassing public debate" about the purposes and methods of philanthropy.  "I believe debate and 
discussion educates and challenges us," she said.  Although she has a "quibble" whether her attraction to 
argument comes from a Southern sensibility, Ridings asserts that, unlike Yankees, Southerners have "never 
been very secretive" and have been "open about prejudices."  Some of this she attributes to a "strong caring 
for other people."
<p>        However, it is in her definition of caring for others that Ridings discloses the attitudes that made 
her palatable to those who named her Council on Foundations president.  Ridings takes strong exception to 
those who would limit charitable contributions to direct services to the needy, and she makes a strong case 
for the importance of advocacy activities.  "One of the reasons we have public charities is to advocate on 
behalf of the powerless," she told Foundation Watch.  "Charity is not just providing services.  A very 
important part is advocating on the part of those for whom you are providing the services."
<p>        "This is not a Lady Bountiful era of charity.  It is not food baskets and blanket distribution.  It is 
not just one thing.  You ought to be able to go down to the city council and say there: 'Charity cannot fill in 
all the gaps.'"
<P>
<a name="infoage"></a>
<CENTER><H3>PHILANTHROPY IN THE INFORMATION AGE</H3></CENTER>
A highlight of the conference was the presentation of the Wilmer Shields Rich Awards for Excellence in 
Communications.  At this grand ceremony in the grand ballroom, the Council on Foundations awarded 
prizes for best annual reports and newsletters, special reports and magazines, public information 
campaigns, published guidelines and World Wide Web homepages.  So that all might have some share of 
glory, awards were made in varying categories: for community foundations, corporate grantmakers, family 
foundations, and private foundations.  Similarly, the size of the foundation was acknowledged under $15 
million, over $15 million, over $25 million as well as the member's purpose public grantmaker or 
operating nonprofit.  
<p>        A beautiful brochure listed Gold, Silver, and Bronze award recipients.  All told, there were more 
than one hundred awards distributed for what were essentially achievements in public relations.
<p>        Each year the Council on Foundations also bestows the Robert W. Scrivner Award on a 
grantmaker "making a critical difference in a creative way"  and its Distinguished Grantmaker Award "to 
honor an individual whose long service and long-term commitment have helped elevate standards in the 
field."
<p>        Oddly, the Council has no award for the most cost-effective grants program that has delivered 
lives from welfare dependency, helped substance abusers overcome their addictions, placed abandoned 
children in loving homes, helped the handicapped, or found cures for sickness.  In other words, awards for 
actually doing good.
<p>        Ridings hesitated when Foundation Watch asked her if the Council might not institute awards of 
this sort.  "Maybe we ought to take a broader look at providing services," she said.  "But looking at awards 
programs, I'm not high on adding up more awards."  
<p>        When asked why the annual convention did not place as much emphasis on serving people 
directly as on formulating strategies for advocacy, Ridings responded, "The members make the program." 
<p>        The Council on Foundations does not need more public relations awards, nor does it require more 
rhetorical promises of "openness" or "accountability." Philanthropy's problems are not public relations 
problems, they are real ones.
<p>        What the Council needs to do is to reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of 
philanthropy.  It ought to recognize what Bradley Foundation President Michael Joyce has called "a deep 
sense of disappointment, dismay, even shame, at the spectacle of the once-proud, optimistic, and 
forward-looking American charitable sector suddenly going AWOL at the precise moment the American 
public had turned to it with high expectations and hopes."
<p>        Unfortunately, Dorothy Ridings' declaration that "this is not a Lady Bountiful era of charity" gives 
little solace to those who were looking to her for a new era of leadership at the Council on Foundations.
<p>        Perhaps she and Skip Rhodes might reconsider their priorities  -- and put delivery of charitable 
services to the truly needy and the strengthening of traditional charitable institutions such as churches, 
orphanages, hospitals, and asylums at the top of their list.

<center><h3>COUNCIL AND AFFINITY GROUPS HOLD STRATEGY <br>SESSION TO FIGHT CCRI BALLOT 
MEASURE: <br>PLANNING SESSION MINUTES EXPOSE MULTIMILLION<br> DOLLAR FOUNDATION 
PUSH THIS  YEAR</center></h3>
<p>        Among the strategy sessions at the Council on Foundations event in Atlanta was one on fighting 
affirmative action, specifically the California Civil Rights Initiative scheduled for the November ballot.  
<p>        A copy of the minutes of the "joint affinity group meeting" on April 21st has been obtained by 
Foundation Watch. Called "Affirmative Action: What's at Stake," the action-oriented session was 
sponsored by Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy; the Association of Black Foundation 
Executives; Hispanics in Philanthropy; the National Network of Grantmakers; Woman & Philanthropy, 
Women's Funding Network; the Working Group on Funding Lesbian and Gay Issues and the Council on 
Foundations,   "in cooperation with" the Council on Foundations and the Committee on Inclusiveness.<p>
<DD>    Some verbatim excerpts follow: 
<p>"This is an example of collaboration at its best, the mother of all collaborations,"stated Dot 
Ridings, the new president of the Council on Foundations, welcoming a large audience to an historic 
collaborative meeting of eight affinity groups in philanthropy.
<p>"I am a beneficiary of Affirmative Action, in spirit if not in letter. I am out today as a beneficiary, 
and I will do all I can not to retreat," asserted Cynthia Carey Grant, steering committee member, part of the 
statewide coalition "No on CCRI" - the so-called California Civil Rights Initiative on the ballot in 
November.
<p>        Bonnie Erbe, host of the PBS news magazine "To the Contrary" outlined the context in which the 
current attacks on affirmative action are occuring. She targed the "freelance economy" in which good jobs 
are lost, replaced by contract and contingent jobs with no benefits.
<p>        "At stake is not only affirmative action, but our collective vision for the year 2000," said [Karen] 
Narasaki [executive director of the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium]. "Will we go back to the 
1950's or embrace the globalization of culture an economy and make it a positive force for change?"
<p>Behind the attack on affirmative action is a broad attack on women by the radical right, said Carey 
Grant. Affirmative action is only one item on their agenda. Who do they oppose? Not the extreme left, but 
moderates, centrists, even conservatives - anyone who wants to promote the welfare of the majority of the 
people.
<p>        Attacks on affirmative action always peak before elections. This is not a socially driven issues, but 
a political issue, said Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights 
Under Law and head of the national consortium called Americans for a Fair Chance.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The Strategies:</H3></CENTER>
	<B>Come together. </B>The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is coordinating the legislative 
strategy. Asian Americans and women are important in the stuggle not to be divided (sic).
<p>        <B>Appeal to white women. </B>Surveys and focus groups indicate the more they learn about affirmative 
action, the more they support it. Equal Rights Advocates.
<p>       <B> Increase public educations.</B> Americans respond to information. Following public service ads 
conducted by Americans for a Fair Chance (a consortium of civil rights and women's rights groups in 
support of affirmative action), support among white men increased four percent; among white women it 
increased 13 percent.
<p>        <B>Hire the marketing professionals</B> - don't leave the ads to lawyers!
<p>        <B>Raise voter turnout</B>, especially minority and immigrant populations. Go to citizen classes, 
swearing in ceremonies. Support youth actions.
<p>        <B>Identify supporters in the business community.</B> Get your business allies to speak out. Citizens 
Commission on Civil Rights has documented business support on video.
<p>        <B>Support litigation</B> - court decisions are news items and thus public education tools.
<p>       <B> Show the opposition how they have benefitted.</B> Pull up our talented younger people of color; 
diversity is in the lower ranks.
<p>        <B>Use consumer power.</B> Women spend 80 cents of every consumer dollar.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The challenge:</H3></CENTER>
	The right has coopted the dialogue. How can we get back in the discussion with a unified voice? 
Bonnie Erbe.
<p>        We  need to change the debate from who gains, who loses, to what society as a whole has gained 
and what it will lose. Karen Narasaki.
<p>        Tony Romero, program officer at the Ford Foundation agreed. Grantmakers fear that IRS 
restrictions do not allow them to defend affirmative action, he said; our staff attorneys have assured us we 
can. This a moral issue for funders he added - "we need to put our grant dollars where our mouths are."
	
<p>        According to Fall/Winter 1995 Women & Philanthropy News, an "affinity group" publication, the 
Ford foundation has awarded $1.4 million to 12 organizations to support affirmative action. Other 
foundations "actively funding affirmative action intiatives" are the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie 
Croporation of New York and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation which have granted hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law for the National Affirmative 
Action Consortium.

<center><h3>LESSONS FROM THE FALL:<br> FOUNDATIONS AND THE CRISIS IN ARTS FUNDING<br>
BY ROBERT HUBERTY</center></h3>
<P>
	Art Lessons: Learning for the Rise and Fall of Public Arts Funding by Alice Goldfarb Marquis 
(Basic Books, 1996, paperback, 304 pages).
<P>
	The names Mapplethorpe and Serrano ignite passionate debate on the nature and purpose of art.  
Can we know when art is obscene and blasphemous?  Should art depict obscenity and blasphemy?  If it's 
obscene and blasphemous, is it art?  Should government officials try to answer these questions before they 
spend public funds on whatever art is?  Why should government fund works of art at all?  And, the 
ultimate liberal handwringer, is refusing to fund art censorship?  
<p>        Art Lessons, Alice Goldfarb Marquis' engaging and instructive history of U.S. public funding of 
the arts, manages to put these questions into an entertaining context.  Her deft and amusing narrative 
surveys forty years of shenanigans by politicians, bureaucrats and wealthy patrons who scheme to spend 
public and private money for the creation and consumption of what is for them a valuable commodity: 
more good art.  The debate which is now culminating in bitter protest over who is responsible for squalid 
public displays began innocently enough as an exercise in high-minded liberal - and Republican - 
philanthropy.  Indeed, by carefully describing how private philanthropy made public arts funding possible, 
Marquis' study implicates it in the scandals that have led to the NEA's downfall.
<p>        Marquis does not begin her tale in 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson signed legislation 
enacting the National Endowment for the Arts.  She starts in the dark ages of the late 1950s.  A time that 
most Americans remember as happy days was for intellectuals an "age of anxiety," a time when televised 
and commercial mass culture threatened the life of the mind.  It was also a time when worried big city 
mayors watched their tax base erode as the middle class fled to their T.V. sets in suburbia.  City fathers, 
desperate for a solution to urban decay, seemed to find one in the performing arts complex, the cultural 
equivalent of the shopping center.   
<p>        Art, music and theater, they reasoned, would attract tourists and new business, lure suburbanites 
back to town at night, and give senior citizens and juvenile delinquents something useful to do.  An 
uncontroversial social benefit, art was good public relations.  So private philanthropy came to the rescue, 
working in "partnership" with public agencies to create venues for art.  John D. Rockefeller III mobilized 
Manhattan's civic elite to plan fundraising for construction of Lincoln Center; President Eisenhower signed 
legislation donating federal land for what became the Kennedy Center; and Governor Nelson Rockefeller 
established the first state arts council.  
<p>        The art moguls in Marquis' telling hardly attempted to answer the question of what art is.  Largely 
ignorant or indifferent to aesthetic questions, they were more at ease developing social and economic 
justifications for art's sake.  And they positively jumped at opportunities to work on the comparatively easy 
problems of finding money for art and developing new ways to spend it.  
<p>    Much of Art Lessons is an almost farcical recounting of the bureaucratic consequences of public 
spending on the arts.  As the NEA budget surged from $5 million to $40 million from 1969 to 1973 under 
director Nancy Hanks, a Nixon appointee, and from $100 million to $165 million from 1975 to 1979 under 
Carter appointee Livingston Biddle, there was a boom in grant administrators, categories, and applications 
(27,000 by 1982). 
<p>        Everyone wanted to get in on the act.  Big and small states jockeyed for NEA money for their arts 
councils - whose purpose is to lobby for more NEA money.  The multi-billion dollar film industry lobbied 
for NEA funding for the American Film Institute.  Dance companies multiplied on the expectation of 
continuing grants, and every congressman lobbied for his district's symphony orchestras.  
<p>        Even commercially successful art found ways to tap the federal treasury.  Since jazz ensembles 
already had ticket-paying audiences, the NEA set up and funded a nonprofit whose purpose was to fund 
presenters of jazz concerts.  The NEA even added a musical theater grants program after NEA council 
member Hal Prince, a highly successful Broadway producer, complained that composers were forced to 
move to California to write for the movies to survive.  
<p>        To be sure, arts activities rapidly increased in the 1960s and 70s.  But the Ponzi scheme of more 
groups pursuing public and private grants was sure to collapse.  NEA supporters, not Jesse Helms, 
weakened the faltering agency's capacity to identify and reward artistic excellence by demanding more 
subsidies for ever more arts groups.   
<p>        One ironic lesson of public arts funding is that it has made nonprofit arts organizations more 
financially insecure.  Marquis astutely observes that artists have been tempted by foundation philanthropy 
and by the availability of NEA grant money to overextend themselves while neglecting money-making 
opportunities.  By becoming nonprofits, the prerequisite for public funding and a mark of status for 
foundation elites, artists have forsaken the main chance - the commercial marketplace.  
<p>        Despite new technologies, artists have been led to believe that the arts cannot be self-supporting 
because they cannot achieve economies of scale.  Living hand-to-mouth on $5000 grants, they take the 
risks while administrators of foundations, arts agencies and advocacy groups reap the reward. 
<p>        Last month NEA director Jane Alexander protested Congress' $99 million appropriation and asked 
for $136 million for the next fiscal year.  These inflation-ravaged figures are a pittance.  But they represent 
the agency's continuing effort to credential arts groups, attract political patronage, and steer private funds 
toward privileged favorites.  Art Lessons does not inspire confidence that the agency can credibly fulfill 
this role.              By contrast, private philanthropy gave an estimated $9.6 billion to the arts, 
culture and humanities in 1994 (7.5 percent of all philanthropy).  A reading of Alice Marquis' study 
suggests that its credibility is also at risk.

<CENTER><H3>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</H3></CENTER>
I read your story on the Rockefeller Foundation [vol.1, no.4] today.  While we at the Foundation do not deliberately "avoid the limelight" as 
you charge in your story, we did choose in this isolated case, not to respond favorably to your requests for 
interviews.
<p>        Your story has confirmed my initial judgement and that of others we consulted -- that we would 
not get accurate reporting of Rockefeller Foundation positions in your publication.
<p>        Any of your readers who are interested in receiving complete and accurate descriptions of our 
current funding priorities, including our support for arts and humanities worldwide, are encouraged to call 
or write us for a copy of our 1995 annual report. We can be reached on (212) 852-8414 or by writing the 
Communications Department, Rockefeller Foundation, 420 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10018.<p>

<P>
	We would be happy to correct any specific errors you might care to point out. We did find one 
mistake in the story after it went to press. Peggy Dulany is David Rockefeller's daughter, so the family does 
have a living presence on the foundation board -- even though the name of Rockefeller has disappeared.
<P>
	I was delighted recently to discover Foundation Watch.  As a one-time denizen of the City of 
Light, the issue [vol. 1, no. 2] devoted to the decline and fall of the American Center in Paris and the 
liquidation of its jazzy, spanking new building designed by Frank Gehry was especially appalling. 
<p>         It was also a riveting read.  Your post-mortem account represents lively, no-holds-barred cultural 
reportage of a sort seldom seen in the main-stream press - particularly where international matters are 
concerned.
	Your profile on the Rockefeller Foundation [vol. 1, no. 4] was equally revealing.  The common 
thread, of course, is cutting edge philanthropy run amuck, propelled by the best and the worst of intentions.  
The excesses you have detailed (and the actions of the players you have, dare I say, outed) can be blunted 
only by rigorous investigative pieces such as these.  I look forward to more of the same.

<h2><B><FONT SIZE=4>Welfare Reform in the States: Part II<BR>
</FONT></B></h2>
<p>

<i> This month we conclude our survey of state-level welfare reform
with articles by analysts from ten state think tanks.</i>
<p>
<a href="#cali">California: A Promising Reform Plan</a><br>
<a href="#ill">Illinois: Behind the Curve</a><br>
<a href="#iowa">Iowa: Investing in Families</a><br>
<a href="#penn">Pennsylvania: Changing Welfare by Requiring Work</a><br>

<a href="#nc">North Carolina: Untangling the Medicaid Mess</a><br>
<a href="#nev">Nevada: Private Alternatives to Welfare</a><br>
<a href="#ala">Alabama: Lessons from a School that Works</a><p>
 Sally C. Pipes and Katherine Post, president and policy fellow,
respectively, of the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute,
applaud a major welfare reform plan for California and highlight
two charities that offer effective alternatives to state welfare
programs.  By contrast, Joseph Bast, president of the Heartland
Institute in Palatine, Illinois, criticizes recent reforms, noting
that political leaders in Illinois seem uninterested in fundamental
change.
<P>
 Amy Frantz, research director at the Public Interest Institute
in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, and Peter S. Barwick, research associate
at the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania-based Commonwealth Foundation,
emphasize the importance of work requirements for welfare recipients.
 Barwick addresses three criticism often made against work-based
welfare reform while Frantz notes that nonprofit organizations
may help Iowa's needy through newly created Individual Development
Accounts.  This is also a feature of South Carolina's reform package,
discussed by Mike Hubbard, Senior Policy Analyst at the South
Carolina Policy Council Education Foundation in Columbia.
<P>
 Kelly McCutchen, executive director of the Atlanta-based Georgia
Public Policy Foundation, discusses recent reforms and notes the
importance of building public support for changes in Georgia's
welfare policy.  The significance of obtaining federal waivers
to achieve change in Ohio's welfare system is emphasized by Samuel
R. Staley and Douglas Hyne, vice president for research and research
assistant, respectively, of the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy
Solutions in Dayton.  John Hood, president of the Raleigh-based
John Locke Foundation, warns that Medicaid, the nation's most
expensive welfare program, must be overhauled before its costs
overwhelm both federal and state budgets.
<P>
 Finally, effective private alternatives to government welfare
programs are highlighted on pages 4 and 5.  Writing for the Reno-based
Nevada Policy Research Institute, State Senator Maurice E. Washington
describes three faith-based organizations that are helping the
needy achieve self-sufficiency.  Gary Palmer, executive director
of the Birmingham-based Alabama Family Alliance, discusses a Christian
elementary school that can serve as a model for private efforts
to prevent welfare dependency.

 Perhaps no other issue in California is as pressing as welfare
reform.  In 1995, approximately 2.7 million (one in twelve) Californians
were on AFDC.  Californians account for 12 percent of the nation's
taxpayers, but support 17 percent of the national AFDC caseload.
 Worse, California's payment of high AFDC benefits--the fourth
highest in the country and the highest among the ten most populous
states--accounts for more than a quarter of the nation's welfare
expenditures.  Finally, and perhaps most damning, an astounding
60 percent of adult (over 18) AFDC recipients in California have
been on welfare longer than two years.  As Governor Pete Wilson
has said, welfare should be a safety net, not a hammock.
<P>
 Debate over welfare reform in California begins in earnest this
spring.  In January, California's Department of Social Services
issued a proposal for redesigning the state's welfare system.
 Devised by Director of Social Services Eloise Anderson and endorsed
by the governor, it is the most promising welfare reform plan
in recent state history.  However, it relies on the President
signing into law block grant legislation to end the fundamentally
flawed federal welfare system.
<P>
 Ms. Anderson notes that the single most important element of
reform is a reduction in welfare payments.  To a large extent,
California's history of high AFDC benefits is responsible for
the entrenched cycle of poverty that many now decry.  The Governor's
reform package would introduce a &quot;flat grant&quot; to replace
the current system of sliding benefits.  This would have four
main elements:
<P>
<ul>
 <li>Benefit levels would be lowered and one standard payment set,
based on equity for lowincome families.  Welfare would not pay
more than work.
<P>
 <li>The grant would be flat, i.e., not adjusted for any increase
in the number of adults or children in the household.  It would
thus restore the principle of personal responsibility and establish
fairness, since working families do not receive wage increases
when they have more children.
<P>
 <li>Eligibility would be timelimited, encouraging recipients to
view welfare as a temporary handup rather than as a career path.
<P>
 <li>The grant would eliminate eligibility requirements that make
aid available only when one parent is deceased, disabled, missing,
or unemployed.  Eligibility would instead be based on a simple
income and asset test, as well as on the presence of a child under
18 years of age.  This would hopefully restore the state's endorsement
of the traditional two-parent family.
</ul>
<P>
 A second key component of the governor's plan is a set of four
programs designed to move recipients from welfare into the labor
force.  Two of these seek to move families toward independence
as quickly as possible.  One sets a twoyear limit on aid, and
the other, for persons with little or no previous job history,
sets a fiveyear limit but provides noncash benefits such as vouchers.
 The other two programs address the needs of those who face the
greatest barriers to independence.  One, for families with a disabled
child or parent, provides aid for the duration of the disability.
 The other provides unlimited assistance for children living with
relatives in lieu of foster care, but puts a twoyear limit on
aid for parents who are themselves ineligible for aid.
<P>
 While these proposals sound promising, California's welfare record
is far from outstanding.  The state has been fundamentally unable
to respond to the particularities of individual cases.  Herein
lies an opportunity for philanthropic alternatives.  Pacific Research
Institute's 1995 privatization competition, titled &quot;Beyond
the Welfare State: Celebrating Private Initiative in Social Services,&quot;
examined social-service programs that receive less than 25 percent
of their funding from government.  We found programs throughout
California that were meeting human needs in meaningful ways without
relying on the state for funds or oversight.  Two programs in
particular stood out:
<P><ul>
 <li>Chrysalis: Jobs for L.A.'s Homeless, is a nonprofit group in
Los Angeles that helps the homeless become economically selfsufficient
through steady jobs.  Its mission states that &quot;Chrysalis
doesn't give people jobs.  We teach them how to find jobs themselves,
by providing intensive classroom instruction and the simple resources
they need to find work.&quot;  Resources include resume assistance,
personal-case managers, bus fare to interviews, a mail and message
center, a set of interview clothes, and food and hygiene items.
 By the end of 1995, Chrysalis had helped almost 3,000 homeless
people find fulltime jobs in the private sector.  It did so with
no government funding.
<P>
 <li>The Redwood Gospel Mission, a 30-year-old faith-based organization
located in a small town in Northern California, likewise shares
a commitment to the ideals of personal responsibility and selfsufficiency.
 It is the only 24hour, fullservice shelter and recovery facility
in a fourcounty area, providing 6,116 hot meals and 2,256 beds
in a typical month.  With the aim of &quot;teach[ing] men how
to fish,&quot; it offers both practical and spiritual support.
 Its tough-love approach has a proven record of moving residents
into society as productive, independent adults.  Like Chrysalis,
it neither accepts nor solicits government money.
</ul><P>
 Welfare reform in California must be a partnership between public
and private assistance, with the common goal of restoring personal
responsibility and selfsufficiency.  This is not simply an economic
necessity, but a social imperative.  The governor's plan offers
dramatic steps to reform welfare, but we must emphasize the importance
of private efforts that are successfully addressing the critical
and massive problem of repairing the damage done by the welfare
state.  Private programs offer powerful, individual-oriented approaches
that no government initiative can match.

<P>
<B>Behind the Curve</B>
<P>
<B>by Joseph Bast</B>
<P>
 Efforts to reform welfare in Illinois have taken three forms:
steps that are too small, throwing good money after bad, and reshuffling
bureaucracies.  In 1994, Governor James Edgar proposed enrolling
Medicaid beneficiaries in a $5-billion-a-year state-run health
maintenance organization.  Many observers questioned whether the
state was competent to run such an enormous new program.  A proposal
to issue health-care vouchers to the needy, redeemable by an array
of private insurance companies, was dismissed as too radical.
<P>
 Recent attempts to reform the Department of Children and Family
Services, the chief child welfare agency in Illinois, are also
fundamentally flawed.  Rather than reconsider the agency's far-reaching
mandate, and perhaps return it to its original mission of enforcing
child abuse laws and inspecting foster homes and other child-care
facilities, the state has poured hundreds of millions of dollars
into new computers, caseworkers, and consultants.  The result
has been even longer delays in placing children into safe homes
and more children returned to abusive parents.
<P>
 In his 1996 State of the State Address, Governor Edgar proposed
creating a welfare super-agency by merging seven cabinet-level
agencies and many other boards, commissions, and programs.  A
background paper distributed by his office noted that such consolidation
would mend the &quot;fractured&quot; state of current welfare
services and allow the government to &quot;focus on the entire
person or family unit and their needs.&quot;
<P>
 While there is certainly a need to consolidate--and scale back--the
state's welfare leviathan, other reforms could generate much greater
benefits more quickly:
<P><ul>
 <li>Issue health-care vouchers that would give the needy a wider
choice of medical providers and insurers.
<P>
 <li>Turn the care of abused and neglected children over to private
agencies that have a better track record of placing children into
safe and stable homes.
<P>
 Two reforms of AFDC would also produce immediate positive results:
<P>
 <li>Limit eligibility to two years, rather than offer the current
lifetime entitlement.
<P>
<li>Remove from the rolls all those who fail to report to state
offices when told to do so.  In November 1995, fewer than half
of 8,000 recipients responded to a call-in for a job-training
workshop--and half of those who responded failed to attend a follow-up
meeting.  Those 6,000 recipients who did not fulfill even the
simple obligation to attend these meetings should be dropped from
the rolls.</ul>
<P>
 The key to welfare reform in Illinois may lie in <I>Building
Communities from the Inside Out</I>, a new book by John P. Kretzmann
and John L. McKnight of Northwestern University's Center for Urban
Affairs and Policy Research.  The authors call for replacing government
programs with &quot;capacity-focused development&quot; driven
largely by private community-based  organizations.  The role of
government, write Kretzmann and McKnight, should be to gather
data on the capacity of the community and remove barriers to job
creation.  Other researchers have noted how Illinois' zoning laws,
occupational licensing laws, corrupt and under-performing public
school system, and politicized economic development program have
reduced job creation and income growth, undermined local self-improvement
efforts, and contributed to welfare dependency.
<P>
 Unfortunately, Illinois' current crop of elected officials--both
Democratic and Republican--is conspicuously lacking the vision
needed to dismantle the state's welfare complex.  As a result,
Illinoisans will carry a costly and counterproductive welfare
burden into the foreseeable future.

<B>Investing in Families</B>
<P>
<B>by Amy Frantz</B>
<P>
 In 1993, the Iowa state legislature enacted a welfare reform
program designed to help welfare recipients become self-sufficient.
 With several waivers from the federal government, AFDC was replaced
with the Family Investment Program (FIP).  FIP provides cash benefits
to participants based on their assets, income, and family size.
 Participants may also be eligible for Medicare, food stamps,
and other assistance.
<P>
 FIP participants must sign a contract, called the Family Investment
Agreement, in which they promise to participate in Iowa's employment
program, Promise Jobs.  This is administered by several state
agencies, including the departments of human services, employment
services, and economic development.  Services provided by Promise
Jobs include education and job training, resume writing, and interviewing
techniques.
<P>
 Each participant must meet with a caseworker, who helps identify
the individual's work and educational background, child-care and
transportation needs, and barriers to work.  After identifying
steps that must be taken to become self-sufficient, the contract
is negotiated by the participant and caseworker.  The participant
must agree to meet a timetable for achieving self-sufficiency.
 The state agrees to offer assistance in exchange.  Those who
fail to make progress toward self-sufficiency due to circumstances
beyond their control, such as the absence of child care, may renegotiate
their contracts.
<P>
 Exemptions to the Promise Jobs program include the disabled,
those with children under three months of age, and those already
working at least 30 hours per week in unsubsidized employment.
 Parents under the age of 19 who have not completed high school
or an equivalent must pursue their diplomas to receive benefits,
regardless of the age of their children.
<P>
 Those who refuse to sign a Family Investment Agreement must enter
a Limited Benefit Plan.  This pays reduced benefits for three
months, then terminates all benefits.  Individuals and any other
household members affected by a cut-off are ineligible for benefits
for six months.  After that time, they may negotiate a Family
Investment Agreement.  However, if they do not earnestly try to
become self-sufficient, benefits are terminated again for six
months.
<P>
 According to the Iowa Department of Human Services, the number
of families participating in the Family Investment Program fell
from 36,583 in October 1993, when the program was implemented,
to 33,091 by February 1996.  In addition, the percentage of families
participating in FIP who have at least one employed member increased
from 18 percent in 1993 to 33 percent by early 1996.  This success
is likely attributable to individuals' helping to tailor their
own self-sufficiency plans and to the reduction or termination
of benefits for those unwilling to pursue self-sufficiency.
<P>
 Iowa has also created programs that allow private organizations
to help those in the Family Investment Program.  One of these
is the Individual Development Account (IDA) pilot program.  IDAs
are held by low-income individuals and can be used for post-secondary
education, the purchase of a home, or starting a small business.
 They are opened with private banks and managed by community-based
organizations.  In addition to funds that individuals contribute
to their IDAs, community-based organizations can provide matching
funds.

<P>
<B>Changing Welfare by Requiring Work</B>
<P>
<B>by Peter S. Barwick</B>
<P>
 The single most important and politically feasible step that
can be taken to reform welfare in Pennsylvania is to impose up-front
work requirements on all able-bodied recipients.  The state must
enact this change if it is serious about helping welfare recipients
achieve long-term self-sufficiency.
<P>
 Governor Tom Ridge recently unveiled a welfare reform plan that
moves in this direction, but it does not go far enough.  For a
better example of how to use welfare to promote work, Pennsylvania's
policymakers should consider the Full Employment model, first
developed in Oregon.  This approach takes money already allocated
for the three largest welfare programs--AFDC, Food Stamps, and
Unemployment Insurance (UI)--and uses it to subsidize jobs for
welfare recipients in the private sector.
<P>
 Full Employment legislation, known as JOBS Plus, was passed by
the Oregon legislature in 1993, and has operated on a pilot basis
for the past two years.  Because of its impressive results in
reducing both welfare costs and caseloads, the legislature voted
last year to implement JOBS Plus statewide.  The Oregon model
has been influential in shaping reform in nearly a dozen states
to date, including Arizona, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Virginia, and Wisconsin.
<P>
 Participation in JOBS Plus is required of virtually everyone
who qualifies for AFDC, Food Stamps, or UI.  Participants initially
receive help in finding regular full-time jobs.  Those unable
to find traditional employment are placed in subsidized jobs with
private-sector employers, who are reimbursed by the state for
the minimum wage plus the employers' share of social security,
unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation premiums.  Subsidized
jobs are temporary, lasting four months, with an optional two-month
extension.  Child care and health care are available to all participants.
<P>
 The benefits of JOBS Plus are numerous.  Most importantly, it
recognizes that work requirements are essential to helping the
poor escape from dependency and enter mainstream society.  As
today's welfare system so clearly shows, without the salutary
influence of employment, self-destructive and anti-social patterns
of behavior are often left unchecked, resulting in the degradation
and destruction of welfare recipients' lives.
<P>
 Other benefits of the Full Employment approach include:
<P><ul>
 <li>Providing participants with practical work experience;
<P>
 <li>Involving the business community in the fight to reduce poverty;
<P>
 <li>Eliminating the perverse incentives of the current welfare
system, which reward non-work and penalize work;
<P>
 <li>Eliminating fraud perpetuated by those who collect benefits
while simultaneously earning unreported income.</ul>
<P>
 Despite offering clear benefits, work-based welfare reform raises
important questions.  Foremost among these is how it will affect
the family.  Some critics, noting that most of those on welfare
are unmarried mothers with children, argue that putting these
women to work will further erode the family by separating mothers
from their children--children who lack the presence of fathers
to begin with.  This concern, while valid, must be weighed against
the danger of children learning habits of dependency from mothers
who have no constructive goals.  If our experience with welfare
over the past 30 years is any guide, the harm resulting from welfare
dependency is far worse--both for welfare recipients and society
in general--than the harm of separating children from their mothers
during the working day.
<P>
 A related concern is the impact of work-based welfare on family
formation.  Some critics believe that work requirements may discourage
marriage by enabling unmarried women to earn enough income to
stay unmarried.  This concern also has validity, but it does not
change the fact that as long as welfare exists, benefits must--for
the good of those receiving them--be linked with work requirements.
 Furthermore, by making welfare less attractive, work requirements
may actually encourage single mothers to marry.
<P>
 Finally, some believe that work-based welfare does little to
help participants achieve self-sufficiency because it places them
in dead-end, low-wage jobs.  These critics view work-based reform
as a thinly disguised attempt to provide business with a pool
of cheap labor.  This criticism is misplaced for two reasons.
 First, Full Employment programs actually require a great deal
from employers.  Under JOBS Plus, employers must provide participants
with on-the-job training and mentors to assist them in learning
the personal and job-related skills necessary for success in the
workplace.  They must also contribute funds to an education account
for each employee.  Second, since poverty often stems from a non-existent
work ethic, putting the needy to work will help them learn positive
habits such as perseverance and punctuality which are necessary
for achieving self-sufficiency.

<P>
<B>Headed in the Right Direction</B>
<P>
<B>by Mike Hubbard</B>
<P>
 South Carolina has joined a growing number of states that have
enacted major welfare reform.  Last year, the General Assembly
passed the Family Independence Act, requiring the South Carolina
Department of Social Services to reorient its mission from distributing
welfare checks to helping welfare recipients find jobs.
<P>
 To implement several proposed reforms, the federal government
must give South Carolina waivers from certain federal laws and
regulations.  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is fighting
the state over most of these, delaying the full impact of reform.
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Family Independence Act is a good step in the
right direction.  Among its provisions:
<P><UL>
 <li>&quot;Success&quot; for state agencies is defined as a shrinking
caseload and an increase in the number of recipients placed in
jobs.
<P>
<li>New welfare applications are not processed unless applicants
can prove they have been looking for work.
<P>
<li>The state helps recipients relocate to areas with better job
opportunities.
<P>
<li>Employers are given a tax credit for hiring and maintaining
recipients.
<P>
<li>Benefits are limited to 24 consecutive months, and 60 months
in a lifetime.  Exceptions are made for those truly unable to
work.
<P>
 <li>Mothers who give birth to children showing evidence of maternal
substance abuse are ineligible for AFDC unless they submit to
drug testing and/or undergo treatment.
<P>
<li>Teenage unwed mothers must live with a parent or guardian,
unless doing so would jeopardize their safety or that of their
children.
<P>
<li>The Department of Social Services must eliminate its &quot;no
daddy&quot; rule, thereby making two-parent welfare families eligible
for programs in financial planning, parenting, and the like.
<P>
 <li>Individual Development Accounts are created, encouraging families
to save money for a small business or home.
<P>
 <li>Drivers licenses, hunting and fishing licenses, and professional
licenses are revoked if fathers fail to pay child support.</ul>
<P>
 In addition, a federal rule that requires state welfare agencies
to keep a large portion of each child support payment is revoked
under the Family Independence Act.  All child support will be
passed on to mothers and their children.
<P>
 South Carolina has also sought to involve nonprofits and businesses
in welfare reform.  The Job Training and Partnership Act provides
funds to private organizations that teach job skills.  The future
of welfare in South Carolina will rely increasingly on such private
initiatives.

<P>
<B>Making Progress</B>
<P>
<B>by Kelly McCutchen</B>
<P>
 Many of the welfare reforms implemented in Georgia in recent
years lack the boldness of initiatives in other states and contain
too many exceptions to be truly effective.  However, Governor
Zell Miller's most recent reforms, combined with a thriving state
economy, appear to be having a positive effect.  From August 1994
through July 1995, the number of families on welfare decreased
by 6,000, from 141,000 to 135,000.
<P>
 Probably the greatest problem facing Georgia's welfare system
is the state's illegitimacy rate, among the highest in the nation.
 Georgia has enacted two reforms designed to discourage out-of-wedlock
births:
<P><ul>
 <li>In 1994, it began to deny benefits to unwed teen mothers who
choose to live on their own.  The following year, the number of
teen mothers living independently dropped by 50 percent.
<P>
 <li>As of 1996, it no longer increases benefits to welfare recipients
who have additional children.  Although it is too early to judge
the success of Georgia's &quot;family cap,&quot; a similar policy
in New Jersey has shown favorable results.</ul>
<P>
 Georgia also recently enacted three reforms intended to encourage
work:<UL>
<P>
 <li>Able-bodied welfare recipients who quit or refuse to take full-time
jobs face a reduction in benefits.
<P>
 <li>In a pilot project in ten counties, able-bodied recipients
are required to work 20 hours per month in assigned jobs at government
or nonprofit agencies.
<P>
 <li>The newest initiative, Work First, seeks to change the character
of welfare in Georgia from income maintenance to employment. 
The state is advising social workers that finding jobs for recipients
is their number one objective.  It is also offering businesses
tax credits and subsidies, giving them an incentive to hire and
train welfare recipients.</ul>
<P>
 Public support is vital to achieving any controversial change
in public policy.  To better gauge public opinion on welfare reform,
the Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) conducted a statewide
survey of registered voters in December 1994.  We found strong
support for many fundamental reforms.  Surprisingly, support was
uniform across racial and party lines:
<P><UL>
 <li>Nine out of ten Georgia voters support requiring unwed mothers
on welfare to name the fathers of their children.
<P>
 <br>Nine out of ten favor requiring able-bodied recipients to work
40 hours per week.
<P>
 <li>By a better than 5-to-1 margin, Georgia voters support limiting
welfare payments so that recipients cannot receive more than those
working at minimum-wage jobs.
<P>
 <li>A majority favor allowing recipients to be paid less than the
minimum wage to increase the likelihood that they will look for
work.</ul>
<P>
 GPPF supports three key elements of welfare reform:
<P><ul>
 <li> <I>Establish paternity at birth</I>.  Georgia has had great
success in recovering child-support payments.  As one of the first
states to privatize child-support collection, Georgia now ranks
sixth in the nation in removing families from welfare by finding
fathers and making them support their children.  The state must
send a clear message to teenage boys that they will be held financially
responsible for any children they engender.
<P>
 <li><I>Reduce benefits</I>.  Welfare recipients should not be better
off than those who work.  According to the Cato Institute, the
wage equivalent of the overall welfare benefits received by a
Georgia mother with two children greatly exceeds the amount most
Georgians earn in entry-level jobs.  Their benefits total $8.37
per hour, the equivalent of a $17,400 annual salary.
<P>
 <li><I>Require work</I>.  Welfare recipients must not be allowed
to stay at home and collect benefits.  We must return to a system
that expects a full day's work in return for assistance.</ul>
<P>
 Although these steps are important, effective reform must go
beyond establishing paternity, reducing benefits, and requiring
work.  Most welfare recipients face tough problems that they cannot
solve on their own, and experience shows that one-size-fits-all
government programs will not promote self-sufficiency.  When government
moved into social welfare, other institutions--families, businesses,
churches, and charities--were shunted aside.  They must once again
assume primary roles.
<P>
 Worthwhile organizations must be identified.  GPPF is currently
working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise to identify grassroots organizations in Georgia that
have a proven record of helping the needy achieve self-sufficiency.
 These groups, including the Georgia-based Habitat for Humanity,
will form the foundation for effective alternatives to government
programs.
<P>
 A successful approach to welfare reform requires a balance of
compassion, fairness, and common sense.  It would be an easy but
tragic mistake to simply transfer federal programs to the states.
 Instead, Georgia will create welfare reform approaches that work
by requiring more responsibility from the needy and by engaging
an active citizenry in the &quot;tough love&quot; initiatives
of local organizations.

<P>
<B>From Welfare to Work</B>
<P>
<B>by Samuel R. Staley and Douglas Hyne</B>
<P>
 Welfare spending rose dramatically in Ohio during the 1980s.
 As a result, the state has either scaled back, restructured,
or eliminated several welfare programs.  General Assistance, which
gave over $100 per month to more than 146,000 able-bodied adults
in 1991, began to be phased out in 1992 and was eliminated in
1995.  This has already saved the state $900 million since the
phase-out began and should save an additional $885 million over
the next four years.
<P>
 Ohio has also implemented the federally mandated Job Opportunities
and Basic Skills (JOBS) program.  This requires a large number
of welfare recipients to enroll in job-training programs.  Refusal
to participate results in a loss of welfare benefits.
<P>
 A recent federal waiver also allows Ohio to require recipients
of Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) to participate in JOBS or lose
benefits.  This is expected to dramatically increase the number
of JOBS participants, which already is higher than in any other
state.  Combined with state-mandated self-sufficiency contracts
that outline steps recipients must take to prepare for employment,
Ohio's JOBS participation sanctions are considered some of the
toughest in the nation.
<P>
 Another federal waiver has allowed Ohio to &quot;cash out&quot;
ADC and food stamp benefits as wage supplements.  In a pilot project
now operating in five major urban counties, welfare recipients
are placed in jobs paying between $8 and $11 per hour.
<P>
 In 1989, Ohio implemented the Learning, Earning and Parenting
(LEAP) program.  This offers teen mothers $62 per month to stay
in high school.  The governor's office reports a 10 percent decline
in the dropout rate since 1991.  It also credits the program with
encouraging 13 percent of dropouts to return to school.
<P>
 In addition, ADC parents are required to establish paternity
and support their dependents or face penalties.  And those who
have committed welfare fraud are required to pay back benefits.
 Even those under the age of 18 risk losing Medicaid coverage
if they have received benefits under false pretenses.
<P>
 Additional federal waivers will allow Ohio to implement Ohio
FIRST, a comprehensive welfare-reform initiative.  Spearheaded
by Governor George Voinovich and passed by the General Assembly
with strong bipartisan support, it will:
<P><ul>
<li> Increase the income families may earn before losing ADC benefits;
<P>
 <li>Eliminate work-history requirements for able-bodied married
couples.  (These encouraged divorce since only single parents
without work histories qualified for welfare.);
<P>
 <li>Increase the maximum allowed value for an automobile, allowing
recipients to take jobs that require personal transportation;
<P>
 <li>Allow married couples who work more than 100 hours per month
to retain benefits.  (Previously, only single parents could do
so.).</ul>
<P>
 Another key component of recent welfare reforms is timelines.
 Under these:
<P><ul>
 <li>JOBS participants enrolled in a GED program must complete their
schooling within two years to retain benefits.
<P>
<li> ADC benefits are limited to three years.</ul>
<P>
 Ohio is also testing a version of the Electronic Benefits Transfer
(EBT) smart card.  Similar to ATM bank cards, EBT cards are issued
by the state and can be used by welfare recipients to purchase
food, housing, and other goods.  The cards are expected to reduce
both administrative costs and fraud.
<P>
 These and other efforts appear to be paying off.  Ohio's welfare
caseload fell from 811,219 in 1991 to 569,405 by February 1996,
a 30 percent drop.  ADC payments are nearly $300 below the national
average.  The number of ADC recipients fell 25 percent between
1992 and February 1996.  And Medicaid spending, expected to consume
30 percent of the state's General Revenue Fund Budget over the
next two years, grew by only 1.4 percent between 1994 and 1995--the
slowest growth in twenty years.  Ohio has also received a federal
waiver that will let it place more low-income families in cost-efficient
managed-care programs.
<P>
 Ohio should explore additional welfare reform options.  Tax credits
and other incentives could be used to encourage donations to charities
serving the needy.  By restructuring its own tax code, Ohio could
help relieve some of the welfare burden without having to deal
with the federal bureaucracy.

<P>
<B>Untangling the Medicaid Mess</B>
<P>
<B>by John Hood</B>
<P>
 Lawmakers and the general public most often think of welfare
as cash assistance programs such as AFDC.  These are the least
popular and, to many, the most infuriating.
<P>
 But AFDC is not the largest welfare program.  That distinction
belongs to Medicaid, the joint federal-state program designed
to subsidize health care for about 36 million poor, disabled,
and elderly Americans.  Federal taxes support two-thirds of this
$160-billion program while state and local governments contribute
the remainder.  Astonishingly, the cost of Medicaid has tripled
just since 1988.  If welfare reform is to succeed in its twin
goals of reducing dependency and costs, it must include serious
federal and state reforms of Medicaid.
<P>
 Nationwide, Medicaid pays for one-third of all births, more than
half of all nursing home bills, and a significant part of the
bill for those with mental illness, physical disabilities, and
AIDS.  In North Carolina, the scope of the program is even larger,
paying for nearly half of all births and three-quarters of all
nursing home bills.
<P>
 The costs of Medicaid are rapidly outstripping the ability of
federal and state governments to pay the bill.  The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that Medicaid costs will almost double
by 2002.  A recent study by the Heritage Foundation estimates
that by the same year states will spend a combined $100 billion
on the program, up from $70 billion in 1995.  Such increases would
likely be funded by higher taxes or cuts in other state programs
such as education and crime control.
<P>
 A viable reform strategy must recognize that Medicaid is not
a program but a set of programs with different goals and different
problems.  Created in 1965 as a health insurance program for the
poor, Medicaid has become an amalgam of at least three social
welfare programs.  These cover:
<P><ul>
 <li>Poor children and adults;
<P>
 <li>Disabled children and adults;
<P>
 <li>Elderly residents in nursing homes.</ul>
<P>
 These three populations have very little in common.  Most of
the Medicaid population qualifies through eligibility for cash
welfare programs such as AFDC.  While these low-income individuals
certainly have health-care needs, their main problem is welfare
dependency.  They need help learning job skills, getting off drugs,
and becoming self-sufficient.
<P>
 Instead of automatically being enrolled in Medicaid, these recipients
should receive vouchers to purchase private health insurance,
enroll in managed care, or make deposits in medical or other savings
accounts.  These would be subject to the same time limits, work
requirements, and other rules set for welfare benefits.
<P>
 Medicaid recipients who are disabled may be thought of as long-term
wards of the state.  Per capita, their health-care costs are the
highest.  But being less numerous than the elderly, they do not
account for the largest share of Medicaid spending.  Disabled
Medicaid recipients should receive care as part of subsidized
assigned-risk pools and through competitive contracting.
<P>
 Finally, elderly recipients in nursing homes, who are a minority
of the Medicaid population, account for the largest share of Medicaid
spending.  Often, they are middle-class Americans who have transferred
their assets to their children in order to qualify for Medicaid.
 They must be encouraged to plan for their own health-care needs
through individual savings and long-term care insurance.
<P>
 One way to do this is to amend the income-tax system to treat
premiums for long-term care insurance the same as for medical
insurance.  Also, the payment of long-term care benefits, either
from insurance or medical savings, should not be considered taxable
income.  The potential savings to taxpayers of this change would
be massive.  According to the American Health Care Association,
if most people over age 55 had long-term health-care insurance,
the percentage of those subsidized by Medicaid in nursing homes
would fall from a current 67 percent to 25 percent within 25 years.

<B>Private Alternatives to Welfare</B>
<P>
<B>by Senator Maurice E. Washington</B>
<P>
<I> &quot;It has so happened in all ages of the world that some
have labored and others have without labor enjoyed a proportion
of the fruits.  This is wrong and should not continue.  To secure
to each laborer the whole product of his labor or as nearly as
possible is a most worthy object of any good government.&quot;
 Abraham Lincoln</I>
<P>
 Lincoln's statement distills the essence of what I have learned
about life and human nature in relation to the current welfare
morass.  As a pastor and member of the black community, I have
watched the traditionally strong morals and family structure of
black families destroyed by the false god of welfare entitlement.
<P>
 In 1994, when I was elected to the Nevada State Senate, I began
work on a sweeping welfare reform proposal.  Dubbed the Nevada
Self-Reliance Act, its goals are to end welfare entitlements,
strengthen the fragmenting family unit, and restore individual
responsibility.  It also seeks to build partnerships between the
public and private sectors and provide relief from the escalating
tax burden caused by welfare programs.
<P>
 Three programs with which I am familiar underscore the vital
role that local nonprofits can play in welfare-reform efforts:
<P><ul>
 <li> The Center Street Mission in Reno provides a full range of
services to help the needy become productive members of society.
 Founded in 1989 by Mickey Lafkin, C.M.S. and funded by individuals,
foundations, churches, and local government, it provides showers,
clean clothes, evening meals, and help in finding housing and
employment.  It also offers spiritual support.  Over 2,000 participants
have found jobs and a new start in life--a 92 percent success
rate.  The Mission also reaches out to prisoners and parolees
through weekly Bible study programs.
<P>
 <li>Friends in Service Helping (FISH) in Carson City was created
17 years ago to provide temporary and emergency assistance to
the needy.  Private contributors, including individuals, churches,
businesses, and civic clubs provide over 90 percent of FISH's
support.  FISH operates a food pantry, dining room, temporary
homeless shelter, and immunization clinic.  It also provides counseling,
free G.E.D. classes, and an interim housing project for eight
families.  Nearly 150 families are served each month.  FISH's
effectiveness is evident from the fact that Carson County, the
third largest county in Nevada, employs only one part-time state
social worker.  Residents have chosen to support an effective
private organization over a government bureaucracy.
<P>
 <li>Center of Hope Christian Fellowship in Sparks is the church
that I pastor.  When I helped create it six years ago, many of
our members were on welfare.  Today, every one is employed.  None
receive welfare.  Like the Center Street Mission and FISH, our
programs are locally controlled and operate in partnership with
the community.  Paid staff are few.  Volunteers provide most services.
 In return for spiritual and moral support, recipients are expected
to change self-defeating or self-destructive behavior.</ul>
<P>
 The principles by which these organizations operate should serve
as models for future welfare reform efforts.
<P>
<B><a name="ala">Alabama:</a></B>
<P>
<B>Lessons from a School that Works</B>
<P>
<B>by Gary Palmer</B>
<P>
 Perhaps the best example of what true welfare reform could be
in Alabama is the Cornerstone School.  Located in a low-income
minority community in Birmingham, Cornerstone is a privately funded
Christian elementary school which charges no tuition.
<P>
 According to Cornerstone's executive director, Dr. Vernard Gant,
the best way to break the cycle of dependency is through a combination
of strong character and morals, a good education, and a vision
for the future.  Gant insists that students from inner-city, low-income
families can excel in school and learn the social skills necessary
for success as adults.
<P>
 As soon as students are admitted to Cornerstone, they are given
a battery of tests to identify educational deficiencies.  Teachers
then tutor individual students to bring them up to the appropriate
grade level.  The wisdom of this approach is evident in the results.
 Third grade students with barely a second grade education who
enrolled in August 1995 saw their achievement scores jump an average
of 54 percent as of January 1996.  The fifth grade class, half
of whom enrolled with less than a fourth grade education, improved
its overall score by 38 percent.  Math skills for both classes
are now above the national average.
<P>
 Cornerstone makes parental involvement a high priority.  Before
a child is admitted, parents must sign a covenant, pledging to
participate in their children's education.  They are required
to have their children to school on time, attend all report card
conferences and parent meetings, work with faculty to promote
appropriate speech, behavior, and social development, and provide
a distraction-free environment for doing homework.  Teachers stay
in constant contact with parents through meetings, after-school
visits, and by telephone.  Despite these demands, there is a waiting
list for admission to Cornerstone.
<P>
 Religious education is central to Cornerstone's effort to elevate
students above poverty and dependency.  A recent Heritage Foundation
report shows that religious values are critical factors in avoiding
unwed pregnancy, drug use, alcoholism, crime, divorce, and other
circumstances that can lead to welfare dependency.  It found that
students who receive a religious education also place a higher
value on academics, are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle
to reaching their goals, and are more likely to have serious and
realistic goals for the future.
<P>
 Cornerstone judiciously selects its teachers on the basis of
the &quot;Three M's:&quot; mentor, model, and mission.  Every
teacher is a mentor and a model of integrity and determination.
 Each is also a missionary to both students and parents.
<P>
 Cornerstone students are admitted from the surrounding area,
primarily on the basis of need.  Tuition and operating funds come
from individuals, foundations, corporations, and churches.  Cornerstone
also has a &quot;Partners&quot; program for those who make an
annual contribution of $2,500.  Partners agree to be mentors and
role models and to attend up to four Partners' Day programs each
year.
<P>
 Governor Fob James recently visited Cornerstone to see first-hand
how private, faith-based education helps future generations of
at-risk children from becoming welfare victims.  He saw that private
initiative can accomplish what government programs have so often
failed to do: prepare a generation to be responsible, self-supporting
adults.

<p>
Conspiracies involving traffickers in illegal drugs are covered
extensively in the media. So are stories about individual drug
users who would like to grow, obtain and use drugs legally. But
very little has been written about the prominent individuals and
nonprofit organizations that have made the legalization of drugs
an issue in public policy. A worldwide network of people and groups
is coalescing to work to end the criminal penalties attached to
the sale and use of currently illegal drugs. Most Americans are
not aware of how serious and determined these efforts are. But
the public needs to realize that the availability of drugs, the
extent of drug use, and even the corrupting effects of illegal
drug trafficking are only part of the story. What has not been
adequately discussed is the political influence of the pro-drug
legalization movement and the economic, social, cultural and moral
consequences of its activities. 

<P>
Because most experts in law enforcement agree that the &quot;war
on drugs&quot; launched by President Nixon in 1970 has not been
won, much of the public has become skeptical of claims that authorities
are committed to fighting drugs. Increasingly indifferent to the
anti-drug rhetoric of politicians, many Americans are starting
to listen more attentively to a growing, widespread, and well-targeted
public relations campaign aimed at making them more accepting
of public policies that would tolerate drug use. 
<P>
Contributing to this are well-intentioned and well known individuals
such as financier George Soros, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke,
and commentator William F. Buckley Jr., who have become convinced
that legalization is the answer. They are among the most prominent
public figures who have lent their voices -- and their respectability
-- to calls for drug legalization. 
<P>
Television &quot;documentaries&quot; are often supportive
of legalization arguments. MTV's &quot;Straight Dope&quot; (April
1994), ABC's &quot;America's War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions&quot;
(April 1995), and The Discovery Channel's &quot;The Cronkite Report:
The Drug Dilemma&quot; (Fall 1995) were all sympathetic to legalization
and calls for so-called &quot;alternative&quot; drug policies.
PBS programs, including <I>Firing Line</I> and <I>The Charlie
Rose Show</I>, have questioned the wisdom of the drug war and
the prohibition of illegal drugs -- as have <I>National Review</I>,
<I>New York Magazine</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, and <I>The
Los Angeles Times</I>. All use phrases like &quot;harm reduction,&quot;
&quot;responsible use,&quot; &quot;alternatives,&quot; and &quot;decriminalization,&quot;
which have become code words used to mask a pro-legalization agenda.

<P>
The cover story in the February 12, 1996 issue of William
Buckley's magazine, <I>National Review</I>, was devoted to drug
legalization, with a series of essays making the case for ending
the legal prohibition. The journal that arguably established the
intellectual foundations for the modern conservative movement
is now providing a forum for these opinions. Most politicians,
government officials, as well as the majority of the American
people still dismiss pro-drug legalization arguments. But a broad
array of well-funded nongovernmental organizations across the
political spectrum is developing programs to legitimize drug legalization.

<P>
The financial backing and political and social support for
legalization arguments comes from a variety of sources, including
George Soros's Open Society Fund, the Soros Foundation and his
own Lindesmith Center, the Drug Policy Foundation, and the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). Together
with such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union,
ACT-UP, and the New York chapter of the American Bar Association,
they make up the pro-legalization chorus. 
<P>
In addition, a number of other groups, including prominent
foundations like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,
Twentieth Century Fund, Carnegie Corporation, RAND Corporation,
and the Ford Foundation, do not advocate legalization, but provide
indirect support. They fund projects that not only criticize current
law enforcement policies, but lend support to the argument that
the drug war is a lost cause. Contending that the supply of drugs
can never be halted, these groups call instead for more treatment
facilities and programs for drug users and less law enforcement
and interdiction against drugs. They insist that many drug offenders
are non-violent and should not be imprisoned. Yet their arguments
confuse the consequences of drug use with its cause. As Robert
Peterson, the former Illinois drug czar, has said, &quot;You cannot
win the war by treating the wounded.&quot; 
<P>
Political figures like Representative Barney Frank (D-MA)
and former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders have spoken out, joining
Hollywood notables like producer David Geffen and actor Richard
Dreyfuss, and writers Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, John LeCarre,
Jorge Castaneda, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in seeking decriminalization
of drugs. 
<P>
Arguments that lend support to the pro-legalization movement
are advancing on all fronts. They are adapted and modified to
persuade different segments of the public. Thus, taxpayers are
warned that drug prohibition wastes public resources and is not
cost-effective. Law enforcement officers are reminded that an
unsuccessful drug war breeds disrespect for all laws. Parents
are counselled that kids are more likely to respect them and keep
themselves safe if they aren't forced into back alleys in dangerous
neighborhoods to buy their &quot;recreational drugs.&quot; The
health conscious are enlightened with data that purports to show
that cocaine is a &quot;unique source of vitamins and minerals&quot;
and that government needle bans promote unsafe and unnecessary
needle exchanges that are responsible for HIV infection among
those who inject their drugs. The arguments are unending to help
Americans overcome the repressions of a &quot;hypocritical&quot;
society. 
<P>
<a name="soros"><B>An Evening At Soros's</B> </a>
<P>
<I>Editor's note: Ms. Ehrenfeld attended the event she describes
below.</I> 
<P>
&quot;Cocaine is as good a stimulant as coffee with less harmful
effects on the body,&quot; said a drug legalization advocate in
New York. A colleague from Duke University chimed in, &quot;And,
it fills a spiritual vacuum in the deep void left by our shallow,
materialistic society.&quot; 
<P>
Caricature? Not at all: These are some of the comments made
by the respected guests of billionaire financier George Soros
at a gathering at his opulent Upper East Side Manhattan duplex.
Having spent hundreds of millions of dollars to foster the democratic
values of an &quot;open society,&quot; and claiming credit for
bringing down Communist rule in Eastern Europe, Soros is now mobilizing
some of his vast resources to fight against the &quot;evils and
misguided policy of the drug war.&quot; During last September's
Gorbachev Foundation &quot;The State of the World Forum&quot;
meeting in San Francisco, Ethan Nadelmann, director of Soros's
Lindesmith Center, introduced those ideas as part of the New World
Order while moderating the session on &quot;creative approaches
to the international drug crisis.&quot; 

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has described Soros
as &quot;a national resource -- indeed, a national treasure.&quot;
Yet the sixty-six-year-old, Hungarian-born Soros seems to be the
treasury of the movement to legalize drugs. He is the godfather
of the pro-legalization, decriminalization, harm reduction and
&quot;responsible use&quot; movements, all of which are interconnected.

<P>
Since the early nineties, Soros has donated $6 million dollars
to the Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), and he apparently
hosts DPF's New York office in his own offices on 7th Avenue.
Soros also gave at least $4 million dollars to the Lindesmith
Center, and $3 million dollars to Drug Strategies, which, according
to its president, Mathea Falco, promotes &quot;more effective
approaches to the nation's drug problem.&quot; 
<P>
In 1994 Soros, through his foundations, made grants totalling
at least $13 million dollars to a variety of organizations involved
in drug policy-related projects. In 1995, he &quot;provided $450,000
to Human Rights Watch for their first ever project on the abuses
of the war on drugs worldwide.&quot; Other non-American organizations
that have benefitted indirectly from Soros's largesse include
the Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy, which was formed in 1993;
the International Anti-Prohibitionist League, which is based in
Montreal and has offices in Europe; and the Australian Drug Law
Reform Foundation. 
<P>
These and other Soros-funded groups organize and help to fund
international conferences to promote marijuana and drug legalization
policies, and &quot;harm reduction,&quot; a term that refers to
programs designed to reduce the ill effects of illegal drugs.
They have played key roles in organizing and funding meetings
in the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada. They
also arrange for overseas legalization advocates to speak in public
forums in the U.S. and elsewhere, by covering their expenses and
providing honoraria. 
<P>
Soros poses as being open-minded on the drug issue, and in
public he calls for debate. Yet in press interviews his spokesman
on drugs Ethan Nadelmann has recalled that Soros told him: &quot;We
are basically in agreement . . . [I] empower you to accomplish
our common objectives.&quot; Nadelmann's objective is to &quot;legalize
the personal use of drugs by adult Americans. . . .&quot; And
Soros &quot;is comfortable with that,&quot; says Nadelmann. He
must be, because he is paying for it. 
<P>
Other guests were equally unrestrained at this memorable evening
at Soros's. New York district judge Robert Sweet, who favors decriminalization,
remarked, &quot;This [drugs] is a phony issue. People want to
change their state of mind because they don't have jobs, they
are deprived . . . And it is a lie that violence is caused by
drug addicts . . . The harm comes from the drug laws, not from
drugs.&quot; &quot;And let's not forget that drugs are fun,&quot;
added a well-known pro-legalization jazz musician. 
<P>
Interviewed by <I>High Times</I>, a magazine published by
NORML, Nadelmann asserted: &quot;It is important to see drugs
as a human rights issue,&quot; said Nadelmann, because &quot;it
is typically the same sorts of people who mount major wars on
Communists and major wars on drugs.&quot; He added that &quot;.
. . from a scientific perspective cocaine is not a dangerous drug
for the large majority of the people who use it&quot; -- and as
for legalization, &quot;take the chance and come out of the closet
. . . the way homosexuals . . . came out. . . . When all of a
sudden your cousin or your childhood friend or your daughter comes
out, your whole view of it begins to get normalized.&quot; 
<P>
He passionately added that &quot;Millions of Americans have
to lie to their kids because they think if their kids know they
smoke pot they'll report them. . . . That's a tremendous travesty.
The fear that children will put loyalty to the state ahead of
loyalty to the family is a lot more like Stalinist Russia or Nazi
Germany than traditional American values.&quot; 
<P>
Comments of this kind aim to establish a new intellectual
climate. Those who make such assertions see America's distrust
of drugs as an expression of its hangups. They think people who
oppose drugs are also opposed to sex, rock 'n roll, good times,
freedom, and love. The counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s
lives on: But its most influential partisans are not on college
campuses or in Greenwich Village coffee houses. They are meeting
at receptions and conferences where the well-connected and well-to-do
gather. 
<P>
The president of a leading &quot;harm reductionist&quot; organization
told the gathering at Soros's that the U.S. should emulate Colombia.
In 1991, Colombia decriminalized drugs and made the corrupt profits
legal. Of course the violence continues, and Colombia is to the
international drug rackets world what Cicero was to Chicago in
the days of Al Capone. In March, the United States finally decertified
Colombia's eligibility for foreign aid because of its failure
to combat drugs. 
<P>
Yet despite Colombia's example, the pro-legalizers in the
U.S. receive a respectful hearing. With former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elder's invitation to study legalization, Bill Buckley's
endorsement of legalization, and Soros's munificent funding, it
is not surprising that many well-intentioned people who began
as firm opponents of drugs have mistakenly concluded that, &quot;If
you can't beat 'em, join 'em.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="drug"><B>Drug Policy Foundation</B> </a>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., every cause needs its own think-tank.
In 1987 Arnold Trebach, a law professor at American University
in Washington and a long-time proponent of drug legalization,
established the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). 
<P>
DPF represents the Brooks Brothers wing of the decriminalization
movement. Besides Trebach, DPF's board includes Yale law professor
Steven Duke, ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser, Hoover Institution
Fellow Joseph MacNamara, Judge Robert Sweet from New York, Baltimore
Mayor Kurt Schmoke, Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon, Milton
Friedman, and David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato
Institute. The media organ of DPF is <I>The Drug Policy Letter.</I>

<P>
In the May 5, 1994 issue of <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine,
Aryeh Neier, president of Soros's Open Society Fund, was quoted
as saying, &quot;Soros doesn't think the drug war makes any sense
from an economic standpoint.&quot; The article explained that
in 1993 Soros gave DPF a &quot;set of suggestions to follow if
they wanted his assistance: Come up with an approach that emphasizes
`treatment and humanitarian endeavors,' he said . . . target a
few winnable issues, like medical marijuana and the repeal of
mandatory minimums.&quot; Apparently, they took his advice.

<P>
Besides generous support from Soros, the group has over 20,000
dues-paying members who are urged to be forthright, not furtive,
in their advocacy. Says David Condoliffe, DPF's vice-president
and the former New York City &quot;drug czar&quot; during the
Dinkins administration: &quot;Each person who cares about drug
reform must become actively involved, paying what he or she can
for DPF membership and listing five or more friends or associates,
and hosting fundraising events -- even on a small scale.&quot;
It has also received funding from such prominent philanthropies
as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, J. Roderick
MacArthur Foundation, Harold Simmons Foundation, Public Welfare
Foundation, and the Chicago Resource Center. 
<P>
The DPF organizes educational lobby sessions with documentaries,
coffee, and cake on Capitol Hill. They train drug legalization
advocates from Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany,
England, Australia, and Israel. 
<P>
A common feature of DPF activities is its careful avoidance
of direct references to drug legalization. Instead, spokesmen
call for &quot;alternative drug policies,&quot; harm reduction,
needle exchange programs, and &quot;responsible drug use.&quot;
DPF is also a grantmaker. According to <I>The Drug</I> <I>Policy
Letter</I>, DPF's Grant Program awards funds to &quot;successful
harm-reduction programs looking to expand their efforts, ranging
from needle exchange programs to peer counseling projects aimed
at `street youth'; for action-oriented grass-roots groups using
both the Internet and other communications methods to link reformers.
Furthermore, DPF believes that the drug policy debate cannot be
advanced unless Americans learn more about pioneering experiments
overseas.&quot; Perhaps the U.S. can emulate Switzerland, where
heroin and syringes are provided by the government. 
<P>
DPF grants have gone to such groups as the Cannabis Action
Network in Berkeley, California ($25,000), the Foundation on Drug
Policy and Human Rights in Amsterdam, the Netherlands ($15,000),
and Clean Needles Now in Los Angeles ($25,000). (See box).

According to the its<I> Drug Policy Letter</I>, DPF expected
to award one million dollars in additional grants by the end of
1995. However, the DPF and the Soros foundations do not publicly
list all the grants they award. 
<P>
DPF shares offices with several computer on-line groups such
as the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), formed in January, 1995,
and the Drug Reform Coordination Network (DRCNet), in action since
1993. Together with an on-line service run by the Lindesmith Center,
these services alert drug legalization advocates to what's happening
in Congress on drug issues and of current information on drug
enforcement, prevention, and treatment efforts. They also provide
warnings when more stringent laws are under consideration or when
new or extended anti-drug activity is undertaken. And they offer
advise on how to undermine government efforts to control drugs
and how to lobby for &quot;drug reform.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="NORML"><B>NORML: Selling Freedom?</B> </a>
<P>
Whereas DPF courts the establishment, the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) speaks for the beads
and sandals crowd. It makes no attempt to conceal its clear pro-legalization
stance. Founded by attorney Keith Stroup in 1970, NORML, which
is also based in Washington, is probably the best known of the
pro-legalization groups, and it was the first to lobby for the
legalization of marijuana in the U.S. Richard Cowan, who currently
heads the organization has claimed for NORML: &quot;We are selling
freedom, not marijuana.&quot; (<I>USA Today</I>, Nov. 25, 1994)

<P>
NORML contends that the ban on the use and sale of marijuana
threatens &quot;basic civil liberties.&quot; It supports the &quot;removal
of all penalties for the private possession of marijuana, cultivation
for personal use, and casual non-profit transfers of small amounts.&quot;
Large scale distribution would be taxed and regulated. 
<P>
NORML's board includes Kary Mullis, winner of the 1993 Nobel
Prize in chemistry; Louis Lasagna, Dean of the Sackler School
of Biomedical Science at Tufts University and chairman of the
National Academy of Science committee to study marijuana; Professor
John Morgan, author of the drug abuse section in the celebrated
<I>Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy</I>, and Lester Grinspoon,
a Harvard psychiatrist. 
<P>
NORML receives funds from eclectic sources. In addition to
grants from DPF and private contributions, rap groups such as
<I>Sacred Reich</I>, <I>Blues Traveler</I>, and <I>Cypress Hill</I>,
that perform under labels owned by Sony and Time Warner, are forwarding
to NORML the proceeds from the sales of their joint album <I>Hempilation</I>
(Capricorn Records), suggesting that &quot;because hemp is marijuana,
this will further the marijuana legalization efforts.&quot; (The
quote appears on the liner of the album along with a NORML membership
application.) The collection of songs is devoted to the &quot;wonders
of weed.&quot; These groups often display the marijuana leaf on
their albums, at their concerts, and on their promotional posters,
T-shirts and hats. Some of this merchandise is made of hemp, which
NORML promotes as an environment-friendly source for paper.

<P>
The group has over 100 chapters and affiliates around the
country. 
<P>
<a name="moral"><B>Moral Leadership: Where is it?</B> </a>
<P>
It is surprising that in this election year, drugs are not
a significant issue. Although there are no quick or easy fixes,
our political leaders ought to exercise moral leadership in speaking
out against the easy availability of drugs and those who sell
them. First Lady Nancy Reagan's &quot;Say No to Drugs&quot; campaign
demonstrated leadership. George Soros, on the other hand, is demonstrating
yet again what money can buy. What is spare change for him has
made important inroads in the public's opinions about drugs.

<P>
The counter-offensive against the drug war is succeeding by
causing the American public to begin to doubt its wisdom. Americans
need to understand the full magnitude of the movement to surrender
to drugs. 
<P>
The pro-legalization movement is far from winning the &quot;war
against the war.&quot; But if the proponents of legalization are
victorious, it would not be the first time that a persistent counterculture,
led by highly educated individuals in elite institutions, heavily
funded, and supported by many in the media, was able to reverse
deep-seated beliefs and the will of the majority of the American
people. Only this time, it will lead to the devastation of our
culture and society.

<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Orphanage!  The word connotes bleakness;  Charles Dickens' British
vision has become our own, with some Faulkneresque grotesque added
in. Here Dr. Olasky argues that the conventional history of American
orphanages is a tale of sound and fury directed against the helpless,
with the absence of close government oversight leading to unmitigated
child abuse.  The real story, however, is richer; it shows how
good orphanages combatted both material and spiritual poverty
among children who would otherwise have been the truly wretched
of the earth. According to Olasky our bias toward accentuating
the negative in the history of orphanages has often led us to
eliminate the positive.</i>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The first orphanage in what is now the United States opened
in 1729 in New Orleans.  The second, the Bethesda Orphan House,
emerged in Georgia a dozen years later through the ardent fund-raising
of famed evangelist George Whitefield.  Such early efforts were
rare; not until the nineteenth century did homes specifically
devoted to orphaned or abandoned children become common in a land
where families were big and extra water for an orphan was often
thrown into the soup.     In the colonial era small children without
parents were taken in by relatives or cared for informally by
neighbors; older children were indentured to a master who would
teach them a trade. Apprenticeship bore no stigma since it was
common to send a child at 13 or so into another person's home
for training or education; all who had hands capable of work were
expected to use them at an early age.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   The growth of towns and the disruption that the Revolutionary
War created  led to a more structured approach toward orphans
by the end of the century.  The British seizure of Charleston,
S.C., in 1780 destroyed not only buildings but families so that
when the tide of independence after Yorktown washed out the occupying
forces some orphans remained. The Charleston city council appointed
commissioners to gather up parentless children and lodge them
in private homes, with the government paying for room and board.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later the commissioners appealed to the public for
contributions to build an orphanage, and-according to a mid-nineteenth-century
 account-&quot;all classes of citizens vied with each other in
the grateful work of contributions in money, labor, material and
services.&quot;    The Charleston orphanage was completed in 1794
and occupied by 115 children. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By 1800 there were five or seven orphanages in the United States;
sources vary as to the exact number.   Local governments promoted
the efforts by urging citizens to contribute to them, with members
of legislatures sometimes offering part of their salaries.  Typically,
a &quot;society of citizens&quot; would take the initiative; in
New York City, the New York Orphan Asylum Society in 1806 rented
a two-story frame house in Greenwich Village, hired a &quot;pious
and respectable man and his wife&quot; as superintendent and matron,
and mandated that &quot;The orphans shall be educated, fed and
clothed at the expense of the Society and at the Asylum.  They
must have religious instruction, moral example, and habits of
industry inculcated on their minds.&quot;  The &quot;Asylum&quot;-in
those days the word meant merely a place of security-opened with
twelve orphans in 1806, and soon expanded into a facility housing
200 orphans.
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Orphanages during those years shortly after passage of the first
amendment were religiously motivated; concerns about separation
of church and state voiced privately by Thomas Jefferson were
not in public evidence.  The Charleston city council in 1801 proposed
a contributions drive to erect a building for religious services
on orphanage land, with provision that the building &quot;be open
to the clergy of all denominations.&quot;  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; After a few years the New York Orphan Asylum Society received
a state subsidy for its care of orphans, but the emphasis on religious
instruction remained.  Americans understood in the nineteenth
century that government was not to establish any particular denomination
as a state church, but that government should not try to banish
God. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of orphanages grew throughout the first half of the
nineteenth century largely in connection with an outpouring of
evangelical benevolence, with women often in the forefront.  Petersburg,
Virginia females petitioned the legislature in 1812 for authorization
to set up an orphan asylum, for they were &quot;deeply impressed
with the forlorn and helpless situation of poor orphan female
children... and wish to snatch [them] from ignorance and ruin.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Every epidemic, such as the cholera disaster of 1832, created
orphans and new orphanage efforts; by 1850 there were between
71 and 77.  Individual and church contributions paid most of the
cost, but it was not unusual to have municipalities pay up to
a third, and for expenses to be held down through some work by
the orphans themselves; boys learned manual skills while making
repairs and girls under the instruction of a sewing teacher often
made clothes for all the residents. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By mid-century orphanages often were impressive buildings; the
orphan house in Charleston, after undergoing remodeling and enlargement
from 1853 to 1855, contained a spacious five stories.  The first
floor contained three dining rooms, three play rooms, and ten
other rooms, including a kitchen, pantry, and laundry room.  The
second story included classrooms, parlor and reception rooms,
and other rooms for sewing and office space.  Three upper stories
were largely bedroom space, with steam heat throughout.  Architects
reported that the building contained 2,355,000 bricks, 222 doors,
298 windows, and 39,000 feet of piping. 
<P>
<a name="net"><B>A Massive Network</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Civil War greatly expanded demand for orphanages, and the
supply skyrocketed to over 600 by 1880.  Character as well as
quantity changed however; early in the century a &quot;half-orphan&quot;
was supposed to live with a surviving parent, but in the late
1800s children of destitute single parents increasingly found
their way to orphanages.  The Protestant monopoly also disappeared
as Catholic and Jewish child care institutions proliferated. 
The New York Catholic Protectory, established in 1862, became
the largest children's institution in the United States.  Jewish
organizations dated from shortly before the war-both the Jewish
Foster Home of Philadelphia and the Association for the Relief
of Jewish Widows and Orphans on New Orleans were founded in 1855.
But deaths and massive immigration led to a huge network of institutions
that reached its peak between 1880 and 1920.  Most orphanages
were segregated by race, with institutions such as the Colored
Orphan Asylum in New York City becoming prominent. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The most comprehensive report about orphanages during this period
grew out of investigations by William P. Letchworth, commissioner
of the New York State Board of Charities in 1875.  Letchworth
visited some 130 institutions for children and came away with
positive impressions concerning nutritious food, safe living conditions,
and factors such as &quot;a high standard of personal cleanliness.&quot;
  Letchworth also emphasized religious and moral training, which
he thought a matter for the public interest because good citizenship
arose only when a child learned his &quot;obligations to the Deity&quot;
and was &quot;taught the importance of living an upright life.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Letchworth's 470 pages of detailed notes on his site visits
to the institutions throughout the state are valuable not only
for his physical descriptions but for his reporting  of how orphanage
managers saw their work. He quoted Mrs. Helen Mercy Woods,  the
 very trustworthy matron of the Onondaga County Orphan Asylum
in Syracuse, as explaining (contrary to our current stereotypes),
&quot;I do not believe in shutting children up, frightening them
or making them go without their meals.... I try to impress upon
them, especially upon the boys, that it is not what people do
for them that is going to avail, but what they do for themselves.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I endeavor to convince the boys that they can be any thing they
please if they will only try for it.  I do not see why they should
not fill positions of respectability as well as others.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Orphanage directors during the second half of the nineteenth
century saw their mission as not merely furnishing basic material
needs but creating model American citizens-particularly when they
dealt with children of immigrants.  They tried to instill virtues
such as thrift, self-reliance, and sobriety, and to create a capacity
for hard work; they believed in busy daily routines and strict
discipline. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The morning schedule at the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum featured
children rising at daybreak, attending a chapel service thirty
minutes later, and then marching quietly-two by two and holding
hands-to large dining halls with long tables.  There they were
segregated by sex, and anyone wishing an extra helping had to
raise his hand.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Similar schedules were followed throughout the land.  Mrs. F.B.
Tufts, matron of the Utica (New York) Orphan Asylum, was proud
of the routine her charges had in 1875: &quot;The children rise
at six o'clock, dress and wash, after which prayers are said in
the sitting room.  After breakfast the older children go to their
work.  The boys clear off the table, sweep the dining room, and
the girls make their own beds with the assistance of the superintendent.
 All assemble in the school at nine o'clock and remain there until
twelve, with the exception of an intermission of fifteen minutes.
Dinner is served at twelve, after which there is recreation until
half-past one, when they enter the schoolroom again and remain
till half-past four. After school they have recreation till five
o'clock.  Supper is served at five.  In winter they have supper
very soon after school.  The little girls set the tables and assist
in light branches of housework.  After supper the children play
till bedtime.  In winter the younger children go to bed about
seven, but the older ones are permitted to stay up a little later.
 Prayers are said before retiring.  Sometimes the children sing;
sometimes they repeat psalms.  The exercise is varied.&quot;
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Observers at the time generally considered such disciplined
activity to be benign, but critics of orphanages over the years
have muttered about regimentation and mean-spirited harshness.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; From 1850 on records show an increase in questioning whether
orphanage life was best for children in distress.
<P>
<a name="homes"><B>City Kids, Country Homes</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Constructive questioning underlay the efforts of Charles Brace,
a writer and missionary who felt called to gain firsthand knowledge
of how the orphaned or abandoned lived.  Settling in New York
City at mid-century, Brace visited &quot;centres of crime and
misery,&quot; and was then able to describe how &quot;the street-boys
were trained by older pickpockets and burglars for their nefarious
callings,&quot; and how &quot;little girls who flitted about with
baskets and wrapped in old shawls became familiar with vice before
they were out of childhood.&quot;   Brace soon set up six homes
for orphans and abandoned children that provided not only shelter
but classes in reading and industrial arts, along with Bible lessons.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The largest of the lodging houses served about 90,000 children
from 1854 through 1872.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Brace emphasized rules that would &quot;discourage pauperism&quot;
and show the rewards of honest work.  Instead of handing out clothes
upon request, Brace preferred to &quot;give the garments as rewards
for good conduct, punctuality, and industry.&quot;   Once they
came to know the children, housekeepers who saw cases of  dire
need could relieve them with less likelihood of deception and
without harm to the character-building process.  The best way
to turn often-troubled children into good citizens, he knew, was
to give them the security of adoption by a family. But there were
not enough willing families in New York City, and Brace agonized
over questions like, &quot;How were places to be found?... And
when the children were placed, how were their interests to be
watched over, and acts of oppression or hard dealing prevented
or punished?&quot;  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace hit upon the idea of allowing adults who took in children
to do good and do well at the same time.  He decided to try sending
children (aged seven to seventeen) to farmers' homes where-in
return for room, board, education, and personal attention-the
children would work part-time. Brace began by sending out to fellow
evangelicals a circular that proposed the economic arrangement
but also stressed the theological reasons for personal involvement:
&quot;Something must be done to meet the increasing crime and
poverty among the destitute children of New York.  As Christian
men, we cannot look upon this great multitude of unhappy, deserted,
and degraded boys and girls without feeling our responsibility
to God for them.... We bear in mind that One died for them, even
as for the children of the rich and happy.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Response was enormous; as Brace wrote, &quot;Hundreds of applications
poured in at once from the farmers and mechanics all through the
Union.&quot;  Brace and his associates then relied on  volunteer
committees in towns in upstate New York and throughout the Midwest-a
committee usually included the mayor, a minister, a newspaper
editor, a banker, and a storekeeper-to  each assume responsibility
for the placing of several dozen New York City boys in local families.
When a committee contacted Brace and told him it had publicized
the need through newspaper articles and preaching, and made plans
for temporary housing and feeding of the children, Brace would
send a carload of children on what became known as an &quot;orphan
train.&quot;    
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the children arrived, the committee attempted to make sure,
in Brace's words, that the children would &quot;find themselves
in comfortable and kind homes, with all the boundless advantages
and opportunities of the Western farmer's life about them.&quot;
That sounds too good to be true, but it generally was true for
over 91,000 children placed by Brace between 1853 and 1893. This
was for several reasons.  First, in small towns and in rural areas,
committee members had personal knowledge of applicants, and perversities
were hard to keep secret. Second, as Brace wrote, the process
of placing the children &quot;is carried on so publicly ... that
any case of positive abuse would at once be known and corrected
by the community itself.&quot;  Third, an agent visited newly-placed
children within a few months and checked for either pampering
or overwork-both of which were seen as pernicious.  In a culture
that preached compassion and practiced neighborly surveillance,
it appears that cases of neglect or abuse were rare.  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace's New York Children's Aid Society did prosecute two cases
of child abuse and occasionally removed children, generally when
parents reneged on their agreement to provide education.   Records
show occasional cases of farmers working children too long, and
of a few even evicting children when the demands of the harvest
were past.  Some children were placed several times before a good
match was made. But the typical result, even critics of the program
admitted, was portrayed in one report of an inspection tour: &quot;Wherever
we went we found the children sitting at the same table with the
families, going to the school with the children, and every way
treated as well as any other children.  Some whom we had seen
once in the most extreme misery, we beheld sitting, clothed and
clean ... and gaining a good name for themselves in their village.&quot;

<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;One reason for success probably was the willingness of Brace
and others to use economic incentives.  Since extra hands were
so useful on farms, some observers worried that the &quot;farmer,
while he appeared to be influenced by high motives, might be thinking
too much of the economic gains he would secure through the children
placed in his home.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace, however, argued that taking in a child from the slums
was often an emotionally-draining activity that should not be
economically-draining as well.  In an agricultural economy, Brace
suggested, child placement could be win-win for both child and
farmer.  His message was clear:  How much better to get orphans
into fresh air and a fresh life than to keep them cooped up in
an institution! 
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Journalistic support, for which Brace worked hard, helped to
spread that message.  &quot;I made it a point,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;to keep our movements, and the evils we sought to cure,
continually before the public in the columns of the daily journals.
Articles describing the habits and trials of the poor; editorials
urging the community to work in these directions [made the public]
thoroughly imbued with our ideas and a sense of the evils which
we sought to reform.&quot;
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Brace's Children's Aid Society was flattered by widespread imitation
of its methods.  The New York Foundling Hospital began sending
some young children to the New England and mid-Atlantic states.
 The Chicago Orphan Asylum sent its charges to downstate farms,
where farmers agreed to clothe and feed the children, treat them
kindly, and provide religious instruction. 
<P>
<a name="late"><B>The Late-nineteenth Century Mainstream</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of children in orphanages continued to grow during
the late nineteenth century, moving from 74,000 in 1880 to close
to 90,000 in 1900 and 110,000 in 1910.  The word &quot;orphanage&quot;
itself became a misnomer, as children of parents who were still
living but had problems with finances or alcohol found the institutions
safer and better than life at home.  Backers of orphanages near
the turn of the century still looked around and saw good work.
 Charleston Mayor George S. Bryan wrote  upon the 100th anniversary
of his local orphan house, in 1891, that &quot;I have lived long,
and have witnessed many anniversaries in Charleston, but none
ever gave me such unalloyed and absolute satisfaction.&quot; 
Bryan praised &quot;the discipline which has molded this matchless
institution, and which has harmonized all its details, and combined
them into a perfect and symmetrical whole.&quot; 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Praise for orphanages did not come only from politicians; journalists
and the children themselves noted the close relationships between
resident children and the superintendents who developed a long-term
bond with their charges.  Some 1960s-style historians sniffing
for oppression have scorned reports and records that show positive
interactions of most children and most supervisors, but Nurith
Zmora, in her excellent recently-published history of Baltimore
orphanages, provides specific detail of compassion at work.  One
orphanage principal, she notes, &quot;was everywhere, watching
carefully every detail of the girls' education, discussing their
future vocations with them, and encouraging them to excel.  She
knew when to be soft and kind and when to be tough and strict.&quot;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Another superintendent &quot;knew each child's tendency, talents,
and weaknesses and was there to encourage and develop the talents
or correct the mistakes.&quot; 
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Some late19th- and early 20th-century orphanages did provide
fodder for stereotypes, but many others displayed patterns of
discipline combined with love.  When a pastor from Vicksburg journeyed
to the Palmer Home for Children in Columbus, Mississippi  to drop
off four children, he ended up staying two days. He wrote to the
superintendent: &quot;I have never seen a healthier or happier
looking lot of children.... What pleased me most was the family
atmosphere of it.... I noticed that the children ran over to your
house whenever they felt like it with the same confidence that
any little child runs to its father's house.&quot;   Some orphanages
battled not criticism but also the patterns of segregation that
dominated American society.  When Father Edward J. Flanigan opened
his Boy's Home in Omaha, which soon became the famed Boy's Town,
he made it officially color-blind, and stuck to his policy of
integration even when townspeople protested the &quot;mingling
of races.&quot;
<P>
 
<P>
<a name="critic"><B>Early Critics</B></a>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, even though the quality of care was evident to observers,
reporting of orphanages started to turn negative in tone.  Much
of the criticism had an ideological tinge, portraying  what had
seemed to be a virtuous solution to children's needs as materially
satisfactory but psychologically inhumane.  In 1893, two years
after the Charleston celebration, Chicago orator Jenkin Lloyd
Jones praised with faint damn the eleven homes for children within
the windy city: &quot;It is not that these massive buildings with
their 'modern improvements,' well-heated and well-ventilated,
and in the main well managed, are not much better than something
worse.&quot;  He noted that orphanages had trained many children
in &quot;habits of usefulness, making of them self-reliant and
self-supporting men and women.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But that was not enough, according to Jones.  &quot;I believe
there is a more excellent way,&quot; he exulted.  &quot;I know
not which to pity the more, the boy who knows not where his tomorrow's
dinner is to come from, or that other boy, dressed in uniform,
at least when he goes to meeting, who is scrubbed by rule, fed
from a printed bill of fare, who always knows on what days bean
or potato soup is to be expected; who knows which are pie and
which are pudding days; the boy who is marched to the table, marched
to his playground, marched to his bed....&quot;  Jones made it
clear that he pitied the child in that &quot;unnatural classification&quot;
known as an orphanage, because he was being forced to abandon
his old, free nature and take on a new style of thinking and living.

<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The positive example of what Charles Brace and others had accomplished,
along with the negative reputation orphanages were beginning to
have, combined to push orphanages down a slippery slope of early-1900s
social unpopularity.  Two White House Conferences on the Care
of Dependent Children in 1909 and 1919, bent in an anti-orphanage
direction: single mothers were to receive financial aid so children
could stay at home, and orphans or those completely abandoned
should be placed in foster care.  The 1919 conference specified
that, &quot;The carefully selected foster home is for the normal
child the best substitute for the natural home.&quot;   Orphanages
were places where matrons suppressed that &quot;old, free nature&quot;
of children. Washington-centric social workers tended to overlook
the ways in which orphanages were functioning as a good alternative
for many children who would otherwise have led miserable lives.
  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; On the eve of World War I large cities sported an amazing variety:
Baltimore had 28, including twelve Catholic, two Jewish, seven
declared Protestant, and seven labeled private but organized and
run by Protestant philanthropists.  (There were also race and
ethnic divides: six were for blacks, three for Germans, two for
the Irish, and one for Russian Jews)   As Nurith Zmora notes,
some of today's historians would call the typical Baltimore orphanage
&quot;a jail-like institution; they would assume that it was depressing
in appearance  and oppressive in its overreliance on harsh discipline,
rigid routine, and lack of respect for the individual.&quot; And
yet, orphans themselves, interviewed later, tended to attribute
their &quot;success in life to the upper-middle-class education
and culture provided by the charitable institution....&quot; 
 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The number of children in orphanages peaked in the 1920s, with
the census bureau recording 143,000 residents in 1923.  Most were
small, with one-fourth holding fewer than 30 children and 65 percent
housing fewer than 80.  But anti-institutionalism was flourishing
in the roaring twenties-one founder of a family care agency, Dr.
Henry Dwight Chapin, argued in 1926 that the United States was
an &quot;institution-ridden country.&quot;  Orphanages of all
sizes were tarred with that brush.  Furthermore, as more children
of living parents who were troubled or temporarily impoverished
entered orphanages, the children frequently became short-timers
and one of the pro-orphanage arguments-the stability that they
could bring to the lives of confused children-became less salient.

<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Brace concept of emphasizing homes rather than institutions
for orphans triumphed finally in the 1930s, but with a twist.
 As early as the 1880s and 1890s, a few agencies, convinced ideologically
that labor was not good for children, had begun paying foster
parents for boarding children so that the children would not have
to work.   By the 1930s, however, there was little choice in the
matter; industrialization and urbanization had so transformed
the American landscape that open-armed farm families were no longer
available in abundance.  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Brace had done wonderful work in his time, and most of the
charitable procedures he fought for in the nineteenth century
were still usable in the twentieth, but this one was not.  When
families that housed children would no longer be financially recompensed
they now had to look to government for their monthly bread, and
that government was heading toward bloated bureaucracy. 
<P>
<a name="over"><B>Oversimplifications Have Consequences</B></a>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Other problems with the new conventional wisdom soon emerged:
 Institutions were bad, homes were good. But most of the children
who needed help had a surviving parent or parents who had not
freed children for adoption, so the homes they would find would
be temporary, and children yanked from home to home were in less
stable conditions than the orphanages had provided.  Homes were
good, but non-farm parents would have to be paid to provide temporary
shelter, and such responsibility in the New Deal era was of course
governmental, so states started to pay for foster care.  Government
bureaucrats who supervised foster placement developed an empire-building
economic incentive to keep children in foster care rather than
place them in permanent adoptive homes.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Even in the 1920s there were wrenching scenes at the Hebrew
Orphan Asylum in Baltimore as children were selected for foster
families; many not wanting to leave behind orphanage friends and
siblings, but having to go.   By the late 1940s it was clear that
foster care was not a panacea; Michael Sharlitt, who grew up in
an orphanage and later ran one, noted at that time the problem
of children becoming disoriented as they went through a succession
of foster homes.  Nevertheless, federal funding emerged for urban
area foster care in 1951; the increase in available dollars, along
with an epidemic of journalistic articles about child abuse during
the 1960s, led to a dramatic increase in foster care.   Orphanages
were largely forgotten in the popular press until Newt Gingrich
brought up the subject late in 1994, and gave journalists an opportunity
to clank the chains of Christmas past.

<P>
I don't have to look at a U.S. flag in the toilet to know it's
wrong,&quot; Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said on April
2nd. He was calling on the Phoenix Art Museum to cancel an exhibit
which featured one flag draped inside a porcelain toilet surrounded
by a jail cell and another placed on the floor to be stepped on.
<P>
Outside the museum American Legion veterans had protested the
flag abuse while inside eleven-year-old Fabian Montoya took up
the banner from the floor and folded it carefully. Museum curators
quickly replaced the flag. Director Jim Ballinger defended the
action, telling the Arizona Republic that to protect the flag
&quot;would be censorship.&quot; He declared, &quot;the artists
here are just celebrating their First Amendment rights.&quot;
<P>
Gingrich responded, &quot;When I talk about elite versus classic
American values, I think the Phoenix art exhibit is a perfect
example.&quot;
<P>
The culture that permits an arts administrator to defend flag
desecration is in great measure the culture created and funded
during the past fifteen years by the major foundations. And among
all the foundations supporting the arts, perhaps the most committed
to the goals of cultural affront and multicultural diversity --
and the anti-Americanism which goes with it -- is the Rockefeller
Foundation. It is the legacy of a living dynasty whose members
are still active in business, politics, and the arts.
<P>
Historian John Fonte wrote recently in National Review that schoolchildren
now learn &quot;that instead of one people the United States of
America consists of many diverse 'peoples.'&quot; He argues that
a multi-ethnic America has been reinterpreted through the lens
of &quot;the multiculturalist agenda [that] is shattering the
American identity.&quot; For at least a decade, that agenda has
been official policy for the Rockefeller Foundation.
<P>
<a name="rock"><b>ROCKEFELLER VS. STANDARDS</b></a>
<P>
John Frohnmayer, former chairman of the National Endowment for
the Arts during the Bush Administration, claims that since the
NEA's establishment in 1965, the Rockefeller Foundation has been
important precisely because it has &quot;sought out the under-represented
outside the mainstream in the arts.&quot; While some grantmaking
foundations fund the popular arts and others give to traditional
venues such as the opera, symphony orchestras and ballet, the
Rockefeller Foundation, says Frohnmayer, has consistently supported
the &quot;cutting edge.&quot;
<P>
Reached at his home in Bozeman, Montana, Frohnmayer told Foundation
Watch that he &quot;always considered the Rockefeller Foundation
very valuable in supporting the National Endowment for the Arts.&quot;
The Rockefeller Foundation's support is more than moral: it has
supplied millions of dollars in matching funds over the years
for NEA special projects.
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation's early arts funding was praiseworthy,
focusing on both popular and high art and on support for performing
arts complexes such as New York City's Lincoln Center and the
American Center in Paris [see Foundation Watch vol.1, no.2 for
an account of the Center's demise]. However, according to its
own official history, presented in Senate testimony in 1990, the
Rockefeller Foundation gradually came to see its role as &quot;supporting
work which is not yet validated by time and which may not be recognized
or valued by others.&quot; This is the sort of new work, funded
on the basis of &quot;judgement of peer artists and experts&quot;
that would get the NEA in trouble in 1989.
<P>
While the Rockefeller Foundation might have gotten the NEA off
the political hook by privately funding the most controversial
works that were receiving NEA grants, instead it chose to strong-arm
the NEA to continue its support for the avant-garde.
<P>
The result: NEA funding dropped from a high of some $180 million
to its current $99.5 million appropriation. Mired in a series
of federally-funded fiascos over the works of Andres Serrano,
Robert Mapplethope, Joel-Peter Witkin, Karen Finley, Holly Hughes,
Tim Miller, John Fleck, Ron Athey, and the most recent flag incident
in Arizona, the NEA continues to confound its supporters and infuriate
its opponents by being unable to see the difference between insulting
and honoring the public's trust.
<P>
In 1990, Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark, Jr.
testified to Congress against &quot;standards&quot; for NEA-supported
art in the wake of the Mapplethorpe and Serrano controversies.
<P>
He argued, &quot;I think if it is possible to make a strong case
to put into law a standard about whether something is religiously
acceptable or whether it is obscene, no matter how harmlessly
it appears to be phrased, then I think it will likely be possible
for someone else to say we ought to have a standard that has to
do with whether the art appears to support evolution or whether
it does not, or whether it appears to be patriotic or whether
it does not. I would suggest to you, let us stay away from the
road of State involvement in content. I would argue to you that
is the only safe way in our society for the State to support the
arts.&quot;
<P>
Despite Goldmark's testimony, the NEA was reauthorized in 1990
with the stipulation that NEA awards should be made after consideration
of &quot;general standards of decency and respect for the diverse
beliefs and values of the American people.&quot; Goldmark had
failed to convince Congress, but his minions had more luck with
officials at the NEA.
<P>
<a name="friend"><b>WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE...</b></a>
<P>
In his memoir of his life as a federal arts bureaucrat, Leaving
Town Alive (Houghton Mifflin, 1993), Frohnmayer recalls that he
suspended a NEA grant for a New York art gallery called Artist's
Space in 1989 because its material was &quot;cruder and potentially
more problematic than Mapplethorpe's photos.&quot; Frohnmayer
told Susan Wyatt, the gallery's director, that among other items
in the show, &quot;at least one photo of masturbation was potentially
obscene.&quot; Moreover, the artist, David Wojnarowicz, whose
work was prominently featured, called New York's John Cardinal
O'Connor &quot;a fat cannibal&quot; in the exhibit catalogue.
<P>
Frohnmayer decided to see the New York City exhibit for himself.
Upon arriving at the gallery, he was confronted with demonstrators,
camera crews swarmed about him, and a banner flew from a building
across the street denouncing the National Endowment for the Arts.
Wrote Frohnmayer, &quot;The scene reminded me of Tom Wolfe's descriptions
of the Bronx courthouse in Bonfire of the Vanities.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It was an extremely unpleasant situation,&quot; Frohnmayer
told Foundation Watch. &quot;I went there because I wanted to
talk to them and see the show for myself.&quot; In his book, Frohnmayer
describes a meeting with art world denizens who confronted him
over his decision to suspend the grant.
<P>
The group, he recalls, included David Wojnarowicz and leaders
of ACT UP, a group advocating radical gay rights; Andres Serrano,
whose &quot;Piss Christ&quot; photo of a crucifix in urine helped
start the NEA controversy; Martha Wilson, the director of the
Manhattan &quot;performance space&quot; called Franklin Furnace,
where Annie Sprinkle had offered her private parts for public
examination and told the audience the show was &quot;government
funded,&quot;; Nan Goldin, the curator of the exhibition; and
twenty or so others. Among those there, Frohnmayer clearly recalls,
was &quot;Alberta Arthurs, of the Rockefeller Foundation.&quot;
<P>
How did the group treat the new Chairman of the NEA in his moment
of crisis? Did they offer their services to protect the agency
from a potentially damaging political confrontation while taking
care of their &quot;cutting edge&quot; constituency with private
money? To the contrary.
<P>
Frohnmayer describes the occasion vividly: &quot;I said I had
come to listen. What I heard was a series of ad hominem attacks,
something that never before, in my pleasant existence, had been
directed at me. 'You have politicized the NEA.' 'You are a coward.'
'You have sold out the artists of this country; you should resign.'
'How do you feel about men kissing each other?' 'Why don't you
fight for removal of the language that Congress passed if you
don't like it?'
<P>
&quot;After about thirty minutes of listening to people beat up
on me, I was able to direct the conversation toward what the Arts
Endowment could do in the future,&quot; Frohnmayer wrote. &quot;I
didn't like the personal attacks, but I considered them part of
the price I had to pay to work myself out of this self-inflicted
mess. I was numb; my emotions were on hold. Only a solution mattered.&quot;
In other words, as Frohnmayer put it, &quot;We were in the process
of being had for at least the second time.&quot; And in a most
rude and unpleasant manner.
<P>
While Frohnmayer noted that Alberta Arthurs was present during
his battering, he cautioned that he thought &quot;it was not a
situation orchestrated by the Rockefeller Foundation.&quot; Yet
despite his visible discomfort, Arthurs (director of Arts and
Humanities for the Rockefeller Foundation) had said not a word
to defend Frohnmayer while he endured the torrent of verbal and
psychological abuse.
<P>
Frohnmayer confessed he was grateful to have been there in New
York for the experience. &quot;I felt the Rockefeller Foundation
was a valuable ally,&quot; he told Foundation Watch. &quot;They
had the very strong feeling that the underrepresented voices ought
to be heard.&quot; And who were the &quot;underrepresented?&quot;
Frohnmayer said it was &quot;clear&quot; that &quot;the group
way on the left was underrepresented.&quot; He estimated these
were &quot;about 20-30% of the American population.&quot;
<P>
Frohnmayer's own account to Foundation Watch presents a scene
of ideological rectification worthy of Darkness at Noon. He had
obviously strayed from the art world party line, had to endure
a self-criticism session with the relevant arts commissars and
ideological enforcers, and confess to his sins before returning
to Washington.
<P>
In retrospect, Frohnmayer concludes, &quot;They wanted to make
a point. You have to say they made their point.&quot; And he adds
that following his visit to New York, &quot;I restored the grant.&quot;
<P>
The NEA funds &quot;cutting-edge&quot; works like these, in part,
because, like a battered spouse, it has come to depend on being
tormented by grantmakers like the Rockefeller Foundation. While
the Foundation purports to defend the NEA from attacks by Congress,
it joins the &quot;arts community&quot; in abusing the NEA's processes
while denouncing the agency's integrity. The Rockefeller Foundation,
for instance, made grants to the American Civil Liberties Union
and others to sue the NEA on behalf of the artists denied grants
for offensive material: The ACLU claimed &quot;free expression&quot;
required overturning the law that the NEA respect &quot;general
standards of decency.&quot;
<P>
<a name="ludlow"><b>THE LEGACY OF LUDLOW</b></a>
<P>
No member of the Rockefeller family currently sits on the Foundation's
fifteen-member board of trustees. The family absence is a legacy
of the Foundation's role in the aftermath of the &quot;Ludlow
Massacre,&quot; which occured in 1913, the same year the Foundation
had been established. That year two women and eleven children
living in a striker's camp at the Rockefeller-dominated Colorado
Fuel and Iron company died during a raid by National Guard troops.
As Martin Morse Wooster notes in The Great Philanthropies and
the Problem of Donor Intent (Capital Research Center, 1994), &quot;the
'Ludlow Massacre' quickly became a cause celebre for the left.
Novelist Upton Sinclair picketed John D. Rockefeller's home, and
in New York City, four members of the Industrial Workers of the
World died when a bomb [intended for Rockefeller] exploded prematurely
in their apartment.&quot;
<P>
At the suggestion of Harvard president Charles Eliot, the Rockefeller
Foundation hired Mackenzie King, a Canadian politician to study
labor relations at Rockefeller-controlled businesses and improve
John D's image.
<P>
The move backfired badly. In public hearings government officials
grilled King and Rockefeller public relations advisor Ivy Lee,
and concluded that &quot;the huge philanthropic trusts, known
as foundations, appear to be a menace to the welfare of society&quot;
because they gave the wealthy a mechanism &quot;to become molders
of public thought.&quot;
<P>
Under pressure, Rockefeller transferred control over his fortune
to his children in 1916, and control over the foundation to his
son John D. Rockefeller, Jr. who, according to Wooster, made it
a principle to &quot;erect a firm wall between the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Rockefellers' personal affairs.&quot; The younger
Rockefeller also replaced his father's friends and business associates
on the Foundation board with pillars of progressivism.
<P>
Soon the reconstituted Foundation was rejecting a grant proposal
from John D. Rockefeller himself. He wanted to replace textbooks
&quot;calculated to lead astray and do harm rather than good&quot;
and he proposed to fund education with &quot;the most sane and
practical and possible views of life rather than...socialism and
some forms of Bolshevism.&quot; Rockefeller's lawyer, Starr Murphy
&quot;was aghast&quot; at this proposal and wrote &quot;it would
be extremely unwise for any donor to attempt to place limitations
on the character of the teaching which shall be given in an institution
to which he contributes.&quot; The divorce of the family from
the foundation was set.
<P>
To reconnect the Rockefeller families to the charities it had
created, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund was created in 1941 by
John D. Rockefeller 3rd, Nelson, Lawrence, Winthrop, and David.
Subsequently, the Rockefeller &quot;cousins&quot; also created
their own charitable vehicles. But the original Rockefeller Foundation
itself remained firmly in the hands of a liberal establishment
independent of the family.<a name="vocab"></a>
<P>
<b>THE MULTICULTURAL<br>
VOCABULARY OF THE BOARD</b>
<P>
Today, the legacy of an independent Rockefeller Foundation lives
on. One current board member characterizes the Rockefeller Foundation
Board of Trustees as &quot;more of a Who's Who board than a Social
Register board.&quot;
<P>
The current chair is Alice Stone Ilchman, president of Sarah Lawrence
College. Establishmentarians past and present like C. Douglas
Dillon, Cyrus Vance, and the late Dean Rusk have served, as have
media figures like pundit Bill Moyers, actor Alan Alda, and former
Times-Mirror Chairman Tom Johnson, now head of CNN, and the late
Disney exective Frank Wells. It is no surprise, then, that the
Rockefeller Foundation enjoys exceptionally good press coverage.
<P>
Moreover, as one observer remarked to Foundation Watch, &quot;When
you have two billion dollars you don't have any public relations
problems. Everybody loves you&quot;.
<P>
Perhaps for these reasons, and despite the increasing notoriety
of multiculturalism's excesses, the role of the Rockefeller Foundation
has escaped public criticism. The Rockefeller Foundation's officers
and staff have been careful to avoid the limelight and declined
to respond to Foundation Watch's requests for interviews. However,
several current and former board members freely offered their
opinions of the Foundation's cultural agenda.
<P>
The immediate former chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board
of directors is Dr. John Robert Evans, a Canadian physician and
educator who is currently chairman of the parent company of the
Toronto Star. He told Foundation Watch that the board of trustees
had approved the Foundation's commitment to diversity and multiculturalism
because of the importance of &quot;understanding difficulties
across cultures&quot; and the need to appreciate &quot;the strength
of African American and Hispanic arts.&quot; Evans, who has served
on the Rockefeller Foundation board for fourteen years, explained
that the board's &quot;general tendency was to look at 'emerging'
areas&quot; in the arts and humanities rather than fund traditional
artistic disciplines and institutions. He said the &quot;style
of the Rockefeller Foundation&quot; was that &quot;non-expert
trustees take an interest&quot; in all areas of giving, including
the cultural realm.
<P>
Another Rockefeller director said the board was influenced greatly
in the direction of multiculturalism by a Hudson Institute report
called Workforce 2000 issued in the early 1980's. Its analysis
of demographic trends suggested that women and and minorities
held the key to America's social and economic future. However,
a source close to the Hudson Institute told Foundation Watch that
the Rockefeller Foundation &quot;took the wrong message out of
Workforce 2000. The message was that there was a problem in levels
of skills and education, not that we needed 'cultural sensitivity
training.'&quot; The source added that Hudson is currently working
on Workforce 2000 Revisited, which will make an explicit case
against multiculturalism.
<P>
Trustee Daniel P. Garcia, a vice-president of Warner Brothers
and head of the Los Angeles Airport Commission, also told Foundation
Watch that the board of directors was committed to multiculturalism
and diversity. Garcia is a former chairman of the now-defunct
Los Angeles Festival, a multi-ethnic assemblage of street fairs
and performances which banned Eurocentric theatre and dance. The
L.A. Festival was supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.
<P>
A Vietnam veteran and advisor to Republican Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, Garcia says he is proud that a Rockefeller Foundation
grant enabled &quot;the Bellas Artes&quot; dance troupe to come
from Mexico City to New York. Culture, he asserts, &quot;is not
a Eurocentric affair.&quot;
<P>
No art lover would deny Garcia's truism, but there is a vast difference
between a national folkloric dance ensemble and the ethnocentric
&quot;performance artists&quot; Time magazine critic Robert Hughes
has called &quot;all-purpose Barbarians.&quot;
<P>
In The Culture of Complaint (Oxford, 1993), Hughes points out
that &quot;multiculturalism means something less than genuine
curiousity about other cultural forms.&quot; It is unavoidable,
says Hughes, that, &quot;Most art made by white Americans is mediocre.
Most art made by black Americans is mediocre. Most art made by
Chinese-Americans, Japanese-Americans, and American Indians is
mediocre, too. And most art made by women is as mediocre as most
art made by men. The same applies to gays and straights and to
all the other polarities. We must therefore be extremely wary
of the sentimentality that institutional multiculturalism brings.&quot;
<P>
Yet this common-sense view from a respected art critic is out
of favor at the Rockefeller Foundation. Garcia says that Alberta
Arthurs, the Rockefeller Foundation's director of arts and humanities
for the past decade, has promoted diversity and multiculturalism
by following the &quot;general policy&quot; of the board of directors.
In 1990, Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark submitted
a copy of this policy to the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Its declared goal: &quot;The encouragement of creative artists...whose
work can advance international and intercultural work in this
country...supporting the flow of art between Third World cultures
and the United States, and increasing opportunities...for ethnic
populations in the United States.&quot;
<P>
At least one insider, however, is not impressed with Rockefeller's
policy, noting: &quot;What goes on at Rockefeller is that they
are just another group following the way culture seems to be going.
Large foundations are followers, not leaders, of what's going
on in the world.&quot;<a name="record"></a>
<P>
<b>THE ROCKEFELLER RECORD</b>
<P>
This was not always the case. The official mission of the Foundation
is to promote &quot;the well-being of mankind throughout the world.&quot;
In the sciences, for example, the Rockefeller Foundation has a
proud legacy of leadership in eliminating such infectious diseases
as yellow fever and hookworm. The Foundation also has played a
leading role in the so-called &quot;green revolution&quot; that
has spurred agricultural productivity through scientific research.
To this day, approximately fifty percent of the Foundation's budget
goes to three areas where it has been a pioneer: public health,
agriculture, and population control. Indeed, John D. Rockefeller
3rd once joked to reporters, &quot;If my parents had been exposed
to today's ideas of family planning, my brothers Win [Winthrop,
former Governor of Arkansas] and David [former chairman of the
Chase Manhattan Bank] might not have made it.&quot;
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation is the eighth largest foundation in
the United States, with an asset portfolio worth some $2,364,552,922,
according to the most recent accounting in The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
In 1993 the Foundation distributed grants of some $93,260,988,
a little under four percent of assets.
<P>
Today the Foundation has an annual arts and humanities budget
of about $13 million, not including the Bellagio Study Center
in Italy, which provides accomodation for scholars and artists.
From 1965 to 1989 the Foundation spent about $73 million on the
arts. In 1993, the Rockefeller Foundation ranked eleventh in giving
to the arts and seventh in giving to the humanities, according
to appendices in Looking Ahead: Private Sector Giving to the Arts
and Humanities (December, 1995), a Foundation-sponsored study
for the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Author
Nina Kressner Cobb's analysis reveals that Rockefeller spent about
three times as much on the arts (161 grants totalling $10,403,575)
as on the humanities ($3,405,150 for 38 grants).
<P>
But Rockefeller's influence exceeds even its large size. The reasons
are manifold. The Rockefeller name alone, despite the absence
of actual family control, associates the Foundation not only with
great wealth, but with great American cultural institutions: the
University of Chicago, New York's Museum of Modern Art and the
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, institutions which command
respect and due deference. Moreover, the Rockefeller family and
various Foundations have been enormously influential in the formation
of a national arts policy, a notion unheard of before the 1960s.
<P>
For example, The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a family grantmaker,
paid for the 1965 study The Performing Arts: Problems and Prospects
(McGraw-Hill) conducted by a Rockefeller Panel chaired by John
D. Rockefeller 3rd, and staffed by Nancy Hanks, later to become
National Endowment for the Arts chairman. The establishment of
the National Endowment for the Arts can be traced directly to
that report.
<P>
Just as the Rockefellers rationalized, bureaucratized and attempted
to monopolize the oil industry, their institutional offspring
have performed the same function for a once-freewheeling arts
world. The arts grantsmakers have mangaged the growth of arts
administration by funding the creation of a corporate and government
arts bureaucracy (sometimes called &quot;public-private partnership&quot;)
to replace the once all-powerful individual impresario. For the
Rockefeller Foundation, three individuals have been key.<a name="hanks"></a>
<P>
<b>NANCY HANKS: PRESENT AT THE CREATION</b>
<P>
Nancy Hanks did not work directly for the Rockefeller Foundation.
Beginning in 1953, Hanks worked as confidential assistant to Nelson
Rockefeller, with whom she &quot;fell hopelessly in love,&quot;
according to Alice Goldfarb Marquis's account in Art Lessons:
Learning from the Rise and Fall of Public Arts Funding (Basic
Books, 1995).
<P>
Over the years, Marquis says, Hanks &quot;was so enchanted with
her lover that she mended his socks, baked his birthday cake,
and paid for lunch, when, as usual, he had no cash in his wallet.&quot;
<P>
In return, &quot;Nelson showered her with gifts, including airline
tickets, drawings and etchings by Degas and Picasso, and a $200,000
securities portfolio.&quot; Marquis says the romance ended in
1955 when a press aide to the newly-elected Governor of New York
State told Rockefeller he had to &quot;get her out of here.&quot;
In 1956 she was made a key staffer for the Special Studies Project
of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
<P>
Although she had been &quot;shipped out,&quot; Hanks &quot;remained
a creature of the Rockefeller family,&quot; researching arts policy
for the Rockefeller report and helping to found the Arts Council
of America, still a powerful arts lobby.
<P>
Former NEA Chairman Livingston Biddle, then a top staffer for
Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI), remembers that Nancy Hanks accompanied
John D. Rockefeller 3rd when he testified before Congress in 1965
on the NEA's behalf. Biddle recalled in his memoir, Our Government
and the Arts (American Council on the Arts, 1989), &quot;I am
sure that Nancy's fine hand was visible in the Rockefeller statement.&quot;
<P>
After the election, and backed by &quot;Rockefeller Republicans,&quot;
Hanks was appointed the second chairman of the NEA by Richard
Nixon in 1969. On her watch the NEA budget increased fifteen-fold.
In 1966 the agency had only 28 full-time staffers. By 1977 Hanks
presided over 220 employees processing over 14,000 grant applications
annually.
<P>
Then-Congressman John Brademas (D-IN), later to serve on the Rockefeller
Foundation Board and currently chairman of the President's Committee
on the Arts and Humanities, is reported by Marquis to have &quot;noted
with some envy that 'a well-placed call from Nancy triggers calls
from all over the country and these people can exercise considerable
pressure.'&quot;
<P>
When President Nixon reappointed Hanks to the NEA chairmanship
in 1973, he joked that NEA funding had increased by 900 percent.
&quot;That is why we are reappointing you here,&quot; he said.
&quot;We don't want anything else increasing by that amount.&quot;
<P>
Even when controversy erupted over the NEA's support of controversial
items like Erica Jong's feminist comic best-seller Fear of Flying
or a one word poem _ the word was &quot;LIGHGHT&quot; _ which
received a $500 grant, Hanks used her connections and political
savvy to quell opposition. While not an employee of the Rockefeller
Foundation, Hank's example has inspired the generation of cultural
bureaucrats who followed her.<a name="center"></a>
<P>
<b>THE CENTER AND THE MARGINS</b>
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation has not always always been committed
to the cultural margins. In the 1960's, most of the grants were
for more mainstream projects. A Rockefeller Foundation time-line,
called The Rockefeller Foundation: 1913 to 1988, bears witness
to this trend.
<P>
In 1935 the Foundation established the film library at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York. In 1936 it supported travelling productions
of Shakespearean drama. In 1942 the academic discipline of American
cultural studies was established with Rockefeller funds, which
also subsidized Dumas Malone's biography of Thomas Jefferson.
<P>
In 1946, Rockefeller gave some $7.5 million for education of Southern
blacks.The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were among the earliest
backers of Lincoln Center in New York, giving matched donations
of $2.5 million each in 1957. In 1962 the Rockefeller Foundation
gave $7 million to support publication of the Lincoln, Hamilton,
Madison, and Wilson papers. In 1963 some $85 million provided
scholarships for black university students, and summer tutoring
programs at Princeton, Dartmouth and Oberlin. In 1967 major grants
went to the Eliot Feld Ballet, the North Carolina Dance Theatre,
and the Agnes de Mille Dance Theater.
<P>
However, in 1967 major grants also went to the &quot;experimental&quot;
La Mama Theatre Company and to Joseph Papp's Public Theatre. In
1973 Rockefeller began funding &quot;women's studies&quot; programs
at Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence, and Harvard Divinity School. In
1978 the Foundation commissioned a report on the &quot;crisis&quot;
in the humanities. In 1981 the Foundation supported minimalist
composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich.
<P>
After the NEA became operational in the late 1960's the role of
the grantmaking foundations changed. Instead of providing grants
which would allow arts institutions to flourish in an essentially
private sector economy, the foundations would now make provocative
grants to supplement the public sector support on which arts institutions
grew increasingly dependent, and to &quot;leverage&quot; public
support for the avant-garde.
<P>
Michael Straight, NEA's deputy director in the Nixon administration
indicates in his book Twigs for an Eagle's Nest (Devon Press,
1979) that &quot;A number of foundations agreed [with the primacy
of the federal role] and decided to cut back their support for
the arts.&quot; Straight, who later confessed that he was the
&quot;fifth man&quot;- turned FBI informant in the 1930s Kim Philby
Cambridge spy ring, was Nancy Hanks's troubleshooter at the NEA,
responsible for &quot;flagging&quot; controversial grants such
as one to George Plimpton's The American Literary Anthology for
a pornographic Ed Sanders story.
<P>
That was then. Private sources could and did take up the slack
in the &quot;flagged&quot; cases. But in the 1980's the Rockefeller
Foundation decided that its priority would be not only to fund
that which would not otherwise be funded, but to insist that the
Federal government fund it, too.<a name="power"></a>
<P>
<b>PETER GOLDMARK: POWER OPERATOR</b>
<P>
By the mid 1980s The Rockefeller Foundation's had strengthened
its commitment to the multicultural agenda. That agenda is shared
by two key figures, Peter Goldmark and Alberta Arthurs. Through
their control of Rockefeller's arts budget, they share responsibility
for the trend in giving which places &quot;diversity&quot; ahead
of quality in the arts.
<P>
Peter C. Goldmark, Jr., age 56, is the current president of the
Rockefeller Foundation. He was recruited to his position in 1988
by his employer, Times Mirror president Thomas Johnson who, as
a Foundation director, headed a search committee established by
the board. At the time, Goldmark was a senior vice-president of
the Eastern division of Times Mirror. (Goldmark's succeeded Richard
Lyman, a former Stanford University president who resigned under
savage criticism over his performance. Lyman's record was &quot;slouching
towards senility,&quot; wrote Waldemar Nielsen in The Golden Donors,
a major study of grantmaking foundations.)
<P>
The son of the maverick inventor of the long-playing record who
later became head of CBS Labs, Peter Goldmark Jr. is a Harvard
graduate, was once a prep-school history teacher at the Putney
School in Vermont, and worked in the War on Poverty's Office of
Economic Opportunity during the Johnson Administration. A seasoned
political veteran, he also has worked for New York Mayor John
Lindsay, New York Governor Hugh Carey, and Massachusetts Governor
Francis Sargent.
<P>
Goldmark is a former executive director of the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey. But although praised for his personal
style as an administrator, he has a spotty record of accomplishment.
Former Governor Hugh Carey gives Goldmark a mixed review. &quot;He
didn't succeed fully at what he had hoped to do,&quot; Carey told
an interviewer for Manhattan, Inc. in 1988.
<P>
Likewise, a 1988 New York Times business section profile offered
this faint praise of Goldmark: &quot;He cannot completely hide
the boredom brought on by narrowing his sights to the challenges
facing a single company. It is obvious to those around him that
he will fit more naturally into his new role, where he can spread
his attentions to global concerns.&quot;
<P>
Goldmark's global concerns are embodied in the rhetoric of social
obligation and racial awareness. In 1968 he co-wrote the preface
for the Kerner Commission Report, which was the Johnson Administration's
response to civil unrest. His words include the famous refrain,
&quot;Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one
white _ separate and unequal. What white Americans have never
fully understood _ but what the Negro can never forget _ is that
white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions
created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society
condones it.&quot;
<P>
Upon taking the Rockefeller post, Goldmark told The New York Times
that he would concentrate his attention on &quot;the underclass.&quot;
&quot;Nobody knows who they are, what they do, how they stay alive,
or why they are so totally cut off from the institutions of American
life. The only institution they come in contact with is the criminal
justice system,&quot; he told The Times' Kathleen Teltsch. &quot;The
underclass is not a topic to pursue from the library. You get
out and look for them.&quot;
<P>
Another guilty liberal? In the 1991 Rockefeller Foundation annual
report Goldmark's sense of shame assumed universal proportions:
&quot;To survive as a species of promise rather than a race of
destruction will require of us a degree of planetary cooperation
that we have barely begun to imagine. That should prompt us to
prepare soberly for the test of effectiveness. The history of
the 90's demands it.&quot;
<P>
Goldmark is well-regarded by associates and has been described
as charming and considerate. The secretaries of Rockefeller Foundation
board members know him for his Christmas gifts, which usually
are &quot;third world crafts, a pillow or embroidery,&quot; according
to one recipient.
<P>
Behind the geniality and the social conscience, however, Goldmark
runs hard. He craves power, Goldmark told Manhattan Inc. &quot;We're
very bad about talking about power in American culture. We're
probably more awkward talking about power than we are about sex.
We don't have much of a vocabulary of how to talk about power,&quot;
he said. &quot;But to exercise power...you have to believe that
every action you take is important, that every word you say is
heard.&quot;<a name="woman"></a>
<P>
<b>ALBERTA ARTHURS: A WOMAN OF INFLUENCE</b>
<P>
In the art world, power is typically exercised quietly, gloved
in velvet, behind panelled doors. As Tom Wolfe noted in The Painted
Word, the public is not invited into the decision-making process.
The results are merely announced, like weddings and funerals,
in the pages of The New York Times. This is certainly true of
Alberta Arthurs and her management style as Director of Arts and
Humanities. Immensely influential, while extremely private, Arthurs
is in the vanguard of Rockefeller's arts and humanities efforts.
She annually distributes about $13 million to some 200 successful
applicants.
<P>
While Goldmark's attentions are focused on the broadest aspects
of urban affairs, global environmental matters, and the goals
of free expression, Arthurs has made sure for over ten years that
the interests of feminism, multiculturalism, and &quot;diversity&quot;
define the Rockefeller Foundation's politicized giving in the
arts.
<P>
Among the recipients of Rockefeller Foundation largesse during
her 1994 term:
<P><ul>
<li>$25,000 to the ACLU Foundation, Inc. for the &quot;Arts Censorship
Project&quot; which paid for suing the NEA.
<P>
<li>$35,000 to the ETV Endowment of South Carolina, Inc., for pre-production
and development of a six-hour television series entitled &quot;With
God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America.
<P>
<li>$60,000 to the Los Angeles Festival &quot;for a six-month feasibility
study of future organizational options.&quot;
<P>
<li>$75,000 to the National Black Arts Festival, Inc., Atlanta for
&quot;Celebrate Africa!&quot;
<P>
<li>$10,000 to Franklin Furnace Archive, Inc. for &quot;hiring a
consultant&quot; to &quot;implement new artistic programs.&quot;
The venue is famous for presenting Annie Sprinkle, a former prostitute
cum &quot;performance artist.&quot; The theater's basement location
was closed by the New York City Fire Department in 1990 after
complaints.
<P>
<li>$35,000 to Arthur Dong for &quot;They Called Us Lesbians.&quot;
Dong previously produced &quot;Coming Out Under Fire&quot; a film
about gays in the military.
<P>
<li>$50,000 to the National Cultural Alliance, a lobby for the NEA,
&quot;for its national campaign to expand public awareness of
the critical role of the arts and humanities in the United States.
<P>
<li>$25,000 to the National Endowment for the Arts for &quot;ART-21&quot;
a national advocacy conference
<P>
<li>$25,000 to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in New York for &quot;a
series of developmental screenplay readings&quot; by Puerto Ricans
living in New York.
<P>
<li>$17,000 to Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis, a co-sponsor of torture
artist Ron Athey's 1994 slicing and dicing.
<P>
<li>$10,000 to 18th Street Arts Complex/Highways Performing Space,
Santa Monica, CA for &quot;development and production of &quot;The
Dodo Vaccine.&quot; Highways has hosted Ron Athey, and NEA litigants
Tim Miller and Holly Hughes. Miller is &quot;artistic director&quot;
of the venue. It was most recently in the news for presenting
a performance artist describing &quot;sex with Newt's mom,&quot;
subject of a debate on the floor of the U.S. Congress prior to
yet another NEA budget cut.
<P>
<li>$35,000 to Signifyn' Works in Berkeley, California for &quot;filmmaker
Marlon Riggs' film Black Is...Black Ain't.&quot; Riggs, a Harvard
graduate who died of AIDS in 1994, had previously produced &quot;Tongues
Untied,&quot; which created a storm of protest against its profanity
and explicit sexuality when aired on PBS in 1992. The film led
to Senate passage of a decency amendment to the Telecommunications
Act that same year, which the Supreme Court upheld against ACLU
challenges.
<P>
<li>1994-95 Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Fellowships advertised
in The Chronicle of Philanthropy include the Center for Lesbian
and Gay Studies at the Graduate School of the City University
of New York; the Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's Studies at
the University of Rochester; the Afro-American Studies Program
at Princeton University, and Claiming Social Equity and Cultural
Rights, Centro de Studios Pertorriquenos, at Hunter College, New
York.</ul>
<P>
This list is just a sampling of the venues and artists Arthur's
Rockefeller program supports. And this Foundation support for
the &quot;cutting edge&quot; can clearly be laid at Arthur's feet.
<P>
For Arthurs was already in charge of Rockefeller's arts and humanities
grants under Richard Lyman, Goldmark's predecessor. An ardent
and active feminist whom some critics call &quot;the Wicked Witch
of the West Side,&quot; she is a career academic and former college
president. A 1954 graduate of Wellesley College, Arthurs married
in 1959 and taught English at Rutgers University from 1964-73.
She earned a Bryn Mawr Ph.D. in English completing a dissertation
on landscape in the work of Jane Austen in 1972.
<P>
In 1973 Arthurs became Dean of Admissions at Radcliffe College,
then was named Dean of Undergraduate Affairs at Harvard from 1975-77,
and then served two years as president of Chatham College, a small
liberal-arts institution near Pittsburgh. She has been director
of Arts and Humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation since then.
<P>
In the late 1980's the Rockefeller Foundation began to provide
an annual one million-dollar grant to establish a new organization,
National Video Resources, Inc. Arthurs became chairman of the
board of the new enterprise. It helps to distribute &quot;independent&quot;
and &quot;avant-garde&quot; videos to libraries, schools and colleges.
To do this, it &quot;trains&quot; librarians, distributes bibliographies,
and sometimes arranges for donations.
<P>
In other words, National Video Resources subsidizes receptivity
to the type of marginal productions the Rockefeller Foundation
typically funds _ productions which would not ordinarily be included
in school curricula or library holdings without this outside &quot;incentive.&quot;
In the for-profit sector, such operations are sometimes called
bribery, kickbacks, and public relations.
<P>
No matter. Arthurs had been unafraid to advocate on behalf of
both the NEA and the NEH. Daniel Garcia, a Rockefeller Foundation
trustee, told Foundation Watch that Arthurs had &quot;given millions&quot;
over the years in matching grants to NEA projects.
<P>
Since Frohnmayer's capitulation, Arthurs has been vocal in lobbying
for the NEA. In 1993 Arthurs co-authored an op-ed piece for The
Los Angeles Times with NEA Visual Arts Policy panelist Douglas
Davis called &quot;News Flash To Washington: Americans Like the
Arts: Culture: Polls Show Strong Support For Government Leadership
and Assistance In All Fields of Creative Endeavor.&quot;
<P>
Arthurs was unrepentant, despite public outrage at the NEA's track
record of pornography, blasphemy, and horror, and despite punitive
budget cuts approved by a Democratic Congress spearheaded by the
then-Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator Byrd (D-WV), Arthurs
argued for &quot;additional dollars&quot; for the NEA and NEH.
<P>
As recently as last year, Arthurs testified on behalf of the National
Endowment for the Humanities before the a Senate committee. Supporting
the NEH's multiculturalist promoter Sheldon Hackney, Arthurs declared
&quot;the Endowment is essential for scholarship.&quot; This was
shortly after former NEH chairmen William Bennett and Lynne Cheney
both called for the abolition of the Humanities Endowment.
<P>
If the Rockefeller Foundation faced the truth it would acknowledge
that its policies of multiculturalism and diversity have put the
future of the Arts and Humanities endowments in peril. The Rockefeller
Foundation's insistence that the federal cultural agencies maintain
these policies in the face of public outrage has sealed their
doom.

<b><i>Why the Wealthy Give: The Culture of Elite Philanthropy </i>by Francie
Ostrower (Princeton University Press, 1995, 190 pages)
<P>
Reviewed by Robert Huberty</b>
<P>
Why the Wealthy Give won't really help a fundraiser searching
for tips _ it's too poorly written for one thing _ but it does
present some useful ideas and information to suggest why the nonprofit
sector is in its current fix.
<P>
Ostrower, a Harvard professor of sociology, interviewed 88 very
wealthy New York City-area donors in the late 1980s. She wanted
to see whether philanthropy shaped a distinctive outlook and way
of life.
<P>
The author looked for differences and tensions in her group, which
she had randomly selected from lists of big givers. Categorizing
donors by religion and ethnicity, sex and marital status, and
areas and amounts of giving, she was able to discover some interesting
variations. And by getting the donors to talk about themselves,
she learned much about what they thought they were doing.
<P>
What these unidentified donors told Ostrower has led her to conclude
that they think of themselves as a distinctive social elite, and
they regard philanthropy as an activity of their class and a symbol
of their status.
<P>
Many organize their daily lives around philanthropy: they conscientiously
serve on nonprofit boards, generously volunteer their time and
expertise, and enjoy evenings at fancy galas and receptions that
raise money for favorite charities. They recognize each other
at such events and are proud to feel an obligation to contribute
to what one called, &quot;the whole range from what's acutely
necessary to what is desirable.&quot;
<P>
However, while most Americans' philanthropy goes heavily to religion,
this figured less prominently in Ostrower's donors' priorities.
The reason may have to do with Ostrower's methodology. Surprisingly,
when Ostrower constructed her initial database she did not include
churches or synagogues.
<P>
This biases her study, since it makes her sample appear less religious
than wealthy New York City donors may be. Certainly, it resulted
in fewer interviews with wealthy Catholics, distorting the world
of philanthropy which Ostrower claims to be describing.
<P>
In other words, while Ostrower may accurately describe &quot;her&quot;
social elite, it may not be representative of New York's let alone
the nation's.
<P>
Still, the results are interesting. Ostrower's donors' favorite
causes are education (especially higher education) and cultural
institutions. Hospitals and other health-related groups follow.
Those who graduated from the most prestigious private institutions
were more likely to have made large gifts to alma mater. This
will give no comfort to those hoping for more alumni help in fighting
political correctness.
<P>
Social service agencies received more support from Jews and unmarried
women. Married women were more likely to give to culture. Public
policy, advocacy, and environmental causes had few supporters.
Jewish-federations were well-funded, no doubt because 49 donors
in the sample were Jewish, more than half.
<P>
Ostrower's sampling are typically American in many ways: they
respect individual accomplishment, distrust government power,
and believe private institutions can carry out many functions
better than government.
<P>
They value individual choice and they believe government funding
will politicize decision-making.
<P>
Unlike many Marxist academics who think such attitudes disguise
selfish class interests, Ostrower takes the donors at their word.
She thinks their sense of mission is sincere, and generally finds
their approach to giving open-minded, self-critical and pluralistic.
<P>
Yet her donors also voice attitudes which betray certain limitations
in their thinking. These prevent them from doing as much good
as they might hope to achieve. And they contribute to serious
problems in philanthropy.
<P>
One trouble with social elites is that they don't want to interact
too much with other people. It's hard to involve donors with anyone
other than their own kind.
<P>
Ostrower found that her donors did not want to give to individuals.
Rather, they contributed to prestigous organizations. Or, as she
puts it in the language peculiar to social scientists: &quot;Identifications
with organizations become a central focus of donor loyalties and
concern.&quot;
<P>
Her donors seem to exert too little muscle, not too much. Some
donors gripe that they have no influence over the nonprofit professionals
who set their groups' agendas. Others seem only to want the status
of an institutional affiliation.
<P>
But by holding themselves aloof, donors fail to exercise a power
of the purse which is uniquely theirs. Organizations cannot be
accountable to donor intentions if they don't express them.
<P>
Ostrower's sample is also not very charitable. Because building
prestige institutions is so important to them, Ostrower discovered
that her donors sharply differentiate philanthropy from charity
to individuals.
<P>
Many saw direct services to the needy _ homeless shelters, soup
kitchens, disaster relief and the like _ as an entirely separate
activity. Said one donor, &quot;I do not give money to buy clothes
and food for individuals. My tax money goes for that.&quot; What
the comment demonstrates is that the rich, like the poor, will
succumb to the culture of welfare dependency.
<P>
Finally, Ostrower's donors don't seem to have given enough serious
thought to the long-term and public policy consequences of their
wealth. They believe they have a right to choose who will receive
their money, but are ambivalent about leaving estates to their
children, and leery about philanthropy by bequest -- recognizing
that their intentions may not be honored.
<P>
Almost unanimously, they rejected a hypothetical proposal to eliminate
the tax deduction for charitable giving in order to increase government
support for welfare and cultural activities. Says Ostrower in
one of her clearer sentences, &quot;Money that goes to government
is seen as taken away, while money donated to philanthropy is
seen as money given away.&quot;
<P>
Yet large majorities agreed that government should spend more
for health care, the arts, higher education, social services,
and environmental and animal protection.
<P>
The problem is Ostrower's donors want their philanthropy to &quot;make
a difference&quot; but they can only imagine this within the context
of the familiar. They relate philanthropy to personal attachments
and social networks more than to individual charity or public
policies towards broad social goals. 
<P>
In wanting to &quot;protect&quot; their philanthropy from welfare
and other social problems that they perceive as intractable, the
rich, like all of us, may really be yielding to a despair that
nothing can be done about the poor. That's a mistake which philanthropy
can correct once donors recognize that government isn't taking
care of the big problems now, and can't be expected to do so in
the future.

<P>
 Welfare reform is well under way in the states.  Despite President
Clinton's recent veto of welfare reform legislation, many states
have received or are seeking waivers from the federal government
to reform their welfare systems.  This issue presents contributions
by leaders of state public-policy think tanks.  It examines reforms
already made in six states and proposes new ideas to make charities
and nonprofit organizations key providers of private welfare services.
<P>
 Lawrence W. Reed, president of the Midland, Michigan-based Mackinac
Center for Public Policy, describes Michigan Governor John Engler's
ambitious welfare reforms.  He notes, however, that charities
must become more involved in these efforts.  David G. Tuerck,
executive director of Boston's Beacon Hill Institute, offers a
tax-credit proposal that would address Reed's concern.  It would
shift welfare responsibilities from government to charities.
<P>
 Three articles follow which emphasize the importance of moving
welfare recipients into the workforce.  Andrew Bush, a research
fellow and director of the Welfare Policy Center at the Indianapolis-based
Hudson Institute, argues that Indiana should adopt an aggressive
work-based welfare program.  Michael E. Hartmann, Director of
Research at the Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Policy Research Institute,
describes a strong workfare program likely to be signed into law
this month by Governor Tommy Thompson.  Tom Tancredo and Dwight
Filley, president and senior fellow, respectively, of the Golden,
Colorado-based Independence Institute, discuss the role of fatherlessness
in long-term welfare dependency and propose workfare and other
programs to address this problem.
<P>
 Two concluding articles from Washington state think tanks emphasize
why private efforts to help the needy are more likely to succeed
than government programs.  John Carlson, chairman of the Seattle's
Washington Institute for Policy Studies, uses a &quot;thought
experiment&quot; to outline principles that should be the basis
of any welfare reform effort.  Lynn Harsh and Bob Williams, executive
director and president, respectively, of the Olympia-based Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, discuss ways to implement some of these principles
in their state.
<P>
 Next month's issue will carry additional articles by state think
tank leaders on state-level welfare reform.
<P>
<B><A NAME="mich">Michigan: Have We Gone Far Enough?</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Lawrence W. Reed</B>
<P>
 Welfare programs may well be the most unpopular of all government
initiatives--criticized by social scientists who observe the results,
disdained by taxpayers who pay the bills, and often unloved by
many of those who collect the benefits.  Even the Maryland State
Conference of the NAACP says that welfare &quot;is a major contributory
factor to the crime problems we face today.&quot;  Unlike private
efforts that stress character-building, one-on-one mentoring and
a spiritual dimension, the impersonal public dole does nothing
to overcome &quot;behavioral poverty&quot;--the breakdown in values
and behavior needed to promote self-sufficiency and build stable
families.
<P>
 Michigan Governor John M. Engler recognized this in 1991 when
he embarked on what has become one of the most ambitious efforts
to reform welfare in the states.  Michigan abruptly ended the
General Assistance program for able-bodied, childless adults in
October 1991 and adopted a &quot;social contract,&quot; whereby
welfare recipients are expected to seek work, go to school, or
perform community service in exchange for benefits.
<P>
 To encourage work, the state now allows welfare recipients to
keep more of their earnings without having that count as income
against their welfare checks.  Before this change, the tax-free
value of AFDC, food stamps, and Medicaid for a family of three
in Michigan (about $1,000 per month) was roughly equal to the
income one could earn at a minimum wage or entry-level job.  This
hardly promoted work over welfare.
<P>
 The Engler reforms have produced tangible results.  Nearly 25
percent of Michigan's AFDC recipients are now working.  This is
three times the national average and up from 16 percent just two
years ago.  Average earnings from work and hours spent in volunteer
activity are up as well.  Fewer families are receiving assistance
than at any time since 1989.
<P>
 While those results are welcome, it's too early to break out
the champagne.  Governor Engler himself expressed a healthy skepticism
about both federal and state welfare reforms when he told ABC's
David Brinkley in November 1994, &quot;Replacing liberal micromanagement
with conservative micromanagement would only be a slight improvement;
it's time for wholesale reform.&quot;  By this, he means further
reducing the role of government and making welfare a largely private
initiative.  In the words of columnist John Fund of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>, &quot;Ask yourself: If you had a financial
windfall and wanted to help the poor, would you even <I>think</I>
about giving time or a check to the government?&quot;
<P>
 In Michigan, a growing number of private initiatives to help
the poor are already underway, some of which sprouted in direct
response to the state's abolition of General Assistance.  For
instance, Hard Times Cafe in Harrison provides counseling, job
placement, and other services to the needy.  Clients earn &quot;Hard
Times Dollars&quot; that are redeemable for personal-needs items
such as soap and toothpaste.  These are donated by individuals
and local businesses.
<P>
 With hardly a murmur about separation of church and state, the
state of Michigan has contracted with the Salvation Army to operate
a statewide network of 120 homeless shelters.  For the amazingly
low cost of $10 per person per day, the Army provides a bed, two
meals, and personal interaction with the needy aimed at reducing
behavioral poverty.
<P>
 The privatization of welfare could be pursued in a number of
ways.  A cold turkey approach would simply abolish welfare and
rely on families, churches, and charities to help the needy. 
The response might pleasantly surprise some who think that only
government can perform this task.  A more gradual transition to
a privatized scenario would provide more public recognition of
charities and greater incentives for charitable giving.  State
and local governments might also contract out more welfare services,
giving those in need a choice between increasingly proscriptive
and punitive government programs and private charity, which is
more likely to offer personalized help.
<P>
 Our welfare system has produced such disastrous consequences
that it's hard to imagine how a radical overhaul could make things
worse.  If we revitalize the American ideals of charity and self-help,
we might end up spending less for success than the government
now spends for failure.

<B><A NAME="mass">Massachusetts: Why State-Level Reform Won't Work</A></B>
<P>
<B>by David G. Tuerck</B>
<P>
 Welfare reform is progressing in many states.  Even if President
Clinton vetoes future federal welfare reform bills, a number of
states will continue to undertake reforms of their own.  Massachusetts,
justifiably infamous for its bloated welfare state, adopted sweeping
reforms last year under Governor William Weld:
<P>
<ul>
 <li>Ablebodied welfare recipients whose youngest children have
entered school must work at least 20 hours per week in a job or
community service program.
<P>
 <LI>Parents under age 18 must live with a responsible adult or
in a supervised group home.  They must stay in school or in a
GED program.
<P>
 <LI>A family cap denies additional benefits to recipients for children
born after August 1996.
<P>
 <LI>Ablebodied recipients' benefits are cut by 2.75 percent.
<P>
 </ul>Just to make a point, Massachusetts renamed its welfare bureaucracy:
the Department of Public Welfare became the Department of Transitional
Assistance.

<P>
 Overdue as these reforms are, they do not go to the heart of
the problem.  The reason lies in the method by which we fund welfare.
 Under the existing system, taxpayers send their money to Washington,
where most flows into a welfare bureaucracy and only a fraction
eventually reaches the pockets of the poor.  As long as welfare
is taxpayer-funded but government-controlled, it will remain an
expensive entitlement offered by a faceless bureaucracy.  The
seeds of poverty will be left to sprout anew.
<P>
 The best reform approach is to make welfare taxpayer-funded and
taxpayer-controlled.  A Beacon Hill Institute Policy Study, <I>Giving
Credit Where Credit Is Due: A New Approach to Welfare Funding</I>,
proposes that individual taxpayers, both itemizers and non-itemizers,
receive a 100 percent federal tax credit for contributions to
eligible charities for up to 25 percent of their federal tax liability.
 This would shift control of $115 billion in federal welfare spending
from government to individuals.  Eligible charities would be 501(c)(3)
organizations that offer services now provided by government under
meanstested programs, such as AFDC, Food Stamps, and housing assistance.
 These organizations would vie for taxpayer support by offering
superior services to the needy.
<P>
 Why so radical a proposal?  A few facts show why the welfare
system is broken.  Although the poverty rate declined from 1959
to 1994, there are still more than 38 million Americans (14.5
percent of the total population) living in poverty.  Poverty affects
women and children more than others.  The poverty rate was 54
percent for single female headsofhousehold in 1994.  The rate
for children rose from 14.9 percent in 1970 to 21.8 percent in
1994.
<P>
 These statistics stand out against the backdrop of a vastly expanded
welfare system.  Combined federal and state spending on direct
public aid increased tenfold from $15 billion in 1970 to $142
billion in 1990.  Furthermore, government welfare spending is
highly inefficient.  Only 41 percent of all povertylevel families
receive any government benefits at all.  And almost half of those
receiving benefits are not poor.  More than two-thirds of all
federal welfare spending ultimately ends up in the pockets of
people who are not poor.
<P>
 Welfare is commonly viewed as something the government provides.
 But this view is highly myopic.  Individuals currently give about
$17 billion to private charities that provide services similar
to those provided by government.  Total spending for direct-service
programs is about $132 billion, equal to the $115 billion spent
by the federal government plus $17 billion spent by private charities.
 Contrary to those who believe that charity cannot compensate
for a loss of government welfare payments, a tax credit can be
expected to increase the total amount of welfare for at least
four reasons:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI><I>Increased giving</I>.  The provision of a tax incentive
for charitable contributions amounts to a reduction in the price
of private giving.  This price is equal to the cost, after taxes,
of giving an additional dollar.  Under present law, the price
of giving for a federal taxpayer in the 28 percent tax bracket
is 72 cents.  A 100 percent tax credit would reduce this price
to zero (for donations up to a 25 percent limit).  Provision of
a full tax credit would cause private giving to expand by more
than tax revenues contract, thus causing the total amount of welfare
to expand.
<P>
 <LI><I>Increased voluntarism</I>.  A recent Gallup poll finds that
29 percent, or 70 million, of all Americans volunteer in their
communities.  Those who volunteer also give more to charities.
 The creation of a tax credit would add at least 2 million people
to the pool of volunteers.
<P>
 <LI><I>Increased efficiency and savings</I>.  Most research has
found that the private sector is more cost-efficient than government
in delivering services.  Moreover, nonprofit organizations rely
more on unpaid volunteers than either government or businesses.
<P>
 <LI><I>Reduced crowd-out</I>.  Government spending has been shown
to crowd out private giving.  A one-dollar increase in government
spending decreases private giving by an estimated 10 cents.  The
proposed 100 percent tax credit would eliminate this problem.
</ul>
<P>
 Devolving welfare to the states is one path to reform.  But it
will not succeed if states merely substitute their bureaucracies
for federal bureaucracies.  Optimum welfare reform would shift
responsibility for welfare to private charities.  And tax credits
are the most effective public-policy instrument for achieving
this change.
<P>
<B><A NAME="ind">Indiana: Reorienting Welfare</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Andrew Bush</B>
<P>
 Whether or not the federal government introduces welfare block
grants to the states, Indiana should use the considerable flexibility
it already has to transform the way it helps its neediest families.
 The focus of Indiana's welfare policy should be to help families
become self-sufficient.  Government can best achieve this goal
by recognizing its own limitations and by drawing on the strengths
of charities, community-based organizations, and other private
service providers.
<P>
 The Indianapolis Independence Initiative, or I-3, probably offers
the best model for reforming Indiana's welfare system.  As a graduated
work-based plan currently proposed as an alternative to AFDC in
Marion County, I-3 would dramatically change the orientation of
welfare in two ways:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Consistent employment by at least one parent is about the closest
thing there is to a ticket out of poverty.  I-3 would focus on
giving needy families that opportunity by helping able-bodied
parents find immediate work.  Unsubsidized, private-sector employment
would be the primary goal, but those not yet able to obtain such
employment could build their skills and work histories through
partially subsidized jobs or fully subsidized community-service
jobs.  Those with temporary disabilities could &quot;earn&quot;
cash support by performing tasks that would prepare them to support
their families.  I-3's focus on employment and earnings would
help families move quickly into the mainstream working world and
become acclimated to the lifestyle it demands.
<P>
 Rather than ending assistance when parents find jobs, I-3 would
treat initial employment as a first step.  Money used for welfare
benefits would be channeled into services and subsidies to help
low-income working parents remain employed and increase their
capacity to be self-supporting.  Child care, health care, employment
services, and counseling would be available to help families become
and remain employed.
<P>
 <LI>I-3 would open public aid to a wide range of non-government
service providers that would help families pursue self-sufficiency.
 Networks of provider organizations would operate under performance-based
contracts.  By opening up the public-assistance provider system
and judging organizations by performance standards, public assistance
would become more useful, creative, and efficient.
</ul>
<P>
 Private charities and other community-based organizations have
an important role to play in systems such as I-3.  The danger
is that they might seek to recreate the current welfare system.
 It is essential that charities summon all their creativity and
expertise to make work-based public assistance a reality.
<P>
<B><A NAME="wis">Wisconsin: Work Requirements for All Welfare Recipients</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Michael E. Hartmann</B>
<P>
 Wisconsin has imposed stringent work requirements on welfare
recipients and has successfully moved many able-bodied recipients
into productive work.  Only hard-core recipients remain on welfare
in Wisconsin.  A bill that has just passed both houses of the
state legislature by wide margins, &quot;W-2--Wisconsin Works,&quot;
would require all recipients to work.  Spearheaded by Governor
Tommy G. Thompson, it is likely to be signed into law this April.
<P>
 A January 1995 study by welfare expert Lawrence W. Mead found
that between 1989 and 1993, the national AFDC caseload grew by
29 percent, from 10.2 million to 14.1 million.  State caseloads
increased by an average of 35 percent.  But according to the Wisconsin
Department of Health and Social Services, Wisconsin's welfare
caseload fell by 24.5 percent from January 1987 to July 1995--from
98,300 to 70,300 cases.  According to Mead, this was partly because
Wisconsin implemented the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS)
program in 1988.  Mandated by Title II of the federal Family Support
Act, JOBS required caseworkers to closely monitor and motivate
welfare recipients in their search for employment.
<P>
 In July 1993, Wisconsin implemented an even tougher employment
requirement for some AFDC recipients, called &quot;Work, Not Welfare&quot;
(WNW).  WNW limits AFDC payments to two years and offers major
job-training services.  To determine the number of hours a recipient
must work or participate in training, WNW combines food stamps
and AFDC into one lump-sum payment that is then divided by the
federal minimum wage ($4.25).  WNW can be credited with reducing
AFDC rolls in Fond du Lac County from 627 in December 1994 to
385 in July 1995 (a 38.6 percent decline), and in Pierce County
from 191 in December 1994 to 117 in July 1995 (a 38.7 percent
decline).
<P>
 If signed by Governor Thompson as expected, the latest proposal--W-2--Wisconsin
Works--will create a &quot;self-sufficiency ladder&quot; for welfare
recipients based on four graduated work options:
<P>
<ul> 
<LI><i>W-2 Transitions</I>.  Recipients unable to perform self-sustaining
work will engage in work activities (e.g., sheltered workshops),
vocational rehabilitation, and counseling.  Twenty-eight hours
of work activity plus 12 hours of job training at $518 per month
will be imposed.  Food stamps will be available.  A time limit
of 24 months may be extended on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
<LI><I>Community-service jobs</I>.  Recipients will learn work
habits and job skills necessary for employment in the private
sector.  Thirty hours of work per week plus ten hours of training
at $555 per month will be imposed.  Like W-2 Transitions, food
stamps will be available and participation will be limited to
24 months.
<P>
<LI> <I>Trial jobs (subsidized employment)</I>.  Recipients' transition
to unsubsidized private employment will initially be subsidized--for
example, when a recipient is willing to work but has little or
no work history.  Forty hours of work per week at market wages
will be imposed, and employers will receive up to $300 per month
in subsidies.  Food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
will be available.  Time in the program will be limited to 24
months.
<P>
 <LI><I>Unsubsidized employment</I>.  Recipients will be guided
to the best available immediate job in the private sector.  Forty
hours of work per week at market wages will be imposed, and food
stamps and the EITC will be available.
</ul><P>
 The bill that has just passed the state legislature says that
&quot;the W-2 agency will operate the four major components .
. . in an integrated fashion so that participants are always entering
the highest (i.e., least subsidized) workforce stage possible,
and are moving up to the next level at the earliest opportunity.&quot;
 Those eligible for participation will be &quot;families consisting
of custodial parents and their children age 18 or younger, with
incomes below 115 percent of poverty and with low assets.&quot;
 Health-care and child-care benefits (to which recipients must
make co-payments) are included.  However, to meet predictable
legal challenges to the program by those denied benefits, the
bill states that &quot;an individual is not entitled to benefits
or services under [W-2].&quot;
<P>
 The state legislature modified the governor's original proposal
by:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>Strengthening health-care provisions for pregnant mothers and
new mothers;
<P>
 <LI>Lowering participants' co-payments for child care;
<P>
 <LI>Allowing those in vocational or four-year college programs
to complete their schooling without losing benefits;
</ul>
<P>
 Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Walter J. Kunicki remarked
before passage that &quot;People are afraid not to vote for [W-2].
 No one wants to be on record voting against welfare reform.&quot;
 W-2 is expected to affect more than 53,000 women and their children
and cost $2.1 billion in its first two years--$110 more than under
current welfare spending.
<P>
  Hopefully, Congress will soon pass block grant welfare legislation.
 Otherwise, Wisconsin will have to seek waivers from the Department
of Health and Human Services to implement W-2.  Nonetheless, state
welfare officials see W-2's self-sufficiency ladder as a realistic
way to encourage all welfare recipients, even those heretofore
considered unemployable, to become productive members of society.
<P>
<B><A NAME="colo">Colorado: An Agenda for the State Legislature</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Tom Tancredo and Dwight Filley</B>
<P>
 What if one thing caused most of Colorado's social ills?  And
what if government policies were encouraging that one thing?
<P>
 If these two statements are true, then we can go a long way toward
curing those ills by simply reversing the policies that encourage
that single development.  There is a growing body of evidence
linking the following social pathologies to a common factor: juvenile
delinquency, drug abuse, gang membership, dropping out of school,
homelessness, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, high infant mortality,
poor prenatal care, poverty, and welfare dependency.  That factor
is the absence of a married father in the household.  Obviously,
the lack of a father is not the only cause, but there is a strong
correlation between these problems and a childhood spent in a
fatherless home.
<P>
 One might think that in an advanced Western democracy, public
policy would be directed toward reducing the number of fatherless
homes and toward encouraging marriage.  But current federal policy
does exactly the opposite.  It penalizes those who are married
and rewards those who are not.
<P>
 The penalties?  A couple considering marriage must get permission
from the government by obtaining a license.  If the government
approves, the couple must pay a fee--a fine if you will.  Once
married, the couple will probably pay a much larger fine--the
so-called marriage penalty of the federal income tax.  They must
pay the fine every year they remain married.  Newspapers have
carried stories about couples who divorce and then live together
to reduce their income taxes.
<P>
 And the rewards for being unmarried?  Government benefits: housing
vouchers, food stamps, day care, and a cash reward--AFDC--that
is paid every month for a child born out of wedlock.  In most
states, this reward is increased with each additional child.
<P>
 What we have here, as they say, is a failure to communicate.
 If the single strongest predictor of the above-mentioned problems
is the absence of a father, why does government policy seem geared
toward driving fathers away?
<P>
 Although Colorado lives under an oppressive burden of federal
laws, we still have considerable latitude to end the perverse
incentives that wreck families and contribute to our social ills.
 AFDC, for example, is a matching fund program.  If the Colorado
legislature refused to fund its share, AFDC would end in the state.
 Similarly, Colorado could revise its income tax code to offset
the federal marriage penalty.
<P>
 The state legislature might also take the following considerations
into account in drafting welfare reform legislation:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Recognize that shielding people from the natural consequences
of their destructive actions will result in more destructive actions.
<P>
<LI> Freeze welfare spending at current levels.  This is the only
way to reduce welfare in the long run.
<P>
 <LI>Do not cut funding for current welfare programs that provide
for the disabled and the elderly.
<P>
 <LI>Do not provide government assistance to people who can work.
 If such people are forced to be accountable to their families,
churches, communities, and private charities, they are more likely
to enter the job market and end their destructive behavior than
if they receive aid from an impersonal bureaucracy.  When Michigan
terminated General Assistance for employable, childless adults,
welfare rolls fell by 82,000, and welfare payments by 17 percent.
<P>
 <LI>Enact a meaningful workfare program.  Do not allow a two-year
waiting period before applying workfare requirements.  If workfare
is to succeed in discouraging able-bodied people from going on
welfare, its effect will be strongest at the time of welfare enrollment,
not two years later.
<P>
 <LI>Workfare costs taxpayers more when unmarried mothers have children
under the age of five, because day-care must be provided.  Accordingly,
apply workfare first to able-bodied recipients other than mothers
with young children.  However, mothers who choose to have additional
children while already on welfare should not be exempt from workfare
requirements.
<P>
 <LI>Do not provide welfare to women under 18 unless they live with
a parent or legal guardian.  Too often, the prospect of money
for one's own apartment is an incentive to become pregnant.  Exceptions
should be made if teenagers have left home because of abuse, and
if teenagers lived independently for at least a year before applying
for welfare.
<P>
<LI> Do not increase payments to women who bear more children while
they are welfare recipients.  Working parents get no pay raise
when they have more children.  This policy is already law in New
Jersey, where the number of births to welfare recipients has fallen
by 16 percent.
<P>
<LI> Make AFDC funding contingent upon the mother identifying the
father, if the child was born after 1994.  DNA testing can verify
or refute disputes about paternity.  Require all fathers of AFDC
children born in 1995 or thereafter to pay child support.  If
the father claims that he cannot find employment, put him to work
in community service.  As word spreads that fathering an illegitimate
child will result in a two-decade-long financial obligation, fewer
men may be tempted to &quot;prove their masculinity.&quot;
<P>
 <LI>Consider abolishing AFDC altogether.  Redistribute AFDC funds
to group homes for unwed mothers, adoption programs and, possibly,
orphanages.  A cut-off for AFDC benefits could be phased in to
apply first to women under age 18 (or 21), then extended to women
25 and under (who bear two-thirds of all illegitimate children),
and then to the entire population.  Group homes and orphanages
should be carefully evaluated.
<P>
 <LI>Encourage sex education programs that promote abstinence. 
Many of these have cut pregnancy rates by 40 percent.  By contrast,
programs that provide contraceptive information have virtually
no success in reducing pregnancy.

<P>
<LI> Encourage adoption as the best choice for women who bear children
and lack the resources to raise them properly.

<B><A NAME="washi">Washington State: Two Views</A></B>
<P>
<B>I. Needed: A Strong Dose of Common Sense</B>
<P>
<B>by John Carlson</B>
<P>
 &quot;We absolutely will not tolerate the sort of back-door discrimination
against families and children that many today call 'welfare reform.'&quot;
 I can understand Washington Governor Mike Lowry making that statement
in 1966.  But in 1996?  Such unabashed '60s-speak explains much
about the governor's political unpopularity.  He has not learned
from experience.  Experience should tell him that efforts to reform
welfare don't discriminate against the family--the status quo
does.  A young mother can receive a welfare check only if she
doesn't marry the father, doesn't live at home, doesn't find a
job, and doesn't save any money.  You can't get much more anti-family
than that.
<P>
 Statistics bear this out.  Between 1962 and 1992, welfare spending
in the U.S. went up by nearly 1,000 percent in inflation-adjusted
dollars.  At the same time, as former Education Secretary William
Bennett recently wrote in <I>Commentary</I> magazine, poverty
dropped by less than five percent, and illegitimacy soared by
400 percent.  As single-parent households have proliferated, so
have crime rates, drug abuse, drop-out rates in inner-city schools
and teenage pregnancy, keeping the cycle of decay in perpetual
motion.
<P>
 A couple of years ago, after a gang-related shoot-out in one
of Tacoma's rough neighborhoods, a TV station sent in a camera
crew to get people's reactions.  As expected, community leaders
on the scene called for more jobs, fewer guns, and better social
programs.  But one local women knew better.  She looked at the
reporter and simply told the stark truth: &quot;You gotta start
asking, where are the fathers?  What happened to all the men?&quot;
<P>
 That is the question our welfare system cannot answer.  Young
men who father children out of wedlock don't have to take responsibility
for their actions.  The welfare system does it for them.  And
the mother isn't required to identify the father of the child.
 Again, you can't get much more anti-family than that.
<P>
 So what's the answer?  Before getting specific, let's be clear
about standards.  Welfare is supposed to be a temporary, stop-gap
measure to help people who have fallen on hard times.  In that
sense, we should apply the same kind of common sense to welfare
reform that we would use if someone in our own family experienced
trouble.
<P>
 Suppose your divorced sister lost her job.  She has two kids.
 Naturally, you would want to help.  First, you'd give or loan
her some money to pay some bills due at the end of the month.
 Then you'd try to help her find a job.  You'd back up her efforts
to get child support from her ex-husband.  You might buy her some
groceries.
<P>
 But for how long?  Suppose she stopped looking for work.  Suppose
you found out she was using your temporary financial help to buy
drugs.  Or that she was just hanging out with friends at the local
tavern.  Suppose she let her husband off the hook for child support.
 Would you keep subsidizing her behavior?  Of course not.  Which
raises the question, If you wouldn't subsidize the irresponsible
or illegal behavior of your own sister, why are we doing it through
our welfare system for complete strangers?
<P>
 Suppose your sister wasn't irresponsible--she just wasn't motivated.
 Let's say she couldn't find a job that paid as much as she was
earning before.  Wouldn't you expect her to accept a temporary
job that paid less and wait for a better-paying job to come along?
 Would you keep sending her money if she refused to take a lower-paying
job?  What if she couldn't find any jobs in the small town where
she lived?  Wouldn't you tell her after awhile that it was time
to move on to a place where she could find employment?
<P>
 This is the kind of genuine safety net that family members erect
for each other hundreds of thousands of times a year.  It is a
net that would unravel if not tightly woven with reasonable and
sensible expectations about how best to help others.  Why not
apply that same common sense to our welfare system?
<P>
 Fortunately, state Representative Suzette Cooke (R-Kent) has
crafted a welfare reform bill that begins to do exactly that.
 It would limit welfare benefits and include an additional period
of reduced benefits for welfare recipients who are working.  Recipients
who don't look for work would have their benefits reduced.  They
could save money without being penalized, but cash benefits would
not be increased for recipients who have more children.
<P>
 Governor Lowry might find this unfair, but I know him well enough
to say that if he were spending his own money to help someone
in his family, he'd find these conditions perfectly reasonable.
 Extending these standards of common sense to government programs
is long overdue.
<P>
<B><A NAME="washii">II. Dismantling the Welfare Culture</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Lynn Harsh and Bob Williams</B>
<P>
 There she was: a teenage mother pleading her case on TV, warning
state lawmakers of the hardships she would face if her welfare
payments were reduced.  The nicely-dressed, high school dropout
lived with her middle-class parents, but they were financially
stretched, she explained.  The baby's father?  He was not helping
out, nor did she expect him to.  She said that she needed more
time on welfare to get a college education.
<P>
 It was a picture of a welfare system gone awry--a system undergirding
promiscuity and making fatherhood irrelevant; rewarding personal
irresponsibility with a free trip to college; and allowing able
grandparents to shift the responsibility of caring for their grandchild
to the government.  Most Americans have heard similar stories
and realize that the &quot;welfare culture&quot; created by our
current system must be changed.
<P>
 In reviewing new welfare responsibilities that might soon become
the responsibility of states, legislators need to carefully examine
each current program and ask:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Is the program a proper function of government?
<P>
 <LI>What is the program's mission, and is that mission worth pursuing?
<P>
<LI>Given the option, would we have mandated the program?  If not,
can it be eliminated?
<P>
 <LI>If government at some level should operate the program, how
can it be done in the most efficient and cost-effective manner?
</ul><P>
 Block-granting welfare money to states should only be viewed
as a short-term approach since it does not substantially change
the relationship between givers (taxpayers) and receivers (welfare
recipients).  As soon as possible, givers must become individuals
and private charities, not different levels of government.  To
move in that direction, states should block grant funds directly
to counties and require them to contract out the delivery of welfare
services on a strict performance basis.  Counties should receive
incentives for involving private charities, and block grants at
all levels should be reduced over time.
<P>
 Washington state legislators began serious welfare reform negotiations
in 1995.  Talks broke down when the Senate refused to discuss
limiting the number of months recipients could collect benefits.
 Negotiations began again this year, but once again faltered over
the issues of time limits, family caps, and cash payments to recipients.
 The House proposal, which will likely be revived again next year,
moves in the right direction.  Among its major provisions:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>A maximum of 36 months of assistance.  Benefits would be cut
over time.  However, there would be exemptions to the time limit
for those caring for an incapacitated person, a child under two,
and for victims of domestic or sexual assault.
<P>
 <LI> Recipients would sign contracts outlining their responsibilities
and would be required to participate in a job-training and job-search
program (with certain exemptions).
<P>
<LI> Unwed teen mothers would receive no cash payments and would
be restricted in their living arrangements and in the amount of
benefits they could receive.
<P>
<LI> Recipients in job programs would receive full child care and
transitional child care.
<P>
<LI> Unwed mothers would be required to identify the fathers of
their children.
</ul><P>
 We recommend that the state legislature also undertake the following
reforms:
<P>
<ul>
<LI> Stringently enforce child support.
<P>
<LI> Ease restrictions that make adoption difficult.
<P>
<LI> Ease regulations on private charities and offer greater tax
incentives for charitable contributions.
<P>
<LI> Change program incentives so that state welfare agencies redefine
success as the number of people removed from welfare rolls and
placed in long-term employment.
</ul>
<P>
 Interestingly, the mere talk of tough welfare reform seems to
be having an effect.  Fewer people are applying for welfare in
Washington state than last year despite no significant changes
in the law or the economy.  Experts have no explanation for this.
<P>
 We are, however, concerned about the curt dismissal of some programs
that are religious in nature.  Religion-based charities have a
far better track record of helping the needy than centralized
bureaucratic programs.  Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice's program,
&quot;Faith and Families,&quot; should be replicated in Washington.
 It pairs welfare recipients with a church of their choice and
offers personal, practical, and spiritual guidance.
<P>
 Hundreds of charities, nonprofit organizations, and privatesector
job-training and placement programs already serve the needy. 
Many of them have a proven record of operating efficiently and
with a high degree of accountability.  In the long run, we advocate
abolishing government-run welfare entirely.  Far from being a
cruel or reckless approach, this change would help renew our families,
neighborhoods, churches, and communities--the institutions best
able to serve the needy.  Each of us must set an example and lead
the way.  No government program can compete with that kind of
first-person compassion.

Pick up any news article about crime and somewhere in it you are likely to come across a reference to the  
Sentencing Project, a little known Washington, D.C. think tank which focuses on crime issues.  A Nexis  
search reveals that the group's name has appeared in 219 stories, 71 of them since the start of last year.  <p>
  Although obviously a press darling, the Sentencing Project (TSP) is unlike other Washington think tanks.   
It has none of the glitz of better-known policy groups:  no fancy offices or panelled conference rooms or  
glossy annual report.  What is remarkable about TSP's success is that it promotes its agenda while  
remaining obscure as an organization.  <p>
  Housed in a run-down part of Washington around the corner from the tour buses parked outside Ford's  
Theater, the group promotes what it calls "alternative sentencing programs."  From dingy offices reached  
by an antique elevator, it issues a stream of reports and policy papers whose titles - "Building Alternatives  
Instead of Jails"; "Racial Disparity in `Crack' Cocaine Sentencing"; and "Why `3 Strikes and You're Out'  
Won't Reduce Crime" - remind the reader that the absence of subtlety or nuance is not an invention of talk  
radio.  <p>
  These reports generally hammer away at two points.  The first is that locking up criminals does not reduce  
crime.  The second is that the criminal justice system is rigged against racial minorities.  These conclusions  
find their way to the front pages of major newspapers, the evening television news broadcasts, and the  
speeches of politicians.  <p>
  TSP is virtually a conservative caricature of liberal crime policy.  Rather than focus on the finding of guilt  
and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, it seeks to uncover the sociology of "root causes" of  
crime.  And it attacks the political motivations of those who favor penalizing criminal behavior.  What is  
astounding is that we are paying for TSP.  The nonprofit 501(c)(3) group is funded through a "major grant"  
from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance.  <p>
  TSP was founded in 1986 by Malcolm C. Young, who had been associated with the National Council on  
Crime and Delinquency, another liberal crime group.  Young remains TSP's Executive Director.  Assistant  
Director Marc Mauer is its chief spokesman and he writes many TSP reports.  <p>  
  Although most people would consider TSP's notions of justice to be marginal and even kooky, the group  
is not without influence in the criminal law arena, where liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law  
professors continue to take these ideas seriously.  TSP in 1992 increased its visibility by establishing a  
professional association, the National Association of Sentencing Advocates.  TSP also runs the Campaign  
for an Effective Crime Policy, a coalition of "criminal justice professionals" working against  
"demagoguery on crime."  <p>
   Public faith in the criminal justice system has been strained for some time.  Doubts about the system's  
fairness have fueled citizen disgust with political leaders who seem more concerned about the procedural  <p>
rights of criminals than with the suffering of their victims.  How can public confidence be restored when  
tax money is used to finance the advocates of the very policies which provoke the mistrust?  Is it any  
wonder the public is angry?   <p>
  
<a name="race"><b>Race and Imprisonment: What's the Connection?</b></a>  <p>
  The Sentencing Project is best known for its much-publicized work on the nexis between race and  
incarceration.  In 1995, the group released a study which showed one in every three black men between the  
ages of 20 to 29 was under the supervision of the criminal justice system:  either in jail or prison, or on  
parole or probation.  Entitled Young Black Americans and the Criminal Justice System, the study was  
reported in virtually every major media outlet, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Los  
Angeles Times, CNN, and National Public Radio.  Jesse Jackson invoked it during his speech at the  
"Million Man March" in Washington.    <p>
  One major finding of the report is that the war on drugs has a disproportionate impact on minorities.  It  
concludes that the effort by law enforcement authorities to stamp out illegal drugs and various proposals to  
get tough on crime are contributing to a "growing racial disparity in the criminal justice system."  Indeed, it  
claims that the war on drugs has been an "unmitigated disaster" for young blacks.  <p>
  TSP blames the increase in the number of blacks in the criminal justice system on what it sees as a  
lopsided emphasis on convictions relating to crack cocaine.  It attributes this to "police practices that target  
inner-city communities for intensive drug enforcement. . . ."  <p>
  TSP's illogical evasion of responsibility is evident when it blames not drugs but the war on drugs for the  
destruction of a generation of young black males.  Crack cocaine is destructive.  The evidence shows that  
violence is associated with crack cocaine far more than with the powder variety.  As social policy expert  
Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has observed:  "The evidence is quite clear . . .  
Crack is a more addictive, violence-creating drug than is powder cocaine.  Period."  <p>
  Underlying TSP's report is the belief that many of those convicted and sent to prison are low-level drug  
offenders who do not pose a threat to society.  However, as Princeton Professor and crime expert John  
DiIulio noted recently in the Washington Post, "virtually all drug offenders behind bars are in for drug  
trafficking, not mere possession" _ and most "have long criminal records."  Says DiIulio, "anyone who  
thinks U.S. attorneys or big-city cops focus their enforcement energies against petty drug criminals must be  
either statistically illiterate or smoking something."  <p>
  The black community has indeed suffered from the scourge of crack cocaine.  But this argues for greater  
vigilance in stamping out its sale and use.  Black families will suffer most from any slackening of law  
enforcement.  While TSP argues that the war on drugs serves to "exacerbate" racial "inequities," its  
solution is to go easy on the drug criminals who devastate inner-city communities.    <p>
  TSP Assistant Director Marc Mauer proposes a "renewed dialogue on drug policy."  He notes obliquely  
that the disciplining of former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders "for advocating a discussion of drug  
policy" indicated a lack of "serious discussion" about substance abuse.  Elders was talking about legalizing  
drugs, and Mauer's euphemistic call for "dialogue" is nothing more than an excuse for starting down the  
road toward drug legalization.    <p>
  TSP's policy research has usefully documented how drug crimes have led to the imprisonment of all too  
many young black men.  But it is tragic for the black community that this research should result in such  
misguided policy recommendations.  These proposals should make the public wary of "policy experts" who  
claim to know the significance of their own findings.  
  <p>
<a name="crime"><b>To Let the Punishment Fit the Crime </b> </a><p>
  TSP's ideas about race and the criminal justice system follow from the group's premise that incarceration  
just doesn't work and that it's simply not an enlightened way to deal with persons convicted of crimes.  The  
group opposes mandatory minimum sentences and "three-strikes-and-you're-out" proposals that require life  
sentences for three-time violent offenders.  TSP says the latter are "harsh" and "divert public attention from  
a full discussion of the causes of violent crime."  Likewise, it opposes truth in sentencing measures that  
restrict parole, and it is hostile to just about anything that increases the penalty for committing a crime. <p> 
  TSP dismisses attempts to introduce greater accountability in criminal law and certainty in sentencing as  
unsophisticated responses to the public's alarm over crime.  It also denigrates them as a way for politicians  
to exploit middle class hysteria.  In 1994, Mauer told the press, "Part of what is driving this [effort to crack  
down on crime] is politicians' simplistic approach to dealing with crime and part is suburban America's  
fears."  <p>  
  Testifying before Congress in 1994, Mauer said that incarceration "has a limited impact on crime" and  
there is no "clear relationship between crime and incarceration."  But if keeping criminals out of prison  
does not increase crime rates one might as well believe that keeping Congress in session will not lead to  
more laws.<p>    
  The Council on Crime in America, a project of the New Citizenship Project, has demonstrated the relation  
of crime and punishment in a recently published study entitled The State of Violent Crime in America.  It  
takes note of the "obvious reality that prisons restrain convicted criminals from committing large numbers  
of crimes that they would be committing if free."  In other words, much serious crime is averted each year  
by keeping convicted criminals behind bars.  The report cites a number of empirical studies which estimate  
that for each additional incarcerated felon, anywhere from 12 to 17 additional crimes will not be committed  
each year.  <p>   
  Moreover, by applying 1973 crime rates to the 1989 population, the report estimates that there were  
60,000 fewer rapes, 323,000 fewer robberies, and 380,000 fewer assaults in 1989.  In other words, contrary  
to the assertions of TSP, increasing the prison population in the 1980s significantly reduced violent crime  
below what it would have otherwise been.  (This is not to suggest that one should take heart about the  
current crime situation; only that it could have been much worse.) <p> 
  This is common sense to most people, but not to TSP, which insists that increasing the number of prisons  
and prisoners has had no effect.  As the Council report observed, "It apparently takes a Ph.D. in  
criminology to doubt that if we released half of all prisoners tonight, we would experience more crime  
tomorrow."<p>  
  Another recent study, this one conducted by the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis,  
bolsters these conclusions.  Focusing on crime in Texas, the report demonstrates how a more aggressive  
incarceration policy has lead to a dramatic reduction in the state's crime rate.  According to the study, the  
overall rate of serious crime in Texas has been cut by 35 percent and is at its lowest level since 1973.  This  
follows a four-year building boom, which has raised prison capacity from 49,000 to 150,000, with the  
state's prison population increasing to 64 percent above the national average.  The data is also interesting in  
that it refutes TSP's mantra that longer sentences do not deter crime:  In Texas, the average time served for  
serious crimes climbed from 1.9 years to 3 years.  <p>
  While TSP argues that prison is a failure, the evidence from the states paints a different picture.  Yet to  
the true believer facts are irrelevant; and TSP remains undaunted.  Not only does it reject the proposition  
that putting criminals in prison reduces crime, it also contends that increasing the number of police will not  
bring the crime rate down.  "There is little relationship between the number of police per capita and crime  
rates," Mauer wrote in a 1994 USA Today op-ed.   
  <p>
<a name="answ"><b>Bad Answers to Foolish Questions</b></a><p>	  
TSP is preoccupied with explaining the "causes" of crime.   
Predictably, it blames the failures on society.  This familiar refrain condemns "abuse and neglect" for crime  
and censures "attitudes toward women" and "the ready availability of firearms in this country" for violence.   
In Mauer's view, "incarceration speaks very little to poor schooling, dysfunctional families, or limited job  
skills."  <p>
  What then is the answer?  More government spending.  TSP wants to spend tax dollars not on stopping  
crimes or catching criminals, but on social programs for more treatment and counseling, for education and  
recreation.  Mauer testified that "programs such as Head Start and Job Corps are cost effective in reducing  
long-term crime control costs."  Washington liberals conclude that every ill plaguing society can be cured  
by a government program; crime is no exception.    <p>
  Mauer actually has gone so far as to suggest that Hillary Clinton's health care task force should serve as a  
"model" for how the country should approach crime policy.  He noted approvingly that President Clinton  
"assembled a team of hundreds of experts to dissect and analyze every aspect of the health care system. . .  
."  And he wondered why there has been no parallel effort with respect to crime.  (Hint:  Hillary's task force  
was a failure!)  TSP sees this as part of a "more rational and humane" approach to crime.  Given the voters'  
revulsion at Mrs. Clinton's health care machinations, what could be more cruel?  <p>
  Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, a Capital Research Center trustee, says TSP operates in a  
"fantasy world."  "Of course crime reflects deeper societal problems," adds Meese, "but that doesn't answer  
the question of what to do about the criminals on the streets right now.  How do we keep known criminals  
from committing more crimes?"  The answer is to "put them where they can no longer harm others _ in  
prison."  <p>
  
<a name="edna"><b>Sources of Funding:  The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation</b></a>  <p>
  TSP reflects the world-view of its benefactor, the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, a prime patron of  
left-wing causes from the ACLU to the Children's Defense Fund.  With assets of $500 million, the Clark  
Foundation is one of America's largest foundations.  Mrs. Clark's father was the founder of Avon Products,  
and her husband, with whom she established the Foundation in 1950, was chairman of the board of the  
cosmetics business.  The Foundation is unrelated to the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation (see April  
Foundation Watch).   <p>
  Like TSP, the Foundation wants to "move the corrections system away from an overreliance on jails and  
prisons."  Its annual report repeats the buzz phrases of anti-incarceration advocates:  "community-based  
punishments"; "inadequate investment"; "intermediate punishments"; "unnecessary incarceration";  
"nonviolent offenders"; and "alternatives."    <p>
  In 1994 TSP received three grants from the Clark Foundation totaling $195,271.  The year before the  
Foundation awarded TSP two grants totaling $334,000.  Besides providing financial backing to TSP, the  
Clark Foundation's Program for Justice also supports the Families Against Mandatory Minimums  
Foundation, which opposes laws setting minimum sentences for various crimes.  It also funds the American  
Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, awarding it $825,000 in 1994.  The National Prison Project  
is a prisoners' "rights" organization that litigates on behalf of incarcerated criminals.  <p> 
  This is elitism at its worst.  The folks at TSP and the Clark Foundation can win kudos from academics by  
theorizing about alternatives to prison.  But the urban poor who must suffer the consequences of crime as  
well as the consequences of naive crime policies have no such luxury.  They are not interested in  
speculating about root causes.  Instead, they want to see criminals swept from the streets.    
<p><a name="fund"><b>Federal Government Funding</b></a>  <p>
  TSP's private foundation funding is augmented by the federal government.  The Justice Department's  
support will enable TSP to "publish a guide for the establishment and operation of defense-based  
alternative sentencing programs."  (According to the most recent information available through FAADS,  
the federal grants database, the Justice Department awarded TSP $125,000 in the last quarter of 1993.)<p>  
  Last year, Congress failed to deal with the problem of government funding of nonprofit advocacy groups.   
Reps. Ernest Istook (R-OK), David McIntosh (R-IN) and Robert Ehrlich (R-MD) were unable to convince  
their colleagues that federal grants should not be given to nonprofit groups engaged in political advocacy.   
But TSP illustrates why action on this front is needed now more than ever.  You wouldn't know it by  
visiting its offices, but TSP is one of the most influential players in the ongoing debate about crime.   
Regrettably, it is the kind of influence we could do without.  <p>
  Media and political elites bemoan what they characterize as public cynicism toward government  
institutions.  They should not be so perplexed.  What else can one expect when citizens discover that their  
tax dollars are squandered so foolishly?  The public demands protection from crime, yet finds its money  
spent on those whose solution is keep criminals out of jail.

<h2>The Ronald McDonald House</h2>
<b><I>The House That Love Built</I></b><BR>
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><a href="#name">By Gwen Vereen Purtill & Patrick D. Purtill, Jr</a></FONT></B>
<P>
  Debbie Wargos voice was cheerful and warm and she got straight to the point.  I was calling three minutes after my husband and I were to have arrived to interview her at the Ronald McDonald House.<p>
  Gwen! I was just taking your name in vain. Are we going to have to reschedule?
  We had come down with an ugly flu last night, I explained, and didnt think we ought to share it with the kids.<p>
  Yes, she agreed, wed have to ask you not to come in under the circumstances. So many of the children here have suppressed immune systems. We agreed to have a preliminary talk by phone and visit 
the House when we were well.<p>
  Debbie is the executive director of the Ronald McDonald House, a 22-bedroom facility in northeast Washington, D.C. Since 1980, it has provided a home away from home to families of children being treated for life-threatening illness in any of the areas hospitals. A family can stay indefinitely as long as their child is under active treatment. This hospitality extends to children who are receiving outpatient care such as chemotherapy or radiation.  The House serves families that live at least an hour away from the hospital where the child is being treated, or that face other circumstances that making it impossible for them to get back and forth. <p>
  The House itself is a large and inviting 1920s style structure, comprised of a main house and pavilion situated on a two-acre plot that allows for a large playground in back. On the ground floor of the main house are generous gathering rooms, the dining room and kitchen. The pavilion bridge houses a 
meditation/consultation room and a small library; on the ground floor of the pavilion is a television/playroom.<p>
  During its fifteen years of operation, the D.C. House has served nearly eight thousand families. The sixteenth of the now more than 160 Ronald McDonald Houses worldwide, the D.C. House is owned and operated by Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Washington D.C., a nonprofit organization. 
Roughly 50 percent of those served by the DC House are children from military families being treated at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington.
<p>
<h3>Missys Story</h3>
<p>
  Missy Terry is from such a family. Missy and two of her three brothers and sisters were born in Korea to a military couple. Missys mother, Tara, left the service when  she and her husband Mark were sent to separate duty stations. In January 1995, Mark was posted to Korea for a second time and they decided that 
Tara and the children would move to Illinois to be near Taras family.
  In early March 1995, Tara took four-year-old Missy to see her doctor because she had what looked like a mild cold and had started waking up at night complaining of headaches. Unable to find anything wrong, 
the doctor sent her home. But a few days later, Missys lymph nodes began to swell and her face was noticeably puffy. Tara took her to the emergency room and doctors warned that Missy might not survive the night. Mark was on a plane home from Korea the next morning.<p>
  The diagnosis was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in which the bone-marrow and other blood-forming organs produce increased numbers of white blood cells. Missys white cell count was 1.2 million, with 92 percent leukemic cells. Three times Missy went through a process that removed the blood from her body 
and cleaned it. After all this, Missys white cell count came down to 350,000seven times what is considered high risk and roughly thirty-five times what is considered normal. Missys ability to fight off infection often is so low that everyday matters like using a drinking glass after her sisters or brother become seriously dangerous.<p>
  Nearly every day for three months, Missy and her family made the 110-mile drive to the hospital in St. Louis where she was being treated. It was a constant drain, remembers Tara. She now wonders why no one at the hospital suggested they stay at the Ronald McDonald House in St. Louis.<p>
   Each time the family adjusted to the demands of a regimen of treatment, it seemed that they were buffeted by something new. At first there was only the shock, but then Missy somehow lived through the initial phase of treatment. Then, Mark and Tara were told that Missy would have to have a broviac (an in-
dwelling catheter) implanted in her chest; it seemed like the end of the world. Next began the day-to day business of contending with chemotherapy, while watching their little girl lose her hair. <p>
  At first, Missy was as frightened as they were. She wasnt feeling all that sick, but suddenly teams of doctors were descending on her. Now, Tara says, Missy is not afraid of anything. She knows how to take care of the broviac, and when a nurse is careless, she tells her what she is doing wrong. At home, she does 
the heparin push in her own tube and always remembers her pills. Tara describes Missy as bright, energetic and an attention seeker. It is easy for onlookers to forget, but kids will be kids. Tara and Mark still have to 
discipline her occasionally, but it is hard. Missy is not allowed to misbehave. But now, says Tara, she and Mark evaluate the situation more generously before deciding that it really is important that Missy is told no.<p>
  In late June of 1995, the family was transferred to Ft. Belvoir, south of Washington, D.C., and Missy became a patient at Walter Reed, one of the armys three major hospitals. The move exacted a terrible emotional toll on the family. It was horrible, Tara says, We knew no one. <p>
  The family went directly to the hospital when they arrived in Washington because Missy had an infection. She stayed there for twenty-three days. The family had no place to live. The first night in town they paid $85 for a hotel room that Tara describes as unpleasant. Taking matters into their own hands they asked a hospital social worker to place them in a Ronald McDonald House. He made the referral, and they stayed there for three weeks until Missy was released.<p>
  During those three weeks, the family stayed in the downstairs bone marrow apartment of the D.C. Ronald McDonald House. The Terrys consider themselves private people, and did not especially relish the idea of staying in a group environment. But the staff helped them to get over their discomfort. At the House there was always someone to talk to who was concerned about their needs. Even now as Tara gets more involved with support organizations, she says that only at the Ronald McDonald House is everyone consistently supportive. <p>
  Tara was especially impressed that the House takes it in stride when residents fail to appreciate what is being done for them. They ask nothing but that you clean up after yourself. Some people do not even do that. They really seem to understand the stress level better even than hospital staff.<p>
 One day, in particular, the Terrys were exhausted and tense. A woman in the kitchen spoke sharply to Missy, who was out of the hospital on a pass. Mark came downstairs and blew his top. Later he went to Barbara Silverman, the Resident Manager, to apologize for making a scene.  Barbara was unruffled; she understood his stress.<p>
  During that time, Missy was in treatment at the hospital for 72 hour periods. But occasionally the hospital would let her leave on a pass for eight hours. Back at the House she could be with her parents and see her brothers and sisters who were at the House all the time.<p>
  Tara thinks her family has been very proactive in doing research and looking into Missys options. But she says the Ronald McDonald House was their only source of support during that period. Without it there would have been more crises. Because you are in the hospital so much, you see a lot. It really gets depressing. But at least we had a place to go. At the Ronald McDonald House, we could see a friendly face, talk to people, and vent our frustration.<p>
  While the family was emotionally needy, they saw many families at the House who were in much worse financial shape. The staff of the Ronald McDonald House gave one family Christmas presents and food vouchers. Tara especially felt for the overseas families that were separated because usually only one parent 
could accompany the child to the U.S.<p>
  After Missys initial stay at the Ronald McDonald House, the family moved to Ft. Belvoir in Northern Virginia, forty-seven miles on the other side of Washington from Missys hospital. If her other children were not in school, they would still be staying at the House. Tara says it is the first place she will look to if Missy should relapse or if Mark is transferred. <p>
  Missy is on a high dose chemotherapy regimen, and has lost her hair. People often mistake her for a little boy, says Tara. One day in the park, kids made fun of her hair, so now she wears a baseball cap all the time. But despite having tubes in her chest, she is very active; she runs and plays. You get to a point in all 
this of feeling sorry for yourself. But she is so strong, so happy, and so outgoingshe keeps us going. She has lost so muchher dance classes and pre-school. She has done very wellbetter than we have.<p>
  Missy currently is in a two-year maintenance phase of her treatment by experimental chemotherapy. They do most of the maintenance at home, including the chemo, which is administered through her leg. She only has to go into the hospital about three days every month. Doctors say Missy has about a 30% 
chance of making it through the maintenance regimen without a relapse. The family had a scare near the end of January when Missys white blood cell count dropped suddenly. If there is a relapse, the initial thirty-day induction stage of intensive treatment in the hospital starts again. It is also likely that doctors 
would prescribe a risky bone marrow transplant, which they have not done yet because none of Missys brothers or sisters are a match.  In either case, the family plans to spend their nights at the Ronald McDonald House while Missy sleeps. <p>
  If all goes well, there will be a final five-year phase of treatment. But it will be at least another seven years before Missy is out of the woods. Meanwhile, Tara now tells other families about the House because she thinks that it can help them through the crisis. When you need them, she says, it really makes the 
difference between whether the situation is bearable or unbearable.<p>
  Tara still feels isolated here. The couple made a few friends at the Ronald McDonald House. But they are finding that it is hard to start new friendships  because they are so emotionally needy and often exhausted. As a result Tara has started working with support groups. At least  everyone there is in the same boat. The House is sponsoring an Easter egg hunt in April, and Tara intends to take the children. Even if you are not staying at the House anymore, they are always open to you if you need it, she says.<p>
<h3>Full House</h3>
  <p>
The week before we visited the D.C. Ronald McDonald House, only five of its twenty-two rooms were occupied. But by the time we arrived on a Monday afternoon, Barbara, the resident manager, was juggling families and rooms. It is impossible to tell from day to day what the need will be. During busy times like 
these, the House has its medical priorities. The original mission of the Ronald McDonald Houses gave cancer and leukemia patients the highest priority as well as any child in an intensive care unit. The level of priority works its way down from there. Debbie tells us that they would never turn away a high priority 
family. If necessary, they will look for a hotel in the area willing to donate a room while the House is full. <p>
  When space is available, grandparents and other relatives may stay at the House. Like immediate family members, they are asked to make the customary $10 per night donation. However, reservations for extended family members are handled on a day-to-day basis.<p>
  Families must be referred by the hospital that is treating the child. Usually a hospital social worker or sometimes a doctor or nurse makes the referral. No walk-ins are accepted at Ronald McDonald Houses. There are few problems because the social workers assess whether the family is looking for a hotel or 
needs a temporary home. Occasionally a family cannot fit into the group setting, but  very rarely is anyone asked to leave. When  family members check in, they go through an orientation during which are asked to agree to, and sign, a handbook specifying  the House rules. Occasionally, a family will decide not to stay, 
but that doesnt happen very often.<p>
   Most families stay for two or more weeks. They live in a group setting and are responsible for doing their own laundry and cooking.  A cheerful plaque that hangs on an interior wall as you enter the kitchen sums up the philosophy and organization of the entire operation: This is a self-cleaning kitchen. Please clean up after yourself. Opposite,  numbered cupboards store the food purchased by families.  A common pantry is provided although the families buy most of their own food. Barbara coordinates emergency provisions for the pantry from local vendors, clubs, organizations, and individuals.<p>
  Most people welcome the opportunity to engage in the normal activities of daily lifecooking their own meals, doing laundry, cleaning up common areas. They want to feel they are doing something useful for their family and others at a time when they may feel helpless in the face of a childs illness.<p>

<h3>A Surrogate Community</h3>
<p>
  There are plenty of restaurants and hotels in the Washington area, but most families simply cannot afford to eat out every night and stay in hotels for a prolonged periodespecially if they already face large medical bills. Hotels leave families isolated at a time when they most need emotional support.  Kate Shafer, a social worker at Childrens Hospital, says the  House provides an opportunity for normal interaction for couples and extended family. They  can sleep restfully  knowing they are five minutes away from their sick child. And the child can sleep soundly knowing mom and dad are minutes away. 
According to Shafer, parents away from home and family find a naturally supportive community of 
people who are uniquely sensitive to their needs.<p>
  Staff believe that this temporary community, while ones own is out of reach, is one of the most important 
services the house provides. Families can sit down together over breakfast and informally compare notes 
on what to expect as treatment progresses. Newer patients can ask those who know the ropes about hospital 
services and staff, or they can find out how to deal with practical problems that arise as they try to take care 
of a child who is in transition from the hospital.<p>
  Like most places that cater to children, Ronald McDonald Houses go all out for holidays. Groups bring in 
Christmas presents or Valentines Day treats. Some will bring little favors or bake cookies. At Halloween a 
group always comes to decorate the stairwell, and the kids go trick-or-treating at Catholic University a few 
blocks away. When we visited, the House was celebrating a mothers birthday.  Barbara provided  a cake, 
and small presents were waiting to be opened. In preparation for Valentines Day, a table in the hall held 
dozens of favors, prepared by volunteers, awaiting the return of the families that evening.<p>
  Giving the House a homey feel is crucial to its mission. Much of that feeling is achieved by the staff and 
volunteers who keep the atmosphere informal. But while hospital staff often try to keep things informal  no 
one has ever left a hospital thinking it had a homey feeling. In this House children are allowed to play. It 
is a place where kids can just be themselvesa place where they feel comfortable enough to allow their 
thinning hair to show. Even structurally, the House encourages community. Rooms dont form an insular 
world the way they do in hotels. There is only one central kitchen. The bathrooms are shared. Telephones 
and televisions are in common areas so families are more or less forced to go out, just as they would at 
home.<p>
  Because of this, the supportive bonds formed at the House often grow into lifetime friendships. Early in 
its history, the House had a number of children with extremely serious cancers, and many of them did not 
make it. Some of those families still keep in touch, and even get together for holidays.<p>
  A very ill teenage girl has been at the D.C. House with her father for several months. Her mother died 
several years ago. When she first came to the House, she told Barbara that all of her friends had dropped 
her because they were unable to understand what she was going through. She has since become attached  to 
the staff and to some of the mothers and children staying at the House, and they to her.<p>
  We are her friends, says Barbara. If you asked her whether she would like to be here or at home, at this 
stage she probably would say here. She was in the hospital, but when it looked as if she was certain to get 
better, she asked if she could stay here during her physical therapy. Shes more comfortable hereexcept 
for Max, her dog. She misses Max.
<p>
<h3>Day by Day</h3>
<p>
  While Debbie Wargo goes out into the community looking for financial and other help, Barbara works 
with the families and the volunteers. Her job is to keep everything functioning and everyone living as one 
big happy family. Says Barbara, she raises all the money and I get to spend it.  Barbara tries to have 
volunteers on hand from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. each day to do everything from answering the telephones 
to checking in guests, checking rooms, attending to light maintenance, doing mailings, and baking cookies. 
Some 50 volunteers come in to help as often as twice a week or as little as  twice a month. Most  family 
activities take place in the evenings or first thing in the morning. But often healthy brothers and sisters are 
in the House during the day. When there is a healthy sibling under age sixteen, there is usually a parent at 
the House also.<p>
  The House rules are mostly just common sense. Children must be supervised by an adult. Quiet time is 10 
p.m. to 7 a.m. Because there is no maid service, families have to pick up after themselves and their children 
in the common areas as well as in their private rooms. And of course, they must make sure that their 
children are courteous to others. No smoking is permitted inside, and no alcohol may be drunk anywhere 
on the premises. Food and drinks are allowed in the dining room and kitchen only, unless a child is 
bedridden. <p>
  Because the House, its staff, and the families seem so cheerful, reminders of the purpose of Ronald 
McDonald House can be slightly jarring. Reading through the House rules is reminder enough. Hand 
washing is taken very seriously here, as is proper disposal of diapers, syringes, and blood specimens. 
House managers must be notified if anyone in the House is exposed to contagious disease; chicken pox can 
be fatal to children with weakened immune systems. <p>
  One of the most remarkable things about Barbara and Debbie is their approach to illness and death
particularly  the deaths of children. Certainly there is grief, which is as much a part of death as death is a 
part of life. But they are both passionate and practical about what they do. They have no soapbox, and there 
is no melodrama as they talk to us about the often terrible suffering of the families and children they serve. <p>

<h3>Practical Services</h3>
<p>
  This practical but caring approach manifests itself in several other services the House provides. For 
instance, a former playroom was converted into a classroom in 1992. Because patients, as well as their 
healthy brothers and sisters, often had no way of keeping up with their schoolwork, Fiorella Carmelino, the 
tutorial coordinator, has recruited and trained about sixteen volunteer tutors. They assist  patients at the 
House, their sisters and brothers, children who are confined to the hospital, and indeed any child at 
Childrens Hospital who requests help. Tutors spend two to three hours per week working with students on 
a one-to-one basis, usually meeting with two or three students per session.<p>
  As the nations capital, Washington offers children educational opportunities that can compensate for 
what they are missing in their schools at home. Volunteers from local colleges and retiree organizations 
serve as tutors and  chaperones on field trips. Outings are organized to such places as the Smithsonians Air 
and Space Museum, the National Gallery, the Lincoln Memorial, the White House, the Capitol, and the 
National Zoo.<p>
  The House also provides for many  families that dont have transportation, especially those who are flown 
in from overseas.  Shuttle vans run four times a day  to any hospital where a child is treated, and to grocery 
stores and to a shopping mall on the weekend. Even those who do bring a car may find  the prospect of 
driving in a large, unfamiliar city daunting.<p>
  And to keep families in touch with friends and relatives, MCI and AT&T have donated special phones  
for brief long-distance calls every day. Regular phone service is also available, and three pay phones are on 
the premises. The House even provides pagers to parents whose children are in intensive care so that the 
hospital can reach them no matter where they are day or night.<p>

<h3>The House That Love Built</h3>
<p>
  The first Ronald McDonald House was the product of a quixotic partnership of an NFL franchise, a 
pediatric oncologist, and local McDonalds franchise owners (see sidebarpage 4). The concept grew out 
of a conversation between Fred Hill, a tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, and Dr. Audrey Evans, one of 
the doctors treating Hills three-year-old daughter Kim for leukemia. The first house opened near 
Philadelphia Childrens Hospital in 1974.<p>
  Debbie describes their relationship with McDonalds as wonderfulboth in terms of manpower and on a 
volunteer level. If the House needs a van it may ask local franchise owners to  raise the money. 
McDonalds suppliers also help the Ronald McDonald House. The D.C. House, for instance, receives free 
dairy products from the Shenandoah Pride Dairy.<p>
  None of the Ronald McDonald Houses could exist solely on what McDonalds does for them. This is 
especially true for the larger Houses. The D.C. House, for instance, depends on the community for the 
overwhelming majority of its annual operating budget. It fluctuates yearly, but is now at just over 
$700,000.  McDonalds restaurant counter boxes are projected to account for just over 17% of the 1996 
budget.<p>
  Debbie, who has been executive director for seven years, is responsible for public relations, management 
and fund-raising. Her very active, forty member Board, composed of parents of children with cancer, 
doctors, social workers, McDonalds representatives, and community leaders, assists with management, 
finance, fund-raising and special events. Each board member must serve on at least one committee.<p>
  The House had no executive director from the time the House opened in 1980 until Debbie came on in 
1989.  The sole staff person, a resident manager, lived on the premises and the Board filled in as needed. 
Debbie now directs four full-time and four part-time staff members.<p>
  While the D.C. House participates in the Combined Federal Campaign, it does not receive any 
government money. In fact, its fund-raising relies almost exclusively on local projects designed to serve a 
dual purpose, raise the always-needed funds, and increase community awareness of the facility. Special 
events raise a  large portion of their budget. While always happy to accept money, the House also 
welcomes gifts in kind. Right now Debbie is looking for a van and a new plain paper fax machine.<p>
  If the Ronald McDonald House has an event planned Debbie tries to get it on the radio or in the 
newspaper. Often she will put out a call for volunteers to  adopt  parts of the garden, bake cookies, or rake 
the yard. She constantly reminds the community that the House depends upon volunteers every day from 
9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.  This high profile approach helps to insure that the community knows that there is a 
Ronald McDonald House in the area that needs volunteers and money.<p>
  Recalling the role of the Philadelphia Eagles, the largest annual fund-raising event involves the 
Washington Redskins football team. The event, Rally Round the Redskins, was begun in the Houses  
first year of operation. It features a live and silent auction, dinner, and an autograph and photo session 
which the House holds with the Redskins each fall. The entire teamcoaches and playersis invited to 
greet anyone who might be interested in meeting  the players and supporting the House. <p>
  Each year there also is an annual golf tournament and four or five smaller events. These included wine 
tastings, raffles, and a dinner cruise. This March the House held its first annual Ultimate Hunt for the 
Good Egg. Eighty celebrity-decorated Easter Eggs, creations by the likes of by Elton John, Corretta Scott 
King, General Norman Schwartzkopf, President Ford and Bob and Elizabeth Dole were auctioned off. The 
event, cosponsored with Neiman Marcus, culminated in the presentation of the first annual Good Egg 
Award to Donna and Gilbert Giordano, keystone supporters of the House.
<h3>Giving Back</h3>
<p>
  The D.C. Ronald McDonald House asks that families who can afford it pay a $10 fee per daynicely 
splitting the difference between the high ($25) and low ($5) established by the Ronald McDonald House 
International Advisory Board. It is certainly not for the revenue, says Debbie. This may be a matter of 
opinion, but I believe the old saying that when people get something for nothing they sometimes dont 
value it, or they almost forget that it costs something for them to stay here. At least this small stipend helps 
families feel that they belong and that they are making a contribution or giving back.  Debbie and Barbara 
estimate that the fee is  waived for at least half of the families. <p>
  But the House, they are quick to remind us, runs on two things: one is money, the other is volunteer 
power. So they also ask all families to volunteer in the House. As with the fee, help is asked on an as 
youre able basis. Some families have many hours to volunteer, others dont. This often depends on how 
sick their child is and how much time theyre spending at the hospital. But most families are quite willing  
to do things for the common areas like take out the trash and change light bulbs.<p>
  Helping out also depends on how each individual deals with stress. Some people need to keep busy, 
others internalize their energy and become contemplative. One  father who was here during  the 
extraordinary blizzards in 1996 kept the walk clear. It was his way to relieve stress and help out. Barbara 
remembers another father whose child was not going to live. He mowed the lawn to relieve stress. The 
childs mother had to be at the hospital; he had to leave. He had to mow the lawn. Thats how he dealt with 
it. For many guests, being able to pull a weed in the garden not only makes them feel more at home, it is a 
necessary pressure valve.<p>
  Currently Debbie and board members are busy supervising the building of another Ronald McDonald 
House on the grounds of Fairfax Hospital in Virginia. It will be an eight bedroom facility to better serve 
hospitals in the Northern Virginia area. Having received the go-ahead, they have selected the design of the 
House and have found builders. They have a lease in hand, and if all goes well the groundbreaking will be 
in August or September.<p> 
  Meanwhile, they also are expanding the House in northeast D.C. The Board of Zoning has approved a 
manufactured three-bedroom housing unit to house three additional bone marrow transplant families, 
whose children need an even greater levels of isolation because of  their weakened immune systems.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
  As rising medical costs threaten families whose children require treatment over a long period, clearly the 
Ronald McDonald House provides a helpful safety net. Parents may miss work and have trouble meeting 
uninsured  costs.  But at the Ronald McDonald House they at least will have food and shelter for little or no 
cost.<p>
  Yet the House serves an even more important function. At a time when a familys emotional stability is at 
risk and when financial and personal tensions may be high, Ronald McDonald House keeps the family 
together. Painful decisions about who has to stay behind are avoided because the House keeps parents close 
to their hospitalized child. It relieves the necessity of long and frequent drives to the hospital when a child 
is in pain or queasy from treatment. And it allows family members to remain charitable to one another 
under the weight of stress and exhaustion. When families are spending day after day with a loved one at the 
hospital, it is hard to overestimate the healing power of a warm shower, a comfortable bed, and a meal that 
didnt come from the hospital cafeteria.
<p>
<h3>The First Ronald McDonald House</h3><p>
  When Fred Hill, tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, asked Dr. Audrey Evans, head of the pediatric 
oncology unit at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, how he could help the families she was working with, 
neither expected her answer to that question to grow into a household name. <p>
  What Dr. Evans wanted was a house that could serve as a temporary residence for the families of children  
treated at her hospital. She caught Hill at his most receptive. Ever since his daughter Kim had been 
diagnosed with leukemia, Hill and his wife had camped out on hospital chairs and benches, eating food 
from vending machines, and doing all they could to keep Kim from seeing their fear, exhaustion, and 
frustration.<p>
  All around them, other parents were doing exactly the same thing. Many of the families had traveled great 
distances to bring their children to the hospital, but the high cost of hotel rooms was more than they could 
afford. Hill was convinced that Dr. Evans idea for a home-away-from-home for families of seriously ill 
children was exactly what was needed. <p>
  Hill rallied his teammates. Through the Philadelphia Eagles general manager, Jim Murray, the whole 
team offered its support. While Dr. Evans looked for real estate around the hospital, Murray called on his 
friends at McDonalds, who were planning a St. Patricks Day Shamrock Shake promotion. On requesting 
a portion of the proceeds, Murray was told by the local McDonalds that the project could have them all.<p>
  The Shamrock Shake promotion raised some $35,000, almost enough to cover the $40,000 purchase price 
of a four-story, seven-bedroom house that Dr. Evans found near the hospital. The interior required 
extensive renovation to convert it from a student rooming house into a temporary home for kids and their 
families. With help from a local developer whose own daughter had been diagnosed with leukemia, the 
house was gutted, rebuilt, furnished, and opened in October of 1974. <p>
  When it came time to name the house, they decided on the Ronald McDonald House in gratitude to the 
local franchise owners who had helped so generously, and because it was hoped that it would be 
comforting for a hospitalized child to know that his parents would be staying at Ronalds House.<p>
  Within a year, word had spread and Eagles General Manager Jim Murray went to Chicago to help 
Childrens Memorial Hospital and several area residents establish a Ronald McDonald House there. Again, 
a milkshake promotion supported by local McDonalds and their customers provided the fundraising 
centerpiece. The second Ronald McDonald House opened in Chicago in April of 1977. <p>
  By 1979, 10 more Ronald McDonald Houses had opened. In the next five years, local communities 
founded 60 more Houses; then 53 more in the following five years. Today, there are 164 Ronald 
McDonald Houses in 13 countries. <p>
  <b>Kim Hill, the little girl whose illness started it all, is now a mother in California. And Jim Murray, the 
Eagles general manager who helped found the first and many subsequent Ronald McDonald Houses, now 
serves as president of the Ronald McDonald House International Advisory Board.</b>

<b>From The Editor:</b>
<P>
Right now, courts are supervising the child foster care programs in some 21 states.  In the 
District of Columbia, a federal court judge has stripped mayor Marion Barry of control 
over child welfare and replaced the elected city administration with a court-appointed 
consultant.  The judge described the "outrageous deficiencies" in D.C.'s child foster care 
in a March 17th, 1996 news story headlined "A Dickensian Picture" and reported on the 
front page of the Sunday New York Times.<p>
	What readers of the article did not learn from reporter Robert Pear was that almost 
twenty years ago the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, a private grantmaking 
philanthropy in New York City with current assets estimated at $90 million, laid the 
foundations for what has become the legal struggle to use the courts to revamp the child 
welfare system. <p>
	Led by its energetic and articulate executive director, Margaret C. Ayers, the 
Robert Sterling Clark Foundation is the story behind the re-orientation of the nation's 
thinking on child welfare.  Ayers is admirable for her forthrightness and willingness to 
clarify her views.  She spoke at length with Foundation Watch.  But the opinions she 
expresses and the goals for which she fights reveal the inherent limitations in her liberal 
though anti-bureaucratic stance:  She truly believes the paradoxical slogan "Pro-family, 
pro-choice."<p>
	Though it has funded the legal challenge to failing government child protection 
services, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation also funds those who support state action 
for abortion rights while attacking the rights of religious groups to establish childcare 
arrangements when parents are absent or unfit.<p>
	Sympathetic government bureaucrats, like Br'er Rabbitt, have often appreciated 
the adverse publicity and legal briar patches into which they are tossed by the Robert 
Sterling Clark Foundation.  Seeming to be opponents, government and its philanthropic 
adversaries have been, in fact, complicit in attempts to expand the power of the state over 
childcare and reduce the influence of independent institutions such as the Catholic 
Church.  <p>
	Although once dubbed a "government accountability project," the Foundation has 
succeeded in removing child welfare programs from the direct supervision of government 
officials who are accountable to the electorate.  Instead, a cadre of professional 
criminologists, sociologists, psychologists, educators and social workers has been 
empowered by the judicial process.  And while it opposes the theories of so-called 
"family preservation," much favored by some prominent child welfare advocacy groups, 
the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has funded those who would use the courts to 
establish alternative therapeutic regimes for the care of children.<p>
	Perplexingly, the Foundation's advocacy of child welfare derives from Margaret 
Ayers' feminism, which champions women's right to abortion and other so-called 
reproductive rights.  This is the second major funding priority of the Robert Sterling 
Clark Foundation.  The third is increased funding for cultural institutions and the arts.  In 
the past year, Ayers has capped these interests by announcing to the press her 
determination to resist those who are in opposition to the goals she supports.  She has 
organized this effort under the banner, "Fight the Right." <p>

<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<a name="in"></a>
<b>IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD</b><p>

The executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has spent a good part of her professional life working to reform the child welfare system.  In the 1960's Ayers spent four years as a New York City social worker who witnessed firsthand the abuse and suffering of children at the hands of an unresponsive bureaucracy.  She left the system after New York City's Commissioner of Welfare banned home visits by social workers in 1968, claiming that they constituted an invasion of privacy and an undesirable form of espionage.  (Ayers does not say this was the reason).  But she did not forget what she had seen nor the benefit of the home visits.<p>
	Ayers told Foundation Watch:  "Mitch Ginsberg [then-New York City welfare commissioner now deceased] separated income maintenance from services.  But the fact is that my colleagues and I were really social workers.  We were not there investigating clients.  We were there trying to help clients; help them get off welfare, substance abuse.  
When income maintenance was separated, the social work staff was reduced.  And the city hired paper pushers who did not provide services.  The caseworkers of the late 60s were not watchdogs.  We were trying to help welfare recipients get into programs that would enable them to lead constructive lives." <p>
	Following her stint in social work, and in a program associate position at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation (no relation, assets $525 million), Ayers came to Robert Sterling Clark as a consultant in 1976.  She found a small private foundation which gave out grants in an unfocused manner in many areas. <p>
	The Robert Sterling Clark Foundation was incorporated in 1952  to shelter and distribute a portion of the inheritance derived from the Singer sewing machine fortune.  Founder Robert Sterling Clark was the grandson of Edward Clark, a lawyer who founded the Singer company with Isaac Singer in the nineteenth century.  Last year, with a smaller 
$70 million fund, the Foundation gave away about $3.5 million.  A small operation with a staff of five, its giving reflects Ayers' intense personal commitment and leadership.<p>
	Says Ayers:  "The board hired me to look at what they'd been doing and try to figure out what fields it made sense to be in.  At that point the foundation was giving grants in ten fields.  There were lots of small grants in science, health, population, environment, education.  It wasn't a developed grants program.  It wasn't focused beyond 
broad categories.  Some areas were sufficiently broad as to render our grantmaking ineffective."<p>
	Ayers proposed to concentrate Clark's grants in three major areas: child welfare reform, monitoring the performance of government agencies in delivering services, and support for cultural institutions and the arts.  Since then, the Foundation has combined the first two fields, kept support for the arts, and added a third area: "insuring access to reproductive health information and services," which paid out grants totalling $1,406,000 in 1994 (information for 1995 is not yet available).  The largest single grant _ $200,000 _ 
went to The Planned Parenthood Federation of America to conduct research on pro-life activists.  By comparison, projects to improve public institutions in New York City and State were funded at the level of $1,084,000. The Foundation funded the arts and cultural institutions with grants totalling $1,196,080.<p>
	Ayers' concern for child welfare was an aspect of the Foundation's "government 
accountability" project begun in 1979 during the administration of New York City mayor 
Ed Koch. That effort focused on the city's administrative failings in responding to child 
abuse and neglect.<p>
	The Foundation made grants to the New York Civil Liberties Union to support litigation against the city.  In particular, from 1979 to 1994 it earmarked annual grants (excepting 1980 and 1988) to children's rights advocate Marcia Robinson Lowry.  She had come to fame as an attorney in a 1973 case, Wilder v. Bernstein, which forced New York City to end the use of religious criteria in making foster placements of children to Catholic and other religious homes.  In a consent decree, the city agreed that such placements violated constitutional guarantees of separation between church and state.<p>
	Since its first grant in 1979, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has given over 
$900,000 to the ACLU's children's rights project, which was headed until last year by Lowry.  In 1994 the foundation gave Lowry's project $80,000.  Last year Lowry left the ACLU to establish her own nonprofit, Children's Rights, Inc., with $90,000 in foundation support from Ayers.  At the ACLU Lowry enjoyed considerable success litigating child 
welfare and adoption cases, including the D.C. case which ended the Barry administration's authority over child protection services.  The essential role of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation in making those successes possible has received little public 
attention.<p>
	Stanley Brezenoff, who was responsible for child welfare enforcement as first deputy mayor in the Koch administration, says, "The unique thing about Peggy Ayers is that she and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation don't shrink from cutting edge issues.  <p>
We wouldn't have redoubled our effort to improve such a massive system, so unrelenting, such an enormous system, with thousands of reports of abuse and neglect, without the advocacy and prodding which came from the children's rights project.  We needed to be pushed and prodded.  The ACLU has come down on both sides.  It's not a liberal or conservative issue.  I admire Peggy and that foundation tremendously for what they've done."<p>
	Unfortunately, says Ayers, "A lot of the good we did, came undone," when David Dinkins replaced Koch as New York City's mayor.  Claiming ongoing city neglect of child welfare, Lowry's Children's Rights project at the ACLU filed the lawsuit Marisol A. <p>
v. Giuliani which is currently before U.S. District Judge Robert Ward in New York.  (The case, televised on Court TV, will also set precedent regarding the presence of cameras in a federal courtroom.)<p>

<b>TARGETED GIVING TO "FIGHT THE RIGHT"</b><p>

Passionate" is the word often used by those who know Ayers, executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation since 1979.  She uses the word herself: "I feel passionately about our work, the work of the foundation." In a universe known for an addiction to euphemism and dissimulation, what Dwight 
MacDonald called the "foundation-speak" of the "philanthropoids," Ayers is a refreshingly straight shooter.<p>
	Ayers is a shrewd politician whose views are respected by others in the world of organized philanthropy.  And she has a reputation as a "hands on" donor:  Ayers not only consults with the CEOs and development officers of the groups she funds, but she works directly with the staff members who run the programs that her grants support.<p>
	In many ways Margaret Ayers is the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation.  A tall handsome brunette in her mid-fifties, Ayers lives in Manhattan in the fashionable East-60's, maintains a country house upstate and is known as a conservative dresser who 
favors Chanel-like suits.  Ayers' annual salary is $150,000, with $22,387 additional in benefits. <p>
	Yet in September, 1995 Ayers told the Chronicle of Philanthropy that her mission 
as head of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation is to "fight the right."  The battle began, she said, with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Ayers says she concluded then that the most important threat to women's rights came from the White House and the Republican party.  Observing the appointment of conservative movement activists and religious conservatives to Executive Branch agencies, Ayers persuaded her board that the Foundation should initiate a grants program to support abortion rights.<p>
	In this regard, Robert Sterling Clark has made some extraordinary grants.  For instance, it has paid recipient organizations to engage in "opposition research."  Some 1994 grant projects include:<br><ul>
	<li>  $80,000 to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League for a 
computer database tracking abortion legislation, court cases, and publication of Sexuality 
In America: A State-By-State Review. 
	<li>  $60,000 to Catholics For Free Choice for A New Rite, a published database 
compiling information on conservative Catholic organizations and individuals.
	<li>  $40,000 to the Feminist Majority Foundation for investigations of pro-life 
groups.
	<li>  $200,000 over two years to Planned Parenthood for "clinic defense strategies" 
and a database of abortion opponents. 
	<li>  $80,000 to People for the American Way for its "Artsave" database of 
controversial art and for publication of Artistic Freedom Under Attack.  
	<li>  $50,000 to the ACLU's "Arts Censorship Project" to represent artists and arts 
organizations that "are under attack by government and private-pressure groups for 
creating and exhibiting works of art that deal with sexual or controversial themes."</ul>
	
	Despite its small size, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation exerts considerable influence over nationwide abortion rights grantmaking.  Ayers heads the Council on Foundations' official Reproductive Rights Affinity Group, "Grantmakers in Support of 
Reproductive Rights."  <p>
	Formed in 1990 at Ayers' urging in light of the restrictions on abortion contained 
in the Supreme Court's decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the group 
has 80 grantmaker members who "encourage foundations to give more money to organizations that advocate broad access to abortion and birth control." <p>
	The group succeeded a smaller, more secretive and unofficial team organized in 
1984.  Ayers told the Chronicle of Philanthropy in 1990 that one in four foundations 
invited to join the group did so because the decision had "shaken a lot of people to the 
roots."  <p>
	In 1991 Ayers called on the twenty largest foundations that fund abortion rights to 
meet at the Ford Foundation to plan a strategy in response to Rust v. Sullivan, the 
Supreme Court ruling that upheld the federal government's authority to prohibit federally-
funded clinic workers from recommending abortion.  <p>
	In 1993, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation donated $100,000 to the Center for 
Reproductive Law and Policy, when the pro-abortion group split from the ACLU.  <p>
	The New York Times reported that the new group was meant to attract 
Republicans such as Barbara Mosbacher, co-chairman of the New York State Republican 
Family Comittee and Republican Pro-Choice Political Action Committee, who opposed 
other ACLU positions. <p>
	 "Some people are incensed by some of the ACLU's stances," she told the Times.  
Nat Hentoff, a pro-life member of the ACLU board of directors responded, "It's good for 
the ACLU that this close identification gets  less close."<p>

<b>"PRO-FAMILY, PRO-CHOICE": FROM WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO CHILDREN'S RIGHTS</b><p>

As Ayers supported improving the lives of children, she also strengthened her commitment to the pro-abortion cause.  She sees no conflict and offers the argument:  "It is critical to the ability of women to be integral parts 
of our economic system for them to have control over their reproductive lives.  I don't 
want the government telling me what to do in my bedroom.  I don't want the church 
telling me what to do in my bedroom.  I don't want them controlling what I do."<p> 
	During pregnancy, Ayers believes that the rights of the mother are paramount.  
The tables turn at birth.  "The life of the child begins at birth," she declared.  Only in this 
way can one understand the zeal with which the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation 
campaigns to remove children from abusive parents and abusive government programs, 
while funding those who would make it easier for mothers to terminate their pregnancies.<p>
	Ayers' four years in New York's slums and projects apparently have convinced her 
that it is better that some children not be born; but once born, children deserve quick 
removal from bad homes.  Ayers is a strong opponent of "family preservation," a social 
welfare concept embodied in a 1980 law which requires social workers to keep families 
together for as long as possible and balance this requirement against others. Ayers, 
however, favors early removal of abused children "in the best interests of the child."<p> 
	In this, Ayers rejects the position of some of the most prominent and well-
connected children's rights advocates, the Child Welfare League of America, the 
Children's Defense Fund (CDF), and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, its former chair. 
In her new book, It Takes A Village (Simon and Schuster, 1996, reviewed in Capital 
Research Center's Alternatives In Philanthropy March, 1996), the First Lady tries to have 
it both ways, defending the priority of the "best interests of the child" while 
simultaneously arguing for family preservation efforts. "It is not only parents who need 
expert 'coaching' in children's development," she writes. "The rest of the village does 
too."  <p>
	The Robert Sterling Clark Foundation stopped funding the Children's Defense 
Fund in the late 1980's because, according to Ayers, "CDF was not conducting work that 
qualified it to receive funds under any of our programs." It was shortly after Ayers 
discontinued the national child welfare program she had established upon her arrival.  
Although Ayers will not criticize the First Lady or CDF, it should be noted that the 
foundation continued to fund other child welfare projects through its New York-centered 
"government accountability" efforts _ but it still does not fund CDF or its local "New 
York City Child Health Project" (with offices at 111 Broadway in Manhattan). Ayers also 
differs with CDF's refusal to fight against race-based placement for adopted children.  
Indeed, some consider Children's Rights Inc. to be a new competitor to CDF's base of 
philanthropic support.<p>
	Yet, despite her differences with the conventional wisdom of the child welfare 
establishment, some experts don't find that Ayers's position offers much of an alternative.  
Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute remarks that more money, more 
social workers, and more court supervision of child welfare programs have had no 
positive long term impact on the child welfare system.  <p>
	"My basic thought is that courts can't reform child welfare agencies." he says.  
"Real reform needs the will of the community. The track record of spending more money 
is there, hiring more caseworkers is there, and it doesn't necessarily improve services to 
children because judges and lawyers can't run social service agencies."<p>
	More critical is William Donohue, a sociologist who is president of the Catholic 
League for Religious and Civil Rights in New York City.  He accuses attorney Marcia 
Lowry of attempting to destroy the Catholic child welfare agencies when she filed the 
1973 Wilder v. Bernstein suit (that found payments to religious agencies for foster care 
and adoption in violation of the Constitution's guarantee of separation of church and 
state).  Donohue calls Lowry "anti-Catholic" (though Lowry denies it) and predicts that 
child welfare systems under court monitors will suffer the same legal problems as mental 
hospitals which have been forced to deinstitutionalize patients, prisons which have been 
under court order to release criminals, and school systems which have been ordered by 
courts to raise property taxes to pay for new buildings and more teachers in vain attempts 
to improve student achievement and stop white flight. <p>
	The goal of Children's Rights Inc. lawsuits, says Donohue, is not to improve 
children's lives, but instead to concentrate power in court-appointed monitors who are 
approved by ACLU lawyers like Lowry.  The suits themselves cost millions of dollars 
which are drained from child welfare budgets into the pockets of lawyers and consultants.  
And the result is that accountability is removed from an electorate which has very 
different religious and moral values.<p>
	"The New York foster-care issue represents a fair characterization of the atomistic 
view of liberty," writes Donohue in his critical analysis of the ACLU, The Twilight of 
Liberty (Transaction, 1994).  "According to this perspective, freedom from religion is 
valued more highly than religious liberty, and that is why state encroachment on religious 
institutions is not interpreted as a threat.  If anything, the atomistic view holds that the 
prospects of liberty are advanced by weakening the influence of religiously-sponsored 
institutions."<p>
	Ayers disagrees that religious liberty is endangered when courts take over child 
welfare, arguing that "litigation is the only certain method of shedding light on child 
welfare systems that hide behind confidentiality laws."<p>
	On the other hand, Richard Gelles, a professor of sociology at the University of 
Rhode Island and author The Book of David: How Preserving Families Can Cost 
Children's Lives (Basic Books, 1996), argues that lawsuits such as Lowry's are inevitable 
but entirely off the mark.  The badly-drafted 1980 federal law which is the basis for court 
filings requires cities and states to pursue mutually contradictory policies: family 
preservation and the best interests of the child.  Because it is impossible to do both, 
lawsuits are inescapable.  Yet they will accomplish nothing.  Gelles argues that the only 
criterion should be the best interests of the child. <p>
	"Connecticut had children dying left and right under a consent decree," Gelles 
told Foundation Watch.  "The decree didn't order them to do the right thing.  You can't 
balance family preservation and child safety." <p>
	And Elizabeth Bartholet, a professor of Family Law at Harvard University 
concurs:  "I think family preservation is part of the problem today.  There is an 
overwhelming bias in our laws and funding priorities for family preservation that is 
inconsistent with the best interests of children."<p>
	In this, Bartholet and Gelles agree with Margaret Ayers, who told Foundation 
Watch, "I've been an observer of the child welfare system for thirty years, and I don't 
think there are any studies which show that family preservation works." 	<p>
	But, says Gelles,  "Lowry believes more social workers, more training, more 
intervention can solve the problem.  They can't.  Until the law is changed, things can't 
improve for children." Yet Ayers disagrees about the root problem, claiming "it is not the 
law. The fault lies in its implementation."<p>
	Gelles responds, "You cannot implement a vague, ambiguous, and inherently 
contradictory law. If you change 'reasonable efforts' to 'child safety' then you hold the 
states accountable."<p>
	In the debate over adoption and foster care, Ayers drops ideological arguments 
and partisan rhetoric.  She says, "I hesitate to say whether it is a conservative or liberal 
position. Basically I'm concerned about the well-being of children in a very vulnerable 
situation."<p>
	In this area Ayers seems to have adopted the self-reflexive and self-critical 
position of Naomi Wolf, who wrote in The New Republic, "the best understanding of 
feminism involves holding women as well as men to the responsibilities that are 
inseparable from their rights."<p>

<b>OUR BODIES, OUR SELVES</b><p>

About abortion, however, there 	are no doubts.  In giving grants 	to groups monitoring the politics of the abortion issue, Ayers has put the 
Robert Sterling Clark Foundation firmly on the side of those who regard abortion as 
central to women's liberation.<p>
	Ayers, who never married, is a truly liberated woman. She says she is not 
primarily interested in abortion for "population control" or "environmental" reasons, the 
argument made by some in the philanthropic community.  Instead, she says the right of a 
woman to control her own body is fundamental to a woman's freedom from oppression.  
The ability to terminate a pregnancy at will must be a premise of individual freedom and 
women's liberation.  This outlook has its roots in the feminism of the 1970's and it 
informs her thinking and her grantmaking. <p>
	"We spend a lot of time trying to promote women's access to reproductive health 
care.  And we have abstinence, but that's where conservative groups end the discussion.  
Many of these groups are not supportive of abortion, not supportive of family planning, 
not supportive of sexuality education," says Ayers.<p>
	The Reagan administration agenda was diametrically opposed to hers, she notes.  
"In 1983-84 there was an edict that came out of the Office of Management and Budget 
that all grantmaking agencies had to examine the projects they were supporting and the 
organizations they were giving grants to insure the purposes of the organizations and 
projects were consonant with White House policies."  Ayers refers to an ACLU legal 
challenge that led to the reinstatement of a USAID grant to the Alan Guttmacher Institute.  
She also mentions Department of Health and Human Service regulations on health clinics 
that separated family planning from abortion and the Rust "gag rule"decision. <p>
	In response, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation made abortion the battleground 
of feminism.  Its fight continues.  Besides the previously cited opposition research  
funding, the Foundation made the following grants in 1994:<br><ul>
	<li>  $75,000 to the New York Civil Liberties Union to pay for "litigation 
challenging the exclusion of abortion services from New York's expanded Mediaid 
program." 
	<li>  $50,000 to Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington for "coalition 
building and grassroots organizing and the development of a database of information on 
the theocratic right and its tactics." 
	<li>  $60,000 to the Ms. Foundation for Women for the "Reproductive Rights 
Coalition Fund." 
	<li>  $50,000 to the NOW Legal Defense and education Fund to "secure legal 
protection for abortion providers." 
	<li>  $60,000 to the National Abortion Federation for "the creation of a Legal 
Clearinghouse" to "combat clinic harrassment." 
	<li>  $200,000 over two years to Advocates For Youth (formerly the Center for 
Population Options) which provides sex education to teenagers. 
	<li>  $40,000 to the Center for Policy Alternatives for a "Support Network for 
Pro-Choice Leaders." 
	<li>	$30,000 to the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy FAIR Health Care 
Reform Project to advocate the inclusion of abortion in health care;
	<li>	$75,000 to the Communications Consortium, for the "Reproductive Health 
Media Strategies Project," whose goal is "achieving better press coverage from the 
pro-choice perspective." 	
	<li>	$55,000 to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health 
Association to "redress health reform measures that threaten access to reproductive health 
care." 
	<li>	$60,000 to the National Women's Law Center, to "support the Center's 
reproductive rights work." 
	<li>	$41,200 to the ProChoice Resource Center of Mamaroneck, NY to 
"monitor voter identification projects." 
	<li>	$50,000 to the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, to 
"strengthen its Clergy Network. . .and raise the visibility of the pro-choice religious 
position." 
	<li>  $120,000 over two years to the Sex Information and Education Council of the 
US for "the expansion of the National Coalition to Support Sexuality Education.
	<li>  $60,000 to the Women's Legal Defense Fund for the "National Pro-Choice 
Coalition."</ul>
	Paradoxically, the success of the pro-abortion movement reduces the number of 
babies available for adoption by loving couples unable to have children _the clear goal of 
Robert Sterling Clark's children's rights efforts, which gets only a fraction of the 
Foundation's abortion funding. <p>

<b>A COMMITMENT TO THE ARTS</b>
<p>

Ayers justifies the Foundation's 
		commitment to the arts as in 
		keeping with the personal interests of Robert Sterling Clark, a collector 
who established the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, 
Massachusetts.  But in an unusual move, Ayers has focused her giving on administrative 
and infrastructure projects as well as on proposals purporting to defend free expression.<p>
	Like its schizophrenic policy of children's rights and abortion rights, the Robert 
Sterling Clark Foundation has a Janus-faced view of support for the arts.  It funds both 
business ventures to help generate revenues for arts organizations which conservatives 
would find easy to support,  as well as People for the American Way's "Artsave" project, 
which compiles charges of so-called "censorship" -- which often are just complaints from 
outraged citizens.<p>
	On the other hand, Ayers is very proud of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation's 
support for income generating projects in the arts.  Among the most successful of these 
was a grant underwriting the scene shop of Playwrights Horizons, a small theatre 
workshop in New York City.  Once headed by Andre Bishop, now artistic director of the 
Lincoln Center theatre company, and Paul Daniels, Playwrights Horizons established 
"Scenic Central," a cooperative storage and construction facility which employed 
non-union labor to build sets for nonprofit theatre companies along New York's 42nd 
Street Theatre Row.  This enterprise created "a million dollar cashflow for the theatre 
company," says Ayers.<p>
	Andre Bishop told Foundation Watch that the scene shop "helped our whole 
theatre world. It grew to be pretty big, and was a way of achieving self-motivated 
financial independence."  Bishop added that "of all the funding sources, Peggy is the most 
knowledgable and sympathetic, very into improving business practices."  Besides "Scenic 
Central," Bishop says Ayers approved grants for new computer systems, audience 
devleopment, and other infrastructure programs.<p>
	However, the flip side of Ayers' union-busting entrepreneurship on Theatre Row 
is her support, on First Amendment grounds, for the most indefensible projects the 
National Endowment for the Arts has to offer.<p>
	By paying for legal defense teams, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation helps 
insure that the NEA will remain unresponsive to taxpayers and their representatives. They 
approach arts controversies over Mapplethorpe, et. al. as free speech issues rather than 
issues of government accountability _ as the Foundation does over child welfare _ or of 
financial accountability _ as the Foundation does with its other arts grants.  This course 
will doom the NEA.  It caused Congress' two percent cut in the NEA's annual 
appropriations in 1992, then a five percent cut in 1994, a forty percent reduction last year, 
and now NEA's planned termination. For Congress must account for expenditures of tax 
dollars.<p>
	Foundation grants helped pay for  ACLU lawyers who represented the Cincinnati 
Museum of Art and director Dennis Barrie for an exhibition of works by Robert 
Mapplethorpe. They also represented so-called "NEA Four" performance artists.  The 
ACLU won the Mapplethorpe obscenity case, and it settled the grant denials litigation 
with Karen Finley, Tim Miller, Holly Hughes, and John Fleck (now a supporting cast 
member on NBC's Homicide) for a quarter of a million dollars.<p>
	By treating government arts funding as a First Amendment issue, Ayers has 
adopted the same "rights-based" arguments which she has used in fighting the abortion 
issue and that have become the essence of modern liberalism.  In 1994 Foundation grants 
defending the sanctity of the presumed "right" to offend the taxpayer have been made in 
the amounts of $50,000 to the National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, $50,000 to 
the National Cultural Alliance, $50,000 to the ACLU Arts Censorship Project, $25,000 to 
the Alliance for the Arts, and $80,000 to People for the American Way's Artsave Project.<p>
	Ayers fails to see the link between her funding and the NEA controversy, 
however, saying that "the Artsave project didn't really have anything to do with the NEA.  
The purpose was to make people aware of where people were being censored."  One 
suspects that the NEA is now expendable to arts advocates --  if its sacrifice on the altar 
of the First Amendment enables artists to continue to enjoy the myth of  their own 
rebellion.  It would be better if the Foundation concentrated on showing artists how to 
create markets for their work, attract audiences, and continue improving arts 
administration.<p>
	As in much of life, it seems as though the law of unintended consequences has 
directed the activities of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation and its executive director.  
Despite its civil libertarian self-image, the Foundation has moved the arts into the 
marketplace.  And despite its aggressive advocacy of state-sanctioned abortion, it has 
highlighted the need to defend children from state welfare agencies and misguided 
"family preservation" policies.  In a sense, the Foundation is at a crossroads.  <p>
	For if Margaret Ayers would realize the good that the Robert Sterling Clark 
Foundation has done unintentionally, she might be able to re-orient her grants to match 
her empirical successes.  Ayers might fund maternity homes and orphanages instead of 
abortion clinics, religious instruction and etiquette classes instead of sexuality education, 
and concentrate on generating new profits and audiences for arts institutions and artists.<p>

<b>Robert Sterling Clark Foundations Clubbable<br> Board of Directors</b><p>

	The trustees of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation have been described by 
those who know them as white shoe, Wall Street, and fiscally conservative.  One 
Ayers friend called them the kind of people [who], if you wanted to join a country club, 
you wouldnt want them to judge your application.  Yet Peggys got them buying 
condoms for high school kids.  Shes brought them around to positions they wouldnt 
ordinarily take.<p>
	The descriptions are entirely accurate.  If there is a Liberal Establishment, the 
Robert Sterling Clark board provides a good sampling of its members worthy of case 
study.<p>
	Winthrop R. Munyan, chairman of the board, is a prominent New York lawyer 
with offices on both Park and Lexington Avenues.  Director Raymond D. Horton heads 
New York Citys Citizens Budget Committee and boasts to reporters of receiving 
personal phone calls from former Governor Mario Cuomo while on vacation in Jamaica.  
Philip Svigals lives in fashionable Upper Montclair, New Jersey.<p> 
	Richardson Pratt, Jr., Williams class of 1946 and Harvard Business School, 
1948, is a resident of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, and a trustee of the Federation of 
Protestant Welfare Agencies, Near East Foundation, Brooklyn Botanical Garden, and 
Brooklyn Museum.  He is former chairman of Charles Pratt & Company, a director of the 
Dime Savings Bank of New York, and is now president of the Pratt Institute, a venerable 
art and engineering school in Brooklyn.<p>
	Miner Dunham Crary, Jr., Amherst class of 1942 and Harvard Law, 1948, is a

<b>Anti Catholic Opposition Research</b><p>

	 A New Rite: Conservative Catholic Organizations And Their Allies, researched 
and written by Steve Askin,  was first published by Catholics For Free Choice in 1994 
and has been updated in 1995.<p>
	Except for its putative liberal tilt, the document reads like a Ku Klux Klan tract 
from the 1920's, complete with allegations of a Papist conspiracy active in America.  But 
this time, the charge is that the Church supports the Religious Right. Rather than 
advocating lynching, the author merely compiles an enemies list.<p>
	In compiling this directory, we attempted to identify the Catholic organizations -
- and their close collaborators -- whose agendas support this conservative blueprint for 
family and society says Askin.<p>
	Some of the organizations singled out for scrutiny include the Knights of Malta, 
the Knights of Columbus, and the Domino's Foundation (based on the pizza fortune).<p>
	The shrill tone plays to traditional anti-Catholic bigotry by scapegoating Catholics 
even for the activities of Baptists.<p>
	"It was a Catholic...Paul Weyrich... who concocted the phrase 'moral majority' 
and who designed the agenda of the organization that went by that name. It was the 
willingness of the Catholic bishops to speak out 'courageously' on abortion that Jerry 
Falwell cited as the stimulus for his own entry into the political sphere, declares the 
introduction. Pope John Paul II, Jerry Falwell once declared, is the best hope we 
Baptists ever had.<p>
	Askin ominously points out that Phyllis Schlafly... William Bennett... Patrick 
Buchanan... are all Catholics. <p>
	He then goes on to indulge in deconstructing a  newspaper photograph in the 
National Catholic Reporter. Seated on the dais are cardinals John J. O'Connor, 
Bernard Law, Anthony Bevilacqua, James Hickery, and Roger Mahony, whle pounding 
away at the podium before a 'March for Life' audience is a stern faced Jesse Helms...So 
even though the bishops and Helms take opposing positions on virtually every social 
question except reproductive issues, they are political pals.<p>
	Add the pope's anti-Communist crusade to his conservative family agenda, fierce 
opposition to abortion and contraception, lack of recognition of women's rights, an 
authoritarian style of leadership, and one sees a near perfect reflection of the agenda of 
the Religious Right, writes Askin. <p>
	He concludes his introduction with a call for a new crusade against an imposing 
force in public life, with enormous potential to affect politics, public policy, and the 
church. If Weyrich is correct, and this is war, we do well to know the enemy.<p>
  What is surprising is that the board of directors of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation 
is apparently not ashamed of this document.

<b>Foundation Watch Study</b><p>

A study of recent IRS data has revealed that the median payout rate for grantmaking 
foundations in 1992 was 8.17 percent, up from 7 percent in 1990 as reported in 
Foundation News (March-April, 1994), which used a different method.<p>

  The new analysis, conducted for Foundation Watch, was based on the just-released 
Private Foundations and Charitable Trusts, 1992, in the IRS Statistic of Income Bulletin, 
vol. 15, no. 3.<p>

  The breakdown was as follows:<br><p>

Size of Foundation Average Distributions<br>
<pre>
$100k to $1m		19.7%<br>
$1m to $10m		10.7%<br>
$10m to $25m		10.5%<br>
$25m to $50m		9.1%<br>
$50m to $100m		7.7%<br>
$100m and above		6.4%<br>
</pre>
<p>
  The median payout rate was computed by dividing the median of overall qualifying 
distributions of grantmaking foundations by the median of overall foundation net worth.  
The  average distribution for each foundation size category was determined by dividing 
the net worth on column 46 of the "Private Foundation" spread sheet of the  IRS Statistic 
of Income Bulletin by the qualifying distributions in column 52 of the same document for 
each category.<p>

what actually transpired during the convention before you can make a convincing case 
that it was an exercise in enforced group-think. Im sure that reports and at least one

  The article on the American Center in Paris is a wonderful piece of work [March, 1996]. 
Its packed with interesting information, planting the seeds for a royal scandal. I was 
furious to read how these cultural pirates hijacked a long-established institution. <p>

<h2><B><FONT SIZE=4>The Nonprofit Sector Abroad<BR>
</FONT></B></h2>
<p>
<I> How does the nonprofit sector in the U.S. compare to that of
other countries?  What are American charities and foundations
doing to promote nonprofit organizations abroad?  This issue discusses
the role of nonprofits in Russia, China, and Sweden.  It shows
that the nonprofit sector in each country has evolved differently,
often producing marked differences, and that the involvement of
U.S. organizations in each country varies significantly.
<P>
 Jeffrey Gayner observes how a developing nonprofit sector in
Russia dealing with the aftermath of the collapse of communism
to propel Russia toward a liberal, democratic order.  Mr. Gayner
opened and directed the Moscow Office of the Heritage Foundation
from 1992 to 1994.  He is author of CRC's recent monograph The
Fulbright Program After 50 Years: From Mutual Understanding to
Mutual Support.
<P>
 Eric Brodin discusses China's less visible nonprofit sector and
describes the role U.S. foundations can play in helping to move
China toward free markets and limited government.  He also offers
an interesting case study in how Sweden's nonprofit sector is
dominated by government-subsidized interest groups and how voluntary
initiative in Sweden has been largely supplanted by the welfare
state.  Mr. Brodin is Director of the Foundation for International
Studies in Buies Creek, North Carolina.  He served as the Burrows
T. Lundy Chair Professor at Campbell University from 1980 to 1988.</i>

<H2>Russia's Emerging Nonprofit Sector:</H2>

<H3>An Interview with Jeffrey Gayner</H3>

<B> Q.</B> <I>Are U.S. foundations, corporations, and philanthropists
taking a greater interest in Russia than, say, five years ago?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> There has been an extraordinary growth of American
involvement in Russia since the collapse of Communism.  This is
best reflected in an extensive survey conducted by the Citizens
Democracy Corps, a Washington, D.C. private nonprofit organization
that has sent over 400 U.S. volunteers from the private sector
to help build democratic institutions and free markets in the
central and eastern Europe.  What began as a short survey, which
I assisted in when directing at the Moscow Office of the Heritage
Foundation, eventually became a 347-page book covering U.S. organizations'
involvement in all of central and eastern Europe.  The study revealed
that as of 1994, 407 American organizations had programs in Russia
and 128 had set up offices there.
<P>
 This only included academic and philanthropic activities.  Business
activities have also expanded rapidly.  Currently, over 800 U.S.
companies are registered with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.  Moreover,
of an estimated $4 billion in foreign private investments in Russia,
$2.2 billion has come from American companies.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the main economic, political, and
social reforms that nonprofits have helped to promote?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Thus far, nonprofits' involvement in social reforms
has lagged behind their push for political and economic reforms.
 Their main endeavors have been academic and research-oriented.
 American universities have established or broadened existing
exchange programs.  Research institutes have studied aspects of
economic and political reform.  And religious and humanitarian
groups have rapidly moved into Russia where their activities were
once prohibited or largely non-existent.
<P>
 Since virtually no academic freedom existed under communism,
serious research was narrowly constrained.  Western groups have
brought a whole new way of operating and thinking into Russian
society.  Individuals promoting free-market economic reforms,
who remained largely underground until recently, readily make
use of the advice and assistance provided by U.S. and other Western
groups.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation worked directly with leading members
of the parliament in drafting legislation in areas where we offered
American expertise--agriculture and land laws, bankruptcy, banking,
privatization, and regulating lobbying activities.  In the political
realm, the system of creating parties and holding elections relied
heavily on Washington, D.C.-based groups such as the Krieble Institute,
the National Endowment for Democracy and its international Republican
and Democratic Institutes, and the International Foundation for
Electoral Systems, an election monitoring group.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>Are voluntary associations, such as relief organizations,
clubs and associations increasing in number?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Yes.  In particular, business groups are forming that
have published an avalanche of materials and have held numerous
meetings to better understand the new economic environment.  The
Enterprise and Economic Development Program in Moscow, started
by the Citizens Democracy Corps, has sought to create a mechanism
for cooperation among emerging Russian business organizations.
<P>
 Numerous humanitarian organizations have also proliferated, often
started by established Western groups.  Both the Salvation Army
and World Vision have set up relief operations with Russian counterparts.
 Some Russian Orthodox religious leaders have promoted similar
activities, such as Alexander Borisov, who has established a support
mechanism for the Russian Children's Hospital.  Through a coordinated
effort, several Western protestant groups have created Co-Mission,
which seeks to infuse the teaching of ethics and morality into
Russian schools.  The Christian Legal Society was created in Moscow
with the help of the Law and Liberty Trust, based in Virginia,
to create a legal basis for religious freedom in Russia.
<P>
 In addition, individual and group efforts to lobby arose so quickly
in 1992 that the parliament, then the Russian Supreme Soviet,
restricted access to its building to prevent &quot;interruptions&quot;
in its work.  Since the December 1993 elections, which created
a new parliament, more public input has been welcomed.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the main obstacles voluntary organizations
face?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Many people are reluctant to join organizations because
they retain a lifelong wariness of speaking and acting in an open
and forthright manner in dealing with controversial issues.  Another
main problem is financial: no recent tradition exists for paying
membership dues.  In a relatively poor society, even modest membership
fees are difficult to collect.  Moreover, the communist party
was the only large membership organization--not an encouraging
precedent.  Furthermore, new businesses, struggling to survive
high taxes and heavy regulation, are largely unwilling to make
contributions to organizations, or even to advertise in publications,
unless they are guaranteed a favorable news story on their behalf.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some areas in which the voluntary sector
can begin to replace government functions?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Given the dismal state of government services, voluntary
organizations have quickly moved in to offer alternatives in a
vast range of areas.  Private education, from non-government schools
to day care to summer camps, has emerged.  Western religious groups
as well as the Russian Orthodox Church have expanded activities,
particularly in providing relief services, such as soup kitchens.
 Neighborhood associations have formed to deal with common housing
problems as well as with setting up security networks to supplement
the police.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>How many market-oriented research organizations
are there now in Russia?  What are the main issues they are studying
and how effective have they been?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Nearly all the research organizations that exist now
in Russia claim the moniker &quot;market-oriented.&quot;  Using
that phrase almost magically opens the door to Western financial
support.  Unfortunately, many longstanding research organizations
simply changed the nameplates on their doors after the demise
of communism and pay mostly lip service to a market philosophy.
 Only six or seven groups have consistently and seriously pursued
the kind of radical economic reform needed to bring about a transformation
of the economy.
<P>
 Most prominent among them have been the Institute for the Study
of the Russian Economy, a small group of independent, market-oriented
scholars; the International Center for Research in Economic Reform,
which has worked as a semi-autonomous research unit closer to
government; and particularly, the Institute for the Economy in
Transition, created by Yegor Gaidar, who headed Russia's Choice
Party in the parliament last year.  These organizations have largely
supplemented the often stagnant work on economic reform done by
government ministries.  But by being outside the formal ministries,
they have avoided much of the bureaucratic legacy that haunts
new Russian policy initiatives.
<P>
 With the recent expulsion of the last leading reformers from
the Russian government, particularly Anatoli Chubais as Deputy
Minister for Economic Policy, it is uncertain how effective genuine
reform-oriented research groups will be in affecting government
policy.  More attention will probably shift to the parliament,
public debate in the press, and work with Western groups and governments
to sustain reform initiatives.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What promising signs or trends do you see in Russia
that offer hope for the reemergence of civil society?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The most encouraging developments remain the general
openness of Russian society and the genuinely free debate on all
issues.  Unfortunately, as the recent elections have shown, demagoguery
can accompany democracy and adversely impact the election results.
 But important generational differences also exist, with younger
people both acting and voting in a more Western manner.
<P>
 Perhaps most important in the long run is the extensive interchange
of Russians and Westerners at the non-government level, whether
through university educational programs or other exchange programs.
 The Washington, D.C.-based National Forum Foundation and the
San Francisco-based Center for Citizen Initiatives have brought
over 400 Russians to the U.S. to intern with private companies,
news organizations, and research institutes.  This interaction
has hopefully fostered an appreciation of what Russia could become.
<P>
 In Russia, people are quickly coming to realize that they must
rely on themselves and their local communities to improve their
lives.  With a growing understanding of how the non-government
sector addresses problems elsewhere in the world, Russians are
seizing such opportunities.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the worrisome signs?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Overcoming the psychological legacy of communism is
proving far more difficult than eradicating its political institutions,
especially among the elderly.  While appalled by the former communist
system, many people nonetheless retain much of the communist criticism
of capitalism.  Many remain wedded to dependency on government
subsidies.  They know that prices, such as for bread, should not
be artificially low, but they rebel against market prices.  People
remain suspicious of anyone who makes money.  The egalitarian
impulse coupled with widely reported abuses under the existing
system has created a reaction against reform.
<P>
 The situation, especially in the political area, will likely
retrogress in the immediate future.  But government incompetence
will also give individuals and local communities wide latitude
to solve problems on their own.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>How can donors identify organizations that are actually
helping the needy or promoting civil society while staying clear
of groups run by con artists or groups that are not really committed
to change?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Donors need on-the-ground-experience to ensure that
their programs reach intended targets.  They must look beyond
the names of organizations and the eloquence with which some Russians
speak English.  Although it is initially more expensive to have
Westerners direct foreign offices, only over time can properly
trained Russians be brought to leading levels of responsibility.
<P>
 Five years has elapsed since the fall of communism, and it is
now fairly easy to tell who actually promotes reform.  Whenever
possible, donors should work with those who challenged the system
from the beginning.  Since many of these people spent time in
prison instead of in academic settings, they may not be particularly
&quot;polished,&quot; but they clearly have the most fervent commitment
to creating a durable civil society.  Similarly, younger people
are among the easiest to deal with since they can absorb change
more rapidly.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What can donors do to ensure that their gifts are
not diverted?  Can sending in-kind gifts help guard against diversion?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Donors should always try to provide direct or in-kind
support.  It best to bring fax machines and computers directly
into the country, rather than send money.  Equipment can also
be purchased locally, but can be much more expensive.
<P>
 As a demonstration of goodwill, donors should seek out local
organizations to provide additional support.  Avoiding government
institutions is critical because of the expense and bureaucratic
quagmires.  Donors who are harassed about bringing in-kind support
into the country should seek help from local contacts or possibly
the U.S. Embassy.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some organizations that you have a high
regard for?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The most admirable groups are the ones fighting for
the most radical changes, often under the most adverse conditions.
 The Glasnost Foundation, for example, began work by taking advantage
of the initial openness under President Gorbachev.  It has pressed
vigorously for respect for human rights and a complete end to
the totalitarian system.  In recent years, despite continuous
harassment, it has critically examined the role of the KGB, both
in the past and present.  Helsinki Watch and Freedom House, both
in New York City, and the Democratic Russia-USA Foundation and
the Jamestown Foundation, both in Washington, D.C., have similarly
monitored and assisted in the expansion of civil liberties.  All
have offices in Moscow.
<P>
 The New York City-based Soros Foundation/Open Society Fund, created
by Hungarian-born businessman George Soros, has provided massive
private support to the academic community and has supported conferences
that have played a valuable role in stimulating thinking about
the nature of a free society.  The Washington, D.C.-based Krieble
Institute has created a network of fellows throughout Russia and
has held conferences that have made a major contribution to the
development of a reform-oriented political order.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What do you think the voluntary sector will look
like in Russia five years from now?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The voluntary sector will play an increasingly critical
role in the transformation of Russia in the next several years,
particularly if communists and ultra-nationals do as well in the
presidential election this June as they did in parliamentary elections
last December.  With a government apparently retreating from reform,
the effort to sustain and expand upon reforms already made will
have to rely more on non-government organizations.  The government
may ultimately decide to take action against these groups.  Thus,
the higher international profile they develop in the next six
months may be critical not only to their influence but to their
survival.<P>

<H2>The Giant Awakes:<BR>
The Emergence of Nonprofit Organizations in China<BR></H2>
by Eric Brodin<BR>
<P>
 Napoleon is reputed to have said, &quot;Let China sleep, for
when she awakes, the world will tremble.&quot;
<P>
 The giant is very much alive today.  The People's Republic of
China is the world's most populous country with an estimated population
of 1.4 billion.  It is third largest in land area and the eighth
richest.  GDP is expected to grow from $2,838 billion (U.S. 1994
dollars) to $8,877 billion by 2010.<SUP>1</SUP>  While these statistics
look impressive, however, China's immense population must be kept
in mind: annual per capita income is only about $350.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> says
this about China: &quot;[It is economically] more advanced and
open than it was several decades ago.  Many of the economic reforms
of the 1980s were undone following the Tiananmen Square massacre
in 1989.  However, since that time, China once again has pursued
economic liberalization.&quot;  However, the report warns that
&quot;an overwhelmingly large part of [China's economy] remains
under state control.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP>
<P>
 Wealth is now being created--both legally and illegally--at an
almost furious pace in the coastal areas, such as Fujian province.
 But the as-yet underdeveloped legal system, which is needed to
protect contracts, and oppressive government regulation remain
serious hindrances to liberalization, and China's human rights
record is dismal.  Still, barring unanticipated reversals by China's
aging political leadership, a cautiously optimistic view of China's
future--and the development of its voluntary sector--is warranted.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>China's &quot;Voluntary Sector&quot;</H2>

 Little is known about the voluntary sector in China today, although
China has a rich history of philanthropy.<SUP>3</SUP>  Early in
this century, every large city had voluntary organizations that
provided relief to the needy and promoted civic betterment.  By
the end of World war II, private and semi-private organizations
supported one-third of China's educational institutions, and churches
joined with other charities to provide medical care, education,
and relief services.
<P>
 With the rise of the communist state in the 1950s, independent
charities were forced to cease operation as the government assumed
responsibility for poverty relief, education, and welfare.  Ostensibly,
voluntary organizations such as youth groups, residents' committees,
and professional associations flourished.  Not until the 1980s,
under a policy of decentralization and denationalization, did
genuine charitable organizations again become officially recognized.
<P>
 According to one 1989 study, there are well over one million
organizations in China today, including political organizations,
scientific and professional associations, social clubs, unions,
residents' committees, self-help organizations, and private welfare
agencies.  Most of these, however, receive government funding.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>The Rise of NGOs in China</H2>

 In 1993, leaders of several American foundations, headed by John
W. Cook of the Henry Luce Foundation, traveled to the cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Hong Kong to learn about
the role of China's so-called &quot;non-government organizations.&quot;
 The other delegates were: David M. Lampton of the National Committee
on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR); Kevin F.F. Quigley, formerly
with the Pew Charitable Trusts; Peter Riggs of the Rockefeller
Brothers Fund; William J. Van Ness, Jr. of the Henry M. Jackson
Foundation; Patricia D. Wright of the Amoco Foundation; and Jon
Vondracek of the Johnson Foundation.
<P>
 A NCUSCR report, <I>The Rise of Non-Governmental Organizations
in China: Implications for Americans</I>, summarizes the group's
findings: &quot;Economic reform . . . is having wide-ranging consequences.
. . .  New social groups, with economic resources at their disposal,
[are] arising and making demands. . . .&quot;  This has provoked
a mixed response from government, which favors new wealth to &quot;help
solve social problems and generate resources, but at the same
time . . . deeply fears the loss of control that such developments
entail.&quot;<SUP>4</SUP>
<P>
 The report notes that the Chinese government is heavily involved
in what can loosely be described as a nonprofit sector, and it
gives examples of what it paradoxically calls &quot;government-owned
non-government organizations.&quot;  These do things quite similar
to Western nonprofits:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The China Youth Development Foundation's
Project Hope seeks to educate children in 25 of China's poorest
provinces.  It has created 62 primary schools and provided funds
to 328,000 school dropouts.  In 1993, it gave financial assistance
to about 1,000 secondary school students and 100 college students.
 The report notes, however, that Project Hope's degree of autonomy
is difficult to determine: &quot;It is unclear what relationship
the [foundation] has to local government agencies.&quot;<SUP>5</SUP>
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Hwa Nan Women's College was
created around the turn of the century by the Ladies Missionary
Society of Baltimore.  By 1917, it had a fully accredited B.A.
program.  In 1951, the communist regime took it over, merging
it with Fukian Christian College and the Provincial Agricultural
College.  Hwa Nan College has since been reestablished, but like
Project Hope, its autonomy is ambiguous: it remains heavily dependent
on public funding, although individual donors and tuitions provide
some revenue.
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Beijing Energy Efficiency
Center is a joint project of Batelle Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and China's State Planning Commission.  It seeks to promote energy
efficiency &quot;to achieve economic development and environmental
protection.&quot;  While partly managed by the government, it
is financially independent, receiving all funds from its U.S.
founders.  Its charter calls for eventual independence from the
government.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Creating a Framework for Nonprofits</H2>

 To support the creation of a nonprofit sector in China, the NCUSCR
report makes the following recommendations:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Laws must be passed that would
establish and regulate non-governmental organizations, assuring
their autonomy and requiring accountability;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The development of a vibrant
NGO sector would require an updated banking system and effective
taxation practices;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> NGOs in China must develop good
management practices, including systems that establish organizational
purposes and methods to accomplish them;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Control procedures must be adopted
to strengthen the legal status of NGOs.  This would require a
greater openness in accounting and control procedures.  Well-established
American foundations could do much to help establish methods for
fiscal responsibility.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>What U.S. Nonprofits Can Do</H2>

 U.S. nonprofits have a vital role to play in China because the
development of nonprofits there is so uncertain.  While many U.S.
foundations and public policy groups have visited China, those
that have sought to promote a market economy are perhaps doing
the most to create conditions for a genuine nonprofit sector.
 Both the Washington, D.C.-based Cato Institute and the Fairfax,
Virginia-based Atlas Foundation have hosted conferences in Beijing.
 The latter event, co-hosted by the market-oriented Friedrich
Naumann Foundation of Germany, attracted 60 scholars, half of
them Chinese.  To support the creation of a liberal and stable
democracy, both conferences highlighted ways to promote free markets,
privatization, private property, civil rights, and private initiative.
<P>
 While encouraging a nonprofit sector in China, U.S. nonprofits
need to anticipate three trends likely to affect China's future:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> A growing, educated, and affluent
middle class can be expected to organize itself and express its
concerns;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Chinese traditions of family
self-help and loyalty to one's clan (tong) may serve as catalysts
for locally based private initiatives if China moves toward a
more limited role for government;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Under the most favorable scenario,
continued trade with Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as the incorporation
of Hong Kong into mainland China in 1997 may help propel China
toward freer markets and create more opportunities for voluntary
initiatives.

<H2>The Nonprofit Sector in Sweden:<BR>
Personal Reflections<BR></H2>
by Eric Brodin

<P>
 As a young boy I remember walking the streets of my native city,
Gothenburg (G&ouml;teborg), Sweden's second largest city.  On
occasion I would come across a large building on whose facade
was written <I>stiftelse</I>, signifying that this was a charitable
institution founded by a wealthy family with old money.  In the
class-based Sweden of my youth, it was understood that the wealthy
were to part with some of their fortune to help the needy.
<P>
 But when Sweden became a socialist welfare state, the role of
<I>stiftelse</I> diminished.  Since the Socialist Party won a
parliamentary majority in 1932, it has remained in power but for
two brief periods, 1976-82 and 1991-94.  As a result of socialist
legislation, propaganda, and other pressures, the nongovernmental
sector of society has lost much of its independence and sense
of mission.  Instead of allowing a rich diversity of independent
charities to flourish, the Swedish government today heavily subsidizes
organizations that serve protected special interests.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Nonprofits: Wedded to Government</H2>

 Unlike American nonprofits, most organizations in Sweden are
closely tied to local and central government.  In this respect,
the are more like the &quot;non-government organizations&quot;
of China.  John Boli of Sweden's University of Lund makes these
observations:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> With some 200,000 organizations
and over 31 million memberships in a population of 8.3 million,
Sweden's per capita membership in organizations is among the largest
in the world;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Swedish organizations focus on
social reform and political advocacy, recreation, and the protection
of organized interests;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> There are few private organizations
that run Swedish schools, provide health care, or offer welfare
services.  Charitable efforts are directed primarily to poor countries
in Africa and Asia.
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Swedish groups work closely with
local and central government.  They are heavily dependent on taxes
and receive little private funding.<SUP>1</SUP>
<P>
 Observers of Swedish society have noted that individualism is
little valued by Swedes while membership in and identification
with groups is widely approved.  Roland Huntford notes that &quot;the
country is adapted to dealing, not with the individual, but with
corporate bodies, and the citizen is therefore expected to belong
to some organization catering to his occupation and interests.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP>
 Swedish national life is dominated by <I>f&ouml;reningar</I>,
or associations representing workers, renters, the elderly, and
other interest groups.  These serve as ombudsmen or official moderators
between organized interest groups and the government.
<P>
 Organizations associated with the socialist and labor movements
receive particularly heavy government subsidies.  In 1986-87,
adult education groups also received 70 percent of their revenues
from government.  A 1980 survey of six municipalities found the
following proportions of government funding: sports groups, 29
percent; scouting groups, 43 percent; temperance societies, 51
percent; religious groups, 25 percent.<SUP>3</SUP>  Even the Lutheran
Church, the official state church of Sweden, to which 90 percent
of the population belongs, is funded by general tax revenues and
a special church tax.  Until recently, non-Lutherans were required
to pay 60 percent of the church tax on the grounds that the Church
maintained vital records.
<P>
 Most other religious groups also receive government subsidies
for their youth and charitable work.  These include mainline evangelical
groups, such as the Methodists, Baptists, and Pentecostals, and
so-called &quot;foreign&quot; churches, including the Roman Catholic
and Greek Orthodox faiths.  Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, however,
have refused all forms of state aid.  Interestingly, these are
the fastest growing religious denominations in Sweden.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Associations and Foundations</H2>

 Sweden has many charities and foundations that benefit children
and the disabled, that support museums and theaters, and that
recognize athletic achievement.  Many of these were created by
wealthy families and individuals, and some are still controlled
by private companies or descendants of the original donors.  As
in the U.S., Swedish charities and foundations are generally exempt
from taxation if they serve a &quot;public good.&quot;  However,
contributions to charities are not tax-deductible.  Unlike U.S.

<H2>&quot;The Atrophy of Personal Charity&quot;</H2>

 The role of associations, charities, and foundations in Sweden
today largely reflects a political atmosphere created by a half-century's
growth of the public sector.  Acts of voluntarism that many Americans
would praise are often viewed with suspicion or hostility by Swedes.
 Volunteers in hospitals and at school crossings are often opposed
by vested interests such as unions.
<P>
 Sweden is therefore an instructive example of what the late Russell
Kirk called &quot;the atrophy of personal charity.&quot;  When
the government is expected to provide an array of services funded
through taxes, we feel less obliged to practice small acts of
personal kindness and giving.  The desire to overcome common difficulties
through voluntary effort is largely lost.<BR>

<H2>A Village Called Washington<BR>
Hillary Clinton's <I>It Takes a Village<BR>
</I></H2>

 Recent years have seen an outpouring of books, reports, and articles
examining the status of children in the U.S. and proposing largely
political remedies to the problems they face.  To this can be
added Hillary Rodham Clinton's <I>It Takes a Village and other
Lessons Children Teach Us</I> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster,
1996, 318 pages).  Writing from the perspective of one who has
been both &quot;mother, daughter, sister, and wife&quot;--and
staff attorney at the liberal Children's Defense Fund--Mrs. Clinton
seeks to offer &quot;lessons&quot; to help us better understand
and satisfy the needs of children.
<P>
 The irresolute reader is cautioned: despite Mrs. Clinton's claim
that the book is not &quot;a textbook or an encyclopedia,&quot;
it often resembles a discourse on anything and everything related
to children.  Included are tips on child-rearing--&quot;Applaud
and encourage learning for learning's sake, whether it's cloud-watching
or understanding what keeps a kite in the sky or mixing paints
to make new colors&quot;--as well as nutritional advice--&quot;[eat]
more grains, beans, fish, fruits, and vegetables and less meat,
fat, and sugar.&quot;  Some remarks reminded this reviewer of
the proverbial dinner guest who stays until three in the morning--&quot;It
surprised us to discover that Chelsea did not like hot dogs and
hamburgers--when we went to McDonald's, it was strictly Chicken
McNuggets for her.&quot;
<P>
 Despite its long-windedness, the book is less concerned with
how to raise children than with drumming up support for federal
laws, regulations, and programs that the author believes are needed
to protect children.  According to Mrs. Clinton, children today
are &quot;under unprecedented threat&quot; from &quot;anti-government&quot;
extremists.  We may soon see &quot;a decrease in federal pollution
standards&quot; and &quot;the elimination of federal regulations
that protect us from outbreaks of contaminated drinking water.&quot;
 Current efforts to devolve authority in these areas to state
and local governments are ignored by the book's not-so-subtle
theme: federal downsizing will hurt children.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton believes that the main challenge facing us today
is to agree on &quot;a common vision&quot; of how &quot;to build
strong families and communities&quot;--what she calls a caring
&quot;village&quot; that will help children reach their full potential.
 But what she offers is the status quo, plus a few more federal
programs.  The key institution of the village is a strong central
government that provides extensive support to parents and communities
in all aspects of child care, from vaccinations to food assistance
to day care.  The author never recognizes that to fund the many
programs she favors, resources must be taken from the private
sector, leaving parents and communities with fewer resources of
their own to meet childrens' needs.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton does have some reasonable ideas.  She wants to reduce
foster-care and adoption roles by 100,000 annually, partly by
terminating biological parents' rights more quickly.  She favors
charter schools and choice among public schools.  She also praises
community-based programs that are addressing crime, drug abuse,
and other problems.  But while urging readers to resist &quot;the
lure of extremist rhetoric,&quot; she seems unable to resist the
lure of greater federal activism.
<P>
 Among the responsibilities she sees for government: &quot;to
provide essential services,&quot; &quot;to support families at
work and at home,&quot; and &quot;to build communities that fulfill
their obligations to families, the environment, and those who
need and deserve support.&quot;  This everything-under-the-sun
role prompts her to call for more government-funded job training,
an increase in the minimum wage (&quot;a modest increase,&quot;
she claims, &quot;does not cost jobs&quot;), and praise for a
host of supposedly vital programs that many Americans have never
heard of, such as C. Everett Koop's Shape Up America, the U.S.D.A.'s
Team Nutrition, and the President's Council on Physical Fitness
and Sports.
<P>
 But Mrs. Clinton suggests that the federal government do more.
 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which allows employees
of large companies to take 12 weeks' unpaid leave to care for
newborns, is a &quot;good beginning.&quot;  The real models, however,
are Germany, which grants tax-funded paid maternity leave for
14 weeks, and Sweden, which pays a full 15 months' leave.  France
is praised for its extensive government-funded preschool system
which provides &quot;sparkling classrooms&quot; and highly credentialed
teachers.  The author notes in passing that &quot;the price for
such generous social programs is felt across the board in higher
taxes.&quot;  She might have also mentioned less economic growth,
higher unemployment rates, and staggering national debts.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton often seems oblivious to the benefits of choice
in the marketplace as well as to the costs of her suggestions.
 A major problem with day care in the U.S., she believes, is the
&quot;dizzying&quot; variety of options: care in private homes,
commercial day-care centers, university and parochial preschools,
nannies, relatives, and babysitters.  &quot;Many parents do not
know what to look for when choosing child care.&quot;  Presumably,
the local bookstore or library--can best address this &quot;problem&quot;
the government--not advice from neighbors or information from
of too many choices.  She also suggests a need for federal oversight
of day care, since home-based and commercial day-care providers
are subject to a &quot;hodgepodge&quot; of regulations and licensing
requirements that vary by state.  That federal requirements would
drive up day-care costs, adversely affecting lower-income parents,
goes unnoticed.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton believes that Americans do not want a &quot;rollback&quot;
of government, only &quot;reform.&quot;  Yet more Americans seem
to think that the cost of big government--both in terms of dollars
ill spent and in weakened responsibilities for families, charities,
and voluntary associations--has become too high.  The voluntary
institutions that comprise real villages will thrive--as her husband
suggests--only by ending the era of big government.

<P>
The scheme to impose a government-controlled health
care system on the American public was not buried by the 1994
elections.  It's not even dead.  Advocates of Hillary-style health
care, stung by defeat in 1993, have reformulated their strategy,
changed their terminology, and shifted their venue.  Instead of
a frontal assault on the private provision of health care, they
are now sneaking their statist health agenda through the statehouse
and schoolhouse door.</FONT>
<P>
  Health care reform has been reincarnated as welfare
and education reform.  With financial support from major private
philanthropies like the Robert Wood Johnson, Henry J. Kaiser Family,
Annie E. Casey, and Rockefeller foundations, and the Pew Charitable
Trusts, proponents of national health care have reorganized and
repackaged their ideas into a number of state-based programs.
Instead of universal health care mandates on an entire population,
they propose a new framework of public-private education and welfare
partnerships.  And since these are touted as serving the &quot;needs&quot;
of children, lawmakers find them much harder to oppose.</FONT>
<P>
* * * * *</FONT>
<P>
  The Pennsylvania General Assembly's House of Representatives
recently passed a resolution, introduced with bipartisan support,
which authorized its Education Committee to investigate how the
state's public school system was being used to provide health
programs for students and their families.  Hearings were held
last year, and many legislators were shocked to discover that
in several districts school-based health clinics were already
providing extensive health services.  These clinics were established
and funded to provide a battery of services without the knowledge
or consent of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.</FONT>
<P>
  The Pennsylvania state legislature is learning
what other state legislators are learning:  that its constitutional
authority has been ignored and its prerogatives undercut by officials
in the Clinton Administration and the National Governors' Association
who are working with bureaucrats in state departments of education,
health, and public welfare, and with officials from private philanthropic
foundations, including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts,
the Kellogg Foundation, and the Annie E. Casey Foundation.  (For
more information on the Casey Foundation, which is headed by United
Parcel Service Chairman Kent C. Nelson, see the December 1995
issue of Organization Trends.)</FONT>
<P>
  Legislatures are also discovering that programs
and proposals that claim to be intended for America's children
actually represent the spearhead of a renewed assault on private
health care.  Hundreds of boxes of documents labeled &quot;confidential&quot;
assembled by the once secret and largely still mysterious Clinton
Health Care Task Force in 1993, which are as yet uncatalogued,
but in the custody of the National Archives in College Park, Maryland,
disclose the Administration's thinking.  They contain extensive
references to child health programs as a fallback position in
case the Administration failed to secure a comprehensive and universal
national health system.  As a matter of public policy and political
strategy, the Clintonites consciously had decided to use children
to phase-in health programs ultimately intended for all Americans.</FONT>
<P>
  The documents suggest that the Clinton Administration
looked  carefully at Goals 2000, an education initiative begun
during the Bush Administration, and Medicaid, the government health
program for the poor jointly funded under complicated formulas
by the states and the federal government.  These programs would
be the vehicles to integrate and coordinate publicly-funded health
and human service programs.  </FONT>
<P>
  They would use school districts as delivery sites
for providing greatly expanded health services.  And they would
be responsive to signals from private philanthropic foundations
that would provide start-up funds that, when combined with subsequent
tax dollars, could draw almost every American citizen into a web
of new government health programs. <BR>

<h3>The Children's Initiative:  It Takes A Child To Disguise
A Policy</h3>

  The Clinton Administration has elevated into an
art form the use of children as tools of social policy.  By devising
new social programs so that children are the first beneficiaries
of government entitlements, Administration policymakers get the
public to acquiesce to programs that have far more ambitious goals.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's new book on children, It Takes A Village,
is meant to be a cozy literary paraphrase of Administration policies.</FONT>
<P>
  In 1988, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
provided grant monies that enabled the National Governors' Association
(NGA) to produce a manual for Goals 2000, a series of vague pledges
by the states to set more rigorous standards for public education.
One year later, the Bush administration and the NGA, chaired
by then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, held an &quot;Education
Summit&quot; that further developed but did not clarify the goal
of national education standards.  </FONT>
<P>
  In 1994, while the Clintons' health reform proposals
were flailing, Goals 2000 became law.  Now a national mantra,
Goals 2000 is invoked by many in the education establishment to
justify the latest fads flowing through academia, e.g., outcomes-based
education.  Less noted is how it has been used as a cover to authorize
programs in health care.</FONT>
<P>
  Federal and state agencies and private nonprofit
organizations are currently seeking public and private funds for
the &quot;The Children's Initiative,&quot; which appears to be
a name assigned by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts
to describe the collaborative efforts of private foundations working
with government to develop, coordinate and support a panopoly
of health service programs in the nation's public school systems
_ a plan almost Byzantine in its complexity.  Particularly in
treating problems of student behavior, these programs have begun
raising eyebrows.</FONT>
<P>
  Under this initiative, Goals 2000 is creating a
system in which children selected by teachers are regularly tested
for emotional, social, mental, and physical disorders in clinics
established within public schools.  These disorders include what
is called Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  Once children are diagnosed and
labelled as subject to this condition according to a scale of
supposed &quot;norms&quot; of mental and emotional health, school
health officials have the authority to treat them by prescribing
and administering such medications as Ritalin, Valium, Lorazepam
and Prozac.  These officials derive their authority from new,
looser prescription-writing standards developed under Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation initiatives to liberalize state restrictions
on who can prescribe medications, thus allowing nurse practitioners
and physician assistants to prescribe drugs.  The consent of parents
is sometimes required, and sometimes not.  </FONT>
<P>
  Goals 2000 proposals receive funding from federal
programs, including Medicaid and Maternal and Child Health (Title
X) block grants, comparable state programs, and philanthropic
foundations.  Some school districts and state legislatures have
resisted Goals 2000.  And at least four states, including Virginia,
have refused to apply for federal funds to implement it.  But
many Governors, unable to resist the lure of the hard coin, are
using Executive Orders to implement state programs to meet Goals
2000.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<a name="Quiz"></a>
<h3>The School Quiz: It's Different</h3>

  How did the problem of student misbehavior in school
become a national health issue?  In 1991, the U.S. Department
of Education formally recognized ADHD as a handicap under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of
the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.  The Department directed all state
education officers to ensure that local school districts established
procedures to screen and identify ADHD children and provide them
with special educational and psychological services.  Naturally,
&quot;school-wide&quot; interventions are favored by the Department.
Programs are now being developed for all children in public schools
and their parents.  </FONT>
<P>
  The parents of elementary school children in Gateway
School District in Pennsylvania recently came face to face with
the implications of all this.  Two projects named &quot;Pharmacological
and Psychosocial Treatment for ADHD&quot; and &quot;Community-Based
Treatment for ADHD: Summer Treatment Programs and School-Wide
Interventions&quot; were funded by a private foundation grant
to the University of Pittsburgh and the Gateway School District
in Pennsylvania.  The Pittsburgh-based foundation will not allow
its name to be disclosed.  The federal National Institutes of
Mental Health provided matching public grant monies, in amounts
as yet to be disclosed.   </FONT>
<P>
  One portion of the project is called the Pittsburgh
School Wide Intervention Model (PSWIM).  The Principal of Pitcairn
Elementary School, Alex J. Balla, described PSWIM in a letter
to parents:  &quot;Many parts of the PSWIM program are designed
to help children get along better with one another.  One part
uses a procedure called sociometrics, in which children are asked
to answer questions about the kids in their class.  Each child
... will be asked about who their best friends are, who they do
not want to be friends with, and to rate how much they like the
other kids in the class ... All information is kept confidential
and children will be told that it is very important that they
do not discuss their answers with the other kids.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  The PSWIM program produces daily &quot;behavior&quot;
report cards and a &quot;behavior&quot; Honor Roll.  &quot;Positive&quot;
report cards go to students who do their homework, return homework
assignment sheets signed by a parent and &quot;break two or fewer
rules during the day.&quot;  There are only six rules, and all
are benign (e.g. be respectful of others; stay in assigned seat;
work quietly; and obey adults).  </FONT>
<P>
  The Behavior Honor Roll seems merely to codify
the tradition of &quot;teacher's pet.&quot;  Honor Roll kids ages
5 to 8 &quot;earn special class jobs and/or privileges,&quot;
and wear special badges.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  However,
PSWIM also requires each teacher to fill out an eight page &quot;Teacher
Rating Scale&quot; questionnaire for each five to eight year old
and check the applicable descriptions:</FONT>
<P>

<ul>
<li> has run away from home overnight at least twice
while living in a parental or parental surrogate home.
<P>
<li> often initiates physical fights with other members of his or her household.
<p>
<li> has forced someone into sexual activity.
<P>
<li> often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions.
<P>
<li> has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g. mugging,
purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery).
<P>
<li> teases or calls other children names.
<P>
<li> is disliked by other children.
<P>
<li> is simply ignored by other children.
</font>
<P>
<font size=2 > For five to eight year olds?  Reading the list,
one is struck by the gross disparity in behaviors.  The descriptions
range from normal childhood pranks and grievances to criminality.
Where would teachers have access to such information?</font>  
<P>
<font size =2>  The answer is that comprehensive health and education
data on all the children who participate in PSWIM is contained
in records at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at
the University of Pittsburgh.  Under the professional services
agreement between the University and Gateway School District,
PSWIM was implemented by an individual with a Masters degree in
education who was supervised by an individual with a Ph.D. _ not
an M.D. _ at Western Psychiatric Institute.  The individual with
the Masters degree interviewed the children in order to gather
the data.</FONT>
<P>
  Alarmed parents from PSWIM area elementary schools
protested the program, its taxpayer funding, and the use of undisclosed
private grant money.  Concerned parents met with baffled legislators
and recalcitrant state education officials, and made appearances
on local media.  They demanded that the program be ended.  It
was terminated on November 21, 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<a name="Policy"></a>
<h3>Education Policy: <br>
Surrogate for Health Care</h3>

  Though it failed to pass health care reform in
1993, Congress in 1994 passed three major pieces of education
reform legislation sought by the Clinton Administration:</font> <p> 
<B>Goals 2000:</b><p>

<ol>
<li>Educate America Act;<p> 
<li> School-to-Work Opportunities Act;<p>
<li> The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, which reauthorized
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).<p>
</ol></font>
<P>
  The way the Clinton Administration has implemented
these laws reveals that its health reform agenda did not fail
_ it only failed to pass the Congress.  Education reform has become
a road to health reform.  State agencies and private foundations
are the Administration's willing accomplices in skirting the legislative
process to change health policy.</FONT>
<P>
  Thirteen states now participate in the U.S. Department
of Education's Integrated Services Project, &quot;Creating Schools
That Work for Everyone&quot; (CSTWE).  CSTWE was created by the
Department of Education in 1994.  It aims to integrate within
the public school system many health and human services provided
by government.  This includes services from Medicaid programs,
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Maternal and Child Health
block grants, and services created by new monies available to
school systems under the three new education acts: Goals 2000,
the School-to-Work law, and the reauthorization of ESEA.  The
thirteen states currently participating in CSTWE are California,
Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.</FONT>
<P>
  CSTWE project consultants have been hired by the
U.S. Department of Education.  They include several Washington,
DC-based 501(c)(3) organizations:  The Institute for Health Services
Management, the National Alliance for Restructuring Education
(NARE), the New American Schools Development Corporation (NASDC),
and the National School Health Education Coalition.  NARE and
NASDC are also working with the states of Arkansas, Kentucky,
New York, Vermont, and Washington, city governments in Rochester
(NY), White Plains (NY), and San Diego, and the Farrell Area School
District of Pittsburgh.  NARE claims that its state and city work
accounts for twelve percent of the nation's schoolchildren.  These
consultants are now embroiled in the New York State Attorney General's
investigation of the National Center for Education and the Economy
and its ties to prominent political figures, including Hillary
Clinton, North Carolina Governor James Hunt, former New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, and health care czar Ira Magaziner.  In part, the
investigation concerns payments made to Mrs. Clinton by the Rochester-based
Center.</FONT>
<P>
<hr>
<a name="Brave"></a>
<h3>Kentucky's Brave New World</h3>

  While it is too early to say exactly what CSTWE
will accomplish, information uncovered through open records requests
in Kentucky give some indication of what its proponents seek.</FONT>
<P>
  For instance, Wade Mountz, Chairman of the Kentucky
Commission on Families and Children (set up by Governor Brereton
Jones to help implement the controversial Kentucky Education Reform
Act), has defined his Commission's goal as the &quot;provision
of a wide range of education, health, mental health, and social
services that are delivered in a coordinated and comprehensive
way to families and their children.&quot;  The Commission has
focussed its work on school districts in Louisville and Owensboro.
In seeking a grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, one which
required a matching grant of taxpayer dollars, Mountz wrote a
March 30, 1995 grant application to Casey's Associate Director
Anthony Cippollone.  After discussing the need to coordinate health
and human services in the school system, Mountz explained why
Kentucky was the right state for an investment of Casey Foundation
money:</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;We will have a change in administration in
December 1995.  The Commissions' [sic] job is to produce selected
local communities whose plans are so attractive that the new administration
and the legislature will be compelled to cooperate with the approach&quot;
(emphasis added).</FONT>
<P>
  What sorts of plans are envisioned?  The Kentucky
Legislative Research Commission in 1992 hired a consulting firm,
Leadership Development Associates, to assist the Kentucky Task
Force on Education Reform.  It proposed six alternative models
for local governments and school districts to govern the web of
human service programs envisioned by the Kentucky legislature:
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<ol>
<li> Total Educational Governance System for Lifetime Learning
<P>
<li> Reconstituting Local Government for Education and Well-Being;
<P>
<li>Educational Development Territories;
<P>
<li> Large Regional Operating Districts;
<P>
<li> Fine-Tuning the Present System; and
<P>
<li> The Unitary District Plan.<br>
</font>
<p>
<br>
</ol>
  The consultants, in the syntax expected of their
sort, explained that Model One's lifetime learning approach &quot;is
a much larger expectation for each citizen.&quot;  It suggested:
&quot;a reconsideration of the compulsory education requirements
pushing taxpayer responsibility both downward and upward through
the age ranges.  Obviously lifetime learning has tremendous implications
for educational finance moving away from traditional concepts
of funding toward new ideas such as individual entitlements to
be expended throughout the lifetime.  Each citizen would have
a lifetime learning account to draw on as needed.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  Model Two, &quot;Reconstituting Government for
Education and Well-Being,&quot; strikes a tone reminiscent of
Brave New World:  The consultants imagine local-level &quot;Chancellors
of Well-Being&quot; who would govern as elected officials.  Leadership
Development Associates explained, &quot;Well-being does not have
the same political connotation as welfare often does.&quot;  The
Chancellors would be charged with protecting and enhancing community
well-being.  As the consultants explained:</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;Although the nation's commitment to general
well-being is anchored in the Constitution, we have treated it
casually, almost with indifference.  We have created units of
local government, such as school districts, and charged them with
part of the responsibility for well-being, but not the whole of
it.  Schooling may well be the flagship of a flotilla of approaches
to well-being but it is not the all of it.  Schooling must be
joined more fundamentally by other contributors of well-being
....&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  The proposal recommends that the Kentucky General
Assembly appoint a permanent &quot;Joint Well-Being Oversight
Committee,&quot; and replace the existing State Board of Elementary
and Secondary Education with a new fifteen member &quot;State
Board of Well-Being.&quot;  The State Board of Well-Being would
be led by the &quot;State Chancellor of Well-Being,&quot; which
runs the &quot;Division of Well-Being Services&quot; _ &quot;a
range of well-being oriented programs and services, including
many of those that traditionally have been offered through the
department of education.&quot;<BR>

<h3>The Medicaid Program in Pennsylvania:  Out of Control</h3>

  Officials in the Clinton Administration's Department
of Health and Human Services, including Heath Care Financing Adminstration
chief Bruce C. Vladeck (a former Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
trustee and former vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation),
have indicated plans to expand Medicaid eligibility to 40 million
Americans.  By granting &quot;waivers&quot; from Medicaid's eligibility
restrictions, the Administration has nearly achieved that goal.
More than half the states currently operate their programs under
such waivers, which expand the definitions of the word &quot;provider.&quot;
Even school districts can now be considered &quot;Medicaid providers&quot;
and they can bill state and federal Medicaid authorities to be
reimbursed for services they provide.  </FONT>
<P>
  School-based health service programs take advantage
of Medicaid by drawing on its &quot;Early Intervention Services&quot;
program which offers a benefit known as &quot;Early Periodic Screening,
Diagnosis, and Treatment&quot; (EPSDT).  EPSDT provides vision,
hearing, and dental testing.  It also provides &quot;other necessary
health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures
. . . to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental
illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services
. . . whether or not such services are covered under the state
plan.&quot;  The 1989 Budget Reconciliation Act required the states
to make the EPSDT benefit available to all eligible Medicaid recipients
age 21 and under, even where a state's Medicaid plan does not
provide state funding for reimbursement.  In such cases, the federal
government must cover EPSDT payments.  </FONT>
<P>
  The law further provides that the state must take
&quot;effective&quot; steps to inform all those eligible for EPSDT
of its availability.  Moreover, a D.C. federal court has held
that the statute is sufficiently specific to create &quot;an enforceable
right of action&quot; under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  </FONT>
<P>
  EPSDT is out of control.  In Pennsylvania, the
legislators did not know how it was affecting school decisionmaking
until they began to hear from parents.  That state's Goals 2000
plan specifically identifies school-based clinics as essential
to achieve its first Goal, &quot;Readiness for School.&quot; 
And an October 5, 1994 memorandum from the Pennsylvania Commissioner
for Elementary and Secondary Education, Joseph F. Bard, to Pennsylvania
School Administrators and Intermediate Unit Executive Directors,
describes how school officials will achieve the goal:  &quot;The
Department has initiated...a program which will allow [school
districts, intermediate units, and approved private schools]...to
obtain federal reimbursement for administrative costs incurred
in providing health related services to medical assistance eligible
students.</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;The use of these funds to supplement the
district's health program will not only provide additional need
health services to the district's student population, but will
increase the district's expenditures for health care services
and thus increase further drawdown of administrative funds under
Title XIX.&quot; </FONT>
<P>
  Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare has
applied to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to
amend the state's Medicaid plan to expand Early Intervention Services
so that schools can request reimbursement beyond the minimum vision,
hearing, and dental tests.  In a June 29, 1995 letter to HHS,
Deputy Secretary Nancy R. Thaler created a virtual &quot;wish
list&quot; of ten program services she would like to offer: social
work, audiology, nursing services, occupational therapy, physical
therapy, psychological services, speech pathology, initial &quot;early
intervention&quot; screening, special instruction, and service
coordination.  Under this proposal, school districts could bill
Medicaid for up to 20 units of service activity per year at $20.00
per unit for each program service it offered.  In other words,
Medicaid might be required to reimburse every school district
up to $4,000 annually per child eligible for the full list of
services.  </FONT>
<P>
  Currently six school districts _ Farrell, Towanda,
Allentown, Philadelphia, Lancaster, and Central Fulton _ operate
school-based health clinics under a Medicaid waiver.  Pennsylvania
still awaits approval of its wish list, but these districts currently
provide the following EPSDT services:  mental health/counseling,
health education, physical examinations/screening, anticipatory
health guidance, referral/tracking of health problems, and dental
services.  <BR>

<h3>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: &quot;Leveraging&quot;
Government Funding</h3>

  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) began
its Mental Health Services for Youth Program in 1989, the same
year Congress authorized federal payment for EPSDT services. 
RWJF grants from this program to state agencies in Pennsylvania
and Kentucky are responsible for creating the procedures that
enable school districts to apply for and receive federal Medicaid
reimbursement for mental health services.</FONT>
<P>
  In 1989, the Johnson Foundation reached the one
billion dollar mark in grants distributed, a goal that took seventeen
years to achieve.  In 1995, just six years later, the Princeton,
New Jersey-based philanthropy awarded its two billionth grant
dollar. The Foundation has said, &quot;The work accomplished,
more than the money awarded, is the true measure of RWJF's achievements.&quot;
That claim bears examination.  The Foundation proudly extolls
the practice of &quot;leveraging public funds.&quot;  Not content
to wait for public agencies to pick up the costs of programs it
has started, the Foundation often requires co-funding committments
from government before it initiates new programs.   </FONT>
<P>
  For instance, RWJF awarded the state of Kentucky
a $100,000 planning grant from the Mental Health Services for
Youth Program.  Kentucky subsequently received Phase I and Phase
II Implementation grants of more than $2,400,000.  The Foundation
has stated, &quot;The major objective . . . is to improve mental
health services for seriously mentally ill children and youth
by developing comprehensive services systems under the aegis of
multi-agency, state-community partnerships that can make major
changes in financing, organization, and delivery of services.&quot;
 </FONT>
<P>
  Clearly, affecting state government policy is central
to RWJF's grantmaking.  The Foundation has indicated that it will
give priority to projects that demonstrate &quot;evidence of collaboration
of multiple agencies at both the state and community levels, including
agreements with institutional care providers to assure appropriate
movement among levels of care,&quot; and &quot;a high likelihood
that the project will continue following the conclusion of Foundation
support and that lasting changes will be made in the state's mental
health services delivery and financing systems.&quot; </FONT>
<P>
  Foundation documents are even more specific.  For
Kentucky, they reveal that &quot;every grant dollar is expected
to leverage five dollars in public monies.&quot;  By carefully
using its grant dollars to promote interagency agreements on mental
health for youth, RWJF is well on its way to achieving comprehensive
health reform in this area in Kentucky.</FONT>
<P>
  How does RWJF secure the cooperation of state officials?
Kentucky's participation was secured after North Carolina Governor
James Hunt, chairman of RWJF's national advisory board for its
Mental Health Services for Youth program, wrote Kentucky's then-Governor
Wallace Wilkinson and invited him to apply for a Foundation grant.
A grateful Wilkinson responded, &quot;The goals of the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative are very much within the mission
of the CYSB [Kentucky Children's and Youth Services Bureau].&quot;
 </FONT>
<P>
  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has used the
power of its private money to rearrange one state's public finances.
It has not been shy about what it expects from Kentucky state
lawmakers.  In Kentucky's proposal for grant funds _ which funds
it received _ the state Secretary for the Cabinet for Human Resources
promised:  &quot;We will be seeking major legislation that sets
in statute for the whole state the system of care for children
and youth with severe emotional problems.  Legitimating this effort
in statute will assure that changing administrations and their
shifting priorities will not hinder the system of care effort.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  In 1990, the Kentucky Legislature passed a bare-bones
statute that was intended to apply to 54 identified children who
had severe mental health problems.  Yet RWJF grants of more than
$2.4 million plus state and federal funding in excess of $10 million
have had their effect.  Because almost any child can be examined
under the EPSDT benefit for &quot;mental health&quot; problems
in Kentucky, local school districts and state agencies can now
tap into both federal and state Medicaid funds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<hr>
<a name="Final"></a>
<h3>Final Considerations</h3>
<P>
  It is time for Congress and state legislatures
to re-examine how children have become pawns in political struggles
over power and money.  They must also exercise rigorous legislative
oversight of state applications for federal Medicaid &quot;waivers.&quot;
Lawmakers need to examine whether it is appropriate for private
foundations to distribute grants to government agencies.  And
Congress should consider enlarging the federal Anti-Deficiency
Act, which prohibits the use of private monies to create and pay
for new staff positions at public agencies _ thereby creating
a deficiency since the taxpayers are eventually expected to foot
the bill.  Finally, a vigilant citizenry and press need to apply
more scrutiny to foundations, demanding greater accountability
than currently exists.<BR>

<h2>Rediscovering Heroes, Remembering Dreams
Rediscovering Heroes, Remembering Dreams<p></h2>
<b><I>A Challenge to Change Lives</I></b><BR>
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Marvin Olasky</FONT></B>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal today is to help each of you think more clearly
about the welfare problem so that you become an agent of change.
Our emphasis should be on change that moves people out of poverty.
We should not be agents of spare change, the distribution of which
merely enables people to stay in poverty. Many citizens today
are agents of spare change.  They hand out quarters or dollars
at street corners with good intentions and support more federal
welfare spending.  Those intentions are often reflected in church
bulletin announcements about the homeless.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few of those announcements that have been
brought to my attention: First: &quot;Thursday night... Dinner
for the homeless.  Meditation to follow.&quot; Here's another:
&quot;At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be
'Seeing Hell close-up...Come early to meet homeless visitors.&quot;
One more: &quot;Don't let homelessness kill you...let the church
help.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are honest mistakes, but they show why we must
go beyond sentimentality and learn how to fight poverty the right
way, the biblical way, the way that was practiced in America until
recent decades.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of our current problem arises from the
twisting of Scripture.  If a supporter of the contemporary welfare
state were to rewrite the parable of the prodigal son, he might
write something like this: &quot;One young man set off for a distant
country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.  After
he had spent everything, he was in need and took a job feeding
pigs. The job was miserable, and the man visualized an alternative:
'I will go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned.'
He was about to return  home, but an official from  Beds for
the Homeless saw him and convinced him to spend the night.  The
shelter offered free food, housing, clothing, and medicine, and
did not require any work in return.  The prodigal son stayed on
and became used to panhandling in the morning, drinking fortified
wine and smoking some joints in the afternoon, and watching movies
at the shelter in the evening.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meanwhile, the father sat on his porch in the
late afternoon, hoping to see the prodigal son trudging home.
Day after day the father yearned for the opportunity to hug him
and prepare a feast, but the son never came.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the tale of the prodigal panhandler, and I
could give you other brand new revised version stories. One of
my favorites is, &quot;Jesus Food Stamps the 5000.&quot;  The
Bible is where we learn how to provide effective compassion for
prodigals.  That God created each of us in His own image, and
that He provided for us a way to be delivered from our inclination
to deface his image, underlies everything I say here.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Forgotten Heroes</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the two propositions I would like to put
before you:  First, the reason why government welfare programs
must be transformed is not that they are too expensive.  The real
problem is that they are too stingy about doing what is truly
important: treating people as human beings made in God's image,
not as animals to be fed, caged, and occasionally petted.  Second,
private programs can do a better job if they  are challenging,
personal, and spiritual-most often, when they are religiously
based.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you have gained experience working with the
poor and I want to hear what you have learned. But I'm speaking
to you after having spent a year in the bowels of the Library
of Congress searching through old records.  I'm here today to
testify to the work of many people forgotten by the standard history
books-men like Charles Brace.  Over a 40-year period Brace built
lodging houses in New York City that provided shelter to several
hundred thousand abandoned children.   He placed 91,000 of them
in adoptive homes.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Women like Helen Mercy Woods.  From 1881 to 1903 she
ran a shelter in Chicago for pregnant and unmarried women.  Month
after month she gave personal attention to each newcomer and rejoiced
as their babies were born. She helped some of her charges to get
married, others to place their children for adoption, others to
get jobs.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm here to testify about now-forgotten heroes like
Annie Richardson Kennedy.  She ran a home for unwed moms in New
York City between 1900 and 1920.  Her goal was to first bring
the girls in touch with their Savior, and then build character.
She provided love and opportunity for thousands, and then disappeared
into the fog of history. When I visited the site of her shelter
several years ago, it was occupied by the consulate of Yemen.
The guard didn't understand much English, and I was not making
his day when I asked him if anyone knew what had happened to a
home for mothers and babies that was there 70 years before. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife doesn't mind when I fall in love with women
like Helen Mercy Woods and Annie Richardson Kennedy, because they've
all been dead for a long time. The textbooks are silent, but I'm
here to testify about the contributions they made.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might think that the work of an historian is boring,
but it's exciting detective work to blow dust off old reports
in the Library of Congress and learn about people who changed
so many lives for the better.  It may be an acquired taste to
sit in the Chicago Historical Society and read the diaries of
self-sacrificing people hour after hour, until the librarian there
turns off the lights and kicks you out, but it's exciting to uncover
what secular liberal historians ignore. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The big story that they missed is this:  During the
19th century, before the federal government ever got involved,
a war on poverty much more successful than our own was waged
by tens of thousands of local, private charitable agencies and
religious groups around the country. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was successful in this way: poverty fighters a
century ago did not abolish poverty, but they witnessed movement
out of poverty by millions of people. Successful in this way:
There were springs of fresh water flowing among the poor, not
just blocks of ice sitting in a perpetual winter of multigenerational
welfare dependency.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful also in this way: The optimism prevalent
then contrasts sharply with the demoralization among the poor
and the cynicism among the better-off that is so common now. I'm
here to testify that there was a great cloud of witnesses to effective
poverty-fighting, and that they succeeded in large ways by knowing
and doing small but vital things. They knew that the literal meaning
of compassion is not just writing a check, but having personal
involvement with the needy, suffering with them, not just giving
money to them. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that welfare doesn't mean passing a bill,
but helping a person to fare well. They knew that the Constitution
talks about providing for the common defense but promoting the
general welfare-and there's a big difference between renting a
hall for a convention, and manning every booth yourself. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that people should be challenged. When an
able-bodied man came to a homeless shelter, he often was asked
to chop wood for two hours or to whitewash a building.  In that
way he could provide part of his own support and also help those
unable to chop. They knew, and they showed everyone through those
work tests, that even the most run-down person is not just a taker;
he can also be a giver. They knew that everyone is made in God's
image and is capable of helping. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they knew what to avoid: in fact, they warned
us.  Some of their warnings were amazingly prophetic. Mary Richmond
of the Baltimore Charity Organizing Society said in 1897, &quot;Relief
given without reference to friends and neighbors is accompanied
by moral loss.  Poor neighborhoods are doomed to grow poorer whenever
the natural ties of neighborliness are weakened by well-meant
but unintelligent interference.&quot;  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Orleans Charity Organization Society in 1899
wisely noted, &quot;Intelligent giving and intelligent withholding
are alike true charity.&quot; Giving money to a poor person by
itself is morally neutral, because the action can hurt if not
done wisely.   New York charity leader Josephine Lowell said,
&quot;The problem before those who would be charitable, is not
how to deal with a given number of the poor; it is how to help
those who are poor, without adding to their numbers and constantly
increasing the evils they seek to cure.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty-fighters a century ago trained volunteers
to leave behind &quot;a conventional attitude toward the poor,
seeing them through the comfortable haze of our own intentions.&quot;
They said, &quot;If drink has made a man poor, money will feed
not him, but his drunkenness.&quot;  They did not use euphemisms.
They said it is  important to &quot;reform those mild, well-meaning,
tenderhearted, sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging
in indiscriminate charity.&quot; They said that government payouts
come &quot;from what is regarded as a practically inexhaustible
source, and people who once receive it are likely to regard it
as a right, as a permanent pension, implying no obligation on
their part.&quot; They were prophetic!<BR>

<P>
<H3>Dream Killers</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;They were prophetic, but the historical knowledge
of many Americans today is pathetic.  Let me be blunt:  We don't
know much about history.  We've forgotten America's past successes
in poverty-fighting. The result has been not just the waste of
billions of dollars each year, but the death of  part of the American
dream.   
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time it was considered hardheaded to talk about
dollars and corny to speak about dreams.  The debate in Washington
was always liberals wanting to spend more and conservatives wanting
to spend less, but no one questioning what welfare does to dreams.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;History, though, is made by dreams followed by action.
America was begun by people who resolved to fight for a country
in which both liberty and virtue could flourish.  But now, welfare
kills dreams. It kills the helping dream of many Americans.  
Most of you and millions of other people would like to be generous
when a panhandler asks for spare change.  But if you know that
most homeless recipients will use any available funds for drugs
or alcohol and will put off real change by getting high, you are
likely to end up walking by and avoiding eye contact. A subtle
hardening occurs.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare also kills the dreams of social workers. 
Their common lament is, &quot;All we have time to do is move paper.&quot;
Listen to this sad statement from a social worker who graduated
from college several years ago, lasted on the job for a year,
and then resigned: &quot;I had a calling; it was that simple.
I wanted to help.&quot;  A lot of people are frustrated, worn
down, burnt out. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare also kills the dreams of poor individuals
who gradually become used to dependency.  Some among the poor
are willing to put off immediate gratification and  sacrifice
leisure time in order to remain independent, but they are called
chumps rather than champs. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare kills the dreams of children who grow up without
fathers.  Coach a little league team some time and you'll quickly
see who's in that fix.  Fatherless children alternately cling
and are standoffish in a way that kids with functioning dads do
not. It breaks your heart.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare kills.  Spend some time with AFDC moms or
with homeless men.  You'll see how sad they are.  You'll see the
essential problem, and I'll stress it again:  Governmental welfare
programs should be fought not because they are too expensive,
but because they are inevitably too stingy in what is truly important:
treating people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we despair?  No. I'm hear to testify that the
reams of the past can thrive in the future if we recover the
lessons of the past and use them to plan for the future. I am
finding good news as I get around the country now: We are recovering
the lost tools of charitable success.  We are  seeing a new great
cloud of witnesses.  We are living in an era with many heroes
or, I should say, ordinary people who become heroic as they show,
through hard suffering with, that the American dream of compassion
is not dead. <BR>

<P>
<H3>Modern Heroes</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Bob Cote in
Denver.  He's a tall, white, ex- boxer who spent a year on the
streets as an alcoholic in the early '80s and then pulled together
a few of his fellow winos and junkies to start a program that
has become known as Step 13.  Bob welcomed me to his four-story
building and showed me how  people from off the streets can, step
by step, come back to life.  They can get jobs of increasing responsibility.
They can get rooms within that building that gradually reflect
greater independence, until a person is ready to go out on his
own.  They can go through a tough, time-intensive process.  Cote
has lived it himself and he's there to help others. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Hannah Hawkins,
who lives  in Anacostia, the poorest part of Washington.  She's
short, black, and retired, and she voluntarily runs an after-school
program which has several dozen children doing their homework
and receiving the love they often don't get at home. Sometimes
they run around like lost sheep, but she knows each of her lambs
by name. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Freddie Garcia
in San Antonio.  He's a softhearted but hardheaded Hispanic ex-addict.
He formed Victory Outreach 25 years ago in San Antonio to help
substance abusers.  Groups based on his teaching have now spread
throughout Texas and California and even to Peru.  I've sat in
his home and watched the way he patiently counsels and teaches
those whom everyone else has abandoned. I've been blessed to see
and come to know some of these people, and I'm here to testify
that they have succeeded and others can too.   The heroes of past
and present have a common understanding that could be summarized
as CPS.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Challenging, Personal, and Spiritual</H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What's CPS? Compassion needs to be Challenging, Personal,
and Spiritual.  I hope it will become as well known as CPR.  
CPR can bring back to life a dying person; CPS can bring back
to life a dying American dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;People successfully
practiced CPS a century ago, and they are successfully doing it
right now.  There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at Clean and Sober Streets in Washington.  Leaders
there get people off drugs and alcohol by caring for them but
also imposing tough rules-one strike you're out-and sticking to
them. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at Teen Challenge sites in Texas and around the
country, where alcoholism is treated as a symptom, not the fundamental
problem.  Leaders there know that the basic problem is that people
have holes in their souls, holes that only God can fill.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at the Right Alternative center in Milwaukee. People
sometimes say that AFDC mothers will be stuck on the government
rolls for a life time, but at Right Alternative AFDC moms pledge
not to swear, not to shack up, not to do drugs.  Leaders there
challenge them to stick to their pledges, and when they do their
lives change:  They do get married.  They do get jobs. What works?
Challenging help... Personal help... Spiritual help. It worked
in the past.  It works now.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of changed lives is accumulating. I'm
not saying it's easy.  I've personally seen successes over the
years. I've seen lives of pregnant unmarried women turned around.
I've seen abandoned children happily adopted.  I've also seen
failures:  Recently I was working with a homeless ex-con, and
I thought he was making good progress, but he slipped back into
irresponsibility.  He's currently in a jail facility near Fort
Worth, but he'll have another chance in several months.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Answering Five Criticisms</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want anyone to go into poverty-fighting without
understanding the difficulties.  In fact, let me give you my responses
to five  criticisms of the generally optimistic message I'm offering
tonight. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First-that history didn't happen.  Some say that when
I talk about the outpouring of charities in the past, I'm romanticizing.
That's easy to refute: It did happen. Read my footnotes.  The
times I describe were not the good old days.  They were bad in
many ways, but people refused to sit back and take it easy.  They
fought,  and they won. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the history happened but it is irrelevant
to our more complex society today.  That could be true-but when
you see what our predecessors did, you naturally ask yourself,
why not today?  I could go point by point through the comparison
of then and now and show the parallels.  But I'll just say here:
Overall, they had problems.  We have problems.  They dealt with
theirs.  We whine about ours. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A third criticism comes from members of the religious
left: They say the Bible requires government to transfer to the
poor whatever resources it can grab hold of because Jesus said
that &quot;Whatever you did to the least of these my brethren,
you did it to me.&quot;  I take that verse very seriously.  But
before we blindly use it to justify the welfare state, we need
to ask, who are the least of these in America?  What kind of help
is real help?  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, children threatened with death before birth
by abortion are among the least of these.   Women abandoned by
their husbands, and children who grow up without fathers, also
have it very rough.   But what about able-bodied homeless men?
Does irresponsibility qualify a person for the ranks of the least
of these?  And how does enabling mothers and fathers to desert
each other help children?  How does the fostering of fatalistic
attitudes help children?
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth criticism goes like this:  Today,  money
to help the poor won't be forthcoming unless people are taxed
and Washington spends.  But we need to keep two thoughts in mind.
First, much welfare money today is wasted and worse than wasted,
since it actually does harm.   Second, we do need  a system of
tax credits by which taxpayers could send less to the government
and more to private and church charitable organizations that provide
assistance to the poor.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the place to get into a full-scale discussion
of tax credits, but the idea fits with the distinction I made
earlier between providing and promoting.  We're in our current
mess because the government has attempted to provide welfare rather
than promote civic action.  Tax credits such as those proposed
by  Senator Dan Coats (R-Indiana) and others would promote community-based
poverty-fighting charities by allowing taxpayers to send money
directly to those organizations and take the money off their taxes.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For each dollar taxpayers chose to allocate in this
way, their tax burden would be reduced by that amount-$500 or
$1000 in some plans, more in others.  The  amount of money allocated
to government welfare programs would also decrease, dollar for
dollar, as the private, taxpayer-chosen programs grew.  Tax credits
are a great mechanism for taking money off the top, from the governmental
superstructure, and sticking it back on the bottom, in private
and religious charities, where it can do the most good. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I don't want to fall into the trap of thinking
that a particular piece of legislation is the solution. Tax credits
will work, but they are still just a mechanism, and they will
rust like other mechanisms unless hearts keep them lubricated.
 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the fifth criticism of my testimony
to you: Some pundits say that most Americans just won't help others
anymore.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, people, ordinary people, are helping others
all over the country: Why can't more? I cannot prove that they
will. As long as government welfare remains, it leads potential
helpers to sit back, since they are paying for someone else to
do it.  We face a Catch-22: We won't have the alternatives until
we need them, but we won't get them as long as government programs
remain in place.  How do we break out of the trap?<BR>

<P>
<H3>Dreams Remembered</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that there's a public policy answer
here-and tax credits are a partial answer.  But the more time
I spend in Washington, the more I'm reminded of  the recommendation
from a junior high school science class: &quot;For a nosebleed,
put the nose much lower than the body until the heart stops.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to break through now is to go above and
beyond the call of economic logic-to remember dreams, and to be
moved by God to volunteer to bring them to life.  We need to knock
out the welfare establishment, but we will only be able to do
that if people around the country are able to demonstrate that
the alternatives do work.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to take large leaps, but change starts with
a single step-a single step that each person in this room, whether
you're a college student or whether you've been out in the community
for decades, can take, starting now. Taking that first step will
require an act of will and courage and faith on the part of each
individual.  For many of you with good but hectic jobs, it is
easier to send a check than to suffer with others-but it's that
personal involvement which is desperately needed. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not very comfortable talking about myself, but
my colleagues have told me that I need to tell people that I've
taken some steps before I ask them to take one themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll
quickly mention a few of the learning opportunities that God has
put in front of me. At various times my wife and I have been able
to give a room in our home to needy individuals, including a homeless
woman and a pregnant teenager. We've been able to tutor and to
coach kids in baseball, and to mentor many younger men and women.
We've been blessed with three children born to us, and we've been
able to adopt a fourth.  I recommend both methods of family expansion.
We should be doing more.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a confession: I'm not a particularly hospitable
individual.  I'd rather spend time in libraries than on the streets.
And as I've been traveling so much this past year, I've fallen
into the trap that I tell others to avoid:  Maybe helping in little
ways here and there, but not following through consistently enough
with one poor individual. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But my failings lead me to think that if once in a
while, I can do something that's a little decent, why can't people
of much finer qualities do the same, or even more? I know very
well, from personal experience,  that many things, including some
good intentions, get in the way of personal involvement with others.
But I'll ask each of you the same question I ask myself:  Can't
we do something?  And why can't we do more? 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you try to picture in your mind's eye one poor
person whom you have directly helped during the past year, do
you see anyone? If you do, good-and can you do more?  If you can't
picture anyone, here's the hard question: Will you take a first
step? Will you tutor a child for one hour a week? Will you be
a big brother, a big sister, or a little league coach? Will you
volunteer at an organization in this metropolitan area that offers
true compassion-challenging, personal, and spiritual? Will you
provide biblical counsel to a young, unmarried pregnant woman?
If you are able to do this, will you give her a room in your
home? If you're able to, will you adopt a child? 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the first step is hard.  But we are surrounded
by hundreds of thousands of people now, and millions over the
past two centuries, who have taken first steps, and many more.
Like you, I have moments of pessimism, but overall I am optimistic:
I am seeing a growing understanding around this country of what
effective compassion is.  First comes thought, then action: I
am hopeful that we will soon see an enormous outpouring of effective
voluntarism. It's as if we have been in a desert, and suddenly
the Red Sea is parted before us and we're beginning to walk through.
I've often wondered how astounded the Israelites must have been
as they walked through.  They must have been amazed-but there
were probably a few who kept muttering, &quot;It's all an optical
illusion.&quot; We're beginning to cross the Red Sea now.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent time last year in south central Los Angeles
and on the upper east side of Manhattan.  I talked with people
over lunches in dingy cafeterias and at a few fancy dinners. 
I can say, based on that experience,  that across America people
of many faiths, income levels, and races, are refusing to give
up on the dream of effective compassion. More people are capturing
the understanding  that the major flaw of the modern welfare state
is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy.  It
gives the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone.
More people are recapturing the optimism that a look at history
can provide.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More people are saying, in the words of the Bible
that are inscribed on the famous bell in Philadelphia, &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout  the land, and to all the inhabitants thereof.&quot;
Let's not settle for the new slavery of welfare.  Let's be agents
of change who proclaim liberty to all the inhabitants this nation.
With God's grace and your help, we can.<BR>

<h2></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">How They Took the Stars and Stripes from the 
American Center in Paris: </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">The Boh<B>e</B>n and 
Mellon Foundations and the Death of a Cultural Institution.</h2>

	On February 12th, 1996, the doors at the American Center at 51, rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement 
of Paris closed for the last time.  Eleven days had passed since the death of Gene Kelly, whose MGM film
 <I>An American in Paris</I> had inspired architect Frank Gehry in his design of the Center's new headquarters.
  A white limestone monument designed to resemble a dancer amid the rooftops of the French capital, the
 198,000 square foot structure was less than two years old.  Now it was closing.  The headline in<I> Le
 Monde</I> observed simply:  &quot;A  VENDRE&quot;  (for sale).  The American cultural institution, founded
 in 1931, was &quot;Trop grand, trop cher, trop tard&quot; (too big, too expensive, too late).<p>

	The American Center had suspended most of its operations in 1987, when the original building at 261
 Boulevard Raspail was sold for some $42 million dollars. Gehry's new structure had opened only in June 1994.
  It contained a 400-seat theatre, a 100-seat screening room, a dance studio, art galleries, classrooms and twenty-six 
apartments intended for visiting artists and intellectuals.  At a cost of between $27 and $42 million
 (the figure is disputed), the instant landmark figured to transform an otherwise drab neighborhood of wine
 warehouses east of the city center.<p>  	

	What had happened?  There was a grain of truth to the <I>Le Monde</I> description.  Parisians,
 with the naivete of the sophisticated, expected such follies of Americans.  But to insiders who were familiar
 with the American Center and its history, the closure reveals something more.  The story of how officials from
 two American philanthropic foundations appeared as &quot;White Knights&quot; to rescue a struggling
 cultural institution but stayed to liquidate its assets testifies to the perils of permitting funders to exert direct
 control over organizations.  It also reveals the arrogance of America's avant-garde arts establishment 
during a period of post-Cold War re-evaluation of the U.S. role in Europe.  Finally, it exposes the greed of
 foundation officials who put their private agendas ahead of a nonprofit organization's welfare.
  Ironically, the Bohen and Mellon foundation executives came to Paris not to praise the American Center,
 but to bury it.<P>  

 	***<br>
<hr>
<a name="Yanks"></a>
<H3>THE YANKS ARE COMING</H3>
	The closure and sale of the American Center brought to a distressing end a seven-year run of dreams gone
 awry.  In February, 1987 the original American Center headquarters closed.  Situated in Montparnasse, the Left
 Bank neighborhood which Hemingway and Fitzgerald had made their haunt, it had been a focal point for French
 and American artists and students still searching for the ghosts of the &quot;Lost Generation.&quot;  The Center
 site had been Chateaubriand's garden, and it still sheltered the oldest tree in Paris.<p>

	&quot;The American Students and Artists Center&quot; was founded in 1931 by Frederick Warren Beekman,
 the Dean of the American (Episcopal) Cathedral in Paris (and father-in-law of Presidential candidate Malcolm S. (Steve)
 Forbes, Jr., whose wife Sabina was raised in Paris). The Beekman family owned New York's Social Register (later sold
 to Malcolm S. Forbes) and catered to a striving social elite of expatriate Americans.  Beekman modelled his Center on
 the YMCA, for he intended it to offer an alcohol-free environment protecting Prohibition-era Americans from the
 temptation of cafes while encouraging them to &quot;come to France to partake of its unparalleled culture.&quot;<p> 

	He was immediately successful.  Americans in France formed a 150-member fundraising committee which
 raised $175,000 in Paris and an additional $200,000 in the United States.  Architect Welles Bosworth, brought to
 France by the Rockefeller family to help remodel Versailles, was commissioned to contruct the Center's headquarters,
 a  neo-classical palazzo which contained a swimming pool, gym, bowling alley, billiard room, auditorium, library,
 canteen, enclosed garden, and art studios.  The building was completed in 1934.<p>
<hr>
<a name="Paris"></a>
<H3>AN AMERICAN IN PARIS</H3>
	In the thirties and early forties, the Center was eminently respectable.  The American expatriate community
 enjoyed its events, and it was well-known for its teas, served to patrons in club chairs.  The expatriate American 
community which built the Center was also known for its other good works. It was instrumental in establishing
 an American Hospital, an American Church, and an American Library -- all independent and privately funded -- 
&quot;just as they would be in Minneapolis or Kansas City,&quot; in the words of Henry Pillsbury, heir to the
 Minnesota flour fortune and former executive director of the Center.<p>
	
	During World War II the building was commandeered by the Nazis.  But at war's end Beekman regained the
 building from the French Army and, after retiring as Dean of the Cathedral, became the Center's first executive
 director.  Once independent of the Cathedral, the Center became a venue for American artists in the 1950's and
 60s, sponsoring concerts, theatrical peformances, and exhibitions. In post-war Europe nonconformity became the
 Center's watchword as &quot;beatniks&quot; and avant-garde artists began to change what journalist Claire
 Downey, a reporter for <I>Paris City</I>, called its &quot;Ivy-League, clubby atmosphere.&quot;<p>  

	The Center became known for its bohemian charm and chance <I>rendevous</I> of French and American
 students.  An English language program was instituted, and poetry readings, art and music classes were offered.
  Open all night -- until 7 a.m. -- the Center attracted jazz musicians who would stop by after the French clubs shut
 their doors.  In time, eighty percent of the Center's expenses were paid for by tuition for classes and ticket sales.
 Some 5,000 art students and 3,000 English students enrolled in Center programs annually.  Downey refers to it as
 &quot;a commercial enterprise which supported an artistic agenda.&quot;  This was in keeping with American
 traditions of art and commerce.<p>

	But the Center was changing.  After the rebellious days of the 1968 student uprising, hippies, drugs, and
 theft came to the American Center -- as they did to America itself.  &quot;It was like a small Berkeley,
&quot; observed one-time student Jimmy Shuman.  In 1969 Pillsbury took over as executive director.  In what
 Shuman called &quot;a revolution from the inside,&quot; Pillsbury adopted a new, laid-back approach to
 managing the Center. &quot;He was like a camp counselor,&quot; said one longtime American Paris resident.<p>

	Pillsbury's expatriate American bohemianism was in many ways quite traditional and fundamentally non-political.
  Among some Parisian leftists there were rumors that the Center was involved with the CIA.  In fact, the Minneapolis
 native was simply an eclectic individualist devoted to the arts.  He had once been a theatre director and occasionally 
staged his own productions at the Center. <p> 

	Like his Center, Pillsbury was well-liked by many quite conservative Americans in Paris.  Jean Gerard, President
 Reagan's appointee as U.S. ambassador to UNESCO called him a &quot;fine fellow.&quot;  A &quot;gentleman
&quot; is how he is described by Judith Bingham, a prominent figure among Republicans residing abroad. 
 Pillsbury's devotion to the Center was also quite tangible.  He donated at least $1 million from his personal fortune
 to the Center, making up an annual budget deficit not covered by other revenues.<p>

	The governing board of the Center, made up of primarily expatriate Americans from the listings of Beekman's
 Social Register, had confidence in Pillsbury, who had a relatively free hand as executive director.  &quot;The old
 American Center was deeply loved by both Americans living in Paris and the French,&quot; noted Downey. &quot;It
 was a miracle,&quot; said Michel Reilhac, who later came to work for the Center as its highest-ranking French 
employee, &quot;living on a shoestring it had managed to be a major focus of cultural life in Paris without any means,
 compared to richer French insitutions, which had less cultural influence.&quot;<p>

	In 1977, Pillsbury was joined by Judith Pisar, who had moved to Paris with her husband, Auschwitz survivor
 Samuel Pisar, an international lawyer specializing in East-West trade who represented British publisher Robert Maxwell,
 among others.  A New York City fundraiser for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Pisar soon became chairman of the
 Center's board after garnering increased contributions.<p>

	Pisar's personal connections helped the Center's fundraising and raised its public profile among the French 
and back home in the United States. Together, Pisar and Pillsbury set their sights on expanding the American Center
 as, in Pillsbury's words, &quot;a place where you can see, where you can learn, and where you can do.&quot;<p> 

	In 1979 Pillsbury and Pisar had secured Rockefeller Foundation funding which supported an &quot;artists
-in-residence&quot; program.  Over the next eight years it would sponsor 500 artistic performances, 350 workshops 
and 30 exhibitions.  Merce Cunningham, John Cage, and Philip Glass graced the Center's stage.  Sources in Paris
 say Pisar was quite close to Republican Senator Charles Percy, who, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee, worked to better relations between the Center and the USIA and, as father-in-law to Senator John D.
 Rockefeller IV, helped with Center fundraising.<p> 
	
As the decade came to a close, the Center was still a proud and representative American institution in Paris,
 supported by the American establishment and the Franco-American public.<p>	

<hr>
<a name="Singing"></a>
<H3>SINGING IN THE RAIN</H3>
	In 1987, at the height of the Paris real estate boom, Pisar and Pillsbury accepted a fantastic bid of $42 million
 from the Banque Arabe d' Invetissement for the Center's property in Montparnasse.  At that time, the Center's annual
 budget averaged only about $500,000.  The National Endowment for the Arts had given $250,000 to the Center in 1985
 for its endowment fund.  But the enormous pool of new money, Pillsbury and Pisar said, meant that the Center could 
meet ever-rising public demands.  With help from the City of Paris, the Center acquired a huge plot of land in Bercy,
 just across the Seine from the new French library and near the &quot;Palais Omnisport,&quot; a sort of French
 Madison Square Garden.  With $42 million sitting in the Banque National de Paris, Pisar and Pillsbury took a gamble
 and built a monument.<p>
	
	The Center held spectacular fund-raising events in the late 80's and early 90's at such venues as the Theatre
 de le Rond Pont on the Champs Elysees.  They starred the likes of Gene Kelly and Leonard Bernstein, and celebrated
 the elegant fashions of Hubert de Givenchy.  But the eclectic bohemianism of the center was also maintained by
 showcasing avant-garde darlings such as Jean-Louis Barrault and Peter Brook.  During the next decade, Pisar and
 Pillsbury helped raise some $11 million -- in addition to the sale price of the building and accrued interest reaching 
10 percent annually -- including a $5 million dollar matching grant from Minneapolis native and pop art patron  Frederick
 R. Weisman.  Among other old-line donors, the Dillon Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Fund each gave $100,000.
  Walter Annenberg also made a substantial contribution.  And French companies such as Yves St.Laurent and the 
Banque National de Paris contributed half a million dollars each.  Pisar received a Legion d'Honneur from the French 
government in recognition of her work promoting exchanges of Franco-American culture.<p>

<hr>
<a name="Deux"></a>
<H3>FOLIE A DEUX</H3>
	Unfortunately, the financial windfall for the American Center carried with it some severe problems.  
Freed from the fiscal constraints of the past, Pillsbury and Pisar succumbed to a culture of spending during the
 seven years between buildings.  They executed a series of false starts, made unfortunate staff choices, and relied on
 &quot;consultants&quot; who undermined the Center even as the foundations of its new headquarters were being laid.
<p> 
	
	Michel Reilhac, a French cultural administrator hired by Pillsbury as general manager in 1992, says the Center 
&quot;got trapped in the process of getting rich overnight after having been poor a long time.&quot;  As word spread
 that it had millions in the bank, &quot;a whole group of so-called consultants became attracted to this newly rich
 institution, people who are attracted to making money in this field.&quot;  Reilhac feels that &quot;Pillsbury and
 Pisar didn't know how to say 'No.'&quot;  The result, he argues, was that money began to hemmorhage from the
 Center faster than it could be raised.  It is estimated that some $2 million a year was spent on administration and
 that the projected operating budget for the building was $2 million for programs and $2 million for maintenence.<p>

	To save $5-6 million dollars in construction costs by scaling down the building design, Reilhac flew to
 Los Angeles to meet with the architect, Frank Gehry, whose original design was rejected by zoning officials for the
 City of Paris.  But on returning to Paris, Reilhac discovered that Pisar and Pillsbury had told Gehry to go ahead and
 spend the additional money.<p> 

	Meanwhile, the Center's artistic aspirations were becoming increasingly expensive.  The old American Center
 was a labor of love, but the new operation was paying premiums to its associates.  Pillsbury's friends Martin and
 Mickey Friedman of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis were among the new &quot;consultants.&quot;  They
 had recommended Gehry as architect and were now assigned to direct the artistic program and decorate the building
 on a retainer estimated by sources at between $10,000 and $20,000 per month.<p>

	To be curator for the Center's art exhibits, Pillsbury then hired Adam Weinberg.  He had worked for Friedman
 at the Walker Art Center before moving to New York City's Whitney Museum.Weinberg reportedly objected to the
 taint of Reilhac's attempts to raise money by renting space to commercial clients from a temporary Center classroom 
building constructed near the Gehry construction site.<p>

	Reilhac also says Weinberg began planning an exceptionally expensive opening exhibition called
 &quot;Landscape as Metaphor,&quot; with Friedman as curator.  Presented with a $1.5 million budget, Reilhac
 asked Weinberg to raise the money.  Friedman got some $500,000 from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Foundation,
 but it was not enough.  In 1992, Pillsbury fired Weinberg, and Friedmansoon left.  Rumored cash settlements 
of $200,000 to Friedman further drained the Center's finances and negative press reactions crimped fundraising.
  &quot;I must say, I have no respect for the Friedmans,&quot; says Reilhac. &quot;They have no idea what
 international culture is about.&quot;<p>

	Soon after the debacle, Pillsbury met Bill Arnett, an Atlanta art collector who manages the career
 of Mississippi's Thornton Dial, an African-American painter and one of the most prominent &quot;Outsider
 Artists&quot; working today.  Pillsbury agreed to an American Center show of Dial's work.  Reilhac describes the
 planned exhibition as &quot;just beautiful work&quot; and Arnett agreed to secure the show's financing at no cost
 to the Center.  Surely the Parisian love affair with African-American culture, from Louis Armstrong and Josephine 
Baker to James Baldwin and Richard Wright, would be rekindled by Dial.<p>

	Whatever their missteps and foolishness, Pillsbury and Pisar had the Center's interests at heart.  It seems
 probable that the American Center could have overcome their <I>folie d'grandeur.</I>  Once the amazing new building
 opened, the Center could have recaptured its role as a vital American presence in France and served as a genuine
 artistic balance to the popular appeal of Euro-Disney. <p>

	The Thornton Dial show was the sort of project that could have led the Center out of the wildneress.  But it
 was not to be. Pillsbury and Pisar lost control of the Center in 1993 after the press stories of its problems reverberated
 through the philanthropic and art communities.  The Center's new leaders cancelled the exhibit of &quot;Outsider
 Art.&quot;  The successors to Pillsbury and Pisar were very much New York art world insiders.<p>
<hr>
<a name="Fou"></a>
<H3>L'AMOUR FOU</H3>
	The final chapter in the collapse of the American Center stars a new cast of characters who assumed center
 stage in 1993:  representatives of the Bohen and Mellon Foundations who took control of the Board of Directors.
  Their role in the destruction of an American cultural institution tells much about the new philanthropy of culture.<p>

	Incredibly, after only eighteen months of operation in its prize-winning building, Frederick Bohen Henry, the
 new Chairman of the American Center's Board of Directors, ordered the Gehry landmark closed and sold.  Henry, the
 president of the Bohen Foundation (assets $6 million), and Rachel Bellow, his partner in the Center's reorganized
 &quot;Office of the Director&quot; and a program officer for the Arts and Humanities at the Andrew G. Mellon 
Foundation (assets $2 billion) preferred to liquidate the American Center's assets.<p>

	This drama took place behind the scenes during 1993 and 1994, as Pillsbury and Pisar were shunted aside
 and a new &quot;special committee&quot; of twenty-five art world superstars shuttled back and forth between 
Paris and the United States prior to the June 1994 opening of the Center.  In Paris, they
 stayed at the fashionable Hotel d'Alembert.  Some reportedly flew first class, others preferred the Concorde. 
 According to sources, neither Henry nor Bellow resided in Paris, preferring to visit for a few days each month.<p>

	While the Center had a New York apartment for &quot;fundraising&quot; purposes, neither of the new leaders
 made a similar commitment to Paris.  This should have been the first sign that neither Henry nor Bellow had the
 interests of the American expatriate community at heart.<p>

	After cancelling the Thornton Dial show, Bellow and Henry cancelled the English classes that Reilhac had
 championed.  They rejected offers from Robert Altman to rent space to produce his film &quot;Pret-A-Porter
&quot; and from Voyager Videodiscs to headquarter its project to digitize the Louvre on CD-ROM.  They even
 turned down a local cafe proprietor who wanted to open a bistro<B>t</B>.  Bettina Zilkha Trink, heiress to a
 Franco-American banking fortune, resigned from the board in disgust.<p>

	Plans for the June, 1994 Center opening continued, and Pillsbury and Pisar agreed to stay on for the sake
 of appearances.  They have never spoken about the final days.  But interviews with their associates make clear 
that by January, 1994, they were mere figureheads and the institution was under the control of the visiting 
Americans.<p>

	Bellow explained her new approach to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>:  &quot;First we will see how much 
money we can get, and then we'll decide what we are able to do with it.&quot;  One of her first decisions was to 
spend an estimated $500,000 on an opening party.  David Byrne, the former Talking Head, and a gospel group 
provided the music, the decorations were by Andre Puttnam, the liquor flowed, and there was dancing till dawn. <p>

	Among the curious expenses paid by Bellow and Henry was a confidential settlement of a harrassment 
complaint filed by superlawyer Eddie Hayes, current involved in the fight over the Andy Warhol estate and the
 fictionalized protagonist of Tom Wolfe's <I>Bonfire of the Vanities.</I>  Hayes represented an American woman
 hired by the Center to help with fundraising.  How much did her two-month &quot;development&quot; tenure 
cost the Center?  No one is talking, but Hayes did remark, &quot;They were very reasonable.&quot; Coming 
from a plaintiff's lawyer, one can only shudder at the implications.<P>

	Bellow and Henry replaced the no-cost Thornton Dial show with a $250,000 exhibit from Los Angeles'
 Museum of Contemporary Art called &quot;Pure Beauty.&quot;  (Richard Koshalek, the director of L.A. museum,
 was a member of Henry's &quot;special committee&quot;; Bill Arnett was not.)  The show was a flop.  Of &quot;Pure
 Beauty&quot; the <I>Wall Street Journal's</I> Judy Fayard wrote, &quot;Most of it is so hopeless, so lazy, so utterly
 lacking in rigor or vigor or vision, that even the cost of shipping the silly things over seems too much.&quot;<p>


	But the Center's changed tone was noted by the <I>Journal</I> reporter, who quoted Bellow's declaration
 that the Center would now become &quot;a meeting place for an international community of artists and 
performers...&quot; rather than a Franco-American institution.<p>

<hr>
<a name="Vanities"></a>
<H3>BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES</H3>
	In September 1994, the Center hired Marie-Claude Beaud as executive director. She was given a remodeled
 and furnished New York apartment, a travel allowance, and permission to hire her own staff.  Beaud was a French
 cultural bureaucrat, who had managed state-supported museums in Toulon and Grenoble before joining the Fondation
 Cartier, which was, according to <I>Apollo </I>magazine, &quot;better known for its gimmicks and parties than for any
 lasting contribution to modern art.&quot;  Beaud had &quot;never raised a sou&quot; according to one former
 Center employee.  A curious choice for an institution in financial crisis.<p>

	Although Beaud declared in public that she liked America, former Center employees say that in private she 
was &quot;clearly anti-American.&quot;  Soon after her arrival, what had been English and French-language press
 releases were issued only in French.  The policy was not reversed until a prominent American reporter stationed in
 Paris said she would not cover any event without an English-language press release.<p>
	
	Beaud's program decisions parody an NEA annual report:  They include Leon Golub and Nancy Spero's
 left-wing agitprop, &quot;video art&quot; by Nam June Paik and Bill Viola, a Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and
 presentations by politically correct Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, dancer Bill T. Jones, and Living Theatre relic 
Judith Malina.  Others events included Larry Clark's film on teen sex, &quot;Kids,&quot; art exhibits by European
 artists Phillippe Boardas and Nicholas Bouvier and writers Cees Noteboom and Michel LeBris, and concerts by 
UNUN, with singers &quot;Helda...Thor Eldon, guitarist of the Sugarcubes (Bjork) and Dr. Gunni, an independent
 rock star in Iceland...&quot;  The Center's last cinema event honored the work of Jonas Mekas, whose grainy loops
 of 16mm self-indulgence have a decidedly limited appeal.<p>

	A cynic might conclude that Bellow and Henry must have encouraged such programs to justify their decision
 to sell the building.  Certainly there were alternatives to their selection of <B>Madame Beaud.  </B>Robert Fitzpatrick,
 a Center board member who had headed Euro-Disneyland, the California Institute of the Arts, and the highly 
successful 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival expressed interest in the executive director's job.  Pillsbury
 himself had proposed his name.  With contacts in Europe and America and experience in promoting popular and
 high culture, Fitzpatrick could have raised the money and protected the center's mission.  Rebuffed, Fitzpatrick
 became Dean of the Arts at Columbia University.<p>

	Observers close to the scene have revealed to <I>Foundation Watch </I>that Henry and Bellow, who have
 jointly managed the Center's day-to-day affairs since 1994, are personally responsible for sealing its fate.  Depending
 on the sale price of the building, estimates of the potential future endowment range from $10 to $30 million.  Instead 
of raising the money to save what had been an important institution representing American culture to France, the new
 overseers are converting its assets into funds that will be distributed by a grantmaking foundation that will fund art 
from and for &quot;the international community.&quot; <p>

	On January 24, 1996, an American Center press release reported that after the sale of the Gehry landmark
 -- which still awaits a buyer -- and debt repayments including a reported $4 million owed the city of Paris, all remaining
 funds will go into an endowment to be directed by Marie-Claude Beaud, last director of the American Center.  Fred
 Henry will be Chairman of the Board of the newly reorganized fund.  Rachel Bellow announced that she is leaving 
the Mellon Foundation to become a &quot;consultant&quot; to arts organizations.  It was not disclosed whether the
 American Center fund will become her first client. <p>

<hr>
<a name="Deconstructing"></a>
<h3>DECONSTRUCTING THE AMERICAN CENTER</h3>
	The cultural outlook implied in the decisions Henry and Bellow are making derive from the modern-day
 detractors of all things genuinely cultural who currently dominate so much of the art world: the post-modernists
 and deconstructionists who substitute nihilism for aesthetic achievement.  They have little in common with the 
celebration of the buoyant and eclectic American culture usually championed by Pillsbury and Pisar.  Moreover,
 by choosing to redeploy the American Center's financial assets rather than supervise its mission to represent
 American culture, Henry and Bellow are redefining the purposes of philanthrophy. <p>

	How did they manage to takeover the American Center?  In retrospect, there were warnings that should
 not have gone unheeded.  Pillsbury's downfall commenced with his decision to hire Adam Weinberg, late of the
 Walker and Whitney Museums.  It was Weinberg who introduced him to Frederick Bohen Henry.  Henry, a New
 York City attorney and avid art collector, was born in Des Moines, the heir to the Meredith Publishing fortune.
  He remains on the board of the family business, currently valued at some $700 million.  Henry lists his occupation
 as Bohen Foundation president.  (The Bohen board also includes pollster Daniel Yankelovich, co-founder of the
 Public Agenda Foundation.   Bohen gave $125,000 to the Public Agenda Foundation in 1991-92.  See <I>Foundation
 Watch v.I, n.1</I> for more on Public Agenda.)  Most importantly, Henry was a member of the Board of Trustees of 
tNew York's Whitney Museum of American Art.  <p>

	Since the mid-1980s the Walker and Whitney museums have been models and mirrors of the decadence and
 fiscal irresponsibility pervading the American arts establishment.  Representatives of both institutions are
 on Henry's influential &quot;special committee.&quot;  These &quot;cutting edge&quot; venues for self-mutilation
 performances and exhibits of plastic puddles of excrement and vomit have been funded targets of the 
public's outcry against National Endowment for the Arts grants<B>.</B>  (The Walker Museum sponsored the 
HIV-positive artist Ron Athey, who hoisted towels smeared with his victim's blood over the 
heads of art patrons.  The Whitney Biennial featured the poop and puke).  In any future history of the NEA's demise,
 the Walker and the Whitney surely will be featured for their roles in destroying a once bipartisan congressional 
consensus in support of the arts. <p>

	Fred Henry was no stranger to the gross and disgusting.  His Bohen Foundation had been a sponsor of a
 Bruce Nauman exhibit that was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Smithsonian's Hirshorn
 Museum.  It featured neon signs blinking &quot;F--- and Die,&quot; &quot;S--- and Die,&quot; and depicted excited
 male sexual organs and a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals.<p>

	Henry began his courtship of the American Center with a Bohen Foundation donation to support &quot;public
 art&quot; for the park at Bercy.  Well connected in the art-world, he also helped the Center secure money from New 
York City's public art fund in 1989.  By 1990 Bohen was on the American Center's board of directors.  Pisar had stayed
 on as titular Chairman of the board, but Henry in 1992 became Chairman of its Executive Committee.  In that capacity 
he organized the &quot;special committee&quot; of top officials in prominent arts institutions who reported directly 
to him.<P>

	How was Henry able to oust Pillsbury and outmaneuver Pisar? The answer is simple.  He used the assets of
 the Bohen Foundation to increase his influence among the artistic avant-garde so that they would second his 
recommendations on the fate of the American Center. In confronting the troubled institution, Henry's
 aggressive tactics were not unlike those of a corporate takeover artist.  The American Center was a target.  It would
 be a fine institution to run -- or sell -- after a leveraged buyout.  To secure its assets, which were worth over $40 
million, Henry needed only to make investments (i.e. contributions) of mere hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
his allies and then push the old guard aside.<p>

	According to IRS records, in 1991-92 the Bohen Foundation reported a contribution of only $50,000 to the
 American Center in Paris. (Bohen would eventually give about $500,000, roughly half of Henry Pillsbury's personal
 contributions over the years).  More interesting were the Bohen Foundation's grants to other American cultural 
institutions:  $173,000 went to the Whitney Museum of American Art, whose curator of Film and Video, John 
Hanhardt joined the &quot;special committee&quot; of the American Center in 1992; $50,000 went to Social 
Policy Inc. -- The New Press, headed by editor Andre Schiffrin who also joined Henry's &quot;special committee
&quot; in 1992; and $110,000 was contributed to the Museum of Modern Art, whose director, Richard Oldenburg
, joined the &quot;special committee&quot; as well.  A grant of $15,000 went to the Dia Center for the Arts, a venue
 for the avant-garde where Henry was a board member.  Its director joined the &quot;special committee&quot; in 1992,
 as did Harvey Lichtenstein, director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  BAM received $57,000 from the Bohen 
Foundation.  Clearly, the members of Henry's &quot;special committee&quot; were aware of his contributions to
 their institutions and unlikely to resist his plans for the Center.<p> 

	In 1994, members of the special committee were invited to join Henry in what an American Center press
 release called &quot;a radical innovation in the management of nonprofit cultural institutions.&quot;  The special
 committee had been &quot;assembled to help formulate and implement the Center's diverse artistic and educational
 program&quot; in order to develop &quot;a new strategic alliance&quot; which &quot;may signal the development 
of a new model for securing international hubs of artistic activity and exchange.&quot;  By such cloudy jargon did the
 arts elite ratify Henry's intention to sell the American Center's new building.  And what justified the sale would be a
 major philanthropy's predatory concept of how nonprofit arts organizations should deploy their resouces.<p> 

<hr>
<a name="Boardroom"></a>
<h3>INSIDE THE BOARDROOM</h3>
		Where did Henry get his ideas about how to proceed in philanthropy?  Some clue may be found in
 <I>Inside the Boardroom</I> (John Wiley, NY, 1994), a new book by William G. Bowen, president of the Andrew 
A. Mellon Foundation.  In his book, Bowen argues that the boards of directors of nonprofit organizations should 
take a more direct role in the day-to-day management of their institutions.  Henry followed this advice when he 
placed himself in power.  But he also innovated.  By consolidating decision-making in an &quot;Office of the Director,
&quot; but then sharing that post with the Mellon Foundation's Rachel Bellow, Henry devised a novel experiment in 
organizational infrastructure.<p>

	Henry's reliance on his &quot;special committee&quot; perhaps reflects Bowen's endorsement of outside
 consultants as a highly desirable board practice.  Bowen, a former president of Princeton University who once
 managed the private trusts of the Rockefeller family (estimated by <I>Fortune</I> magazine in 1986 to be worth some
 $3 billion) argues that good management requires &quot;the board should have ready access to advice from
 accountants, compensation consultants, lawyers, and investment bankers who are chosen by the outside directors,
 not by management,&quot; (i.e. the American Center's case, not Pillsbury and Pisar).   <p>

		More importantly, in <I>Inside the Boardroom, </I>Bowen specifically credits Rachel Bellow, Mellon's
 program officer on the American Center board, for helping reconcile the Center to its own suicide.  Concludes Bowen:
  &quot;More thought needs to be given, in my view, to ways of allowing nonprofits to achieve 'death with dignity'
 when that is appropriate.  In theory, some nonprofits recognize that institutional demise can signal success, not failure.
 . .For example, my colleague, Rachel Bellow, has called my attention to the Free Southern Theatre in New Orleans. . .The
 theater staged a large funeral through the streets of New Orleans and artists from all over the country attended to 
celebrate the 'death' (read:success) of the theater.&quot;<p>  

	What occurred in New Orleans foreshadowed what followed in Paris.  By hiring Marie-Claude Beaud
 as Pillsbury's successor, Henry and Bellow selected more than a promoter of the international avant-garde. 
 The former curator at the Fondation Cartier dreamed about shutting down cultural institutions
</B>Beaud once actually once told a journalist that she would like to close Cartier's museum and sell its collection. 
 In September 1992 she declared to Elspeth Moncrieff of Britain's <I>Apollo</I> magazine: &quot;With the ease of
 modern-day travel it makes more sense for the Fondation to contribute to existing centres of excellence, rather than
 create another institution in a minor Parisian suburb...There is no point in continuing to build our own collection...
If you have a collection, you need a museum and curators.  Even lending the works involves a good deal of
 administration all of which eats into our grant.  If I had my way I would give away the Fondation's collection,
 with the exception of the works which hang in our corporate offices.&quot;  When she took over the American
 Center one could ask for no clearer statement of Beaud's philosophy.<p>

		In his new mission statement for the Center, Henry declared his constituency to be not Americans
 or the French, but &quot;an international community.&quot;  He promised &quot;an entrepreneurship of new 
expressions.&quot;  Henry had made sure that he was joined in his venture by the most powerful officials from 
America's private arts bureaucracy.  And to the modest assets of his Bohen Foundation he added the backing of
 William Bowen's Andrew Mellon Foundation, whose $2 billion in assets makes it the largest single grantmaker in
 the arts and humanities in the United States. <p>

		Rachel Bellow, the woman who advised Bowen on the successful death of the New Orleans theater,
 is a program officer in the arts and humanities at the Mellon Foundation.  Her division alone distributes some $20 
million annually.  Bellow is widely considered an expert on arts management.  She has served as a consultant to the
 NEA and is married to Adam Bellow, an important neoconservative editor at The Free Press who is the son of novelist
 Saul Bellow.  Like the other art world denizens selected by Fred Henry, Bellow had been invited to join his
 &quot;special committee&quot; in 1992 for a purpose.  She was given leave by the Mellon Foundation for her
 new assignment. By 1993 Bellow was Henry's full partner in the newly constituted &quot;Office of the Director.
&quot;  But what was her purpose?<p>

		Some might have supposed that the Mellon Foundation would open its deep pockets to the Center.  
Former Center staffers thought so.  In 1993, Bellow's division in the Mellon Foundation gave $15 million in a single 
grant to the National Gallery of Art.  But they would misjudge the intentions of Henry and Bellow.<p>

		Consider, for instance, the disposition of a $440,000 Mellon grant to the American Center in 1993
 which was personally approved by William Bowen.  Mellon's annual report claims the grant went &quot;to 
strengthen its [the American Center's] core programs, collaborations with smaller arts organizations and financial
 stability.&quot;  Did the report's bland prose admit of a new definition for the Center's &quot;core programs,
&quot; or was the report a misrepresentation to the Mellon Foundation's board?<p>

		Certainly, the Mellon Foundation could have rescued the American Center had Bowen wished it.
  Would Mellon's Board Chairman, John C. Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration 
and a former head of Goldman, Sachs, have permitted the sinking of a flagship American cultural institution?  
Indeed, Bowen's book quoted Whitehead's own personal observation that &quot;A for-profit board has an 
obligation to <I>get out</I> of a bad business while a nonprofit board may have an obligation to <I>stay in</I>,
 if it is to be true to its mission.&quot;  <p>

		The mystery is that Henry, Bowen and Bellow were indifferent to such basic obligations.  Should
 not Whitehead call them to account for their decision to kill the symbol of American culture in Paris?  After all, it
 was William Bowen himself who wrote in <I>Inside the Boardroom, &quot;Nonprofit boards are tremendously 
important.  They can have more impact on the success or failure of an organization than can most for-profit 
boards.&quot;</I><p>

<h3>WHO IS WILLIAM BOWEN</h3>
	William Bowen is widely perceived as a mentor to University of Pennsylvania President Sheldon Hackney,
 the Clinton Administration's selection for Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.  A 1965 Bowen
 study laid much of the groundwork for the National Endowment for the Arts.<p>

<hr>
<a name="Never"></a>
<h3>	NEVER ASKED BOX</h3>
<b> 		Anne Radice, the first director of the National Museum of Women in the Arts (and acting chairman of
 the National Endowment for the Arts under President Bush) pointed out, she had built a new museum, with a new 
constituency, and an income-generating membership, with programs that required an annual operating budget of 
$6 million. And the National Museum of Women in the Arts did it without any endowment, and in a building which
 required monthly mortgage payments, and an initial $5 million renovation. <p>

		How did she do it? &quot;We were careful how we spent our money,&quot; Radice says. &quot;I
 wouldn't do an exhibit without underwriting. Never. We paid for everything before we did it. I never planned a budget
 on the receipt of grants.  And so we never had to fire people. Every night when I went to bed, I felt personally 
responsible for all of our employees. I would never have jeopardized their jobs.&quot;Clearly, had the American
 Center asked Radice, who has a MBA in addition to her doctorate in Art History (in Florentine art), and experience
 as an international cultural officer with USIA specializing in public diplomacy, she might have been able to help them
 out. The sad part is, as she notes, &quot;I was never approached.&quot;Ironically, Radice became available in
 November, 1992, when President Bush lost his bid for-re-election. Today she is involved with a different private
 foundation, not funding the arts.<p>

</B>(Architect Gehry disputes the figure, assigning a cost of $27 million, including architect's fees). 

 (Sadly, this relic was chopped down by the Fondation Cartier, the corporate foundation of the jewelry business, 
when it took over the site in 1990.)

FR: <a href="/crc/about/people.html#scanlon">TERRY SCANLON</a>
<P>
RE: WHAT'S HOT AT CAPITAL RESEARCH CENTER
<P>
The record-breaking high temperatures that swept through the country
during July and August were matched by Capital Research Center.
We've been red-hot this summer.
<P>
Capital has added new staff, upgraded its technology, refurbished
its meeting facilities and taken on new projects. We have published
an annual report, distributed ground-breaking issues of our monthly
newsletters, and made substantial progress on our annual corporate
giving study and special reports scheduled for publication by
year's end.
<P>
The board elected a new director, the Hon. William E. Simon, former
secretary of the U.S. Treasury, past president of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, and chairman of William E. Simon &amp; Sons. But the
highlight of the summer was watching House Republicans reform
the federal grant system. All this and more is inside <I>Capital
Report</I>, so read on!
<P>
<a name="reform"></a>
<h3>Congress Reforms the Grant Process;</B> <B>Calls on CRC for
Help </h3>
<P>
Americans are becoming more and more aware of how federally-funded
nonprofits use taxpayer money to influence public policy. Tax-exempt
advocacy groups get almost <B>$40 billion</B> a year in federal
grant money, and much of it goes directly or indirectly to lobbying
for even more tax dollars. Ending this unethical use of taxpayer
money has long been Capital Research Center's goal. For 11 years,
CRC has monitored the flow of government and private funds to
nonprofits and researched how that money was used. We believe
a nonprofit organization should deliver services to those in need
-- not use taxpayers' forced charity to lobby the government for
higher taxes, increased spending, more regulations -- and additional
money for an organization itself. Capital spreads this message
in its publications and public statements. For instance, CRC Research
Director Robert Huberty discussed the issue this summer as a panelist
during a Heritage Foundation seminar.
<P>
This was about the time Congress addressed the problem of charities
soliciting government welfare for their lobbyists. CRC President
Terry Scanlon testified before a U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee in June about how to stop tax-exempt special interest
groups from using tax dollars to promote their own public policy
agendas. His message: break this vicious circle.
<P>
&quot;Federal agencies go to Congress asking for more money while
funding the groups that lobby for more government funding. Having
become accustomed to receiving their treasury checks, these groups
have a vested interest in the perpetuation of the status quo.
It is a vicious circle,&quot; Scanlon told the House National
Economic Growth, Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee.
<P>
In August, the House passed legislation by Republican Reps. David
McIntosh (IN), Ernest J. Istook, Jr. (OK) and Robert L. Ehrlich,
Jr. (MD) that goes a long way toward restoring integrity to the
federal grant process. Using information developed in part by
CRC, House reformers won support for a law prohibiting tax-supported
charities from using any federal grants for lobbying purposes
and to make them accountable if they spend their non-federal dollars
on advocacy. The legislation provides for auditing and reporting
how grant money was used and how much advocacy is practiced. The
House approved the legislation as part of the Labor/Health and
Human Services appropriation. The Senate, which earlier passed
legislation regarding nonprofits in its lobbying reform bill,
will take up the Labor/HHS appropriation in the fall.
<P>
&quot;Nonprofit advocacy groups who rely on federal grants must
realize that government money is not necessary to amplify their
appeals for charity. Until they realize this, every organization
that criticizes the McIntosh legislation should be obligated to
disclose how much government money they accept and how much they
lobby.&quot; Scanlon said. Of course, CRC does not solicit nor
accept any government money.
<P>
<a name="scanlon"></a>
<B>A Plan for Reform</B> 
<P>
The practice of nonprofit advocacy groups lobbying for public
policy changes that benefit themselves is a vicious circle that
Congress has recognized must be broken. The scope of the problem
is broad. For instance, the American Association of Retired Persons
receives about one-quarter of its budget ($85.9 million) from
the federal government. The National Council of Senior Citizens,
a charitable lobbying group, gets 96 percent of its budget (almost
$70 million) from the federal cash cow.
<P>
CRC President Terry Scanlon testified before Congress in June
and recommended that leaders enact a four-part plan to show it
is serious about reforming the federal grant process and to preserve
the independence and integrity of the nonprofit sector. Scanlon
suggested Congress:
<OL>
<LI>Break the circle. Congress should enact legislation severely
capping the amount of non-government dollars that charities accepting
federal grants can spend on advocacy. Of course, the ideal solution
would be to bar nonprofit advocacy groups from receiving <U>any</U>
taxpayer funds.
<LI>Don't let them launder their money. The law should extend
the cap on advocacy to affiliate organizations. If Congress skips
this step, grant recipients will set up affiliates and subsidiary
organizations -- often run out of the same office -- to engage
in lobbying activities.
<LI>Let the sun shine in. Agencies should be required to provide
the public, on a regular basis, detailed information about its
grantmaking. Government officials should name and describe the
organizations that receive their grants, the size and purpose
of the grants, and what kind of lobbying a grantee has performed.
Furthermore, committee and subcommittee chairmen should require
panelists testifying at congressional hearings to reveal the amount
of taxpayer dollars their organization has received during previous
years.
<LI>Give the law sharp teeth. The law should contain an effective
enforcement mechanism that will levy steep fines on officials
who break the rules and retrieve the grant from government-funded
nonprofits that violate the advocacy restrictions. Also, groups
that break the law should be ineligible for future government
grants or contract.
</OL>

<P>
The House recently passed legislation that closely mirrors Scanlon's
recommendations. The Senate was scheduled to consider the bill
after the August recess.
<P>
<a name="advice"></a>
<B>Scanlon Advice Hits Home</B> 
<P>
Republicans hadn't held the majority for forty decades when the
tidal wave class of 1996 allowed it to take control of the 104th
Congress. Unfortunately, the party was a bit rusty when it came
to the hearing process. In many cases, members were absent, inattentive
or unprepared for hearings. Chairmen failed to invite key conservative
witnesses to testify and allowed Democrat members to interrupt
their testimony with patronizing dismissals, sarcastic rebuttals
and blatant attempts to intimidate.
<P>
CRC President Terry Scanlon, former chairman of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission under Ronald Reagan, knows what it was like
to face a well-organized congressional committee. That's why he
penned an op-ed for <I>The Washington Times</I> that advised the
new Republican chairmen to control the selection and questioning
of witnesses to present their causes in the best possible light.
<P>
After the piece appeared, Republicans made efforts to tighten
up their hearings. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) distributed
the op-ed to all committee chairmen. First-termer Rep. Bob Barr
(R-GA) passed it out at a freshman class meeting. And after the
Whitewater and Waco hearings, which were widely seen as a fumbled
opportunity for the majority, the leadership developed a two-page
primer on how to conduct hearings. When Congress returns from
the August recess they will have another opportunity to enact
the public agenda that votes supported last November.
<P>
<a name="lacey"></a>
<B>CRC Researcher <a href="/crc/about/people.html#lacey">Lacey</a> Testifies about Americorps</B> 
<P>
When the Republican House began reviewing the effectiveness of
Americorps, the President's expensive and faulty attempt to invigorate
the spirit of service, they turned to Capital Research Center
for information. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-CT), House Human Resources
and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee chairman, invited
<I><a href="/crc/books/pcs/">Philanthropy, Culture and Society</a></I> Editor Jill Lacey to
testify at a May hearing.
<P>
Lacey gave Congress an eye-witness account of the Georgia Peach
Corps, a $2.8 million Americorps demonstration project she visited
last year. She outlined on the obviously discernible problems
of the program: the teenagers not being volunteers (they were
paid $4.25 an hour plus a $5,000 tuition grant); the grossly under-estimated
cost (the Georgia program's high drop-out rate rocketed the cost
per graduate to $35,000 a year); and the marginal value of their
projects to the community (because by law Americorps cannot displace
any government workers).
<P>
&quot;We often hear that Americorps is 'making a difference.'
But the phrase is an empty one. Everything we do makes a difference
-- even spending money foolishly makes a difference. The question
is: What kind of difference?&quot; Lacey asked the subcommittee.
<P>
The answer exposes as flawed the very premise for Americorps.
While the idea of volunteering is to help others, Lacey said,
Americorps focuses more on the volunteer -- not the populations
they purportedly serve.
<P>
&quot;Continual pulse-taking in the form of rap sessions, journaling
exercises and self evaluation sends this message loud and clear:
self esteem, not self sacrifice, is the order of the day,&quot;
Lace observed. This summer, the House zeroed out Americorps' appropriation.

<a name="growth"></a>
<h3>CRC: GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS</h3> 
<P>
As Capital's work becomes more prominent and effective, the think
tank is called on to accomplish more and more. The result is Capital's
evolution into a more comprehensive and efficient operation.
<P>
After 11 years of steady growth, CRC's profile has risen high
enough to warrant an in-house communications department. Natasha
L. DeWees joined Capital's staff as director of communications
on May 30 to get this operation up and running. Communications
services were previously provided by Hugh C. Newton and Associates.
<P>
DeWees is former press secretary for U.S. Rep. Porter J. Goss
(R-FL). She has two degrees in journalism, including a master's
from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University
in Evanston, Ill. The communications position was funded for two
years by a donor who wishes to remain anonymous.
<P>
One major emphasis of CRC's new communications department is to
reach the enormous audience of talk radio. In June, DeWees attended
the annual convention of the National Association of Radio Talk
Show Hosts in Houston. She introduced hosts and producers to CRC's
mission and promoted the center's latest studies. The event enabled
CRC to build a network of radio contacts throughout the nation.
Capital Research associates have already been invited to speak
on radio shows around the country, most recently in Seattle, Salt
Lake City and Detroit.
<P>
<U><I>Facilities Upgrade</I></U> 
<P>
CRC's external growth has prompted comprehensive internal improvements
in our facilities, from upgraded computers to our new E.L Wiegand
conference room.
<P>
Thanks to a new computer system installed in May, CRC's staff
now has access to two new research tools: the Federal Awards Assistance
Data System (FAADS) and Nexis. Nexis is a private database of
national and international news and information on politics, business
and industry. FAADS is a federal database that documents the thousands
of groups that receive millions of taxpayer dollars through the
federal grant process. Using this information, CRC can track organizations
that might use government money to influence public policy.
<P>
Equally impressive is CRC's refurbished conference room. The room's
new paint, trim, carpet, furniture and fixtures provide a more
professional and comfortable environment for meetings and special
projects. Both the computer system and the new conference room
were made possible through the kind generosity of the E. L . Wiegand
Foundation.
<P>
<B>CRC Appoints New Patterns Editor</B> 
<P>
New to the CRC roster is <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Fulk">Austin Fulk</a>, a Little Rock native who
will serve as principal researcher and author of the ninth annual
edition of <I><a href="/crc/patterns/">Patterns in Corporate Philanthropy</a></I>. A 1992<B>
</B>graduate of John Hopkins University, Fulk has considerable
experience in the Washington policy community, serving most recently
the 104th Congress as press aide to freshman Rep. George Radanovich
(R-CA). Fulk's experience includes an internship with U.S. Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA).
<P>
Fulk replaces Stuart Nolan, who will attend law school at the
Catholic University of America. Nolan will continue to share with
us his extensive knowledge of corporate philanthropy as a CRC
adjunct fellow.
<P>
<B>Interns Gain Big Experience</B> 
<P>
Capital Research Center was fortunate this summer to have three
dedicated student interns. Jennifer J. Waite, a political science
major at Georgetown College in Kentucky, served a six-week internship
with CRC's new communications department. We are grateful to the
Fund for American Studies which supported her internship with
us. We are equally grateful to the Charles Koch Foundation for
providing CRC with two of its Koch Fellows. Eliot Jamison, an
economics and philosophy major at Columbia, and Boris Shor, an
international affairs major at Princeton, ably assisted our research
staff in preparing our annual <I>Patterns in Corporate Philanthropy</I>
and a forthcoming book on environmental groups. Each also authored
an independent study for future CRC publications. Jamison's study
examines the effect of the proposed flat tax on charitable giving.
Shor's study explores the impact of consumer advocacy groups on
international trade issues.
<P><a name="heats"></a>
<B>CRC <a href="/crc/about/pubs.html">Publications</a> Hot Off the Presses</B> 
<P>
Capital's efforts to affect more responsible philanthropy made
dramatic headway this summer. Monthly newsletters set the tempo
for many public policy debates in the media and in Congress. We
expect these studies to become even more effective, because we
began distributing them to all conservative members of Congress.
And as always, Capital's single-subject books continue to provide
in-depth coverage of the forces influencing the nation's social
philosophy. (Already in the first seven months of 1995 our book
sales have exceeded 1994 sales.) Here are the some of the highlights
of the summer's publications.
<P>
The July <I><a href="/crc/trends/">OT</a></I> looked at the heavily politicized agenda of
an organization that ought to be a model of nonprofit community
service -- the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In recent
years, however, the organization has dramatically changed and
expanded its activities to promote political advocacy of public
policies at odds with a free society. The National Trust fights
legal and public relations battles against commercial expansion
that creates jobs and builds the tax base for local communities.
And it does this with the help of taxpayer dollars. In an unprecedented
challenge to the Trust's appropriation of federal funds (which
accounts for 20 percent of its $33 million budget), the House
this summer voted to phase-out funding for the trust over two
years.
<P>
Professor James T. Bennett continued his expos&eacute; of the
American Cancer Society in the July <I><a href="/crc/ap/">Alternatives</a></I>. The report
revealed how ACS utilizes federal funds to lobby for higher taxes
on tobacco, rather than educate smokers about health risks. The
report also related financial mismanagement by the society's state
officials. Weeks after this newsletter hit the streets, several
of the officials spotlighted by <I>Alternatives</I> were reassigned,
and another was arrested for forgery.
<P>
Last spring CRC released <I><a href="/crc/books/neighbor.html">The Rise of the Nanny State</a></I>, visiting
fellow Tom Holt's history of the consumer movement. The report
is a startling account of how Ralph Nader's organizations form
an iron triangle with trial lawyers and federal agency bureaucrats
to put a choke-hold on consumer choice and individual responsibility.
Holt shows how this relationship has turned America into a &quot;nanny
state.&quot; The author appeared on many talk shows to discuss
how the federal government interferes with Americans' lives, and
he often debated representatives of the consumerists movement
that he profiled. During one memorable appearance, Holt coaxed
a US PIRG representative to agree that it is a good idea to make
public the financial relationships among these three groups.
<P>
Clinton administration officials at the U.S. Information Agency
(USIA) carefully read CRC's report on the federal government's
academic exchange program, <I><a href="/crc/books/fulbrit.html">The Fulbright Program After 50 years.</a></I>
Facing intense pressure from congressional budget-cutters, USIA
officials convened several formal meetings to discuss what they
called &quot;The Gayner Report,&quot; CRC author Jeffrey Gayner's
recommendations for reduced U.S. funding and increased private
and foreign support for the student and scholar exchange program.
The death of former Arkansas Sen. J. William Fulbright one week
before the report was released also heightened interest in the
study.
<P>
Finally, the business community sat up and took notice of <I>Patterns
VIII</I> after House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) wrote CEOs
of the Forbes 250 companies we study and questioned whether their
corporate giving was indeed pro-business. The side effects of
the Leader's much-publicized letter generated a remarkable amount
of publicity and howls of protest from Ralph Nader, <I>The Washington
Post</I>, Hillary Clinton and liberal members of Congress. We
knew we had hit our target! Since then there has been an increase
in cooperation from corporations releasing their giving information
to us. Several of the companies and advocacy groups have even
asked CRC how they can reform their giving practices and improve
their rating. American Airlines and the Nature Conservancy are
among those who have contacted CRC.
<P>
<a name="lagacy"></a>
<B>Provide a Legacy for Enlightened Giving</B> 
<P>
One of Capital Research Center's best selling books, <I><a href="/crc/books/pdi.html">The Great
Philanthropists and the Problem of Donor Intent</a>
</I>, studies how
the last wishes of yesterday's great philanthropists are less
and less a factor in the giving philosophy of their foundations
today. Careful estate planning, however, can ensure that a donor's
intentions will be honored.
<P>
By carefully thinking through giving objectives, pre-determined
gifts to groups like CRC can benefit donors as much as the beneficiary.
Such a gift to Capital accomplishes several worthwhile objectives.
Not only does it ensure that your bequest will be used as you
wish, but it provides resources enabling Capital to promote informed
giving practices; educate policy makers and opinion leaders about
nonprofit advocacy groups; and highlight the real achievements
of individual charity and the liabilities of much professional
philanthropy. Further, such a gift reduces your estate tax burden
by providing a charitable deduction equal to the value of the
bequest at the time of your death.
<P>
<I>Types of Bequests</I> 
<P>
Bequests are provision made in your will or living trusts that
specifically set forth the portion or actual dollar amount that
you wish transferred to a charity after death.
<P>
A <B>general bequest</B> is a gift that is payable from the general
assets of your estate. The usual general bequest directs that
a certain sum of money be paid to Capital Research Center.
<P>
A <B>specific bequest</B> gives a particular item or real or personal
property to CRC. For example, &quot;I direct that 5,000 shares
of XYZ Corporation stock be transferred to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>residuary bequest</B> provides CRC with the remainder of
your estate after all of your debts, expenses and taxes have been
paid and all general and specific bequests satisfied. For example,
&quot;I direct that all (or a specific percent) of the rest, residue
and remainder of my estate be given to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>contingent bequest</B> makes CRC a beneficiary of you estate
only when designated beneficiaries fail to survive you. For example,
&quot;If any of the above-named beneficiaries should predecease
me or no longer exist, I direct that the share of the beneficiary
be transferred to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>bequest by codicil</B> allows people who have completed their
will to make a bequest to CRC without rewriting the entire will.
For example, &quot;I, (your name), a resident of (your address),
make this codicil to my last will and testament executed by me
on (date). I hereby modify and amend my last will and testament
as follows: (enter a type of bequest as suggested above). Except
as my last will and testament is expressly modified or amended
by the codicil, I ratify and reaffirm my last will and testament
in its entirety.&quot; This codicil then must be signed by you
and witnessed in accordance with the laws of your state.
<P>
These are just a few of the possible choices available to individuals
who want to continue to help causes they believe worthy. All of
the above examples and suggested language are provided by CRC
for informational purposes only. But you can learn more by contacting

<h2>The American Cancer Society</h2>
<p>
<h3>Feeding at the Tax Trough</h3>
<p>
<b>By Dr. James T. Bennett</b>
<p>
In recent years, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has become increasingly active in politics.  Some of its state-level affiliates have lobbied for increases in state tobacco taxes, only to have the new tax revenues earmarked to themselves and their political allies.  This has clearly detracted from the ACS's mission of providing services to cancer victims.  Donors to the ACS must ask themselves why they should continue to support an organization that is increasingly political and funded by tax dollars.
This article examines how ACS state divisions in Massachusetts and Arizona have sought and received government funds.
<p>
<h3>ACS's Old Policy:<br>
No Tax Dollars</h3>
For almost 20 years, the American Cancer Society (ACS), as a matter of policy, refused government support.  Although the ACS had sought and obtained federal funds in the past, on November 11, 1978, ACS's Board of Directors adopted a resolution known as Financial Policy 19:
<ul>
<li>"RESOLVED: that acceptance of federal, state, or local governmental funds by the American Cancer Society directly or indirectly be discontinued as soon as practicable;
<li>FURTHER RESOLVED: that to accomplish the above, the following course of action be taken:
<li>1. No new tax-funded program is to be authorized.
<li>2. Divisions [of ACS] that can withdraw from existing arrangements without severe repercussions should do so as soon as feasible.
<li>3. Where Divisions have contractual or strong obligations to continue joint programs, they may continue to do so but should look for ways to phase out such arrangements gradually.  No obligation should exceed five years.
<li>4. Co-sponsorship of activities may continue provided it does not require the Society to accept federal, state or local governmental funds."1
</ul>
The reasons for this ironclad prohibition were explained by Lane Adams, ACS's executive vice president, in the ACS's annual report the following year: "Freely contributed dollars are simply not the same as tax dollars.  The need to win public support every year, year after year, imposes an important discipline on the Societya need to keep the public informed and involved.  It's a myth that government programs are the heavy artillery in social improvement because they're often more generously financed."2
After adopting Financial Policy 19, the ACS repeatedly emphasized its stance.  For instance, in the book, Crusade: The Official History of the American Cancer Society, published in 1987, author Walter Ross stated that "The Society is supported entirely by private donations. . . .  The Society accepts no money from federal, state, or local government.  Nor does it participate in jointly funded research or other activities with any government agency."  Ross claimed that because ACS fundraising was conducted by volunteers and "contributions are generally small, averaging about $10 . . . , this extraordinarily broad base of support frees the ACS of obligation to any individual, group, or foundation."3
Both Adams and Ross were correct to note that private donations are inherently different from taxpayer funds.  Government money inevitably carries restrictions on its use.  Moreover, reliance on tax dollars requires a charity to be involved in the political arenaan activity that necessarily detracts from its charitable mission.  And unlike private contributions, the quest for tax dollars does not require a charity to convince the public that its activities are worthy of support.
The ACS's policy against accepting taxpayer funds was commendable.  Unfortunately, that policy turned out to be expendable.
<p>
<h3>ACS's New Policy:<br>
"If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em"</h3>
During the 1980s, two events made ACS officials reconsider the ban on accepting tax money:
<ul>
<li>Through intense political advocacy, the AIDS lobby was able to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars from the government to assist AIDS victims and educate the public about AIDS.  Despite IRS regulations that limit nonprofit lobbying, the AIDS lobby's advocacy was largely ignored.  Other old-line health charities, most notably the American Lung Association, also became highly proficient at obtaining government funds without losing tax-exempt status.  (See Dr. James T. Bennett, "Health Charity Lobbying: Imitating the AIDS Movement," Alternatives in Philanthropy, December 1994.)4
<li>Second, and more importantly, rising competition among health charities for increased funding dramatically lowered the rate of growth in contributions to the ACS.  During most of the 1980s, the ACS saw double-digit percentage increases in its yearly income.  But in 1990, the ACS raised only 2.8 percent more than in 1989, causing considerable concern among ACS executives.5  If private contributions could not keep pace with rising expectations, the ACS would have to follow other health charities and feed at the tax trough.
</ul>
In 1993, a decision was effectively made to quietly abandon Financial Policy 19.  This is apparent in ACS president Reginald Ho's 1993 report to the board of directors: "One of the barriers to growth and health in the Society has been flat fund raising. . . .  A situation has arisen in certain states, namely, California and Massachusetts, in which a high excise tax on tobacco was lobbied for by the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the American Heart Association jointly.  The tax was passed, and millions of dollars were released. . . .  The Lung Association and the Heart Association competed for these programs.  However, the ACS Division was not allowed to compete for funds. . . .  New sources of funds are becoming available which did not exist in the 1970s.  Perhaps it is time for a paradigm change in this area of policy."6
Indeed, the ACS's Executive Committee had already taken up the issue of abandoning Financial Policy 19 so that state and local tax funds could be accepted: "The Society recognizes that state and local health departments are sources of indirect funding through privately operated programs and will look with greater favor on the acceptance of funding through these programs, with the flexibility and discretion they offer, than on the acceptance of direct government funding" (emphasis added).7  In other words, nonprofit intermediaries could channel state and local tax dollars to the ACS so that the organization could still publicly proclaim that it did not accept government funds while discreetly doing so.
<p>
<h3>Massachusetts' Question 1 Referendum</h3>
In 1992, anti-smoking activists in Massachusetts succeeded in raising state cigarette taxes through a referendum called Question 1.  A 25 cents-per-pack tax increase took effect on January 1, 1993.  Proponents expected the tax to generate about $176,000,000 annually in revenues, $80,000,000 dollars of which would be earmarked for anti-smoking programs run by government agencies and nonprofit organizations.  In addition, $17,900,000 would support a media campaign and millions more would be distributed to local health departments that would award grants and contracts to anti-smoking groups.
The Massachusetts referendum closely mirrored a tobacco-tax initiative in Colorado, described in detail in "The National Cancer Institute and Colorado's Project ASSIST" (Dr. James T. Bennett, Alternatives in Philanthropy, February 1996).  Candace Pierce-Lavin, an ACS-Massachusetts employee, helped spearhead the referendum under the auspices of a front group called the Massachusetts Coalition for a Healthy Future.  According to the Boston Globe, "Candace Pierce-Lavin . . . said [that] her group of 200 or more health and professional associations will keep the pressure on Beacon Hill [the Massachusetts legislature] to make sure the funds are spent as proposed in the petition [i.e., given to anti-smoking groups].  'The coalition will stay together after the campaign and aggressively lobby the legislature,' Pierce-Lavin said."8
The Massachusetts Department of Health was charged with awarding grants and contracts to anti-smoking groups.  The Boston Globe described Dr. Gregory Connolly, a state health department official who helped organize the referendum, as a "strident antismoking activist:" "Connolly and his associates at the Department of Health have brought aboard many of the individuals and institutions that helped them pass the referendum" by making "grants for dozens of projects intended to batter smokers into submission. . . ."9
<p>
<h3>ACS-Massachusetts' "Quitline":<br>
Make-Work for Anti-Smoking Activists</h3>
One such grant, in the amount of $800,000, was given to ACS-Massachusetts to operate a smoking "Quitline."10  A copy of the grant, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows the Quitline to be a bloated bureaucracy.  The contract calls for three telephone "counselors," each paid $26,000 per year,who offer advice to smokers.  Assisting them are two "screeners/data entry" personnel, each paid $20,000, to screen callers and record demographic data.
But in addition to these five, the grant also calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>Program Manager at $55,000;
<li>Program Director at $43,500;
<li>Supervisor at $33,800;
<li>Promotion Coordinator at $28,000;
<li>Assistant Program Director at $25,000;
<li>Data Manager at $28,000;
<li>Office Manager at $22,000;
<li>Administrative Assistant at $22,000;
<li>Secretary/Receptionist at $18,000;
<li>Finance Coordinator/Payroll employee at $22,000.
</ul>
In addition, 12 percent is added for payroll taxes and another 13 percent for fringe benefits.  More telling, however, are those slated for the positions.  According to the contract, the Program Manager position "will be carried out by Candace Pierce-Lavin, ACS' Director of Tobacco Control and Government Affairs.  Ms. Pierce-Lavin has been with ACS since 1982, has played a leadership role in the coalition that secured passage of the Question 1 Referendum, and is extremely knowledgeable about tobacco control and smoking cessation issues."  But Ms. Pierce-Lavin's only "qualification" appears to be that she "recently conducted a site visit to the California Quitline, where she consulted at length with the Director, and with key staff members, and observed the Quitline in operation."
The contract also specifies that Karen Zweig, J.D., fill the Program Director position.  Ms. Zweig's credentials include "building inter-agency collaborations" (i.e., forming political coalitions) and "[visiting] the California Quitline to learn about their [sic] operation."
Obviously, the Quitline is a "make-work" project for ACS employees and anti-smoking activists.  Considering the hundreds of millions of dollars that federal, state, and local governmentsas well as private sourcesalready spend on anti-smoking programs each year, the Quitline is redundant.  And given the severity of the nation's cancer epidemic, surely more effective uses for $800,000 could be found, such as free mammograms for low-income women.11
<p>
<h3>Arizona's Tobacco Tax Initiatives</h3>
In 1994, the head of ACS-Arizona, Matt Madonna, organized a coalition to collect petition signatures to place a cigarette tax increase, known as Proposition 200, on the state ballot.  ACS-Arizona contributed $24,000 to the initiative, which voters passed in November.  As in California, the increased revenues, estimated at about $90,000,000 annually, were partly earmarked for groups such as ACS-Arizona.  The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) was charged with distributing grants and contracts to nonprofit groups for educational and research purposes.12
Since ACS-Arizona and the ADHS worked together to pass the cigarette tax increase, their continuing collaboration is not surprising.  What is surprising is how closely the two operate.
<p>
<h3>ACS-Arizona:<br>
Fundraising with Tax Dollars</h3>
A January 30, 1996 "Memorandum of Understanding" between ACS-Arizona and the ADHS discloses how ACS-Arizona obtains taxpayer support.13  Ostensibly, ACS-Arizona and ADHS operate a joint project, officially administered by ADHS, called the "Women's Cancer Control Project."14  But the memorandum specifies "five core areas" of concern for ACS-Arizona that go far beyond the control of women's cancer.  These are: "Breast Cancer, Tobacco Use Reduction, Fundraising, Resources and Information, and Volunteer Involvement."  To support ACS-Arizona in these areas, ADHS's Women's Cancer Control Project has "[designated] an ADHS staff person to participate in activities of the ACS, including . . . fundraising efforts [and] other areas agreeable to both parties" (emphasis added).
Why should a state agency assign a tax-paid employee to assist in ACS-Arizona's fundraising?  Moreover, the memorandum specifies that "The ADHS will promote reciprocal assistance from local ADHS funded agencies to their ACS Regional offices in volunteer recruitment and ACS fundraising as feasible and appropriate" (emphasis added).
At issue is whether the government should give preferential treatment to one nonprofit organization over others that address health and other problems.  More fundamentally, should the government use taxpayers' money to raise money and recruit volunteers for a nonprofit?
<p>
<h3>ACS-Arizona:<br>
A Poor Steward of Donations</h3>
There is ample evidence that ACS-Arizona is a poor steward of the donations it receives.  A January 1995 expos on ACS-Arizona by John Dougherty, an investigative reporter at the Phoenix New Times, found that the organization spent $3,600,000 in 1994 on its own internal operations but only $47,000 on direct services for cancer victims.  According to Dougherty, between 1988 and 1994, total expenses at ACS-Arizona grew by 10 percent; salaries rose by 25 percent; and overhead costs increased by 7 percent.  But spending on direct services for cancer victims declined by 51 percent.15
Dougherty also revealed that anti-smoking advocates in Arizona, as in Massachusetts and California, lobbied against measures in the state legislature to redirect the new cigarette tax revenues away from their own coffers: "A battle has already erupted in the Arizona legislature over the spending formula, with some Republican leaders trying to have all the money placed into the general fund.  ACS-Arizona and other groups who supported the legislation have hired lobbyists to keep the money from being reallocated. . . .  There is no doubt that ACS-Arizona intends to fight to keep the current distribution of tobacco tax dollars as is.  'We will do whatever we can to make sure the funds . . . are used where they are supposed to go,' [ACS-Arizona's Matt] Madonna says."16
<p>
<h3>Should Donors Support the ACS?</h3>
The American Cancer Society has abandoned its long-standing prohibition against accepting taxpayer support.  By campaigning to raise state cigarette taxes and lobbying to earmark the new revenues to itself, it has found a way to revive its sagging financial fortunes.
By accepting tax money, the ACS is undermining the rationale for its own existenceindeed, the rationale for all charities: they do what neither government nor the profit-making private sector can or will do.  But if the ACS already receives taxpayer support, why should contributors give generously to it?

<B>Introduction by Julie M. Taylor</B>
<DD><I>Today, women control 60 percent of the wealth in the United States.  Yet research has found that women donors 
have traditionally shown less interest than men in supporting national nonprofit organizations that promote changes in 
public policy.  With a growing number of women in the workforce as business owners, entrepreneurs, and executives, women 
are increasingly positioned to affect public policy through their charitable giving.
<DD>This issue features articles by four women who serve in key positions at private foundations: Ethelmae 
Humphreys, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Humphreys Foundations; Heather R. Higgins, Director of The 
Randolph Foundation; Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of the Anschutz Family Foundation; and 
Kristen A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation.  We asked them to discuss why 
their foundations support public-policy organizations and initiatives.  Specifically, we asked:
<UL>
<LI>With so many competing needs for foundation support, why does your foundation award grants to 
public-policy organizations?
<LI>How do these grants help your foundation fulfill its mission?
<LI>If your foundation supports direct-service charities, how does this relate to your public-policy giving?
<LI>What factors cause you to reject public-policy grant proposals?
<LI>What issues do you believe public-policy groups have not sufficiently addressed?
</UL>

<B>Ethelmae Humphreys
<BR>Chairman of the Board and CEO
<BR>The Humphreys Foundations</B>
<P>
<DD>The several foundations created by the Humphreys 
family have as a key part of their mission the demonstration 
of the superiority of a voluntary society over a political 
society.  Over 60 percent of our funding goes to 
market-oriented public-policy groups that are helping to promote a 
society of free and responsible individuals.
<DD>We have for many years supported the Foundation 
for Economic Education, which publishes the monthly 
journal <I>The Freeman</I>.  Other major recipients are the 
market-liberal Cato Institute, the Institute for Humane Studies, 
and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation.  We are 
also a major supporter of the National Right to Work 
Legal Defense Foundation.  We believe each of these is 
doing important yet unique work to promote a free society.
<DD>Other public-policy grant recipients include the 
Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, 
Advocates for Self-Government, the Center for Independent 
Thought, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Consumer Alert, 
the Critical Review Foundation, the Discussion Club, 
Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Free 
Enterprise Institute's debate project, the Federalist Society, the 
Future of Freedom Foundation, the Heartland Institute, the 
Institute for Justice, the Institute for Policy Innovation's 
tax action analysis, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the 
National Endowment for Liberty, New York 
University's Austrian Economics program, the Reason Foundation, 
the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, the U.S. Term 
Limits Foundation and, of course, the Capital Research 
Center, which provides valuable insight into philanthropic activity.
<DD>We support some direct-service charities (mostly 
local), but only those that do not receive funding from 
government tax revenues.  That is the first stipulation of all our giving. 
 Most of this giving is done anonymously.  Recipients 
are generally charities that serve young people and 
families, from scouting and &quot;Y&quot;-type organizations to direct 
assistance to a young quadriplegic who inspires young people 
to take responsibility for themselves.  Each year we 
also provide local elementary school children with 
educational materials about the effects of smoking.
<DD>Over the years, we have supported a few 
direct-service groups that we later discovered were accepting 
government money.  When we learned that the local theater group 
had accepted funds from a state agency, we turned down 
support for its expansion project.  At our urging, the 
theater board changed its bylaws to exclude government funding. 
 But in many cases, we've had to cut off support.  We 
gave to the local Girl Scouts until we learned it was 
accepting volunteer services from a tax-supported agency.  We 
had also supported with a sizable gift the local biennial 
international piano competition until I saw in the newspaper that 
it had received a grant from a state arts agency.
<HR>
<blockquote>I think those who favor a free society have spoken very convincingly 
on economic issues.  But we haven't paid enough attention to social 
issues such as welfare and poverty.</blockquote><HR>
<BR>
While we support very few bricks-and-mortar 
projects, we do not exclude them out-of-hand if they meet 
our general funding criteria.  We supported construction of 
the new Cato Institute building in Washington, D.C.  We 
are also supporting construction of a community center 
building in a small town where one of our businesses is located.
<DD>We generally reject public-policy grant proposals 
that don't seem timely or relevant to today's key issues.  But 
we try to help any organization that has a good business 
plan for promoting a worthwhile project.  It's interesting 
to watch new groups spring up in response to the 
changing constellation of public-policy concerns.  Our funding 
priorities have changed somewhat to accommodate 
these changes.
<DD>In public policy, I think those who favor a free 
society have spoken very convincingly on economic issues.  But 
we haven't paid enough attention to social issues such 
as welfare and poverty.  This is partly a shortcoming 
of academia in not researching this area sufficiently and in 
not communicating its findings to public-policy groups that 
can influence the media and public.  Ideally, the needy 
should be helped through private charity.  But do we have 
enough rigorous research to convince Americans that this is 
possible?
<P><a name="hea">
<B>Heather R. Higgins
<BR>Director
<BR>The Randolph Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Public-policy grantmaking is not a traditional area 
of charitable giving, in large measure because 
historically such efforts, having no defined beneficiary, would not 
have legally qualified as charitable.  But as times have 
changed such giving has come to be viewed as a proper domain 
of philanthropy, just as in roughly the same period our 
understanding of government has generally changed to 
encompass a much broader view of its proper tasks.  In 
contrast, &quot;government&quot; used to be a word that was always 
modified, as in &quot;federal government,&quot; &quot;family government,&quot; 
&quot;church government,&quot; or &quot;school government,&quot; because 
different spheres of life were thought to be best governed at 
different levels and in different ways.
<DD>If the primary purpose of philanthropy is to alleviate 
the sufferings of mankind and to do what we can to improve 
life on earth, then it is important not only to directly 
assist individuals but to help create conditions which will 
help them to help themselves.  This is the purpose of 
public-policy grantmakinga purpose that should be of 
equal interest to citizens of both sexes.  Much of the 
original impetus for such grantmaking came from those who felt 
that government should and could solve our problems.  In 
fact, most public-policy advocacy and lobbying by charities 
is based on that assumption.
<DD>In recent years, however, a contingent of 
grantmakers has become convinced that well-meaning but 
misguided attempts by government to remedy problems it has not 
fully <HR>
<blockquote>
Public policy itself has not only come to affect whole new spheres of 
daily life but has often done so in ignorance. . . .  Unless those errors 
are corrected, in the long run all the direct charity in the world will not 
keep our society whole.<HR>
</blockquote>
<BR>
understood has caused more harm than good, and that 
to remove government-created obstacles to effective 
charity is the first obligation of citizens who wish to improve 
the human condition.  Public-policy grantmaking, done 
properly, is an application of the Confucian maxim that if 
you give a hungry man a fish he will be hungry again 
tomorrow, but if you teach him to fish he will be fed for life.
<DD>That leveraging principle is important to The 
Randolph Foundation's grantmaking, particularly since we are a 
small grantmaker.  In almost all our public-policy 
grantmaking we seek to encourage those attitudes and principles 
which lead to the right and necessary conduct of our citizens.  
We believe that good work has been and is being done in 
the realms of economic and regulatory policy, and that the 
area which currently needs our attention is the cultural 
underpinnings of free and democratic societies.
<DD>Though public policy is our primary area of focus, we 
do occasionally support direct-service organizations.  
When we do so it is generally because their work is 
extraordinary, and we lend support to help them &quot;franchise&quot; their ideas.  
A more likely approach for us, however, is to support 
work that can be used by a variety of local service providers 
to make their own efforts more effective.
<DD>In our view, public-policy grantmaking is 
particularly important at this time, because public policy itself has 
not only come to affect whole new spheres of daily life but 
has often done so in ignorance and in violation of those 
central principles of human nature and natural law which are 
the cornerstones of our society.  Unless those errors are 
corrected, in the long run all the direct charity in the world 
will not keep our society whole.
<P><a name="sue">
<B>Sue Anschutz-Rodgers
<BR>President and Executive Director
<BR>The Anschutz Family Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Although the Anschutz Family Foundation focuses 
primarily on community organizations, we do make 
some grants to public-policy organizations.  We recognize 
that public policy affords us the opportunity to invest at 
the &quot;macro&quot; level.  The interplay between business, 
government, and the nonprofit sector can be best addressed through philanthropic contributions to public policy.
<DD>Our foundation's goal is to promote individual 
self-sufficiency and traditional values.  Over the past 
four decades, government has grown to become the 
principle provider of human, educational, and health services.  
We believe that the best delivery of these necessities is 
through families, churches, and organizations at the 
community level.  Government as a primary resource provider has 
too often caused a retraction of the vital roles of 
voluntary institutions.  Further, charitable investments bring a 
much greater return if directed through community-based 
organizations instead of through government.
<DD>However, we are challenged to understand how 
devolution will affect services to those who are truly in need.  
We believe that no greater resource exists than that of 
the collective capacity of our citizens to serve their 
communities.  But our convictions for limited government, a 
thriving free-market economy, and a compassionate and civil 
society require a successful balance of interests.  
Recognizing historical imbalances, businesses must become more 
responsible.
<DD>Public-policy investments allow us to keep a 
larger perspective.  Americans living in the West often 
decry Washington as myopic, which in some cases is true.  
But state and local governments have also expanded
their domains, and must be reckoned with.  With our focus on 
the community level, it is often difficult to keep abreast 
of national and state issues.  Our support of public 
policy keeps us alerted to legislative, executive, and 
judicial actions at all levels of government.
<DD>What causes foundations to hesitate about investing 
in efforts to affect public policy?  Generally, it is due to 
other questions that arise when contemplating such grants: 
How many think tanks are really necessary?  How many 
high-priced speakers are needed to tour college campuses?  
How many Washington-based public-policy groups rely on 
glossy proposals with no substantiating documentation on 
requested funding or expected results?  How many 
groups champion causes beyond objectivity and common sense?
<DD>Sometimes our being so far from Washington helps 
to filter out the noise.  The question all of us must 
ask ourselves is how do we better assist individual citizens 
as they go about their daily liveslives based on work, 
family, and community?  We believe in the importance 
of public policy, whether it serves to check the growth 
of government or to stimulate debate and discourse.

<B>Kristen A. Avansino
<BR>President and Executive Director
<BR>The E.L. Wiegand Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Contemporary philosophers, politicians, and 
philanthropists are plagued by the poignant questions, &quot;Where are 
we going?  How will we get there?&quot;  Too often, they 
are beguiled by the parlance of the 
day&quot;beyond postmodernism,&quot; &quot;spiritual acedia,&quot; &quot;quantum 
physics,&quot; &quot;social capital,&quot; &quot;devolution revolution,&quot; &quot;cybertots.&quot;  
As the millennium closes, prophetic cynicism often prevails.
<DD>In contrast, at the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, 
the poignant words of James Joyce resonate: &quot;The now, 
the here, through which all future plunges to the past.&quot;  The Foundation is the living legacy and embodiment of 
our benefactor, Edwin L. Wiegand.  As President and 
Executive Director, I view the Foundation's expedition 
through his enduring eyes.  His life-vision embraced a reverence 
for the sacred, for democracy, for free-market principles, 
and an adherence to the work ethic.
<DD>In 1996, this oracle's prescience remains constant.  
Public-affairs grants, one of the five areas that comprise 
the Foundation's mission, exemplify the heightened use of 
our Benefactor's Litmus Test.  Components of the test 
include fiscal responsibility, synergy of mission, project 
uniqueness, geographic parameters, administrative utility, 
societal impact, accountability, other funding sources, 
and board composition.
<DD>Historically, our Foundation's public-affairs grants 
have reflected a strict adherence to E.L. Wiegand's 
principles, and in recent years these grants have totaled nine percent 
of our philanthropic effort.  The average number of 
grants reviewed has decreased while the representative 
grant awarded has increased.  Geographic preference has 
shifted from Washington, D.C. to the West, with special 
preference assigned to small, exemplary, less-institutional 
organizations.  Since 1993, we have awarded occasional 
multi-year grants and have given special consideration to 
projects supporting the emerging democracies in Eastern and 
Central Europe.  Increasingly, the Foundation 
receives unsolicited letters of inquiry, though we currently elect 
to initiate more proposals for Trustee review.
<DD>The preservation of donor intent is serious business.  
As President, I strive to achieve the magical coalescence 
of dreams and due diligence.  Winston Churchill once 
said that &quot;money melts.&quot;  However, the Wiegand 
professional motto is &quot;money melds&quot; with endeavors that are worthy 
in the eyes of our beloved benefactor.<BR>

<h2>Tax-Funded Politics</h2>
<HR>
<P>
<small>Reformers in Congress want to strengthen laws restricting tax-funded
politicsthe practice of federal departments and agencies awarding
grants to nonprofit organizations that use the money to lobby
for higher taxes, more government, and more grants for nonprofits.
No one knows exactly how much is spent on political advocacy of
the estimated $39 billion that the federal government gives to
nonprofits each year. But the Capital Research Center and other
groups have disclosed many questionable grants. Although there
are many laws that restrict such activity, they have not been
well enforced.
<P>
This issue contains two articles that examine grants made by
the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. James T. Bennett, a professor
of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia,
and Thomas J. DiLorenzo, a Senior Fellow at the Capital Research
Center and professor of economics at Loyola College in Baltimore,
discuss how tax dollars intended for disease research and public
health education have been diverted into political advocacy. These
articles should serve as a wake-up call for Congress, taxpayers,
and nonprofit donors.

<h3>The National Cancer Institute and Colorado's Project ASSIST</h3>
<P>
by Dr. James T. Bennett 
<P>

<P>
The July 1995 issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> (&quot;Project
ASSIST: Image and Reality&quot;) described how the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), part of the federal government's National Institutes
of Health, has provided anti-smoking organizations with as much
as $100 million in federal tax revenues to lobby for higher tobacco
taxes at the state level. The NCI's Project ASSIST, the American
Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention, is the
major funding vehicle for this campaign.
<P>
Project ASSIST was largely spearheaded by the American Cancer
Society (ACS), the nation's largest and best-known health charity.
Officially launched in 1991, ASSIST ostensibly supports grassroots
groups that organize public education campaigns to discourage
smoking. This follow-up article examines the actual operation
of ASSIST in the state of Colorado. It shows how federal funds
were illegally used to promote a ballot initiative to raise the
state's tobacco tax.
<P>
Far more is known about operations of ASSIST in Colorado than
in other states where ASSIST grants have been awarded because
a lawsuit was recently filed against the Colorado Department of
Health, the agency charged with disbursing ASSIST funds in that
state. The suit alleged the improper use of ASSIST funds and illegal
lobbying by state health department officials. Documents related
to this case provide revealing information about how ASSIST was
developed in Colorado, its activities, and the personalities involved.
<P>
What emerges is a complex and twisted tale: front groups were
created to provide a smokescreen for lobbying; state bureaucrats
used state offices to facilitate lobbying; and positions of authority
were sold, with those hoping to acquire a share of the projected
tax revenue paying &quot;front money&quot; to secure their positions.
<P>
<B>Colorado's Amendment 1: Self-Interest Disguised as Public Health</B>

<P>
Colorado was in many ways an ideal state from the perspective
of those organizing Project ASSIST. For more than a decade, anti-smoking
groups had been active, and one of their prime objectives had
been to raise tobacco taxes. Colorado's constitution also allowed
citizen-initiated referenda. Against this backdrop, the National
Cancer Institute awarded the Colorado Department of Health (CDH)
an ASSIST contract, providing $6,976,683 for the period September
20, 1991 to September 29, 1998. The CDH would in turn provide
ASSIST funds to local anti-smoking groups.
<P>
On November 19, 1993, anti-smoking activists filed an &quot;initiative
regarding Tobacco Taxes&quot; with the Colorado Department of
State. If the initiative passed, taxes on cigarettes would be
raised on July 1, 1995 by 50 cents per pack and taxes on cigars
and smokeless tobacco would be increased by 50 percent of the
manufacturer's list price.
<P>
Purportedly, the goal of anti-smoking activists was to reduce
smoking by 43 percent in Colorado. If improved public health were
the sole objective, however, the disincentive of higher tobacco
prices should have been sufficient. But substantial tax revenuesan
estimated $130 million per yearwere to be distributed as follows:
<UL>
<LI>$65 million to medical professionals and hospitals for health
care of the needy;
<LI>$39 million to anti-smoking activists and health charities
for educational programs to reduce tobacco use;
<LI>$13 million to academics and public interest groups for research
on tobacco use.
</UL>

<P>
Another $13 million was to be divided among municipalities, counties,
economic development initiatives, and an 11-member citizens' commission.
This would be composed of individualsmost likely health charity
officials, medical professionals, and anti-smoking activistswho
would oversee the disbursement of revenues. While they would be
unpaid, no doubt they would take many expense-account trips to
anti-smoking meetings held at pleasant venues in the U.S. and
abroad.
<P>
<B>The Fair Share For Health Committee and Colorado ASSIST</B>

<P>
In March of 1993, the Fair Share for Health Committee (FSFHC),
a 501(c)(4) lobbying organization, was created to promote the
tax initiative. As shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, its membership was essentially
a who's who of the Colorado hospital, medical, and health charity
professions. The overlap between FSFHC membership and membership
in Colorado ASSIST, a 501(c)(3) educational organization created
to receive Project ASSIST funds, is substantial. Colorado ASSIST's
executive committee included representatives of the American Cancer
Society, Colorado Department of Health, and the Coalition for
a Tobacco-Free Colorado (CTFC), a 501(c)(3) organization instrumental
in securing the ASSIST grant.
<P>
The activities of one anti-smoking activist, Arnold Levinson,
illustrate the ties between FSFHC and Colorado ASSIST. Levinson,
formerly an assistant city editor for the <I>Colorado Springs
Gazette</I>, served as a Colorado ASSIST consultant, helping &quot;extensively
in the design of Colorado ASSIST.&quot; He was also executive
director of FSFHC, and was thus in charge of promoting the tobacco
tax initiative.
<P>
Colorado ASSIST paid Levinson $50 per hour for his services under
an initial contract for 930 hours. Other contracts followedone
for $46,500 during the period 1992-1993 and another for $60 per
hour for the period 1993-1998. Thus, Colorado ASSIST, a federally
funded organization, paid Levinson while he organized the tax
initiative. It also reimbursed Levinson for travel costs to Grand
Junction and Durango, where he gave &quot;presentation[s] on tobacco
taxes.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Colorado</B> 
<P>
Another anti-smoking activist, Walter F. &quot;Snip&quot; Young,
served as director of Prevention Programs at the Colorado Department
of Health and was also the director of Colorado ASSIST. CDH's
&quot;Best and Final&quot; grant proposal to the NCI noted that
Young learned in 1987 of a possible ASSIST grant in Colorado:
&quot;[Young] informed the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Colorado,
which includes representatives of the American Heart Association
of Colorado and the American Lung Association. . . . In Spring
1988 . . . , Mr. Young convened a series of informal discussions
with the executive directors of ALA-Colorado and AHA-Colorado
to discuss their prospective roles in the project. As national
ASSIST planners disclosed information about the Project, Mr. Young
shared this information with the voluntary health agencies through
formal discussions with an ad hoc committee of the [CTFC]. .
.&quot;
<P>
CTFC's 501(c)(3) status would seem to preclude political activity,
but this restriction was ignored in the early stages of the tax
initiative. On January 6, 1993, Young and Peter Bialick, president
of the anti-smoking group GASP of Colorado, sent a letter on CTFC
stationary to anti-smoking activists. It said that &quot;The Coalition
for a Tobacco-Free Colorado is on its way to placing a ballot
initiative to increase the state tobacco tax before the voters
in 1994. We need your help to construct the language of the petition
[at a day-long retreat]. . . . Morning presentations will explain
the rationale for tobacco taxes and the successful experiences
of California and Massachusetts. The afternoon will be a work
session where we will discuss and agree on the principal objectives
of the petition language. . . .&quot;
<P>
A main topic of the retreat was money. Participants approved an
organizational structure for promoting the initiative that included
a board of directors and an executive committee charged with conducting
campaign operations. Organizations that wanted to obtain a seat
on the boardand thus influence in determining what groups would
receive the projected tax revenuewere required to pay $10,000.
<P>
Significantly, more than half the organizations on CTFC's initial
board were also members of the lobbying group Fair Share for Health
Committee (see Table 1, entries marked &#167;). Four other groups
involved in FSFHC were also affiliated with CTFC (Table 1, entries
marked ). By January 1993, CTFC had more than a dozen sponsors
or affiliated organizations who were also members of FSFHC. Thus,
for all intents and purposes, these two organizations were indistinguishable,
even though one was ostensibly a tax-deductible, tax-funded educational
group and the other a political lobbying organization.
<P>
<B>The National Cancer Institute</B> 
<P>
NCI was aware that the objective of Colorado ASSIST was to raise
state taxes and that federal funds would be used for this purpose.
Documents that the Colorado Department of Health submitted to
NCI clearly and repeatedly emphasize the tax theme:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>Colorado should &quot;increase economic incentives and taxation
to discourage the use of tobacco products;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;The price of tobacco products needs to be greatly increased
through taxes and/or sales-license fees;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;The Colorado ASSIST Alliance will work to increase public
knowledge of the need to increase the cigarette tax substantially;&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;Educational presentations will be made to all [areas] regarding
the need and current efforts to increase tobacco taxes;&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;Strategies to advocate increased tobacco taxes will be
incorporated into the ASSIST media plan;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;Information will be presented . . . regarding the rationale
and need for sales license fees on tobacco sales.&quot;
<P></ul>
Other CDH materials clearly show that ASSIST funds were used for
political activity. Expense reports submitted by Connie Acott,
an ASSIST consultant and founding board member of CTFC, to the
CDH note that Colorado ASSIST meetings concerning the &quot;tax
initiative&quot; and the &quot;coalition tax initiative&quot;
were held in August and November 1992. Another Colorado ASSIST
expense report refers to a meeting of the organization's &quot;Political
Advocacy Team,&quot; held on April 15, 1993.
<P>
<B>Tax Dollars Down the Drain</B> 
<P>
Organizations promoting the tax initiative lost little time in
obtaining ASSIST money from the CDH. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> is a partial list
of groups that received ASSIST contracts during 1993-1994. A comparison
of Tables 1 and 2 shows that substantial funds were given to organizations
involved in the Fair Share For Health's tax initiative.
<P>
How were these funds used? Recipients were required to complete
contract reimbursement forms and an &quot;Activity Matrix,&quot;
one of whose goals&quot;Economic Incentive to Decrease Tobacco
Use&quot;lists the following activities: &quot;Educate re excise
taxes,&quot; &quot;attend training,&quot; and &quot;coordinate
publicity/media.&quot; Activities related to the tax initiative
were reported on this form. Reports submitted by grant recipients
requesting payment are also revealing. They show that substantial
amounts were paid for activities that apparently involved very
little effort:
<UL>
<LI>The American Lung Association received $5,000 in October 1993
for having &quot;completed orientation and review of implementation
responsibilities for the Annual Action Plan&quot; and for &quot;[establishing]
recruitment and operating systems for Field Coordinator.&quot;
In November 1993, the ALA received $5,000 for exploring &quot;preparations
for a legislative breakfast.&quot; The following month, it received
$5,000 for identifying speakers to make &quot;presentations on
tobacco taxation,&quot; initiating &quot;development of a list
of influential contacts,&quot; and examining &quot;existing databases
and resource directories that identify Denver Metro tobacco youth
cessation resources;&quot;
<LI>Valley Wide Health Services received $2,083 in October 1993
for &quot;papers contacted/articles written.&quot; Similar amounts
were given in November and December 1993 for identifying &quot;community
groups&quot; and writing articles for newsletters;
<LI>The Weld County Health Department received $2,000 in December
1993 for having &quot;developed Action Plans&quot; and for attending
a CTFC meeting.
</UL>

<P>
ASSIST funds were also spent freely on business amenities:
<UL>
<LI>That Personal Touch Catering company received approximately
$300-$400 per month for catering Colorado ASSIST executive committee
and Alliance board meetings;
<LI>Nearly $5,000 was spent in 1993 to host a Colorado ASSIST
banquet;
<LI>Throughout 1990 and 1991, an average of $1,000 per month was
spent on temporary employees;
<LI>Ramada Inn was paid $1,055 to host a Colorado ASSIST board
meeting;
<LI>Nancy Salas, a CDH employee who often attended ASSIST training
sessions in Washington, was reimbursed $36.70 for a letter opener.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Politicking in the PICS</B> 
<P>
Petitioners for the tax initiative were organized in twelve cities
and regions, called &quot;Primary Intervention Communities&quot;
or &quot;PICs.&quot; Active in Aspen, Alamosa, Boulder, Colorado
Springs, Craig, Denver, Durango, Fort Collins, Grand Junction,
Greeley, Montrose, and Pueblo, their role was to raise funds for
the initiative and gather signatures. Additionally, 130 &quot;community
organizations&quot; throughout Colorado formed a coalition called
the Colorado ASSIST Alliance. Evidence of widespread lobbying
by these organizations can be found in the minutes of their meetings
and in newsletters used to communicate with and motivate the petitioners.
<P>
The Colorado ASSIST Alliance published its own newsletter using
ASSIST funds. In the March 1992 inaugural issue, it reported that
the American Cancer Society had contacted 120 individuals &quot;concerned
with tobacco control across the state . . . with a reminder to
urge their Representatives to achieve legislative passage of House
Bill 1239 Pat Sullivan's measure to add an additional 25 cents
tax on the purchase of a pack of cigarettes. . . . We urge everyone
to let your representatives know your feelings about this measure.&quot;
<P>
In the fifth issue (July 1993), ACS-Colorado's Madelyn Parker
praised the political activism of ASSIST participants in an article
entitled &quot;PICs Take on Policy Advocacy:&quot; &quot;Though
carefully nourished personal interaction at the state and local
levels, ASSIST alliance members who recently attended orientations
in the process of political advocacy are now working to educate
public policy makers about health and safety issues related to
tobacco.&quot;
<P>
The same issue carried another article by the Fair Share for Health
Committee's Arnold Levinson. Headlined &quot;To Get Rid of Tobacco,
TAX IT!,&quot; it described how a &quot;coalition of organizations
has now been formed to increase Colorado's tax on cigarettes .
. . and other tobacco products. Leading the effort is a broad
coalition of health organizations, including the largest voluntary
health agenciesthe American Lung Association, the American Cancer
Society, and the American Heart Association.&quot; The article
noted that more information about the initiative was available
from the FSFHC's Amanda O'Neill.
<P>
Colorado ASSIST's &quot;Annual Action Plan&quot; (AAP), submitted
to the National Cancer Institute in August 1993, explicitly stated
that politics was the organization's central focus. Under the
heading &quot;Year One Objectives,&quot; Colorado ASSIST announced
that &quot;By October 1994, a state bill will be introduced in
the Legislature to license tobacco sales, and active support for
the measure will come from businesses, labor, medical professionals,
educators, youth and the religious community. . . . By October
1994, policy advocacy will be provided to PIC representatives.&quot;
<P>
Arnold Levinson also made numerous presentations to PIC representatives
throughout the state, financed with ASSIST funds. The minutes
of a meeting of the Larimer County PIC, held June 9, 1993, note
that Levinson &quot;gave a presentation on the campaign his organization
[FSFHC] is heading to place a cigarette sales tax initiative on
the 1994 election ballot. . . . [FSFHC] is asking for our help
in collecting signatures on petitions.&quot; According to travel
expense reports that Levinson submitted to the Colorado Department
of Health for reimbursement, similar appearances were made in
June to PICs in Boulder and Pueblo.
<P>
<B>GASP of Colorado</B> 
<P>
One anti-smoking group which received ASSIST funds, GASP (Group
to Alleviate Smoking Pollution) of Colorado, offers insight into
how federal money was used to promote the tax initiative. As one
of the oldest and most energetic anti-smoking organizations in
the state, GASP's newsletter, <I>The Nonsmokers' Voice</I>, relentlessly
promoted the initiative. One issue contained the following articles:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>&quot;<I>Cigarette Tax Efforts Underway</I>. GASP of Colorado
is teaming up with other pro-health groups to put on the ballot
an initiative to increase Colorado's cigarette tax . . . under
the name Fair Share For Health Committee.&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;<I>President's Challenge to Our Members: One Completed
Petition Per Member</I>. I would like to ask each able-bodied
GASP member to help complete at least one petition.&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;<I>Contributions Needed</I>. Initiatives take much time
to organize. . . . [We] will contribute some money and in-kind
support. . . . Pitch in now with your contribution.&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;<I>Annual Meeting to Focus on Cigarette Tax Efforts</I>.
Candace Pierce-Lavin, the coordinator of the successful Massachusetts
cigarette tax campaign, will be GASP's special guest at our annual
meeting . . . this fall.&quot;
</ul><P>
<B>Two Questions</B> 
<P>
Despite the efforts of ASSIST-funded organizations, the Colorado
tobacco tax initiative was defeated by voters on November 8, 1994.
The story of the political campaign for Colorado's Amendment 1
raises two serious questions:
<P>
<ul><LI>Is it proper for the National Institutes of Health and its divisions,
including the National Cancer Institutewhose mission is to research
the causes of and to find cures for diseaseto divert millions
of dollars to advocacy group politics?
<P>
<li>Is it proper for health charities such as the American Cancer
Society, American Heart Association, and American Lung Association
to increasingly embrace politics while abandoning their traditional
mission of providing assistance to disease victims? Obviously,
when health charities use funds for political activities, fewer
resources are available for helping disease victims.

<h2>Tax Funded Politics</h2>
<HR>
<small>Reformers in Congress want to strengthen laws restricting tax-funded
politicsthe practice of federal departments and agencies awarding
grants to nonprofit organizations that use the money to lobby
for higher taxes, more government, and more grants for nonprofits.
No one knows exactly how much is spent on political advocacy of
the estimated $39 billion that the federal government gives to
nonprofits each year. But the Capital Research Center and other
groups have disclosed many questionable grants. Although there
are many laws that restrict such activity, they have not been
well enforced.
<P>
This issue contains two articles that examine grants made by
the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. James T. Bennett, a professor
of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia,
and Thomas J. DiLorenzo, a Senior Fellow at the Capital Research
Center and professor of economics at Loyola College in Baltimore,
discuss how tax dollars intended for disease research and public
health education have been diverted into political advocacy. These
articles should serve as a wake-up call for Congress, taxpayers,
and nonprofit donors.

<h3>The Centers for Disease Control and the American Lung Association</h3>
By Thomas J. DiLorenzo
<P>
The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which most
Americans think of as a federal agency that conducts research
and dispenses advice on disease, is heavily involved in funding
political advocacy. This article examines a $30,000 grant the
CDC recently awarded to the American Lung Association (ALA), the
oldest and one of the largest health charities in the U.S.
<P>
The grant supported the ALA's May 1993 conference, &quot;Seize
the Initiative: A National Training Conference for Increasing
Tobacco Excise Taxes Through Initiated Acts,&quot; one of several
recent ALA seminars designed to train anti-smoking activists in
how to lobby for higher tobacco taxes.1 The California Department
of Health also contributed $68,958 in state cigarette tax revenues.
<P>
A third co-sponsor was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a Princeton,
New Jersey-based private philanthropy that has spent tens of millions
of dollars promoting socialized medicine, including the ill-fated
Clinton health care plan. The Foundation had considerable influence
in the Clinton Administration's secret White House Health Care
Task Force. It has also funded efforts to enact broad-reaching
state-level health reforms compatible with the Clinton plan.2
<P>
<B>From Charity to Politics</B> 
<P>
The conference was organized by the staff of the ALA with assistance
from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. A Freedom of Information
Act inquiry to the CDC regarding the conference drew this response
from Lynn Armstrong, Assistant FOIA Officer: &quot;Program staff
stated that proceedings of the conference were not compiled. Also,
there were no handouts.&quot;3
<P>
In fact, there were handouts, and a considerable record of the
proceedings exists. These were obtained from a state public health
department official who attended the conference and who apparently
felt it was his duty to share this information with the taxpaying
public.
<P>
The overall theme of the conferencewhich underscores the direction
many health charities such as the ALA have taken in recent years was
announced on the first page of an ALA publication: &quot;Health
advocates assumed a new, sometimes treacherous, exhilarating and
definitely challenging role in the past decade. The genteel `Smoking
is bad for your health' posters were replaced by determined action
through legislation and the initiative process.&quot;4 In other
words, many health charities are no longer content with providing
services to disease victims and educating the public about health
issues. They are now committed to using the coercive power of
government to force Americans to adopt &quot;healthy&quot; lifestyles.
<P>
<B>The How-To's of Lobbying</B> 
<P>
One segment of the conference, &quot;Ingredients for Success,&quot;
featured several speakers who offered advice on how to organize
an effective statewide initiative campaign. Karen Rouse, vice
president for marketing and communications at the Massachusetts
division of the American Cancer Society (ACS), amused attendees
with &quot;war stories&quot; of her state's successful effort
to raise tobacco taxes. She emphasized that the initiative was
carefully designed to channel much of the estimated $120 million
in new tax revenues to anti-smoking organizations such as the
ACS.5
<P>
This strategy was virtually identical to one used in 1988, when
anti-smoking groups in California successfully promoted Proposition
99, an initiative to raise that state's tobacco taxes. As discussed
in the July 1994 <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Proposition
99 generated millions of dollars for anti-smoking organizations'
&quot;educational&quot; programs. Anti-smoking groups gave gifts
such as backpacks and gift certificates to high school students
who promised to quit smoking. The groups also spent tax revenues
earmarked for education on political campaigns aimed at enacting
local anti-smoking ordinances. When state legislators learned
of this, they reappropriated some of the revenues to medical care
for the needy.6
<P>
Another speaker, political campaign consultant Jack Nicholl, offered
tips on how to &quot;tap an emotional issue,&quot; the importance
of &quot;aggressive negative campaigning,&quot; and the use children
as an &quot;emotional symbol and message of the campaign.&quot;
As a key organizer of Proposition 99, Nicholl recalled that &quot;Press
events were held in child care centers. Children marched with
organizers.&quot;
<P>
Nicholl also explained steps taken to encourage lifestyle-tolerant
Californians to support Proposition 99: &quot;Early tobacco tax
polling showed that voters were not anti-smoking zealots and did
not support coercive measures to force smokers to stop. In fact,
supporters believed overwhelmingly that `smokers have a right
to smoke.'&quot; Consequently, &quot;leaders of the coalitionsuch
as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association
. . . put their own militant antismoking rhetoric on the shelf
for the duration of the campaign,&quot; and decided instead to
pitch their message as follows: &quot;We are not an anti-smoking
campaign. Adults can choose to smoke, but if they do, they must
pay their fair share of the costs associated with smoking.&quot;7
<P>
This approach was disingenuous in two ways. First, according to
ALA CEO John R. Garrison, the ALA's goal is to achieve a &quot;smoke-free
society&quot; through &quot;advocacy efforts,&quot; not to make
smokers to pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of health care costs.8
Second, contrary to Proposition 99 proponents, tobacco taxes already
more than cover the costs of health care for diseases attributable
to smoking, according to comprehensive studies by the Rand Corporation
and Congressional Research Service.9
<P>
Another speaker, Doug Barr, CEO of the Canadian Cancer Society,
suggested that U.S. health charities stop using their millions
of volunteers to provide direct services to disease victims and
instead employ them in political campaigns: &quot;If we are willing
to learn the political ropes and mobilize our volunteers to exercise
their political clout, our organizations can bring about significant
legislative change. . . .&quot;10
<P>
A representative from the polling firm of Abacus Associates, based
in Hatfield, Massachusetts, also made a presentation on political
polling intended &quot;to develop a strategy and message for winning.
. . . The purpose of polling is to help you develop and deliver
the most effective message for moving the voters you need to move
in order to win.&quot;11
<P>
Conference participants received numerous materials, including
the ALA's <I>Guidebook for State Action to Increase Tobacco Taxes</I>,12
a 124-page manual providing detailed information on coalition
building, petition drives, polling, and how to present one's case
to potential coalition members and the public. The <I>Guidebook</I>
also offers the successful tax-increase campaigns in California
and Massachusetts as models for other states and discusses how
anti-smoking activists in Florida recently celebrated that state's
increase in tobacco taxes. Revenues in Florida, the <I>Guidebook</I>
explains, will be used by anti-smoking groups to conduct door-to-door
leafleting, phone banking, public opinion polling, mail-in petition
efforts, training of anti-smoking activists, and fundraising (said
to be a &quot;high priority&quot;).
<P>
<B>A Tax-Funded Assault on Freedom</B> 
<P>
Anti-smoking organizations such as the ALA ignore the fact that
if smoking is specially taxed or prohibited because it involves
health risks, many other freedoms are in danger of being curtailed
or lost. After all, eating fatty foods, exercising too little
or too much, riding a bicycle without a helmet, and driving a
car also involve risks and may lead to illness, injury, or death.
It is a travesty that taxpayers are forced to support a political
movement that prohibits their freedom of choice.
<P>
Although the CDC's mission is to conduct disease research and
educate the public about health issues, its grant to the ALA was
used to teach the nuts and bolts of political organizing, a blatantly
illegal use of tax money. It is time that Congress investigated
the CDC's politicized grantmaking.

<TITLE>From Foster Care to Adoption: An Interview with Conna Craig -- CRC</TITLE>

<P>
<h2>From Foster Care to Adoption: An Interview with Conna Craig
</h2>
<I>America's state-run foster-care system is increasingly under
attack. Many complain that the system is woefully slow in placing
children into permanent adoptive homes and that it too often shifts
children from one temporary foster home to another. This, critics
charge, leaves children with a sense of rootlessness and without
normal bonds of familial love. Many also say that adoption into
permanent families is taking a back seat to long-term foster care.</I>
<P>
<I>It was not always this way. Until early in this century, adoption
was generally handled informally within communities and by private
charities that helped to place abandoned children and orphans
into stable, loving homes. This work has been largely supplanted
by a state-run, tax-funded foster-care system.</I>
<P>
<I>We recently interviewed Conna Craig, president of the Institute
for Children, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based private nonprofit,
to learn more about how we reached the current morass and what
can be done to revive the voluntary sector's role in adoption.
She advises governors, other policy makers and opinion leaders
both here and abroad on practical steps that can be taken to restructure
foster care and adoption. Adopted at age eight into a family that
has cared for 110 foster children, Ms. Craig believes that children
are better off in a permanent, loving family and that every child
deserves such a start in life. The Institute can be reached at

<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>There are currently some 50,000 children who the
courts have declared legally free to be adopted, yet who are still
in foster care. Why is this?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Fundamentally, because the notion has arisen that the
state can or should be a parent. There are three major reasons
for the demise of adoption. One is government involvement in what
was once a largely private endeavor. The second is an anti-adoption
bias that, with the help of the media, is taking on frightening
proportions. The third is what some call the culture of victimization.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Let's start with the firstgovernment involvement.</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Some people have an interest in perpetuating the current
system. Many of the studies on foster care are conducted by the
government or by organizations that receive government funding.
That makes me question the bias of those studies.
<P>
In 1980, Congress mandated that the states report on the number
of children in foster care and their status. Yet today, there
is no government agency that can say with certainty how many children
are in foster care, where they are, whether they are free to be
adopted, or if they're OK. Since 1980, Congress has also required
that every child have a permanency plan within 18 months of entering
foster care. This is usually a plan for a return to the child's
biological parents or adoption.
<P>
It's been 15 years since this law was passed, but one in ten foster
children is still in state care for longer than seven years. Clearly,
such planning isn't resulting in permanent homes for children.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about state regulations governing adoptions?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Several states require that an adoptive family be identified
before a child is legally free to be adopted. Children in those
states become caught in a Catch-22: they cannot be free to be
adopted until a family is identified, but a family is more likely
to be identified when a child is already free to be adopted. We're
conducting a study of children who are free to be adopted in each
state, and some of the numbers we've found are alarming. In California,
there are more than 9,000 children free to be adopted but who
are still in foster care.
<P>
I don't think we should rely only on social work and adoption
recruitment before freeing these children. For the sake of the
children, people who wish to adopt should be given an accurate
picture of the number of children who need permanent homes.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about the anti-adoption bias you mentioned?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> There's an organization called the National Association
of Black Social Workers in Detroit which believes that there are
&quot;many compelling reasons&quot; to reject transracial adoptionsplacing
children of one race with parents of another. NABSW believes that
if same-race homes cannot be found for black children, the &quot;full
range of permanency planning&quot; should be used. That includes
returning children to their biological parents or keeping them
permanently in state foster homes.
<P>
Rita Simon, a distinguished sociology professor at the American
University, has conducted a 20-year study summarized in <I>The
Case for Transracial Adoption</I> (Washington, DC: American University
Press, 1994) which looks at transracial adoptions. The Search
Institute in Minneapolis has conducted the largest-ever study
of adopted adolescents (&quot;Growing Up Adopted: A Portrait of
Adolescents and Their Families&quot;). Both find that transracially
adopted children fare very well on a number of indicators.
<P>
I grew up in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic adoptive family, and
I'm incredulous when so-called experts imply that I could have
loved my brothers and sisters more if our skin color had matched.
I find that mystifying and even racist. I think the NABSW and
those who are against transracial adoption are partly responsible
for the fact that black children on average spend twice as long
in foster care as white children.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What's the culture of victimization?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> In essence, it's the view that child abuse and neglect
have their roots in social factorsracism, economic inequality,
broken homesnot the uncoerced actions of parents. There is a group
called Concerned United Birthparents (CUB), headquartered in Des
Moines. As an organization, its message is that long-term foster
care is preferable to adoption, although not everyone who belongs
to CUB is anti-adoption. Its arguments are fueled by socialist
feminists who claim that the two-parent family is an old, outmoded
ideal. When this idea infuses the thinking of social workers,
we see children being returned to abusive homes or kept permanently
in the limbo of foster care.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Are there any other obstacles that prevent children
from being adopted?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Another major problem is the categorizing of many foster
children as having special needs. Originally, this designation
was intended to help children who might otherwise not be adopted.
But today, some 70 percent of children in foster care are categorized
as having special needs. Sometimes, this simply means having been
in foster care for a certain number of years or being part Native-American.
Not surprisingly, a federal subsidy comes with this categorization.
<P>
Of course, some children do have special needs. But over-categorization
has two harmful consequences. First, it tends to carry a stigma
that discourages many people who want to adopt. Some of those
people eventually decide to adopt a child from another country.
While international adoption is commendable, not everyone can
afford it. I've heard parents say they tried to adopt a child
from the inner-city, but were discouraged by the system. Second,
the term special needs ignores what one father with several adopted
children recently told me about one of his daughters: &quot;She
is special, and she needs us.&quot;
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Why is the debate over foster care and adoption happening
now?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> It's a positive response to what happens under dire
and unfortunate circumstances. I don't think you'll find many
people who would agree that long-term foster care is working.
Children are dying in foster care. Seventeen percent of incarcerated
criminals in state prisons are former foster children. Forty percent
of former foster kids &quot;graduate&quot; to welfare. Thirty-nine
percent of the homeless youth in Los Angeles County are former
foster children.
<P>
The real solution is a private one. Adoption is the ultimate form
of privatization: it is the wresting of authority over a child's
life away from the state. It allows the child to be freeto be
raised not by government but by loving parents. This results not
only in much better outcomes for children, but also in huge savings
to taxpayers. When you look at children who have been adopted
into permanent homes, these kids do far better as measured by
a variety of indicators than foster children and also better than
national samples of children.
<P>
Foster care is a $10-billion-a-year industry, and it's growing.
I think what we're seeing is 30 years of big-government failure.
People are re-examining the role of the state. We recognize that
government cannot raise children. Even President Clinton said
so in his first State of the Union Address. Mrs. Clinton recently
hosted a White House ceremony celebrating National Adoption Month.
She urged Americans to help find an adoptive home for every child
free to be adopted.
<P>
One of the most tragic failures of the welfare statewhat I call
the dirty little secret of the welfare stateis foster care. Part
of the reason it's taken so long to realize how bad things have
become is because many states and government agencies are loathe
to share their information. But with the &quot;information explosion&quot;
of the last ten years, people are learning about what's going
on through the Freedom of Information Act, good reporting, and
academic studiesand they're blowing the whistle.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>How were adoptions generally handled by earlier generations
of Americans?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Through most of America's history, adoption and child
welfare were handled privately with very little government intervention
or regulation. In <I>The Tragedy of American Compassion</I>, Marvin
Olasky talks about how charities ran orphan trains that took orphans
to adoptive homes all over the country. More often, an adoptive
home was available in the immediate community. Adoptions weren't
usually recognized by law. But there was an informal recognition
by neighbors and those in the community.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about adoption as an alternative to abortion?
That seems to be an area where pro-life and pro-choice groups
could find common ground. Do you see anything happening here?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Right now, women faced with an unplanned pregnancy are
not encouraged to look at their full range of (continued after table)<BR>

choices from raising the child to looking to one's family for
support to getting married. I'm hearing more from the pro-life
community about making adoption work better. The pro-choice side
more often raises the question of who will care for the children.
I would encourage them to look at the number of people who wish
to adopt.
<P>
My sense is that there are tens of thousands of peopleif not morewaiting
to adopt. I'm certain that there are more families than there
are children free to be adopted; and it is not true that these
families are only interested in adopting healthy white babies.
The National Adoption Center in Philadelphia reports that there
are 650 families waiting to adopt older, special-needs children.
AKIDS in White Plains, New York, has a list of 150 people waiting
to adopt special-needs kids. The San Francisco office of Adopt
a Special Kid, which has 27 offices nationwide, receives 1,500
calls a year from people who wish to adopt children with disabilities.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>There seems to be a stigma attached to the woman
who has a child out of wedlock and then places the child for adoption.
She's seen as irresponsible because she's chosen not to raise
her own child. Maybe more women are having abortions because of
this. Can anything be done to change this perception?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> In England, I've seen the same trendbasically blaming
a woman for choosing adoption. Professor Richard Whitfield is
writing a paper on adoption for the Institute of Economic Affairs
in London. He tells the story of a young girl who wanted to place
her child for adoption but was totally discouraged by state social
workers. Also, when I talk to young, pregnant girls who live in
group homes, they consistently tell me they would never place
their children for adoption. They know what the system is. If
we got government out of the business of parenting, the system
would improve and attitudes about adoption would begin to change.
<P>
We see a lot of public service announcements about getting food
stamps and other welfare benefits, but we don't see a message
telling young, pregnant girls about adoptionthat bringing a baby
to term and placing it for adoption can be a morally courageous
choice.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Your Institute is seeking to get governors to take
the lead in reforming the foster care/adoption system.</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Yes. Governors are the natural champions of foster children,
who under law are wards of the state. We are trying to convince
every governor to get his or her state out of the business of
parenting. Governors can also take the lead in helping to knock
down barriers that prevent the voluntary sector from doing more.
For example, we wanted to have a Thanksgiving dinner this year
for foster children in shelters and group homes. A friend volunteered
his beautiful home, which happens to be just over the state line
in New Hampshire. We discovered we couldn't take the children
into another state. Next year, we hope to have Thanksgiving dinners
for foster children in every state.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What role can grantmaking foundations play in promoting
the adoption process?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Foundations have an exciting opportunity to invest now
in reshaping the system. Foster care and adoption are enmeshed
in an array of social issues: crime, teen pregnancy, abortion,
family violence. Foundations that support community-based approaches
to these issues would do well to consider how they can help knock
down some of the barriers that keep foster children languishing
in state care. I would also urge foundations that support economic
research to examine this pressing economic issue: foster care
and public-agency adoption is a $10-billion-a-year industry. The
Atlas Economic Research Foundation in Fairfax, Virginia saw this
connection and became our first investor.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about charities, and for that matter, businesses?
What role can they play?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> There is a tremendous role for both. There's a charity
here in Massachusetts whose mission is to ensure that no foster
child experiences the holidays without a toy. It's all-volunteer
and receives no government money. It also provides football and
baseball tickets and pays for prom dresses and tuxedos for teenage
foster kids as well as for Little League teams and driver's education.
It now reaches 5,000 foster children in Massachusetts each year.
This is a wonderful example of the promise of the private, voluntary
sectorof individuals and corporations working together to help
foster children. I think that with a devolution from federal entitlement
programs to state-level accountability, we'll see more and more
of these kinds of initiatives.
<P>
Charities and businesses can also help cover some of the costs
of adopting, which can run into the thousands of dollars. Let's
say you have a child in South Boston who is free to be adopted
and a family waiting to adopt in Dallas. Delta Airlines, which
calls itself the airline for kids, and other major carriers could
each pay for 1,000 newly adopted children to go to their new homes.
People could even donate their frequent flyer miles for these
kids.
<P>
We're launching an initiative in 1996the Moses Projectthat will
seek to engage the community of faith more fully in the adoption
process. Our first step is to find out why churches and synagogues
do not always get involved in foster care and adoption, and what
they perceive as the barriers to doing so.
<P>
Another problem is medical conditions that some foster children
have. Some who would otherwise be adopted have long-term or episodic
health conditions. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, other major insurance
companies, and HMOs could agree to cover the medical bills of,
say, ten newly adopted children in their communities.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What can individuals do?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> We receive letters and phone calls from individuals
across the nation who are seeking advice and who want to help.
We are considering setting up a network of state-level citizen
groups and are seeking funding for this project. In the meantime,
individuals can support their local private and faith-based foster-care
and adoption providers. Also, I urge individuals to write to their
governors and ask that reform of foster care and adoption be made
a top priority.

<h2>Undermining the Founder's Intent: Five Case Studies</h3>
<BR>


By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Wooster">Martin Morse Wooster</a>
<P>
The issue of donor intent continues to vex the philanthropic world,
particularly some of America's largest foundations. This article
expands on my recent book, <a href="/crc/books/pdi.html"><I>The Great Philanthropists and the
Problem of &quot;Donor Intent&quot;</I></a> (Washington, DC: Capital
Research Center, 1994). It continues the stories of foundations
that have violated their founders' wishes, adding new information
on recent developments. It also includes new material on the views
of Henry Ford II and a discussion of the recent &quot;Lee Bass
Case.&quot; A summary offers advice for donors who may wish to
create a private foundation.1

<B>The Barnes Foundation: &quot;A Dangerous Precedent&quot;</B>

<P>
The Barnes Foundation board of trustees continues to violate the
wishes of Albert C. Barnes (1872-1951), an entrepreneur and art
collector who created a world-renowned gallery of French modernist
art in Merion, Pennsylvania. Although Barnes' will firmly states
that no paintings are ever to leave the museum, many paintings
have been sent to exhibits around the world.
<P>
The Foundation continues a legal battle with the Violetta de Mazia
Trust, created by a student of Barnes who was also a trustee of
the Foundation until her death in 1988. The Trust contends that
the Foundation's board has improperly diverted grants intended
for the Foundation to Lincoln University, an African-American
school which under the terms of Barnes' will appoints most of
the Foundation's directors. The Foundation counters that most
of the de Mazia Trust's assets (including paintings) were stolen
from the Foundation and that the Trust should legally be part
of the Foundation, not an independent entity.
<P>
In January 1995, the Foundation and Trust reached an out-of-court
settlement. The Foundation agreed to permanently offer art courses
based on Barnes' views and agreed that the Trust is an independent
organization over which it has no legal authority. In return,
the Trust agreed to donate $2,750,000 over seven years to pay
for the art courses. It also agreed not to object to the Foundation's
efforts to alter Barnes' will by increasing admission fees, allowing
fundraising events at the museum, and letting the Foundation invest
in areas other than government bonds and railroad stocks, as Barnes
had wished.2
<P>
In July 1995, however, Montgomery County Orphans Court Judge Stanley
Ott rejected the settlement. The Trust, along with Concerned Students
of the Barnes and Friends of the Barnes Foundation (two organizations
not included in the original settlement), have resumed their suit.
Foundation president Richard Glanton, who has led the effort to
alter Barnes' will, continues to criticize Barnes supporters:
&quot;The courts have given standing to any Tom, Dick, or Harry
to heave spitballs at us. Anywhere else in the world we'd be heroes
for doing what we've done. What have our critics ever done for
the Barnes? Nothing. They're nobodies.&quot; Glanton also called
Barnes supporters a &quot;small, mean-spirited group.&quot;3
<P>
The Foundation has been more successful in efforts to send its
paintings around the world. In 1992, Orphans Court Judge Louis
D. Stefan allowed a limited tour of certain paintings. In February
1994, he extended the tour to include museums in Fort Worth and
Toronto. This has proven to be a big moneymaker: by March 1995,
the tour had raised $14,600,000. Visitors to the Philadelphia
Museum of Art paid $9.50 to see the paintings ($8.50 more than
they would have paid at the Foundation) and spent $1,500,000 on
memorabilia, including CD-ROMS, even though Barnes' will firmly
prohibits any reproduction of the paintings.4
<P>
The foundation also successfully petitioned the Pennsylvania Superior
Court in May of 1995 to allow the paintings to be transported
to the Haus der Kunst, a museum in Munich. (A month earlier, Orphans
Court Judge Stanley Ott had denied the request, citing the fragility
of the paintings. The Superior Court gave no explanation for its
reversal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear the
case.) The paintings have been sent overseas in return for a payment
of $2,250,000 from the Haus der Kunst. It is unclear when they
will be returned.
<P>
The <I>New Criterion</I>'s Roger Kimball recently told the <I>National
Law Journal</I> that the assault on Barnes' will is &quot;a smear
campaign pure and simple. Barnes set up a rigorous educational
mission, and it is being undermined by certain people for their
own aggrandizement. Barnes was not crazy; he was betrayed.&quot;
&quot;The Barnes affair is one of the great scandals in American
art museums,&quot; adds Thomas Freundenheim, the Smithsonian Institution's
assistant secretary for museums, &quot;and it sets a dangerous
precedent. If a will isn't sacrosanct under the law, what is?
The Fricks, Barnes, and Carnegies of the future are going to think
very carefully before donating their masterpieces to our institutions
and to our future generations. And that is a more dangerous situation
than the public understands it to be.&quot;5
<P>
<a name="buck"></a>
<B>The Buck Trust: From Charity to Alcohol Prohibition</B> 
<P>
The $427,000,000 Buck Trust, created by Beryl Buck (1896-1975),
an oil heiress and longtime resident of Marin County, California,
supports programs and causes increasingly removed from those specified
by the donor. According to Buck's will, distributions from the
Trust are to be &quot;used for exclusively nonprofit, charitable,
religious, or educational purposes in providing care for the needy
in Marin County . . . and for other nonprofit charitable, religious
or educational purposes in Marin County. . . .&quot;6
<P>
After a 1986 lawsuit in which the San Francisco Foundation, the
Trust's administrator, tried unsuccessfully to alter Buck's will
to allow the distribution of funds throughout the San Francisco
Bay area, a court ordered that the Trust's wealth be transferred
to a newly created Marin Community Foundation. The court also
ordered the funding of three new Marin-based nonprofits with Buck
Trust funds: the Buck Center for Research on Aging, Beryl Buck
Institute for Education, and Marin Institute for the Prevention
of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Problems.
<P>
In June 1991, the Trust's board agreed to spend $4,500 in Trust
funds to study whether the self-esteem of Marin County residents
would be harmed by the Buck Center's plans to use rats in laboratory
experiments. According to Mary McEachron, administrative director
of the Center, &quot;rodent activists&quot; had prompted the study
by protesting construction of the facility.7
<P>
The 1994 annual report of the Marin Institute shows that Trust
funds are being used to support nonprofit lobbying to increase
regulation of the production and distribution of alcoholan activity
unrelated to Beryl Buck's desire to help the needy of Marin County.
In collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a major
promoter of government-run health care, the Marin Institute recently
began a three-year program &quot;to provide in-depth support for
policy initiatives to prevent alcohol and other drug problems&quot;
in seven major cities. In addition, the Marin Institute:
<UL>
<LI>Continued to collect a &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; of alcohol-industry
merchandise of which it disapproved.
<LI>Purchased $1,000 worth of stock in Anheuser-Busch and Canandaigua
Wine in order to introduce shareholder resolutions at annual meetings.
<LI>Joined with alcohol prohibitionist organizations in Sweden,
Norway, and the United Kingdom to create the Global Alliance to
Prevent Alcohol-Related Harm.
<LI>Held at least six &quot;media advocacy&quot; workshops designed
to train activists in ways to urge journalists to support government
regulation of alcohol.
<LI>Provided &quot;technical assistance&quot; to such organizations
as the Advocacy Institute, a tobacco prohibition group; American
Lung Association, now a major anti-tobacco lobbying organization;
and Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.8

<B>The Estate of Doris Duke: Lost in Probate</B> 
<P>
Little change has occurred in the Duke Endowment, the Charlotte-based
regional foundation created by tobacco and hydroelectric power
magnate James B. Duke. But the estate of Doris Duke, his recently
deceased daughter, is more unsettled than ever.
<P>
Doris Duke willed most of her fortune to a proposed Doris Duke
Charitable Foundation. With $1.2 billion in assets, this would
be the sixteenth largest foundation in the U.S.slightly larger
than the Carnegie Corporation of New York ($1.2 billion) but smaller
than the Annenberg Foundation ($1.3 billion).9 With the turmoil
surrounding the Doris Duke estate, however, it is unclear who
would run the foundation or if it will be created at all.
<P>
Duke revised her will at least six times in the two years before
her death in October 1993. In her last will, she named Bernard
Lafferty, her butler, co-executor (along with U.S. Trust) and
awarded him a $500,000 salary plus a $5,000,000 executor's fee.
In January 1995, however, Duke's nurse, Tammy Payette, charged
that Duke did not die of natural causes but was killed by a &quot;massive
sedation regime&quot; administered by Lafferty.10 Manhattan Surrogate's
Court Judge Eve Preminger appointed former district attorney Richard
Kuh to investigate the allegations and other charges of irregularities
in the management of Duke's estate.
<P>
Other Duke employees have also questioned the legality of Duke's
will. Colin Shanley, Duke's cook, and Ann Bostich, Duke's housekeeper,
charged that Duke was disoriented when she signed her last will.
Bostich also accused William Doyle, the lawyer who prepared the
last will, of holding Duke's hand and pushing it &quot;along the
page, guiding the hand&quot; until a signature was obtained.11
<P>
In April, Kuh's report was unsealed in Surrogate's Court. It supported
Payette's charges, saying that though Duke was terminally ill
in October 1993, her death was hastened by a fatal morphine overdose.
It also accused Lafferty of severe mismanagement of the estate,
saying that several charitable gifts made in Duke's name to Duke
University ($2,000,000), the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation
($1,000,000), and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
($1,000,000) may have been made by Lafferty himself while Duke
was in no condition to agree. It further accused Lafferty of reckless
spending and of improperly borrowing $853,000 in interest-free
loans from U.S. Trust.
<P>
As Kuh's report was being released, Chandi Duke Heffner, a belly-dancing
instructor whom Duke adopted in 1988 and then un-adopted in 1991,
settled her longstanding dispute with the estate for a figure
reported to be $65,000,000. As for Tammy Payette, she recently
pleaded guilty to stealing $500,000 in art and jewels from six
wealthy patients.
<P>
In May, Judge Preminger ousted Lafferty and U.S. Trust as co-executors
and replaced them with Morgan Guaranty Trust and Alexander D.
Forger, a former chairman of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley, and McCloy
who served as executor of the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Preminger, citing Lafferty's admitted alcoholism and &quot;lack
of appreciation of the most basic financial matters,&quot;12 also
noted that U.S. Trust should have noticed Lafferty's deficiencies
and not loaned him the $853,000: &quot;U.S. Trust has failed to
discharge this duty to the estate and the charitable beneficiaries.&quot;13
In October, a New York appeals court upheld Preminger's ruling,
although Lafferty and U.S. Trust plan to appeal a second time.
<P>
So it remains unclear who the final executor of the Doris Duke
estate will be, whether the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation will
be created, whether Chandi Duke Heffner's settlement with the
estate will be overturned, and whether Duke University, the Elizabeth
Taylor AIDS Foundation, and People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals will have to return the questionable donations made in
Doris Duke's name. Nearly every question about the Doris Duke
estate, including what her charitable intentions were, remains
unanswered.
<P>
<a name="ford"></a>
<B>The Ford Foundation: &quot;A Horrible Mistake&quot;</B> 
<P>
New information concerning how Henry Ford II (1917-1987) lost
control of the Ford Foundation his family created has emerged
in the form of taped interviews conducted between 1980 and 1985.14
Ford stipulated that the tapes not be made public until five years
after his death. The tapes' contents were recently summarized
by the <I>Detroit News</I> in a multi-part series.15
<P>
Although Ford is already known to have regretted his decision
in 1948 to relinquish family control over the Foundation, the
interviews are more candid. &quot;I made a big mistake on the
Ford Foundation. I had the Ford Foundation in my hand at one time.
Then I lost it, and I lost it on my own volition. I gave it away
on my own. I was young, inexperienced, and stupid. I just muffed
it. It got out of control, and it stayed out of control. And now
it's gone, of course.&quot;16
<P>
Ford added that he should have used the Foundation mostly to fund
causes created by his grandfather, including the Henry Ford Hospital,
Edison Institute (now the Henry Ford Museum), and Fair Lane, his
grandfather's estate (now a conference center). &quot;It could
have been done so easily,&quot; he said. &quot;It could have been
done with a penin four seconds. We had three trustees. We could
have done anything we wanted. We could have taken the [Ford Motor]
stock and given it to any nonprofit company, nonprofit Edison
Institute, nonprofit Henry Ford Hospital, nonprofit Fair Lane,
nonprofit whatever you want. And done a much better job for the
whole family than I did. I did it all on my own and I made a horrible
mistake. I'll never live it down, and I regret it sincerely. But
what the hell can I do about it? I can't do anything about it.
Just have to lie and die with it.&quot;17
<P>
The Ford Foundation recently announced that longtime president
Franklin Thomas will step in down in 1996. His replacement is
Susan Berresford, a Foundation vice-president and employee since
1970. In a lengthy interview with the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
Berresford did not say how she intended to uphold the charitable
ideas of Henry Ford or Henry Ford II. In fact, she did not mention
the Fords at all.18 Writing in the <I>New Republic</I>, David
Samuels predicts that Berresford will continue the Foundation's
longstanding pattern of funding the &quot;professional advocacy
industry,&quot; including the Ms. Foundation for Women, Women's
Legal Defense Fund, National Women's Law Center, and Institute
for Women.19

<B>The Case of Lee Bass: I Want My Money Back</B> 
<P>
One place where donors have had a great deal of trouble expressing
their ideas is in universities. Pro-capitalist donors have spent
tens of millions of dollars creating &quot;free enterprise chairs&quot;
at universities, most of which have done little to advance free
markets.20 Others have had a hard time convincing universities
to accept their ideas as well as their checks. Consider the case
of Lee Bass.
<P>
Bass, who graduated from Yale University in 1979, is heir to an
oil fortune. Inspired by Yale historian Donald Kagan, Bass decided
in 1991 to give $20,000,000 to his alma mater to create courses
that would promote Western civilization. Kagan became the first
&quot;Bass Professor&quot; and was charged with designing the
program.
<P>
In the meantime, Yale hired a new president, Richard Levin, who
found that the university had a $12,000,000 budget deficit that
Bass' grant could close. Although the Western civilization program
was scheduled to hire four new professors, one clause of the Bass
indenture said that &quot;full-time faculty [should] take direct
responsibility for the teaching at the heart of the program.&quot;
Levin interpreted this to mean that existing faculty could be
assigned to the program and paid with Bass funds. According to
Bass professor of history Henry Turner, &quot;We were asked to
design a Rolls Royce of a course [but] were told to put in a Chrysler
engine and Plymouth upholstery.&quot;2l
<P>
Meanwhile, Yale undergraduate Pat Collins began investigating
the program. He found that several professors objected to a new
course upholding the works of &quot;dead white males.&quot; Collins'
work was picked up by the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, which editorialized
that &quot;There can be little doubt that the faculty quarters
ideologically opposed to the Western Civilization program . .
. played a crucial role in derailing the initiative and, not incidentally,
the intentions of the grant.&quot;22
<P>
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Bass first heard his
program was in trouble from the <I>Journal</I> editorial. He had
received no response to several requests for information on the
status of the program between September 1993 and November 1994.
For some reason, Yale president Levin was unable to find time
to talk to Bass. In February 1995, Bass imposed an additional
condition on his grant: that he have the right to approve the
professors teaching the program. Levin refused to accept the condition,
so Bass withdrew his grant in March 1995.
<P>
Yale's response has been to deny that the episode had anything
to do with ideology. But Yale subsequently rejected an offer by
members of Yale's class of 1937 to raise the $20,000,000 lost
by the Bass grant for a new Western civilization program.
<P>
The publicity surrounding the Bass case may lead increasing numbers
of alumni to question the wisdom of giving to their alma maters.
&quot;I don't think the problem is simply dealing with Western
Civilization or the humanities at Yale,&quot; says Russell Reynolds,
a 1954 Yale graduate. &quot;I think it's dealing with the governance
of Yale and the way the institution is currently being run.&quot;23
<P>
The Bass case suggests that universities can be remarkably impervious
to outside influence. Perhaps a better way for alumni to influence
their alma maters is to donate books or magazine subscriptions
to the college library, or to support nonprofit organizations
that seek to aid college students and professors, such as the
Institute for Humane Studies, Intercollegiate Studies Institute,
Madison Center, National Association of Scholars, or Young America's
Foundation.
<P><a name="advice"></a>
<B>Advice for Donors</B> 
<P>
What lessons can be drawn from these stories?
<UL>
<LI>The Barnes case shows that trustees can successfully challenge
a will in court even if the donor's wishes are explicit. Donors
would thus be wise to consider giving most or all of their wealth
during their lifetimes. Nonetheless, examples of other foundations,
such as the Duke Endowment and Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, show
that an explicitly worded bequest is more likely to be honored
than a vaguely worded one.24
<LI>The Buck case shows the importance of carefully selecting
an executor. Had the San Francisco Foundation honored Beryl Buck's
will, the court would not have created the Marin Community Foundation
and programs with no relation to Buck's wishes.
<LI>The Duke case likewise shows the importance of the executor,
and the kind of lengthy probate court contest that may occur if
a highly competent one is not chosen.
<LI>The Ford case suggests that family control of a foundation
can help uphold donor intent. But, as the accompanying article
on the Pew Charitable Trusts shows, family involvement by third-
or fourth-generation heirs is probably less effective, as they
will have little or no direct knowledge of the founder's ideas.
Family control is likely to keep a foundation on track only in
the short run.
<LI>The Bass case shows the advantage of giving during one's lifetime.
Lee Bass was able to withdraw his gift when he saw that his wishes
would not be fulfilled.
<LI>In short, there are no guarantees that one's bequest will
be honoredonly varying degrees of probability that it will be.
Donors can increase the likelihood that their wishes will be followed
by explicitly stating their objectives and carefully choosing
trustees. They should also consider giving more during their lifetimes
and limiting the life of their foundations.<BR>

<h2>The Pew Charitable Trusts: Revitalizing &quot;the Spirit of
the 60s&quot;</h2>
<BR>
By Dr. Robert Lerner and Dr. Althea K. Nagai
<P>
The family of Joseph Newton Pew, founder of the Sun Oil Company,
created seven charitable trusts beginning in the late 1940s to
carry out their philanthropic ideals. As Martin Wooster relates
in <a href="/crc/books/pdi.html"><I>The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of &quot;Donor
Intent,&quot;</I></a> the Pews were strongly religious conservatives
who often gave to charity anonymously, believing that &quot;charity
should be a private matter between God and one's conscience.&quot;1
<P>
Two Pew brothers, J. Howard Pew (1882-1971) and Joseph N. Pew,
Jr. (1886-1963), took over the family oil business after their
father's death in 1912. J. Howard Pew attended Grove City College,
which was largely developed and financed by his father, and briefly
studied at MIT. His scientific contributions to the oil business
included the development of Sun Red Stock, a more versatile lubricating
oil than had been used, and hydrolene, the first commercially
successful petroleum asphalt.2 Joseph N. Pew, Jr., a graduate
of Cornell University, became heavily involved in national politics
as vice president of Sun Oil. He led the effort to overturn Franklin
Roosevelt's National Recovery Act, a system of government-organized
cartels declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935.
<P>
Both brothers were strong supporters of religious organizations
and black colleges. Both also strongly supported the Republican
Party, giving an estimated $2,000,000 between 1934 and 1940. Joseph
N. Pew, Jr. also purchased a number of magazines, including the
<I>Farm Journal</I> and <I>Pathfinder</I>, to advance his anti-New
Deal views.
<P>
<B>The Founding of the Trusts</B> 
<P>
Starting in 1948, J. Howard Pew, Joseph N. Pew, Jr., and their
sisters, Mary Ethel Pew and Mabel Pew Myrin, gave at least 80
percent of their fortunes to seven charitable trusts: the Pew
Memorial Trust, J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust, Mabel Pew Myrin Trust,
J.N. Pew Jr. Charitable Trust, Medical Trust, Mary Anderson Trust,
and Knollbrook Trust. These were intended to support education,
social services, religion, health care, and medical research.
The Trusts' first president was Sun Oil executive Robert G. Dunlop,
who succeeded J. Howard Pew as president of Sun Oil in 1947.
<P>
Major changes began with the death of J. Howard Pew. Robert I.
Smith was appointed administrator of the Glenmede Trust Company,
the holding company of the Trusts, and later served as president
of the Trusts from 1977 to 1986. He began the practice of consulting
outsiders, such as Yale University president A. Bartlett Giamatti
and future Harvard University president Neil Rudenstine for advice
on what the Trusts should do.3
<P>
Even though the Pews believed in giving anonymously, Smith oversaw
publication of the Trusts' first annual reports. He also broadened
the base of Pew funding to include large grants to major research
centers, mainstream social agencies, and Ivy League schools, even
though J. Howard Pew detested the liberalism of Ivy League schools.
In 1981, the Trusts also stopped supporting hospital wings and
disease research, shifting funds to initiatives intended to change
public health policy.4
<P>
<B>Radical Restructuring</B> 
<P>
The transformation of the Trusts accelerated with the 1987 appointment
of Dr. Thomas W. Langfitt as president. A former neurosurgeon
and vice president of health affairs at the University of Pennsylvania,
Langfitt fired 17 of 20 executives, including the executive director,
three vice presidents, and 13 program officers. The only prominent
executive to remain was Rebecca Rimel, a former nurse who was
promoted to executive director. (She became president in 1993.)
During Langfitt's tenure, two of five board members also resigned,
one under pressure for &quot;meddling&quot; in staff affairs and
another, John G. Pew, a distant relation, in protest of the foundation's
increasingly liberal leanings.5
<P>
Langfitt explains the Trusts' operating principles: &quot;In the
past, we'd identify a problem and fund private agencies. Now we
see that most of the responsibility for dealing with major social
problems rests with the government. However, it lacks the money
for new programs. So instead of working on a parallel track we
build partnerships between government and private agencies.&quot;6
Likewise, Rimel says, &quot;If we could infuse the spirit of the
'60s into our work it might get the country out of this morass
of feeling that problems are insolvable.&quot;7 According to Rimel,
&quot;The political ghosts of Pew's past are gone.&quot;8<BR>

<B>Analysis of Pew Grantmaking: The Environment</B> 
<P>
To determine the extent of change at the Pew Charitable Trusts,
we examined all grants in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993,
and 1994. We categorized these as ideological or non-ideological,
then subdivided the ideological grants into liberal and conservative
categories.
<P>
The results of our analysis are startling. We found that in 1986,
the Trusts gave about three times as many grants and three-and-a-half
times as much money to liberal groups as to conservative ones.
By 1994, the Trusts were giving 22 times as many grants and 40
times as much money to liberal groups. The total number of grants
and amount of money given to conservative groups actually decreased
from 1986 to 1994. (See <a href="#chart1">Chart 1.</a>) 
<P>
The liberal orientation of the Trusts is evident in a number of
policy areas, particularly the environment. The Trusts are now
the nation's largest environmental grantmaker. Most funding comes
from the trust created by Joseph N. Pew, Jr., although there is
no evidence that he was interested in conservation.
<P>
The <I>1985 Annual Report of the J.N. Pew Jr. Charitable Trust</I>
shows that 19 conservation grants were awarded in 1984. These
supported such goals as protecting &quot;the natural environment
and genetic diversity.&quot;9 In 1986, the J.N. Pew Trust made
grants totalling over three million dollars to such moderately
liberal environmental groups as the Nature Conservancy, National
Wildlife Foundation, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's
Marine Policy and Ocean Management Center.
<P>
The J.N. Pew Trust has since embraced radical environmentalism.
In 1991, it awarded 98 environmental grants totalling over $13
million. These addressed such concerns as &quot;Deforestation
and the Loss of Biodiversity&quot; and &quot;Global Warming and
Climate Change.&quot; By 1994, the J.N. Pew Trust was giving $17
million to environmental groups, and the combined trusts were
providing over $23 million in environmental funding (see <a href="#chart2">Chart
2</a>).
<P>
This sweeping change is probably due to the 1990 appointment of
Joshua Reichert, the Trusts' program director in conservation
and the environment. Reichert is a former liberal organizer associated
with Caesar Chavez's United 
Farm Workers10 who, according to Langfitt, &quot;understands environmental
issues from the ground up. He has worked at both the program and
policy level to effect environmental change, has had considerable
domestic and international experience, and is particularly familiar
with the important and oftentimes understated linkages between
economic, social, and environmental problems.&quot;11
<P>
In 1994, the Trusts adopted an interdisciplinary approach to the
environment. Under the rubric &quot;the Global Agenda&quot; and
&quot;the Pew Global Stewardship Initiative,&quot; funds are drawn
from the Pew Memorial Trust and support such nonprofits as the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences ($230,000), Environmental
Defense Fund ($180,000), Global Action Plan for the Earth ($150,000
to teach children &quot;to lead environmentally sustainable lives&quot;),
International Institute for Sustainable Development ($150,000),
International Women's Health Coalition ($150,000), League of Women
Voter's Voter Education Fund ($75,000), National Council for International
Health ($50,000), Planned Parenthood Federation of America ($130,000),
and Zero Population Growth ($150,000). Funding from other Trust
programs in 1994 supported the Center for Public Interest Research
($115,000), Environmental Defense Fund ($140,000), Friends of
the Earth ($45,000), Natural Resources Defense Council ($1,175,000
[three grants]), and Rainforest Action Network ($160,000).12
<P>
<B>Undoing the J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust</B> 
<P>
J. Howard Pew created his trust to support individual initiative,
free markets, lower taxes, and less regulation
. The Trust's charter proclaims that &quot;[S]ocialism, welfare-stateism,
Marxism, Fascism and any other like forms of government intervention
are but devices by which government seizes the ownership or control
of production.&quot; Pew also expressed his belief that the &quot;enemies
of freedom employ sophistry, obfuscation, and semantics in order
to destroy the true meaning of liberty. . .&quot;
<P>
Despite its explicitness, the new leadership has diverted the
Trust from its founder's intent. Incredibly, the Trust, which
once supported numerous conservative domestic public-policy organizations,
has virtually abandoned these efforts. In 1993, the Trust made
no grants to conservative domestic public policy groups. In 1994,
it made only one such grant to the National Right to Work Legal
Defense and Education Foundation ($150,000). The conservative
Heritage Foundation also received a grant of $300,000, but this
was to study international trade. In contrast, as late as 1989,
the Trust made 10 such grants totalling $1,775,000. In 1981, conservative
grants totalled $2,432,000 and were awarded to the Alternative
Education Foundation ($22,000), American Enterprise Institute
($1,000,000), Committee for a Free World ($25,000), Ethics and
Public Policy Center ($200,000), Heritage Foundation ($100,000),
and Rockford Institute ($30,000) (see <a href="#chart3">Chart 3</a>).
<P>
Grants since 1991 have supported public policy initiatives in
the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In 1994, the Trust made 27 such grants, mostly to ideologically
indeterminate groups. According to the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
however, the Trust is phasing out its support of Central and Eastern
Europe this year &quot;to focus its $10-million public-policy
program on similar efforts in the United States.&quot; Whether
such funding will promote free markets and limited government
is questionable, since the Trusts are currently &quot;pouring
money&quot; into the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington,
D.C. in order &quot;to alter news coverage of government and politics
to focus more attention on solutions to problems than on political
differences.&quot;13 This may be an effort to counter the recent
Republican sweep of Congress and the Contract with America.
<P>
<B>Family Involvement: An Effective Safeguard?</B> 
<P>
Four seats on the Trusts' eight member board are held by Pew descendants,
who according to <I>Town and Country</I> are &quot;philosophically
attuned to the founders' spirit.&quot; They are R. Anderson Pew,
a great nephew of Joseph N. Pew, Jr., who has long been involved
in the Trusts; Joseph N. Pew III, the son of Joseph N. Pew, Jr.;
J. Howard Pew II, a grandson of Joseph N. Pew, Jr., who is listed
as &quot;an environmental activist in Chester, Nova Scotia;&quot;
and Dr. Joseph Pew IV, another grandson of Joseph N. Pew, Jr.,
who &quot;practices medicine in disadvantaged neighborhoods.&quot;14
<P>
These members appear to be at least complacent, if not supportive,
of the recent changes, although all but one refuse to be interviewed.
R. Anderson Pew says he sees no inconsistency between the founders'
intent and current grantmaking: the Trusts' founders &quot;never
saw any inconsistency between holding to their beliefs and adapting
to a changing world. If Uncle Joe and Uncle Howard were sitting
here today, they'd approve of the direction we've taken.&quot;15
He also purports to be &quot;mystified&quot; by the idea that
the founders were conservative: &quot;Our Aunt Harriet Pew in
Civil War days ran an underground railroad helping slaves. . .
. You can't get much more liberal than that.&quot;16 Of course,
such efforts occurred before the Trust-founding Pews were born.
And while admirable, the underground railroad was not the kind
of &quot;public-private partnership&quot; now endorsed by the
Trusts, but a wholly private endeavor in defiance of federal law.
<P>
The fact that the Pew Charitable Trusts' grantmaking is now far
removed from the vision of its founders suggests that in the long
run family involvement may not be an effective means of upholding
donor intent. As Martin Wooster writes, &quot;the longer a foundation
exists, the less likely it is to heed donor intent. This is due
in part to fading memories, as friends and associates of donors
die and are succeeded by people who did not personally know the
founder.&quot;17 This is a warning that donors should take to
heart.

J. Howard Pew, a pioneer in the petroleum industry, was an outspoken
defender of free enterprise and a critic of big government. Here
are some excerpts from his numerous speeches and writings:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;No economic planning authority could possibly have foreseen,
planned, plotted, and organized such an amazing spectacle of industrial
progress as the world has witnessed in the last century. No trust
or combination, private or governmental, could have accomplished
it.&quot;
<LI>You can't mix government and business &quot;any more than
you can mix pure water with contaminated water and get anything
but contaminated water.&quot;
<LI>&quot;The hand of Government on business is the cold clammy
hand of death and it must eventually destroy everything it touches.&quot;
<LI>&quot;It has been because of its freedom from regulatory interference,
its full opportunity to deal, unhampered, with its manifest problems,
that the petroleum industry has been able so well to serve the
public interest.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Nobody must be barred, no innovation rejected, no idea
untried; everybody must have his chance. . . . That is our great
American heritage. With so many political witch doctors abroad
in the land teaching communism, fascism, planned and dictated
economies, governmental paternalism and all the others, I urge
you to guard well that heritage and turn a deaf ear to all their
sophistries. When a people come to look upon their government
as the source of all their rights, there will surely come a time
when they will look upon that same government as the source of
all their wrongs. That is the history of all planned, dictated
economies. That is the history of tyranny.&quot;

On February 8, President Clinton, with much fanfare, signed the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  The law heralds a new era of growth and competition in the rapidly expanding communications sector, which now accounts for one-seventh of the American economy.  The first overhaul of communications policy in 60 years, the legislation promises to unleash a market free-for-all by tearing down anti-competitive barriers and allowing heretofore segregated industries to enter each others' markets.  Soon, local phone companies will offer long distance services; long distance carriers will provide local service; and both will provide video services.  Cable companies are eager to provide phone service, and users of the Internet and digital technology, restricted only by their imaginations, are already revolutionizing how people communicate with one another.
<p>The main thrust of the new law is laudably deregulatory.  But despite its promising framework, the devil is in the details.  The Federal Communications Commission must conduct scores of rulemaking proceedings to implement the new law.  That means there are many opportunities for mischief on the part of special interests seeking to use the process to restrict competition in one way or another.  
<p>Much has already been written about the various corporate supplicants jockeying for their respective "fair advantage."  Yet the corporate turf wars are only part of the picture.  The law provides plenty of opportunities for big government types eager for a handout.  And a horde of nonprofit pleaders  all claiming to represent the public interest  are queuing up to get their chunk of the pie.  Having failed to derail telecommunications reform, they are now doing their best to gum up the process.  
<p>Smelling money, this vast array of activist groups hopes to use the law's universal service provision to establish a new communications entitlement that will encompass everything from free services for schools to HUD grants for wiring housing projects to the Internet.  The activists are egged on by federal agency officials who see deregulation as a threat to their sinecures.  Unconstrained competition is great for consumers, but scary to those whose power depends on maintaining government control.

<h3>The Birth of a New Entitlement</h3>
"Up for Grabs," appropriately enough, was the title of a June 10 conference at Gallaudet University in Washington sponsored by the Benton Foundation, with funding from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, W. K. Kellogg, and Charles Stewart Mott foundations, as well as the Carnegie Corporation and Ameritech.  Billed as a discussion of the public interest in the new telecommunications environment, it attracted a multitude of progressives representing such groups as People for American Way, Child Welfare League of America, Planned Parenthood, American Library Association, and OMB Watch.  This professional assembly of the socially concerned pondered what the information age meant for them. 
<p>The conference participants shared certain assumptions.  They generally agreed that unfettered markets threaten the fabric of society, that a "referee" is needed to correct the inevitable injustices caused by competition, and that corporate power, left unchecked, will overwhelm the right of other voices to participate in the decisionmaking process.  The participants were unsympathetic to Republican policy ideas and argued for the public's "right" to have access to the new technology.  Needless to say, for the right to be real it would have to be subsidized by the federal government.  
<p>Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) set the tone for the conference at its morning session.  Markey outlined his scheme for a new telecom entitlement centered on his proposal for an "E-Rate."  Schools would receive "free" a core of communications services under the proposal.  Additional advanced services would be acquired at a discounted E-Rate.  Calling for an E-Rate "crusade," Markey urged activists to rally editorial opinion behind it and warned that a "social disaster" was in the making unless schools received these services.  Enthusiastic applause greeted Markey's prediction that by next year he would again be chairman of the House subcommittee dealing with telecommunications issues.
<p>(The alphabet seems central to Markey's policy initiatives.  He is also an architect of the "V-Chip," which in theory allows parents to screen out violent programming.)
<p>Markey's remarks revealed much about the cozy relationship between government and nonprofit advocacy groups.  Liberal interest groups serve the political class, which rewards them for generating grassroots support.  Conferences like this one enable activists to meet with their political comrades to discuss how both can survive and flourish.  Indeed, the event was co-sponsored by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a part of the Commerce Department.  NTIA administers the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program, which is considered one of the top slush funds for government grants to nonprofits.
<p>Thus, Markey implored participants to "ruthlessly participate" in the process.  At the same session, Bob Rowe, a commissioner on the Montana Public Service Commission, warned the crowd that utility regulators were too exposed to business interests and needed to hear more from the "public interest community."  Later, in a small discussion group, he urged advocates to take a grassroots organizing approach.  A lawyer from the Agriculture Department volunteered his agency to subsidize the new technology entitlement.
<p>Senator Robert Kerrey (D-Neb.) provided a further illustration of how nonprofits and government sustain one another.  During a question and answer session after lunch, Kerrey was asked how Indian and rural communities could obtain access to advanced telecommunications.  When the questioner offered to send Kerrey more information, the Senator shot back, "Don't send me the information, send me [legislative] language."  
<p>Many discussions bordered on the surreal.  Some participants seemed convinced that inability to access the internet was a serious cause of many social ills.  Coralee Whitcomb, president of a Boston group called Virtually Wired, worried that the disadvantaged would be "railroaded" off the information mainline and appealed for assistance in connecting battered women to the internet.  She was particularly concerned that those in homeless shelters were unaware of the internet's value.  One might as well have demanded HMOs for Bosnia or Enterprise Zones in Liberia.  
<p>Some conferencegoers shaded their political demands by employing corporate-inspired jargon about "leveraging" grants and "strategic interventions," but there were also class warriors like Gigi Sohn from the Media Access Project, a liberal public interest law firm, who spoke of a "handful of big companies controlling what people hear and see."  Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute deplored the process by which Americans became "atoms up against global economic forces and multinational corporations."
<p>Most participants, however, seemed less inspired by radical activism or liberal ideas than by an envy that the technology revolution is generating enormous wealth.  Sohn summed it up:  "It comes down to money."  Contemporary interest group liberalism is not about new ideas or protecting individual rights: it is focused on protecting and enlarging privileges that depend on maintaining streams of funding from government.

<h3>Universal Service: The Politics of Magic Words </h3>
The rallying cry for telecom collectivists is universal service, the belief that everyone should have access to phone service.  In practice, universal service has meant that urban and long distance phone customers, regardless of income, subsidize the cost of providing equivalent services to rural users.  Proponents assert that phone service is almost a corollary to the constitutionally-protected right to free speech.  Activists now seek to extend the concept of universal service to other forms of electronic communications.  They have good reason to think they can win this fight because the 1996 Telecommunication Act has a universal service mandate.  It sets up a Federal-State Joint Board to make recommendations for implementing the law's universal service provision.
<p>By early fall the FCC is expected to issue a universal service rule.  The rulemaking process, which invites comments in response to the agency's initial "Notice of Proposed Rulemaking," has attracted an unusually broad range of interested parties.  Hundreds of organizations from consumer and civil rights groups to the U.S. Catholic Conference have filed comments.  The large number of participants reflects the amount of money that is at stake.  As Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation observed in its reply comments, "This proceeding will largely determine who will receive universal service subsidies and who will pay for them."
<p>Probably the most vocal and visible player in the universal service debate is the Consumer Federation of America.  CFA was actively involved in the debate over the telecom act, and it has been a thorn in the side of the exponents of telecom deregulation.
<p>According to Bradley Stillman, CFA's telecommunications policy director, not only is every American consumer entitled to have "access to the full panoply of services available over the telecommunications network," there should also be a "guarantee that they will have some level of actual <i>service</i> as well [emphasis in original]."
<p>For CFA, affordability is the bedrock of universal service.  In comments filed jointly with Consumers Union and American Association of Retired Persons, CFA argues that an expansive "relative" definition of affordability "should be a basic concept of universal service."  In other words, people should not have to "seriously diminish their standard of living" or face "serious inconvenience" as a result of paying for telecommunications services.
<p>CFA and its nonprofit allies believe universal service should include not only basic access, but also flat-rate service, directory assistance, the provision of directories, Call Trace, and 900-number blocking service.  (A number of groups, including the U.S. Catholic Conference and the National Coalition for the Homeless, contend that the universal service package should also include specialty services like voice mail.)
<p>The joint comments filed by nine other activist groups, including People for the American Way, Benton Foundation, Center for Media Education, National Council of La Raza, and National Rainbow Coalition, are even more explicit.  Prepared by counsel for People for the American Way and the Media Access Project, they assert unabashedly that "full, equal, and affordable access to a broad range of telecommunications services is a birthright of citizenship."  Put bluntly, "Those without access to telecommunications services are disenfranchised."
<p>No doubt, most of us would prefer to receive a "universal service" for anything; how about cars or televisions?  But as CSE Foundation notes, "to the extent the definition of universal service becomes more expansive, it becomes more expensive."  And the costs of such a policy are likely to be passed on to ordinary telecommunications consumers, and "may hurt those who do not qualify for subsidies yet cannot afford to pay the inevitable costs."
<p>It is important to understand that those mobilizing to affect the law's provision for universal service are not simple do-gooders ignorant of economic consequences.  Advocates of the new communications "right" believe that the communications revolution can become a vehicle to further their political aims.  Hence, People for the American Way and friends emphasize the "role of institutions" in applying an expansive notion of universal service that includes "institutional access to advanced services."  Institutions, they maintain, can provide "fundamentals training, skills building, information exchanges, and technical support" and can "even function as access providers for community networks." 
<p>According to Gary Bass, the head of OMB Watch, "Whether it's the Million Man March or the Stand for Children, we saw the Internet was a tool for organizing . . .  These are empowering mechanisms."  Bass insists that activists must "fight for the right of community groups across the country to have access to the bells and whistles."  The activist left would like nothing more than for the government to provide a free communications apparatus for its lacework of alliances and networks.

<h3>Consumer Federation of America: Suspect Source</h3>
CFA and its allies have been the primary stumbling blocks to greater telecommunications competition.  CFA's Stillman claims to welcome the outbreak of competition among telecom providers.  He says, "We must have competition as soon as possible," that "competition is the only effective outcome", and that competition and universal service are "not conflicting goals."  Yet while the legislation was before Congress, CFA claimed that the telecom bill would cost consumers billions of dollars in higher phone costs.  By contrast, Citizens for a Sound Economy, a group with considerable policy expertise in regulatory issues, estimates that the bill may lower consumer prices by 20 to 30 percent.
<p>CFA has a poor track record in predicting communications costs.  When the old Bell system was broken up in 1984, it contended that local rates would skyrocket, forcing consumers to give up their telephones.  But when one takes inflation into account, phone rates have actually decreased during the past decade.  And phone usage is way up, requiring phone companies to add new area codes at a record rate.  Since the AT&T divestiture the consumer price index consistently has grown at a rate faster than changes in basic local phone rates.  Was this a surprise to CFA?  Probably not.  In 1986, then-CFA Legislative Director Gene Kimmelman, who is now co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, CFA's sidekick in the telecom wars, was quoted in the <i>New York Times</i>:  "To be honest, we painted the worst case scenario and it hasn't been that bad."
<p>CFA was also the prime force behind the 1992 Cable Act, which has been largely repealed by the new Telecommunications Act.  Most analysts have concluded that by 1992 cable rates had peaked and that service was on the upswing.  A classic case of regulatory overkill, the main repercussion of the '92 act was to confuse consumers with nearly unintelligible bills.  Wayne Leighton, an economist at CSE, notes that "while it is true that prices were increasing somewhat before passage of the Cable Act, the quality of services was rising at a faster rate.  The law capped rates, and, as one would expect, services dropped drastically."
<p>CFA's actions on the telecommunications front have been driven by the group's anti-free market ideology.  Railing against "increased concentration" in the industry is characteristic of CFA's enmity toward business and free enterprise.  A glance at CFA's policy resolutions shows that, on virtually every issue, CFA supports more government control and regulation over private action.  It opposes both the flat tax and a consumption-based income tax, supports taxpayer funding of political campaigns, opposes the line-item veto; opposes term limits; opposes a balance budget amendment, supports Canadian-style single-payer health care reform, and opposes medical savings accounts.
<p>Notwithstanding its clear ideological makeup, CFA has been enormously effective at getting its message out.  A Nexis search joining the terms "Consumer Federation of America" and "telecommunications" resulted in 459 citations since the beginning of 1995.  Even AT&T resorted to a CFA study in a television commercial as evidence of the baleful consequences of the then-pending telecom act.

<h3>Competition Policy Institute: Whose Interest is Served?</h3>
A new telecom "public interest" watchdog group was in the news recently when it was revealed that long distance giants AT&T and MCI were among its main sources of funding.  The Competition Policy Institute was co-founded in March by Ron Binz, former head of Colorado's Office of Consumer Counsel, and Debra Berlyn, executive director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates and a prominent critic of deregulation.  The group made the news when the <i>Washington Post</i> reported that John Windhausen had left his job as a Commerce Committee staffer for Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC) to work for CPI.  Hollings was a major force in crafting the 1996 Telecom Act.  CPI received $500,000 in seed money from AT&T, MCI, and other communications companies (see box for list of companies).
<p>A first look at CPI's advisory Committee would lead one to believe that it was simply another ideological advocate of big government.  It includes CFA's Stillman, as well as Rich McClintock of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) and Susan Weinstock of AARP.  Yet its mission will be to promote policies "that introduce competition in telecommunications and energy markets in ways that benefit consumers," focusing initially on implementation of the new telecom law.  Interestingly, in the group's press release, Binz specifically points to the need for "competition for local phone service."  But ironically there is no mention of competition in long-distance phone service.  The long distance providers bankrolling CPI are eager to enter the local phone markets.  They are not thrilled, however, at the prospects of the Bell Operating Companies (Baby Bells) entering their long distance business.

<h3>Children's Television: <br>
Effective and Constitutional?</h3>
Implementation of the Telecommunications Act is only one area attracting the attention of special interest nonprofits.  "Children's Television" remains a lively issue engaging the attention of activist groups.  The FCC announced recently that it will move forward to adopt a rule requiring broadcasters to air three hours weekly of so-called educational television.  This follows a barrage of statements by politicians and interest groups supporting a programming quota, an idea strongly supported by FCC Chairman Reid Hundt, alter ego of Vice President Gore.  President Clinton, the prominent advocate of school uniforms and curfews, also voiced his support.
<p>On May 29, Massachusetts' Rep. Markey held a press conference with representatives of supportive nonprofits to announce that 220 members of Congress  a majority of House members  had signed a letter urging the FCC to adopt the three hour rule and "defend the rights of children."  Markey had the support of the Consumer Federation of America, National Education Association, the U.S. Catholic Conference, Children's Television Workshop, the national PTA, and Children Now, to name a few.  Shortly thereafter, dubious holdouts at the FCC surrendered, clearing the way for adoption of the rule.
<p>Will the rule do what it's supposed to do?  Writing in the <i>Weekly Standard, American Spectator</i> media critic James Bowman observes, "The truth that everybody really does know, but doesn't quite say, is this:  TV, whether 'commercial' or 'educational,' isn't good for you. . . .  At best, television is light entertainment."  So-called educational television, notes Bowman, may only be marginally more beneficial to children than entertainment programming.  The skeptical critic argues that if contemporary children "have no intellectual context in which to place the constant stream of moving images, [they] will never gain anything of any educational use from it."
<p>First amendment expert Robert Corn-Revere, a partner at Hogan & Hartson and adjunct professor at Catholic University's law school, offers a second and more severe argument against a programming quota.  He notes that "no court has ever upheld a specific programming mandate by the FCC."  "Compelling speech is no different than censorship," adds Corn-Revere, who sees the three-hours-a-week proposal as further evidence that there is "less sensitivity" to constitutional concerns at the FCC these days.
<p>
<a name="ed"></a>
<h3>Center for Media Education</h3>
The Center for Media Education is a leading proponent of children's television mandates.  Headed by Jeff Chester, CME is the "designated successor to Action for Children's Television," a nonprofit founded by Peggy Charren, a longtime crusader against television advertising.  CME organized a coalition of groups that called for a mandate of at least one hour per day of educational programming.  
<p>CME has also received wide notice for its work to protect children from what it calls "exploitive media industry practices."  With major funding from the philanthropic Carnegie Corporation of New York, CME launched "Action for Children in Cyberspace" to fight "over-commercialization" and "manipulative forms of advertising."  Pursuing Charren's anti-commercialism theme, it has proposed new rules to restrict what it sees as "deceptive and unfair advertising practices" on the internet.
<p>Founded in 1991, CME has cultivated the concept of "electronic redlining," the notion that unless government and nonprofits intervene to protect the public interest the information highway will bypass the poor and minorities.  Along with CFA, it seeks to "protect consumers from price gouging and other abuses on new telephone and TV systems."  CME has called on the FCC to adopt special rates for nonprofits.
<p>CME has received funding from the Annie E. Casey, Maximilian E. & Marion O Hoffman, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, and Nathan Cummings foundations, and the Pew Charitable Trusts.
<p>
<a name="media"></a>
<h3>Media Access Project</h3>
The furthest left of the telecom nonprofit activists is the Media Access Project.  MAP got its start fighting on behalf of the FCC's fairness doctrine, which was supposed to provide equal time for alternative views.  While the fairness doctrine was also supported by some conservative groups (it was significantly repealed in the 1980s), MAP regarded it as a means to "open the networks to anti-war and civil rights activists."  Focused mainly on broadcast and cable, MAP supports government rules that promote minority and female ownership of telecom industries and policies that insure "access for divergent points of view and alternate artistic perspectives."  MAP shares office space in Washington, D.C. with People for the American Way, and the two groups work closely together.
<p>Like the Consumer Federation of America and People for the American Way, MAP is motivated by hostility toward free enterprise.  It wants to impose greater public interest requirements on broadcasters such as "free" airtime for political candidates.  It also favors regulations to restrict the concentration of ownership in the mass media, and it has criticized recent Baby Bell mergers.
<p>MAP opposes attempts to restrict indecent programming.  It attacked a 1992 law that encouraged cable TV operators to ban indecent programming on public access channels.  MAP Executive Director Andrew J. Schwartzman accused the legislation's sponsor, North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms of "trying to get cable operators to do the government's bidding."  Likewise, MAP joined a bevy of other parties, including the ACLU and People for the American Way, in challenging a 1995 Circuit Court ruling upholding limits on the hours during which indecent programming may be broadcast on TV.  The Supreme Court declined to review the lower court decision.
<p>MAP actually agrees, to a limited extent, with many conservatives on the issue of digital spectrum.  Conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation, as well as Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole, argue that the lucrative digital spectrum should be auctioned off rather than given to broadcasters as currently planned.  MAP opposes the idea of a corporate "give away," but not out of any desire to privatize the radio spectrum.  Instead, it wants to extort nonprofit giveaways.  It proposes that a portion of the money raised through auctions be diverted for "public purposes" like children's programming or public broadcasting  or to "fund nonprofit access to advanced telecommunications networks."
<p>Alternatively, MAP would have the FCC require broadcasters to reserve part of their frequencies for nonprofits or agree to carry additional "public programming" in exchange for the digital spectrum licenses which they want so desperately. 
<p>MAP has received funding from the Nathan Cummings Foundation and the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation.

<h3>The New Luddites</h3>
In the past decade communications has become the most dynamic sector of our economy.  The little-understood and as yet largely unimplemented Telecommunications Act of 1996 could arguably be the most significant piece of legislation passed by Congress in a long time.  It presents endless opportunities for growth and prosperity.  But like the Luddites of old, there are those eager to block change.  Fearing technology, or more accurately, fearing the loss of established political power that new technologies always undermine, they stand in the way.

Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole has proposed a charity tax credit, which will allow taxpayers to earmark a portion of their taxes ($500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for couples) to private and religious charities that spend over 75 percent of their money on poverty relief.  Dole said it would give Americans the choice of giving their money "to Big Government, or to Big Brothers and Big Sisters."

We observed the MAOIST INTERNATIONALIST MOVEMENT distributing its newsletter at the CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND rally "Stand for Children" on June 1.  There's no need to ask them for a copy; it's on the internet: http://ursula.blythe.org/mim
<p>
Unlike the Maoists, most rally participants were not so foolish as to favor the overthrow of the government that provides so much grant money to advocacy groups.  Among the horde of left-wing organizations endorsing the event, 102 received federal grants totalling over $392,468,000.  Participants who merited space at the official information tables included AARP, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SENIOR CITIZENS, SIERRA CLUB, NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION, SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION (SEIU), AFL-CIO, and the ETHICS AND MEANING group started by the first of Hillary Clinton's gurus, Michael Lerner.

Congress is expected to pass legislation making it easier for citizens to get information about tax-exempt groups.  The measure is designed to assist the public in getting access to the Form 990 that most nonprofits must file.  Under the proposed change, nonprofits would have to mail a copy of the form within 30 days of a written request. 
<p>
Former United States Attorney General and Capital Research Center Trustee Edwin Meese III is the advisory board chairman of a new research group that will focus on improving the management of America's corrections and prison system.  The ENTERPRISE PRISON INSTITUTE will explore the efficacy of prison industries and the potential for corporate involvement in prisons.

<h2>The Transportation Lobby: The Politics of Highway and Transit</h2>
<P>
<I><B>Social Engineers Compete with Special Interests in Drive
for Highway Dollars<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
by Peter Samuel
<P>
As anyone who drives to work knows, America's transportation policy
is in gridlock. Long steered by local interests, it is now hobbled
by the additional pestilence of an anti-growth ideology hostile
to roads and cars. As usual, taxpayers are the losers. New technologies
and privatization show promising potential. But transportation
lobbies have joined forces with environmentalists to stall innovative
efforts to relieve the nation's congested highways.
<P>
The automobile is an intensely ideological object. For the political
right, it is a symbol of freedom, fun and individual self-expression.
For the political left, it epitomizes consumerist excess and is
responsible for suburban sprawl, white flight, urban blight, and
the decline of community spirit. In <I>End of the Road: From World
Car Crisis to Sustainable Transportation</I>, author Wolfgang
Zuckerman sums up the view from the Left, declaring cars &quot;an
unchecked menace . . . to our hapless planet.&quot; Most Americans,
however, acclaim and even romanticize modern technology's greatest
contribution to individual mobility. Little wonder, then, that
political ideologues who are troubled by this development want
to restrict the free range of automobiles and seek public transportation
alternatives that organize mobility to achieve larger social goals.
As in the areas of energy and the environment, transportation
has become a target for Washington-based advocacy groups eager
to shape public policy.
<P>
But political advocacy tactics are also used by those whose livelihood
depends on America's love of cars. The highway lobbies have little
ideology beyond &quot;more roads,&quot; but they too see tax funding
as the only way to support their concrete interests.
<P>
<B>Cars Need Roads</B>
<P>
During the third quarter of this century America's cities were
substantially reshaped by an extraordinary spasm of gas-tax financed
highway construction. From 1957 through much of the 1960s state
highway authorities built an average of 2,000 miles of freeway
each year, a third of it in urban areas, in what has been rightly
called the largest public works program in world history. Ninety
percent of interstate freeway funding came from the federal government.
The hectic pace of early interstate construction was driven by
single-minded highway engineer technocrats; neither prices, costs,
nor alternative agendas entered their mental world.
<P>
Highway proponents brushed aside their early and feeble adversaries
the gas stations, motels, and small businesses bypassed by the
new freeways. But then liberals began to agitate. They complained
that aid to education and slum clearance deserved priority over
new highways. Urban freeways were especially controversial because
they required structural demolition. Fearful of losing battles
to anti-highway groups, highway planners looked for ways to appease
potential opponents. They came to accept in principle government
&quot;comprehensive planning&quot; of transportation and urban
land use and learned to adapt to federal oversight.
<P>
In 1973 the Nixon administration supported legislation that for
the first time allowed federal highway funds to be used for mass
transit projects. Washington, D.C. led the nation away from city
freeways. Other cities like Boston, San Francisco, and New York
City quickly followed. The highway lobby, apparently assuming
that tax revenues were limitless, shortsightedly supported federal
subsidies for rail, subway and bus transit systems, arguing that
they would complement highways.
<P>
The result? A national transportation lobby was created in Washington,
D.C. Once dedicated simply to more federal pork-barrel spending,
its appetites are beginning to change. The transportation lobby
increasingly represents the concerns of the social planners and
activists who voice a new ideology hostile to growth and concerned
about &quot;limits&quot; and &quot;sustainability.&quot;
<P>
Yet at least some of the ambitions of the new planning elite are
being thwarted: witness the overturn of the national 55 mile-per-hour
speed limit. In addition, federal spending cutbacks have targetted
transit more than highways in the FY1996 budget. Besides financial
pressures, the conservative political revolution is reviving entrepreneurial
alternatives to the transportation &quot;public works&quot; pork-barrel
and technological innovations are undermining the bicycle-to-work
ideologues. One all-but-forgotten American tradition the private
toll road has been rediscovered.
<P>
<B>Hey, Big Spender</B> 
<P>
Over $900 billion is spent annually in the United States on surface
road and rail transportation. It is not surprising, then, that
transportation looms large in federal handouts, or that there
is a formidable transportation lobby in Washington, D.C. Transportation
lobbies ranked second in campaign contributions $23 million to
Congressional candidates in 1994, exceeded only by labor unions.
<P>
Transportation funding is the purest political &quot;pork&quot;
for any congressman's district. News reports regularly cite Senator
Robert Byrd (D-WV) for his ability to bring huge dollops of highway
funding to West Virginia through arcane parliamentary maneuvers.
Byrd's colleague Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) is affectionately known
as &quot;Senator Pothole&quot; for the deftness with which he
delivers transportation bacon to his constituents. And in central
Pennsylvania, Route 220 is named &quot;Bud Shuster Highway&quot;
after the heroic efforts of Representative E.G. (Bud) Shuster
(R-PA) in securing funds for bringing an interstate-style freeway
spur 25 miles north from the state Turnpike to the town of Altoona
(population 51,000). Ann Eppard, a longtime administrative assistant
to Rep. Shuster was in the news recently for her success as a
lobbyist. Ms. Eppard has signed up Federal Express, Amtrak, American
Road and Transportation Builders Association and other prominent
members of the &quot;transportation lobby&quot; apparently on
the basis of her access to Rep. Shuster and her intimate knowledge
of how the Congress does transportation business. Conveniently,
Ms. Eppard retains her position as Rep. Shuster's Washington fundraiser,
according to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
The largest portion of the nation's transportation account is
spent privately on automobiles and freight. But the huge amount
controlled by governments is caught up in politics, lobbying and
advocacy.
<P>
Government spends over $70 billion annually on roads. By contrast,
the nationwide operating expense for transit train, subway and
bus transportation is a smaller but not insignificant $18 billion.
Only a little more than a third of this amount is covered by commuter
fares. Nearly two-thirds comes from taxes. At least until the
1994 elections, government spending on public transit has been
considered politically correct, with transit spending preferred
to highway spending: i.e., cars are bad, rail is good. Federal
grants for transit construction and equipment purchases have been
rapidly expanding from $3.0 billion in 1990 to $4.6 billion in
fiscal 1995.
<P>
Do motorists pay their way? This question is at the center of
many arguments over government transportation policy. The American
Public Transit Association (APTA), the chief lobbyist for the
transit systems, argues that motorists gain some $345 billion
in benefits while paying $44 billion in taxes, a net $301 billion
public windfall. However, highway interests, organized by lobby
groups such as the Highway Users Federation and the American Automobile
Association, calculate that motorists are net losers by $38 billion
annually, paying motoring-related taxes of $114 billion for only
$76 billion in road services.
<P>
Whatever the correct calculations, transportation economists agree
that there are major inefficiencies and inequities in the highway
and vehicle financing system. Some trucks and rush-hour commuters
pay too little. Light trucks and non-rush-hour motorists pay too
much. This is hardly surprising. Concentrated benefits, diffused
costs is an axiom of politics. Factions with a large and concentrated
interest in policy matters will tend to prevail over members of
the general public, who individually have a relatively small interest
and no way to voice it.
<P>
<B>The Song of the Open Road</B> 
<P>
For an illustration of the transportation lobby, consider the
trucking industry. It is represented by the American Trucking
Associations (ATA), a nonprofit 501(c)(6) trade group that provides
representation at the federal level for a federation of fifty
state associations. ATA has a budget of $35 million, a staff of
300, and an array of spinoff subsidiaries:
<UL>
<LI>TruckPAC, its political action committee;
<LI>The ATA Litigation Center, a non-profit law firm;
<LI>The ATA Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) research and education unit;
<LI>Team 2000, a grassroots network;
<LI>Deliver USA, an educational and publicity outfit;
<LI>TransSat, a satellite-based trucking broadcasting and news
service;
<LI>and the ATA Federation, which brings other industry transportation
groups within its compass.
</UL>

<P>
ATA successfully lobbied last year for passage of the National
Highway System (NHS) bill, which makes nearly 170,000 miles of
road eligible for federal aid. ATA President Thomas J. Donohue
also demands protection of the Highway Trust Fund from diversion
to &quot;non-highway purposes such as Amtrak and mass transit
funding.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Diversion&quot; is the term that the highway lobbies use
when they fight battles for taxpayers' money. The Highway Trust
Fund, created by legislation in 1956, is the U.S. Treasury account
from which money is drawn for federal highway aid. Its most spectacular
accomplishment was the completion of the Interstate Highway System,
first mapped in 1947. Current efforts to defend the Fund from
raids by transit and Amtrak are not new.
<P>
But the Highway Trust Fund, like the Social Security Trust Fund,
is a fiction. A real trust fund has a dedicated set of objectives
and independent trustees who control it. The so-called Highway
Trust Fund is merely a Treasury account drawn on annually as Congress
sees fit through the appropriations process. Since the 1970s,
federal government highway funds have been used for transit projects,
a &quot;diversion&quot; of funds that was regularized in 1983
when a separate Mass Transit Account was established within the
Highway Trust Fund. In this way, taxpayers' monies are used not
for highway expansion and improvement, but to fulfill the social
engineer's dream of remaking America. The image of a small north
European country where commuters happily walk or peddle to the
local tram terminal for their morning ride to work comes to mind.
<P>
<B>Toll Roads: Pay-As-You-Go or Highway Robbery?</B> 
<P>
How inevitable is the battle of special interests over public
highway funds? One alternative may be private toll roads, which
recently have been rediscovered by policymakers. Toll roads can
alleviate traffic congestion, spur economic development, and answer
commuter complaints without resort to the massive expenditure
of public funds. Financially strapped practical politicians are
begining to vie to be seen at toll road ribbon-cutting ceremonies.
And federal and state legislation on private toll roads is not
as obstructive as it once was. Despite continued resistance from
highway departments and interest groups, attitudes toward toll
roads are changing in the 1990s.
<P>
There has been bipartisan political support for the investor-owned
Virginia Dulles Greenway and for California's State Route 91 Express
Lane, the world's first all-electronic toll facility, which has
no cash collection plaza. Opened on December 27, it is the first
toll facility to be based on congestion relief pricing: $2.50
toll in rush hour, 25 cents off-peak.
<P>
The California state government is negotiating with private interests
for two additional major toll roads that are likely to be built
in southern California before the end of the decade. Similar projects
are being considered in Richmond, Virginia; the Seattle-Tacoma
area; and in Michigan. Government-built toll roads have opened
in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, California and Texas during
the 1990s.
<P>
State turnpikes with revenues of $5 billion annually are ripe
for privatization if free enterprise-inclined state governments
opt for reform. And private toll roads are being built internationally
in Canada, Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Thailand, Taiwan, China and Australia.
<P>
The rediscovery of the toll road may be largely a product of the
budget crunch, but toll roads should encourage policymakers to
recognize that transportation policy does not have to centered
in Washington. In fact, initial construction of what now constitutes
the Interstate Highway System was primarily a series of state
undertakings that began in earnest without major federal aid.
California and other western states relied on state gasoline taxes.
Other states financed highway construction through tolls imposed
by state highway departments or state-established turnpike or
tollroad commissions. They borrowed construction money from the
capital markets on the security of the future stream of revenues
that tolls would generate.
<P>
But tollways have been unpopular. Highway toll charges are visible
and irksome when motorists have to wait in line to pay. Consequently,
there is a ready constituency for `freeing' highways: This has
occurred on Connecticut I-95 and its parkways, I-30 between Dallas
and Fort Worth, Route 36 between Denver and Boulder, and I-95
from Richmond to Petersburg. Moreover, tolls' visibility put them
at a disadvantage to the invisibility of the gas tax, which is
simply added to the price of gasoline at the pump, unlike most
other consumer goods. Toll roads have thus been handicapped in
the battle for consumer opinion. The introduction in 1990 of electronic
tolling, however, has removed a major obstacle to their popular
acceptance.
<P>
<B>The Highway Lobby</B> 
<P>
But toll roads are also opposed by a formidable array of advocacy
organizations. Foremost among them are The American Automobile
Association, the American Highway Users Alliance, and the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
<P>
The American Automobile Association (AAA) has always adamantly
opposed toll roads and called for &quot;free&quot; public roads.
Founded in 1902, the famed AAA, along with the farmers' National
Grange, was instrumental in the passage of the Federal Highway
Acts of 1916 and 1921. This legislation established the policy
that public roads should be planned nationally by an independent
federal agency, the Bureau of Public Roads.
<P>
AAA is a huge non-profit: it has 38 million members, 113 state
and regional clubs, and 37,000 fulltime staff in the U.S. and
Canada. A nonprofit but fully taxable corporation without stockholders,
AAA, in effect, establishes its state and regional clubs as franchises
with which it has various confidential revenue-sharing arrangements.
AAA's 34 million U.S. members pay an average fee of $30. It claims
to be the largest publisher of travel material in the world. Further,
it generated $2 billion in 1994 travel agency sales, has 3.8 million
AAA/Visa and Mastercard holders, and contracts with over 13,000
local garages to provide emergency road services to members.
<P>
AAA's government affairs office in Washington, D.C. has a staff
of 12. Its headquarters staff of 1,000 is in Orlando, Florida,
ironically probably the most heavily turnpiked city in the world.
<P>
The Highway Users Federation is another influential lobby that
favors the maximum construction of untolled roads. HUF was established
by General Motors in 1932 on the not unreasonable assumption that
healthy GM auto sales required plenty of roads.
<P>
Renamed the American Highway Users Alliance at the end of 1995,
this 501(c)(6) trade organization is backed by the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association, the American Trucking Associations,
and the American Petroleum Institute. AHUA is directed by William
Fay, who previously headed the Product Liability Coordinating
Committee, a tort reform group. It has about 500 corporate and
invididual members, a $2 million budget, and a staff of 12 in
its Washington, D.C. headquarters.
<P>
The most influential highway lobby, however, is the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), a 501(c)(3)
with a current annual budget of $14 million. AASHTO represents
all 50 state highway and transportation agencies and several regional
agencies that build federally-funded roads and transit systems.
Headed since 1980 by Francis Francois, a patent attorney and former
Maryland county politician, AASHTO has a Washington staff of fifty.
<P>
AASHTO's relations with federal roads agencies have been almost
incestuous. The federal government's Bureau of Public Roads (BPR)
was a full member of the organization for many years and BPR's
long-serving chief, Thomas H. MacDonald (1919-1953), was a fanatical
hater of tolls. These sentiments echo in the Federal Highway Administration,
BPR's successor agency, which, in its 1976 bicentennial history
of American highways, referred to the toll promoter as a &quot;highway
parasite&quot; seeking a &quot;stranglehold&quot; on travel and
commerce.
<P>
<B>The New Road Warriors</B> 
<P>
Before new and technologically-efficient toll roads become an
answer to rush-hour gridlock, one other political hurdle must
be overcome. The old highway interest groups are forming alliances
with public transit advocates. Since 1990, the major barrier to
new highways has been the Clean Air Act. It gives the EPA virtual
veto power over new highway construction. Under pressure, the
highway builders have begun to work with transit groups.
<P>
Symbolizing this change, highway lobby groups have added the &quot;T&quot;
for Transportation to their names: AASHO is now AASHTO. The contractors'
lobby, the American Road Builders Association (ARBA), is now ARTBA.
And the Institute of Traffic Engineers became the Institute of
Transportation Engineers.
<P>
As the highwaymen scramble to re-position themselves, mass transit
has placed its lobbying power in the American Public Transit Association
(APTA). Another 501 (c)(6) trade association, APTA's $12 million
budget comes from some 500 transit agencies around the country
and from the private companies that sell them equipment and services.
APTA's staff of 70 is housed in an office not far from Metro Center,
Washington D.C.'s busiest subway stop. It can claim considerable
credit for influencing the flow of federal transit appropriations,
its top priority.
<P>
APTA has financed a major grassroots campaign, Transit NOW, that
stages rallies and telephone and letter-writing campaigns to sway
members of Congress in transit-dependent districts. Linked to
organized commuter groups, APTA can mobilize the grassroots in
political contests. Its press relations are excellent: it offers
a regular fax service to correspondents and a well-produced weekly
newspaper.
<P>
<B>Progressive Transportation</B> 
<P>
The Surface Transportation Policy Project (STPP) is the latest
special interest entry in the struggle for public funds. Just
as advocates of &quot;progressive philanthropy&quot; want to replace
traditional charity workers with 
social activists, so also do a new breed of transportation policy
experts aim to replace fact-and-figures transportation technocrats.
STPP is a 501(c)(3) group of environmentalists, Naderites, urban
planners and public transit proponents that seeks to tighten enforcement
of the Clean Air Act and to increase transit's share of federal
highway funds. These funds, totalling an incredible $151 billion,
are currently authorized under the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA, or, as it is called, &quot;Ice-tea.&quot;)
<P>
A coalition of over 100 groups without formal membership, STPP
has a $3 million annual budget which supports a staff of ten.
Its steering committee includes representatives of the National
Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, National Wildlife
Federation, Citizen Action, American Public Transit Association,
AARP, the Bicycle Federation, and assorted energy conservation
groups, architects and preservationists.
<P>
STPP's well-argued publications reflect the convictions of policy
ideologues who are more committed to `taming' highways than to
building them. By contrast, the highway lobbies publish materials
that reflect what one researcher has called the tendency of the
highway business to be dominated by engineers from blue-collar,
small-town backgrounds without the education or experience to
fight ideological political warfare.
<P>
STPP's founder and director is Hank Dittmar, former chief lobbyist
for the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
Most of its funding comes from the Nathan Cummins Foundation,
the Energy Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the James C. Penney
Foundation and the Surdna Foundation.
<P>
<B>The New Ideology of Transportation</B> 
<P>
By the late 1990s, highway agencies that once proudly extolled
the benefits of new road construction have been reduced to subsidiaries
of transportation departments dedicated to &quot;transportation
demand management,&quot; or TDM as it is known. TDM is an off-shoot
of environmentalist concepts such as &quot;demand side management&quot;
and &quot;integrated resource planning&quot; that first appeared
in energy policy. Under this philosophy electric utilities, for
instance, are supposed to invest in &quot;negawatts&quot; rather
than megawatts: they are encouraged to promote conservation measures
to <I>reduce</I> energy demand. These buzz words embody the policymaker's
conviction that a well-functioning economy should suppress demand
rather than expand supply. They represent a repudiation of consumer
sovereignty and free markets.
<P>
The TDM ideology of &quot;limits&quot; is apparent in government
transportation programs with titles like ECO (employee commute
options), ETR (employee trip reduction), HOV (high occupancy vehicles-only)
lanes, and carpool propaganda and subsidization. Transportation
departments now tout the special virtues of bicycling, telecommuting,
and riding transit. They insinuate that auto use, especially single
driver auto use, reflects greed, consumer ostentation and insensitivity
to civic virtue. The form of transportation you use is no longer
a private preference. It represents a social morality. The supposed
&quot;imbalance&quot; in the auto/highway system is blamed for
urban &quot;sprawl&quot; i.e. low-density detached housing and
shopping malls and for the decline of central city neighborhoods,
crime, pollution, even global warming.
<P>
Transportation has thus become another battleground in which those
with &quot;the vision of the anointed,&quot; in Thomas Sowell's
felicitous phrase, war with the benighted masses besotted with
cars.
<P>
Few areas of daily life affect people more than transportation.
And few areas are more in need of serious reform. The first step
is realizing that the solution will not be found in perpetuating
government's current monopoly in roads. Rather, it will be found
in new technology and in privatization efforts that are just now
showing signs of catching on in America. As always, this will
entail battling a host of entrenched forces, who, because of interest
and ideology, can be counted on to defend the status quo. 
<P>
<br>
<I>The author, Peter Samuel of Frederick Maryland, has written
about transportation issues for numerous publications. He recently
prepared a report on highway privatization for the Cato Institute.</I>

<h2>Campaign for Human Development Part II: The Chicago Story</h2>
By Scott Weinberg
<P>
<I>Editor's note: In <a href="/crc/trends/ot-0995.html">September</a>, we reported on the worsening problems
of the Campaign for Human Development, the U.S. Catholic bishops'
anti-poverty crusade, whose help for the poor is compromised by
its support for discredited welfare policies and the 60s era activists
who promote them. As last month's issue went to press, CHD supporters
were gathering in Chicago to celebrate the organization's 25th
anniversary. Scott Weinberg, co-author of our September report,
attended the conference and reports on what he saw.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<br>
On August 25-28, over 2,000 activists descended on the posh Hyatt
Regency in Chicago. They came to celebrate the 25th anniversary
of the Campaign for Human Development to meet old friends and
make new connections, in short, to tell their stories. Over the
course of the weekend the conference participants learned new
ways to raise money, discussed how to expand their constituent
bases, and familiarized themselves with the latest organizing
techniques. They heard from academics, reporters, prelates, and
professionals in the politics of protest. They networked, debated
future strategies, and discussed their vision of social justice.
<P>
The event was not unlike other gatherings of liberal activists
except for one thing. This conference was arranged by a program
run by America's Catholic bishops.
<P>
<B>Grassroots Leadership</B> 
<P>
In the atrium, clusters of participants reclined in marbled porticoes
before the opening reception in the Grand Ballroom. Here, I met
Naomi Swinton, who invited me to her fundraiser. Swinton is a
gay and lesbian rights activist for Grassroots Leadership, a CHD-funded
group from North Carolina.
<P>
CHD provided $25,000 to Grassroots Leadership in 1994. As we noted
last month, the North Carolina-based group promotes environmentalism,
abortion rights, homosexual rights, and sundry other liberal causes.
According to its own literature (distributed at the CHD conference),
Grassroots Leadership &quot;works closely with . . . all major
southern movements and organizations, including civil rights,
women, labor, lesbian and gay, environment, peace and religious
action.&quot;
<P>
Swinton is typical of many of the participants. She explains that,
though she has not had that much experience with Catholics, she
hopes CHD can transform what she sees as an autocratic Church.
&quot;I would like to see [CHD] to continue to work on the Catholic
Church . . . presenting a progressive Catholic voice in America.&quot;
<P>
Grassroots Leadership, Swinton explains, is working against &quot;the
right-wing, reactionary, Christian Right&quot; and especially
against Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), who she considers &quot;.
. . one of the most racist politicians in the Congress.&quot;
<P>
Why should a program of the U.S. Catholic bishops, supported by
parishioners' donations to the collection plate, support Grassroots
Leadership? Indeed, even some recipients of CHD benefactions seemed
pleasantly surprised by CHD grantmaking. Duke Schempp, a pro-choice
Catholic and president of a CHD-funded organization in North Dakota,
remarked following Kahn's workshop, &quot;I hear a lot of people
talk in the hallways . . . `My God! I can't believe they're funding
that here!' And these are the constituents of the CHD!&quot; He
concluded, &quot;I hope CHD encourages groups to get out of the
church, because if people knew what social justice was, they wouldn't
be sticking money in the collection every year.&quot;
<P>
(Schempp noted that the chairman of his organization works at
an abortion clinic. &quot;It makes it a little tense when it comes
to doing something with the diocese,&quot; he said.)
<P>
<B>The Politics of Envy </B>
<P>
Several recurring themes punctuated the conference. The arguments
and rhetoric of class warfare were particularly in evidence, and
nowhere was the language of envy and resentment more articulate
than in Cornel West's keynote speech at Saturday's &quot;Interactive
Plenary Session.&quot;
<P>
West is a professor of religion and African-American studies at
Harvard University. The topic of his speech was &quot;A Current
Socio-Political-Economic Analysis.&quot; The following are excerpts:
<P>
&quot;. . . anytime you talk about poverty in America, you also
have to come to terms with the pernicious and vicious legacy of
White Supremacy . . . and you begin to hit up against issues of
patriarchy, insubordination, and wealth . . . We are living in
one of the most frightening and terrifying moments in the history
of the nation. . . .
<P>
&quot;And believe you me, there will never be enough police and
prisons to deal with the avalanche of despair . . . There's no
serious talk about the fact that one percent of the population
owns 48 percent of the financial wealth. That sounds oligarchic,
plutocratic . . . pigmentocratic . . . The ultimate logic of a
market economy is the gangsterization of culture . . . The marketplace
. . . is an extension of the laissez-white supremacy . . . Same
as those with homophobia, keeping trapped the humanity of gay
brothers and lesbian sisters.&quot;
<P>
West, an increasingly well-known public speaker, recently joined
other celebrities and Hollywood leftists like Ed Asner and Whoopi
Goldberg to rally support for convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal.
In an open and shut case, Jamal was convicted and sentenced to
death for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel
Faulkner, who was found with a bullet in his back and another
between his eyes.
<P>
Although it took the jury less than four hours to convict Jamal
of first degree murder, the case has oddly become a cause celebre
for extremists seeking to rekindle the passions of the 1960s.
They now claim that the &quot;mediagenic&quot; Jamal, a former
radio commentator and militant activist, was framed. West has
even compared him to Martin Luther King.
<P>
The third world rhetoric of haves and have-nots was not limited
to Cornel West. Bertha Lewis of Brooklyn ACORN, the radical community-action
group, echoed West's revolutionary rhetoric: &quot;You gotta continue
to organize! `Cuz I'm gonna tell ya the rich and those other folks
[in Congress] CHD can be the foundation for poor people to be
organized in this country, to overcome these walls and bring the
money down!&quot; Rudolph T. Juarez, president of the CHD-funded
Quad Cities Interfaith in Davenport, Iowa, concurred, &quot;Whoever
has the money has the power.&quot; &quot;Endemic to human society
[is that] the big guy has all the power and authority . . . so
what we try to do is spread it around a bit more,&quot; said Juarez.
<P>
<B>Sin and the Republican Contract</B> 
<P>
The absence of diversity was another hallmark of the conference.
Participants were overwhelmingly left-liberal. They shared an
implacable belief in the ability of government to cure society's
ills. And they were united in their enmity toward conservatives,
the Republican Congress and, especially, House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
<P>
Pablo Eisenberg, executive director of the Center for Community
Change, a sort of roundhouse for leftist activists, went furthest
in his attacks on conservatives. In an interview with me, Eisenberg
branded conservatives in Congress as &quot;anti-American, anti-people,
anti-democratic . . . anti-Christian and anti-faith; intolerant,
bigoted.&quot; To him, CHD is &quot;an attack on all the conservative
values the Christian coalition claims it has.&quot; Later, he
added the observation that the Pope is too conservative, and that
&quot;If there was a progressive Pope, everything in the CHD would
be fine.&quot;
<P>
Even discounting a speaker's flattery of his hosts, Eisenberg,
a veteran activist-organizer and Washington fixture, acknowledged
CHD's strategic importance: He observed that without CHD funds
&quot;more than half of the organizing in this country would not
be taking place.&quot;
<P>
At a reception on Friday, Ray Schomaker from the Communities United
for Action in Cincinnati commented that the Contract With America
only &quot;favors the rich and shuts out the poor. That's the
complete antithesis of what we're all about here.&quot; Sister
Marion Dillon, the CHD diocesan director for the Philadelphia
archdiocese, said: &quot;Most people here are against the Contract
for America because Newt Gingrich's contract puts a hold on all
that CHD is trying to accomplish.&quot; Chicago ACORN activist
Sammie Sim told me that Newt Gingrich wants to starve children.
<P>
Such fevered personal attacks were common. In another interview,
Kathleen Sherred, an activist from the CHD-funded Mon Valley Unemployed
Committee in Pennsylvania, charged that Senator Rick Santorum
(R-PA) &quot;isn't Catholic. He thinks that if you were born poor
it's your fault . . . Santorum is against the spirit of CHD. Anyone
but God can fall. Santorum thinks he is God and he will fall.&quot;
<P>
I met Pat O'Bryan, Catholic Social Action Director from Cleveland,
Ohio, on Saturday evening just before the Gala dinner. &quot;Republican
defense spending is up,&quot; said the affable and idealistic
O'Bryan, &quot;but they're balancing the budget at the expense
of social programs to the detriment of the poor.&quot; 
O'Bryan describes Newt Gingrich as &quot;a right-wing intellectual
and demagogue. I think he buys his stuff so well then couches
it in intellectual terms that it's almost a fundamentalist faith.
He's like a fighting dog. He knows just where to bite . . . After
Newt has destroyed the Democrats, it's up to people like us to
find a third way.&quot;
<P>
Returning from an ACORN rally, I came across Andres Sarabia, a
CHD diocesan director from Texas. Speaking with me outside the
hotel, he argued that &quot;CHD helps community organizing provide
the forum, the legitimacy, for anger.&quot; If guilt often goads
the conscience of the liberal upper-middle class philanthropist,
arguably anger motivates the activist. And Sarabia is angry at
conservatives: &quot;The Republicans are saying to young families,
`you don't have a job, that's your fault; you're uneducated, that's
your fault; you don't have a place to live, that's your fault.'
They put all the blame on young families, but society doesn't
take the blame for nothing. What they are saying is that you don't
matter. You're insignificant in our master plan, our contract
on America.&quot;
<P>
Society is at fault and must accept responsibility: this is a
hallmark of CHD thinking and explains the group's emphasis on
collective blame over individual responsibility. The view was
elaborated by Ernesto Cortez, head of the Southwest district of
the Industrial Areas Foundation, a major recipient of CHD money
and the organization founded in Chicago in 1940 by the late Saul
Alinsky, the father of community organizing. Speaking with fervor
and zeal during a Sunday panel discussion, Cortez, the organizer's
organizer, argued that Catholics will have to atone for the sins
of the Republicans: &quot;I'm reminded that all of us as Catholics
are going to have some explaining to do on Judgment Day . . .
when we look at the folks [in Congress] that we gotta explain.
Because unfortunately, our responsibility isn't just individual.&quot;
<P>
In coarse tones, the balding activist added, &quot;We're going
to have to explain as a people, as a community, as a Church, what
we did about these folks. Because Phil Gramm didn't get elected
by an act of God. Dick Armey didn't get appointed by the pontiff.
Tom DeLay didn't just happen. He didn't come out of the head of
Zeus . . . although he's a pretty dumb fellow. I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to say anything people would take offense at. But I didn't
think anyone would take offense at my referring to Tom DeLay as
cognitively challenged.&quot;
<P>
Those who vote for Republicans may not commit a sin, but clearly
it is a sin not to do everything possible to prevent them from
doing so.
<P>
<B>Radical Religion, Imperialism, and Sister Lucy</B> 
<P>
It is unlikely that those with non-traditional views of the Church
itself would feel anything but at ease at the conference. CHD
has often been criticized for giving free rein to advocates of
liberation theology. Participants at the conference were open
about their support for liberation theology and quick to criticize
the so-called institutional church.
<P>
Pat O'Bryan looks to the third world for the answer: &quot;We're
going to find our consciences, our sense, soul, and mind in the
third world . . . Europe is thrashing about; they've gone right-wing
too.&quot; &quot;The CHD in the U.S. and the whole world does
what liberation theology does in Central America. . . .&quot;
Louann Shea from Catholic Charities in Chicago, whom I met in
the hotel lobby, offered the opinion, &quot;My view on poverty
is that when the Church crumbles, and it will, all that's left
are individuals standing on their own two feet.&quot;
<P>
In many cases, CHD conference-goers were critical of what they
see as the autocratic nature of the Church. Often they questioned
fundamental matters of faith on issues such

as the ordination of women. Jan Valder, a former CHD national
committee member who served on the celebration's Educational Moment
Committee, sees CHD transforming &quot;both society and the Church.&quot;
She would like the Pope to be &quot;a little different on women's
issues. Women don't have an equal role in the Church. If you look
at the institution without talking about ordination but you could
talk about that, too.&quot; She is critical of the Church's &quot;overwhelming
male-centeredness.&quot;
<P>
Sister Marion Dillon opines that &quot;Women priests will come
after a married clergy, but not in John Paul II's lifetime.&quot;
She notes that a lot of the people at the celebration oppose the
Pope because he is considered too conservative.
<P>
In short, what the British call &quot;loony-leftism&quot; permeated
the conference. In the exhibit area, I came across an elderly
nun peddling &quot;Lucy's cards&quot;: greeting cards with themes
blending environmental mysticism with feminism: &quot;. . . see
woman whom I have ordained;&quot; &quot;earth mother . . . goddess
mother . . . Sophia spirit breath of the Holy Jesus Son of Mary;&quot;
&quot;praise our goddess in her universe.&quot; The cards are
the creation of Sister Lucy, a Dominican nun from Racine, Wisconsin.
<P>
The moderator at a session titled &quot;Catholic Social Teachings
101&quot; asked participants to provide examples of &quot;structural
sin.&quot; Said one participant, &quot;I was thinking in terms
of structural sin when `imperialism' was written [on the board].
I would say that structurally we are part of a system that exploits
third world countries . . . That's a part of our government. .
. .&quot;
<P>
Another participant offered: &quot;Imperialism is our support
of the Contras in Nicaragua. They [the Sandinistas] had the public
revolution. Our government wasn't happy with the result. We broke
international law by mining the harbors, by funding [the Contras]
when Congress agreed not to fund them . . . People like Ollie
North, and others, broke our laws.&quot;
<P>
<B>CHD and ACORN: Together Again</B> 
<P>
It wouldn't be a CHD event without a media stunt by the Association
of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). As past editions
of <I>Organization Trends</I> have noted, ACORN is a radical pressure
group well-known for its disruptive antics. ACORN chapters across
the country have greatly benefited from generous funding from
CHD.
<P>
ACORN activists from across America took advantage of the CHD
conference to &quot;do a job&quot; on Chicago's Whole Foods Grocery
Store. Calling themselves the &quot;Red Brigade&quot; and wearing
t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan &quot;ACORN &amp; CHD,&quot;
the activists boarded six buses that departed from the Hyatt for
the protest. Most were older black women led by a handful of young
white activists.
<P>
Ted Thomas, ACORN's negotiator, explained the group's objectives:
&quot;We have a hiring hall. What we want to do is make an agreement
with them that they will hire a number of people . . . from our
hiring office. The next step is to see that they get the minimum
of $7.70 what we call a living wage . . . If we hear that our
workers aren't being treated fairly or squarely, we have to go
back and put more actions on them.&quot;
<P>
Just what is wrong with Whole Foods?
<P>
According to activist Marcia Ericksen of ACORN Minnesota, &quot;The
workers are young and they don't know how to organize . . . My
impression [about Whole Foods] is that they're posing as not selling
processed foods . . . Whole Foods is a new type of market based
on the co-op model of having organic food but it's supplied to
people on a larger scale mass market than the co-op model.&quot;
The protesters expressed concern that Whole Foods could put co-ops
out of business.
<P>
Apparently, ACORN regards Whole Foods as some sort of sinister
health foods conglomerate. According to another ACORN organizer,
&quot;Whole Foods attracts the same kind of audience as co-ops
. . . They were originally hippie entrepreneurs who sold out big
to corporate management . . . They have board members in the military
establishment, but I'm not positive about that. They use new age
ideas to market old capitalistic ideas.&quot;
<P>
As usual, the facts conflict with ACORN's claims. Activists unfurled
a banner inside the store which read &quot;We Can't Survive on
$4.25,&quot; and they demanded more ethnic representation in hiring.
However, I spoke with Paul, an employee, who reports that Whole
Foods employees, most of whom are members of minority groups,
start at $7.00 per hour. The store's managers are a black male
and a white woman. The chain's regional president is Mary Kay
Hagen. Paul says that Whole Foods offers great benefits. &quot;It's
a great job.&quot;
<P>
As ACORN workers chant, &quot;A-C-O-R-N, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE WILL
RISE AGAIN,&quot; Steve, another Whole Foods employee, comments:
&quot;The public chooses. That's what makes the country what it
is. The public chooses with their shopping dollars. If the public
did not like what we were selling and where we were, then we would
not be able to survive.&quot;
<P>
Steve's comments were clear and are accepted by most Americans.
It is unfortunate that CHD does not appear to understand or accept
them. Individual freedom, choice, competition and cooperation
are implicit in Steve's off-hand description of how Whole Food's
consumers, managers, and employees relate to one another. But
they seem alien to the ACORN protesters and to the CHD program
officers who distribute the funds raised from Catholic parishioners.
<P>
In his opening address, Chicago's Archbishop Joseph Cardinal Bernardin,
honorary chairman of the CHD 25th anniversary celebration, noted
that &quot;The CHD is the church's best-kept secret.&quot; Indeed
it is.

<h2>Campaign for Human Development: Worse Than Ever
</h2>
<I><B>Anti-Poverty Program Celebrates 25 Years. Conference Features
Marxist Professor and Pro-Abortion Speakers.</B></I>
<P>
<br>
Prepared by freelance reporter Scott Weinberg
and <I>OT</i> Editor <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Pambianco">Bob Pambianco</a>
<P>
<i>Editor's Note: This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Campaign
for Human Development, the 60s-era anti-poverty program of the
American Catholic Bishops. As this issue goes to press, activists
from across America are gathering in Chicago during the last weekend
in August to celebrate the occasion and to reflect on CHD's accomplishments.
For our part, we see little to celebrate. CHD remains a source
of funds for the radical left, supporting groups and causes that
promote class division and espouse beliefs antithetical to Catholic
social teaching. In this issue, we examine some of the notables
who will address the Chicago gathering, and also focus on CHD's
activities in the Southwest. Regrettably, the picture is a dismal
one. In a later issue, we will provide an in-depth report on just
what happened at the Chicago conference.</I>
<P>
<br>
Every year at Thanksgiving time, American Catholics are called
upon to contribute to the Campaign for Human Development, the
anti-poverty program of the American Catholic bishops. Informed
that CHD is an innovative &quot;self-help&quot; program offering
the poor a hand-up not a hand-out, the faithful make generous
contributions over $230 million to CHD since its inception. What
they are not told, and what the bureaucrats at CHD do not want
them to know, is that most of CHD's money goes to support liberal
activists who use it to teach people how to organize and agitate
for more government spending programs. Even worse, CHD-funded
activists are often openly disdainful of the teachings of the
Catholic Church, whose offerings they gladly accept. This year's
collection is scheduled for the weekend of November 18-19.
<P>
<B>CHD Sociology and Theology</B> 
<P>
Far from offering an innovative approach to poverty, the Campaign
for Human Development operates on the same assumptions as Lyndon
Johnson's War on Poverty. Rather than encourage individual striving
and responsibility, CHD focuses on the so-called root causes of
poverty. Rather than offer the poor the example of success and
guidance in achieving it, CHD explains why poverty is the system's
fault and teaches how to radicalize institutions. Rather than
champion faith to challenge society's spiritual emptiness, CHD's
good news is that organizing around &quot;issues&quot; builds
coalitions and creates political power.
<P>
CHD vociferously claims to be nonpartisan, but almost all of its
activities fall on the left often the far-left side of the ideological
spectrum. CHD-funded groups invariably favor public policies that
require state intervention and decisionmaking. And they build
support for their positions by resorting to the rhetoric of class
consciousness and the tactics of social conflict.
<P>
What is worse is that CHD has established a long track record
of funding groups whose activities many Catholics would find repugnant.
CHD grantmaking guidelines essentially allow it to finance any
organization whose <I>primary</I> focus is in accord with Catholic
social and moral teaching. However, other concerns may be directly
at odds with Church teaching. Thus, what should be CHD's goal
acts instead as a disclaimer, enabling CHD to avoid responsibility
for the positions of groups it funds.
<P>
CHD claims to be a witness to Catholic social justice. But Dr.
Francois Orsini, founder of the St. Antoninus Institute for Catholic
Business in Education, observes that CHD solutions preclude genuine
Christian social action. By concentrating on tried-and-failed
methods of victimization and blame, CHD undermines the individual's
capacity for spiritual, moral and social renewal. &quot;In the
long run,&quot; Orsini concludes, &quot;the CHD is a mockery of
Catholicism that hurts rather than helps the poor.&quot;
<P>
<B>Who's Celebrating CHD? </B>
<P>
The announced line-up of speakers at CHD's August 25-28 anniversary
conference in Chicago is a social register of its radical outlook.
Among the featured luminaries are a Marxist college professor,
pro-abortion and pro-gay rights activists, and a strident opponent
of school choice.
<P>
<B>Cornel West.</B> A Harvard philosophy professor and avowed
Christian-Marxist, West regards American democracy as a bridge
between Christian revelation and Marx's dialectical materialism.
The <I>New York Times</I> describes him as &quot;a progressive
socialist in the age of triumphant capitalism&quot; and notes
that he was introduced to Marxism through his involvement with
the Black Panthers, the sixties black-power group.
<P>
In his book <I>Prophecy Deliverance!</I>, West posited that the
fate of Western civilization is in the alliance between Afro-American
religious thought and progressive Marxism. The &quot;relative
absence of progressive Marxism in American society is exacerbated
by the reluctance of American Marxism as a whole to take seriously
indigenous American radicalism . . . A distinctive virtue of progressive
Marxism linked to prophetic Christianity is the ease with which
it can cooperate with non-Marxist progressive movements.&quot;
<P>
West is an &quot;honorary chair&quot; of the Democratic Socialists
of America (DSA), a political party-turned-nonprofit lobby that
shares his yearning for a new political Left. Founded by the late
Michael Harrington, DSA operates on the premise that &quot;our
economic system places too much power in the hands of too few
people&quot; and &quot;seeks nothing less than the freeing of
the human mind and spirit through the radical restructuring of
our economic, social, and political institutions.&quot;
<P>
<B>Dolores Huerta.</B> Like West, an &quot;honorary chair&quot;
of the DSA, Huerta is co-founder and vice president of Cesar Chavez's
United Farm Workers of America. A committed abortion-rights activist,
she was a featured speaker at the National Organization for Women's
pro-abortion rally in Washington in April. An avowed feminist,
she believes that &quot;Men are taught to dominate and have power
over people&quot; and that &quot;Women are a colonized group.&quot;
Proposals to end affirmative action and reform welfare are part
of a &quot;get-back-to-the-kitchen movement,&quot; she says.
<P>
Huerta's views on abortion are incompatible with the Catholic
view of moral life and her politics are the antithesis of the
pro-life cause. She advocates taxpayer-funded abortions and opposes
even modest efforts to restrict abortion.
<P>
In 1990, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported that she was a
member of a commission set up by NOW to determine the feasibility
of establishing a third political party devoted to feminist issues,
in particular support for abortion on demand.
<P>
In 1990 Huerta was involved in an attempt to block President Bush's
motorcade, joining protestors demanding an end to United States
involvement in El Salvador and more money for AIDS. A <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> account reports that &quot;several American flags
were set fire&quot; and protesters unfurled a banner proclaiming
&quot;U.S. out of my Uterus.&quot;
<P>
<B>Bertha Lewis.</B> It is appropriate that the list of speakers
include Bertha Lewis of Brooklyn ACORN. The overtly radical ACORN
(Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) has been
a long-time and major beneficiary of CHD munificence. In 1994,
CHD provided $436,000 to fourteen ACORN groups across the country.
<P>
Accomplished in pressuring banks to finance its housing programs,
ACORN is not so much an advocacy group as a strong-arm gang. Earlier
this year, it gained notoriety for disrupting a meeting featuring
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In March, ACORN activists burst into
a meeting of the National Association of Counties just before
Gingrich was scheduled to speak, banging on lunch trays and shouting
&quot;Nuke Newt!&quot; Later, the group interrupted a House Committee
hearing <BR>
on low-income housing loans. Several ACORN leaders were arrested
and taken into custody by the Capitol Police.
<P>
The Clinton administration scrambled to deny association with
ACORN, cutting off funds to the Acorn Housing Corporation, which
had received a $1.1 million federal grant to support 42 AmeriCorps
national service volunteers. Acorn Housing Corp. unsuccessfully
argued that it was a completely separate nonprofit organization,
one which just happened to share headquarters with ACORN, and
just happened to be founded by ACORN.
<P>
<B>Winona LaDuke.</B> She is co-chair of the Indigenous Women's
Network (IWN), a Minnesota-based group that addresses the concerns
of American Indian women. Earlier this year, the group sponsored
a tour by a feminist rock-and-roll band, the Indigo Girls. Audience
members filled out protest cards and listened to nightly speeches
by LaDuke.
<P>
&quot;Our activism is definitely spiritual in nature,&quot; a
band member told the <I>San Diego Union-Tribune</I>, which noted
the Indigo Girls' support for &quot;. . . Greenpeace and assorted
abortion-rights, gun control and AIDS-relief organizations.&quot;
<P>
LaDuke is the founder of the CHD-funded ($50,000 in 1994) White
Earth Land Recovery Project (WELR). For failure to pay taxes,
the White Earth Indian tribe lost over 800,000 acres of land in
Minnesota, some of which was later acquired by the Catholic Church.
The Project is working to reacquire the land.
<P>
<B>William Greider.</B> A supporter of the methods of Saul Alinsky
and Ralph Nader, Greider is a middle-aged liberal journalist who
has found a home as political editor at <I>Rolling Stone</I>,
the magazine for middle-aged liberal fans of rock music. Greider
is an outspoken opponent of school choice programs. As assistant
managing editor of <I>The Washington Post</I>, Greider in 1981
blasted neoconservatives &quot;living proof that even intellectuals
can be dangerous&quot; for supporting school privatization efforts.
Tuition tax credits, long-supported by Catholic parents and educators,
were denounced by Greider as a racially-motivated sop to the rich
likely to wreck Washington, D.C.'s public schools, &quot;just
when they are getting their act together.&quot;
<P>
D.C. schools have never gotten their act together. The Bishops
are on record supporting the concept of school choice. But Greider
is in tune with the staff at CHD. Last year, Timothy Collins,
CHD's deputy executive director told <I>Organization Trends</I>
that CHD does not support programs promoting school choice because
it is not a &quot;poor people's&quot; issue. For his part, Greider
takes the teachers' union line that private schools deliberately
keep out the &quot;unwashed.&quot;
<P>
In <I>Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy</I>,
clearly the title for a pundit's tome, Greider proclaimed, &quot;America
has become a nation where monied interests and elite organizations
dominate the discourse and the process whereby government makes
decisions.&quot; More colloquially, in a July 1995 <I>Rolling
Stone</I> debate with P.J. O'Rourke, Greider dismissed the argument
that only individuals, not government, create wealth as &quot;silly
and flatly wrong.&quot; State power was needed to &quot;confront
the destructive side effects of capitalism&quot; and the &quot;malefactors
of great wealth.&quot;
<P>
<B>Rep. Marcy Kaptur. </B>A Democratic Congresswoman from Ohio
and former CHD national advisory committee member, Kaptur's voting
record and political career embodies CHD's swing to the left.
According to <I>The Plain Dealer</I>, a Cleveland, Ohio newspaper,
Kaptur, once a rank and file pro-lifer, now believes that &quot;The
majority of my constituents feel that government funding should
not be used to support abortion, but they recognize that families
who choose it should have the legal right to do so. I am trying
to make sure the health [care] bill reflects that.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, the National Right to Life Committee gave Kaptur a 44
(out of 100) in its scorecard of abortion-related votes in Congress.
She has voted against parental notification and for funding of
the United Nations Population Fund.
<P>
<B>Pablo Eisenberg.</B> A veteran of the War on Poverty and the
Johnson administration's Office of Economic Opportunity, Eisenberg
is the chief theorist of the community organizing concept that
informs CHD operations. He is the executive director of the Center
for Community Change (CCC) in Washington, an organization dedicated
to redistributing wealth through higher taxes and increased social
spending. Funded by a raft of liberal philanthropies, the Ford
Foundation in particular, CCC functions as a hub and clearinghouse
for thousands of community-based organizations.
<P>
The Center has helped identify new funding sources for left-wing
activists and was instrumental in creating the National Committee
for Responsive Philanthropy, itself a past recipient of CHD funds.
In 1993, <I>Organization Trends</I> called attention to the fact
that the Committee issued a major report attacking the pro-life
movement.
<P>
<B>Si Kahn. </B>Part professional activist and part singer-songwriter,
Kahn's tunes, in the words of the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>, are
&quot;anthems of social justice.&quot; The conference itinerary
lists Kahn as one of the entertainers at the event, as well as
a workshop leader.
<P>
During a 1985 show, Kahn sang a song about Senator Jesse Helms
getting pregnant and begging for the abortion he outlawed.
<P>
Kahn heads a North Carolina group called Grassroots Leadership
which he founded fifteen years ago. In 1994, CHD contributed $25,000
to Grassroots Leadership, a group whose mission is &quot;to promote
racial causes, women's freedom of choice, gay and lesbian rights,
and environmental issues,&quot; according to <I>The Plain Dealer</I>.
<P>
Kahn says, &quot;My work is explicitly political,&quot; a remark
that exemplifies what is wrong with CHD.
<P>
<B>Radical Grace: Industrial Areas Foundation and Albuquerque
Interfaith </B>
<P>
The network of interlocking CHD grant recipients provides further
evidence of how CHD operates and of the radical nature and ill-effects
of its work. 
<P>
A major recipient of CHD funds is the Industrial Areas Foundation.
CHD has provided millions of dollars $5 million between 1991 and
1993 alone from Catholics of good will to IAF groups across the
country. IAF was founded by the late Saul Alinsky whose organizing
methods serve as a model for CHD. A founding father of social
activism, Alinsky wrote <I>Rules for Radicals</I>, whose credo
inspires and teaches: &quot;To hell with charity; the only thing
you'll get is what you're strong enough to get.&quot;
<P>
In October of 1994, a group called Albuquerque Interfaith (AI)
received a CHD grant of $50,000 &quot;to help that group become
a broad-based community organization.&quot; Albuquerque Interfaith
works with the Industrial Areas Foundation to develop methods
of church-based organizing in order to recruit new members. So-called
interfaith alliances enable church groups to transform themselves
into political action centers to mobilize and agitate for the
progressive cause of the day. The head of the Southwest district
of the Industrial Areas Foundation is Ernesto Cortez, one of Saul
Alinsky's chief disciples.
<P>
A founding organization of the Albuquerque Interfaith network
is the Albuquerque-based Center for Action and Contemplation (CAC).
Its role, according to the Center's founder Rev. Richard Rohr,
is &quot;to question the bourgeois, middle-class world view,&quot;
&quot;to challenge the middle class and the White,&quot; and &quot;the
middle-class attitudes in America that are oppressing us.&quot;
The CAC is committed to &quot;collaborating with other organizations
endorsing a similar vision and philosophy.&quot;
<P>
The character of that vision and philosophy can be gauged in CAC's
newsletter <I>Radical Grace</I>, which blends Saul Alinsky's social-activist
polemics with liberation theology. According to <I>Radical Grace</I>:
&quot;Our times cry out for renewed political vision . . . We
challenge any political litmus test that distorts the independent
moral conscience that faith can bring into politics . . . We are
deeply concerned about the subversion of prophetic religion .
. . when the gospel message is turned upside down to bring more
comfort to those on top of society than those at the bottom.
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> asserts that &quot;The almost total identification
of the Religious Right and the new Republican majority in Washington
is a dangerous liaison of religion with political power.&quot;
Yet mixing politics with religion is exactly what <I>Radical Grace</I>
and CHD practice.
<P>
The newsletter renounces dogma and tradition, promotes radical
feminism, and announces &quot;Reinventing the Masculine&quot;
and &quot;Reconstructing Sexuality&quot; seminars. Nestled among
notices common to any parish bulletin (breakfast at a homeless
shelter; celebrating the feast of St. Anthony) are events that
deal with &quot;rediscovering and claiming the feminine soul&quot;
and &quot;Reconstructing Business Relationships and Corporate
America.&quot;
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> is openly contemptuous of Church teaching
on the role of women in the Church. Christina Spahn writes, &quot;I
do not look to the Vatican for assurance of my place in the Church
today.&quot; She complains that efforts to &quot;remind the Vatican
that women <I>could</I> be named as Cardinals . . . have been
vastly ignored.&quot; The &quot;institutional church,&quot; she
says, &quot;is flawed by sin, fear, and the comfort of the familiar.&quot;
<P>
Another article carps about the &quot;repression of women in the
Church.&quot; &quot;We have been denied what many of us believe
to be God-given privileges,&quot; says the author.
<P>
<B>Political Activism and Abortion</B> 
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> politicizes the sacred by rewriting the Apostles
Creed, referring to God as the mother and father of nonviolence,
and Jesus Christ as a &quot;victim of the death penalty.&quot;
Its &quot;all inclusive&quot; communion of saints numbers Gandhi,
Martin Luther King Jr., Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, and &quot;.
. . the whole of humanity in the great dance of life.&quot;
<P>
A CAC volunteer, Sister Mary O'Keefe, confirmed by phone that
she supports choice in abortion, and dissents 
from Rome on most moral issues. O'Keefe says she is praying for
the Pope's conversion. O'Keefe also confirmed that her views are
largely shared by most of the CAC staff.
<P>
CAC's new president is Richard Heim, a former secretary of the
New Mexico Department of Human Services who was instrumental in
introducing Medicaid-funded abortions to the state. Heim, a Catholic,
repeats the Planned Parenthood line that if &quot;the state undertakes
funding of medical care of the poor, which includes funding for
childbirth, the state cannot also deny funding for abortion,&quot;
according to <I>The Albuquerque Tribune</I>. 
<P>
Heim also serves as &quot;core leader&quot; at the Aquinas Newman
Center in Albuquerque, which works with Albuquerque Interfaith
seeking &quot;supporters in large numbers to demonstrate broad-based
support for corrective action by professional and elected leaders.&quot;
<P>
Members of local church congregations are questioning why their
communities have such close ties to IAF. As a consequence, a number
of churches have withdrawn their affiliation with Interfaith movements
because of that relationship.
<P>
Most notable is the withdrawal of El Divino Redentor Church in
McAllen, New Mexico. Petitioners recount IAF's tactics: &quot;Although
joining in this movement was authorized by committee, it is not
favored by the membership in general,&quot; the petition from
the Methodist congregation stated. The congregation reasoned that
the &quot;objectives of this organization [Valley Interfaith]
are of political pressure and this is contrary to the purpose
of this church;&quot; and it concluded that if &quot;things continue
as they are, our congregation will be destroyed.&quot; The church
called for a service of reconciliation to &quot;renounce membership
in Valley Interfaith.&quot;
<P>
A parishioner at Albuquerque's St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church,
Mrs. Joan Higgs, underscores what is troubling Catholics about
the Campign for Human Development. Higgs recalls the original
CHD collections over twenty years ago: &quot;I believe everyone
used to think the CHD was the Church's [standard] collection for
the poor.
<P>
&quot;It sounded good and so we naturally made the effort to contribute.
Now, as we object to that kind of political action in our church,
my family no longer contributes.&quot;
<P>
Higgs remembers meeting Interfaith activist, ex-priest Tim McCluskey.
She recalls a man quite simply unable to accept &quot;no&quot;
for an answer. His appeals to have &quot;our parish accept an
AI alliance amounted to endless talk, never a prayer, and endless
`discussion.' She concludes, &quot;I believe there is something
wrong with politics being an essential part of our congregation's
affiliation, and so we no longer contribute to the CHD collection.&quot;
<P>
<B>What is Wrong With the CHD?</B> 
<P>
CHD contends that its work is impelled by Scripture, modern Catholic
social teaching, and the &quot;pervasive presence of poverty in
the United States.&quot; Yet the evidence suggests otherwise.
<P>
In fact, Catholic scholars and clerics argue that the CHD abuses
&quot;the pervasive presence of poverty in America&quot; to advance
a liberal political and social agenda. A Midwest diocesan director
for CHD, who asked to remain anonymous, regards the lack of clear
articulation about the Campaign's principles as a danger which
lends itself to abuses. A priest, the CHD director said he doesn't
go out of his way to promote the collection: &quot;We've included
the CHD collection with two others on the same day,&quot; he remarked.
<P>
Commenting on the overall functioning of the CHD, the director
commented that CHD is &quot;in the hands of a few well-intentioned
people who don't do their homework about the projects they fund
nor seem to care to.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It is sad how most Catholics think that CHD money goes to
church projects, when in fact it does not,&quot; he concludes.
<P>
Once again, we call on the America's Catholic bishops to initiate
a desperately-needed overhaul of the Campaign for Human Development.
The problems with CHD are legion. Given the deep-rooted and institutional
nature of the problems, as well as the Campaign's flawed premises,
we seriously doubt whether mere reform is possible. Nevertheless,
we urge the bishops to rein in this program. The bishops themselves
must exercise active oversight, not rubberstamp decisions by CHD
professional staff. At a minimum, they should recognize an obligation
to be honest with parishioners about the aims and activities of
CHD.
<P>
We look forward to the day when there will be no need to report
on the Campaign for Human Development. And we are confidant that
this day will arrive because, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis
once said, the glare of scrutiny is &quot;the best of disinfectants.&quot;
<P>
Meanwhile, we strongly urge parishioners to withhold their contributions.

<h2>The National Trust for Historic Preservation<BR>
</h2>
<br>
<a href="/crc/about/people.html#Pambianco">Robert V. Pambianco</a>, Editor
<P>
<I>Editor's note: The National Trust for Historic Preservation,
a taxpayer-funded nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting
national historic sites, offers a prime example of how opponents
of economic development use the political process to achieve their
ends. Thoroughly elitist in its disdain for popular interests,
the Trust carries a worthwhile goal to extremes: it is hostile
to property rights, doesn't mind trampling on freedom of religion,
and keeps in step with the latest dictates of political correctness.
</I>
<P>
<br>
The National Trust for Historic Preservation was chartered by
the U.S. Congress in 1949 to &quot;protect buildings, sites, and
objects significant in American history and culture.&quot; Over
the years, it has encouraged Americans to better appreciate the
significance and beauty of many places in American history. It
has acquired and manages eighteen historic &quot;house museums,&quot;
including the homes of President James Madison, President Woodrow
Wilson, and Naval hero Captain Stephen Decatur, as well as three
Virginia plantation mansions.
<P>
The Trust has capitalized on the interests of a new generation
of Americans who enjoy travel, antiques, home re-decorating, and
the &quot;finer things.&quot; Its high-toned bimonthly magazine
features people restoring old houses and groups renovating picturesque
local properties. It is filled with advertisements for expensive
vacation spots and has an extensive real estate section. The Trust
sponsors tours to exotic places around the globe Istanbul, Venice,
Carthage, Cape Town, Victoria Falls, Imperial Asia often aboard
cruise ship, yacht, clipper ship, or the Orient Express.
<P>
In recent years, the Trust's mission has moved beyond the preservation
of noteworthy sites. The meaning of historic preservation has
been transformed as the Trust has broken new ground in public
policy, adopting controversial positions on legal and constitutional
issues and using historic preservation as a vehicle to promote
an anti-growth agenda. Perhaps fearful that it will be tagged
as a defender of old-money illusions of bygone days or as a commercial
promoter of yuppie lifestyles, the Trust now dedicates itself
not only to protecting historic places but also &quot;historic
environments,&quot; the &quot;livability of our communities,&quot;
and &quot;diversity.&quot;
<P>
The Trust has a budget of $33 million and total assets of $68
million. Its president is Richard Moe, former chief of staff to
Walter Mondale. A 501(c)(3) organization, it receives one-fifth
of its budget from the federal government through a grant from
the National Park Service.
<P>
The $7 million grant is part of an annual $41 million appropriation
for the Historic Preservation Fund, $33 million of which goes
to State Historic Preservation Offices.
<P>
<B>Constitutional Concerns: the Fifth Amendment</B> 
<P>
The Trust's activities touch on two contentious constitutional
issues. The first relates to the Fifth Amendment to the Bill of
Rights, which states that the government may not seize property
for public purposes without just compensation. With that Amendment
in mind and as part of the Contract with America, property rights
proponents in Congress have proposed so-called &quot;takings&quot;
legislation, which requires federal agencies to compensate property
owners whose land has been devalued by government regulatory mandates.
(The Private Property Protection Act of 1995 has been passed in
the House of Representatives; similar legislation is awaiting
action in the Senate.)
<P>
Even though the legislation would not limit government's authority
to declare a property to be a historical landmark, the National
Trust has joined with the environmental movement and a raft of
other liberal constituencies in opposing takings legislation.
<P>
The Trust argues that takings bills will have an &quot;adverse
impact on efforts to preserve and protect our important and irreplaceable
historic and cultural resources.&quot; George Abney, a legislative
assistant at the Trust, says that &quot;To minimize compensation
costs, agencies ultimately could choose to ignore regulations.
Federal, state, and local governments could lose their ability
to protect public health, safety, and welfare not to mention historic
resources.&quot; In addition, the Trust contends that the legislation
threatens clean water safeguards and the federal wetlands permitting
process, which the Trust says &quot;are often critical elements
in the fight against suburban sprawl.&quot;
<P>
In the courts the Trust has also sided with opponents of property
rights. In <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, an Oregon case, the
U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled, in a significant setback for
land-use controllers, that the City violated the Fifth Amendment's
takings clause in requiring a property owner to turn over a portion
of her property for a bike path as a condition of receiving a
development permit. The Court held that city officials could not
justify commandeering 10 percent of her lot. The Trust filed an
<I>amicus</I> brief in support of the city.
<P>
<B>The First Amendment</B> 
<P>
Attempts to restrict property rights can also raise First Amendment
concerns especially when preservationists set their sights on
local churches. Classifying a church as a historical landmark
raises more than the takings issue; it raises the fundamental
issue of religious freedom enshrined in the First Amendment.
<P>
The Trust and the preservation movement have gone to battle against
churches in a number of cases. Increasingly, they seek to restrict
freedom of religion with historic preservation ordinances that
prohibit the faithful from altering their houses of worship. The
preservationists seem to mistake the purpose of a church. Like
those who attend church for chamber music concerts, preservationists
would protect churches for their aesthetic value or historic significance.
<P>
First Covenant Church in Seattle fought a legal battle with preservationists
in the early 1990s. &quot;The fact is the church isn't a building,&quot;
said Richard Sundholm, First Covenant's chairman, &quot;it is
a congregation.&quot; &quot;The church, as we see it, has a mission,&quot;
he told the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>. &quot;If the mission changes,
and we need to do something different, we are incredibly hampered
because we are a landmark.&quot; The National Trust rejected this
argument and supported city efforts to have the church declared
a landmark. In 1992, the Washington Supreme Court held that Seattle's
actions were unconstitutional.
<P>
Other churches have been less fortunate. St. Bartholomew's Episcopal
Church in Manhattan is perhaps the best known instance of a church
which fought to protect its mission from preservationist encroachment.
The church wanted to tear down its community center and replace
it with an office tower, hoping to use the revenue from the tower
to finance its social service programs for the needy. St. Bartholomew's
argued that by severely limiting its ability to raise money through
development of the property the landmark law had impaired the
church's ability to carry on its ministerial and charitable activities.
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the New York Board
of Rabbis filed briefs in support of the church. The National
Trust sided with the city's landmarks commission which won its
case in the federal appeals court in New York.
<P>
The Trust even has the audacity to cite the First Amendment against
those who attempt to exempt churches from landmark controls. In
a 1990 lawsuit, the Trust and the Landmarks Preservation Council
of Illinois charged that an amendment to Chicago's landmark ordinance
violated the First Amendment's establishment clause. The measure
provided that a church could not be declared a landmark without
the consent of its owner, and it was used by the Archdiocese of
Chicago to block landmark designation for St. Mary of the Angels
Catholic Church. The preservationists argued that the amended
ordinance conferred an unconstitutional benefit on religion.
<P>
Similarly, in 1994 the Trust opposed a bill introduced in the
California legislature by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown which
would bar local governments from designating churches as historic
landmarks. The measure had wide support in both houses of the
legislature and was supported by the San Francisco archdioceses.
<P>
James Bovard, author of <I>Lost Rights: The Destruction of American
Liberty</I>, has pointedly observed of landmark laws that, by
forbidding changes in religious architecture, &quot;these ordinances
in effect dictate that people may pray only in government-approved
spaces.&quot;
<P>
The Religious Freedom Act, signed by President Clinton in November
1993, was passed in response to a Supreme Court decision which
was considered by many too restrictive on the practice of religion.
When it was first introduced in Congress the text of the bill
provided that any burden on religious freedom had to be justified
by a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest. But the National
Trust successfully pushed for a change in the legislative language
stating that only a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on religious
freedom requires a compelling government interest. In non-legal
language, this would appear to mean that the state can impinge
on religious freedom as long as the impingement is not substantial.
<P>
It is ironic that the preservationists, in seeking to uphold history,
appear ignorant of a crucial part of early American history. That
is, in their zeal to preserve history (actually symbols of history)
they are willing to trample on the principle of freedom of worship,
which was a driving force behind the settlement of the American
colonies and the founding of the Republic. In the name of history,
preservationists seek to tell churches what they can and cannot
do.
<P>
Writing in <I>National Review</I>, Bovard quips that &quot;If
the historic-preservation movement had been as strong in the tenth
century as it is now, the magnificent Gothic cathedrals of the
Middle Ages might never have been built. The preservationists
would have been outraged at the demolition of eighth century stone-block
churches . . . and would probably have run to the nearest king
for an injunction.&quot;
<P>
<B>Battleground: The Trust versus Disney</B> 
<P>
All this reveals something else about the preservationist cause:
it defends elite privileges. As in the St. Bart's case, preservationists
often fight political and legal battles against local churches,
neighborhood groups, and social service providers. Bovard recounted
a 1993 attempt by the District of Columbia to designate hundreds
of buildings in the Logan Circle neighborhood as historic landmarks.
The effort led the <I>Washington Post</I> to comment that &quot;The
debate over the historic designation has become a fight between
a group of mostly white, affluent residents . . . and a disparate
cast of social service providers and black parishioners.&quot;
To Rev. Beecher Hicks, pastor of Metropolitan Baptist Church,
the supporters of the historic district designation &quot;. .
. have filed this application to prevent such unhistoric activity
as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and caring for children
proliferating in our neighborhood.&quot;
<P>
Philosophers and historians have recorded how social and political
elites use the powers of the state to help themselves at others'
expense. What was true in the past applies as well to the contemporary
politics of education, regulation, or affirmative action. And
it is especially apparent in the imposition of public restrictions
on private land use, as in the successful campaign to keep the
Walt Disney Company out of Northern Virginia.
<P>
The National Trust was a leader in the fight to prevent Disney
from building its history theme park in Virginia's Prince William
County. The battle pitted Hollywood activists, academics, and
Washington groups against the Governor of Virginia, the local
elected officials, and the people of Prince William County who
stood to gain from the park's construction.
<P>
In its assault on the Disney project, the Trust argued, in Richard
Moe's words, that the project &quot;would spell disaster for the
countryside.&quot; In an open letter to Disney Chairman Michael
D. Eisner, Moe and Trust Chairman Henry Jordan insisted that the
park would &quot;stand as a superscaled specimen&quot; of urban
sprawl. Historian David McCullough, author of the best-seller
biography of Harry Truman and one of the Trust's point men, called
it a &quot;development blitzkrieg.&quot;
<P>
McCullough, a member of the Trust board, typified its outlook.
In the Trust's bimonthly newspaper, <I>Historic Preservation News</I>,
he warned that development of the Disney project &quot;will swamp
the battlefield; it will all but blot it out . . . It will surround
it with congestion, traffic, parking lots, gas stations, T-shirt
shops, souvenir stores, fast food places, motels, hotels, offices.
Any spell that one feels at the Manassas battlefield as is without
the visual intrusion, not to say the noise, that will come with
this massive development that spell will be gone. It won't be
the same . . . It will be hard to be alone there. It will be impossible
to stand and just listen to the silence.&quot;
<P>
McCullough was prepared to deprive the people of Virginia of jobs
and the benefits of economic growth and deny millions of Washington-area
visitors the theme park's family-oriented entertainment and, yes,
instruction in American history because he wanted to be &quot;alone&quot;
at Manassas, without masses of visitors disturbing the &quot;spell.&quot;
<P>
Of course, the campaign for and against the Disney project had
many ironies, among them the Disney Company's intensive lobbying
to secure state funding for roads and improvements to its proposed
private development. But that the Trust, a group dedicated to
America's past, fought to halt construction of a park focusing
on American history was the greatest irony of all. McCullough
compared Richard Moe's efforts against Disney to General George
C. Marshall's leadership. But Marshall was charged with running
the U.S. Army in World War II and later reconstructing Europe,
not returning it to a state of nature. Virginia Governor George
Allen's quip was more apt: &quot;History is not just for historians.
And it is not just for smug, self-appointed arbiters of culture
and Hollywood movie stars. It is for all our citizens or it should
be.&quot;
<P>
Mindful of their vulnerability to the charge of elitism, the Trust
was careful to argue that the issue was the location of the project,
not Disney's capacity to interpret American history. McCullough
did once refer to the project as &quot;McHistory,&quot; but this
was a mistake he didn't repeat, according to <I>Washingtonian</I>
magazine.
<P>
Perhaps the project would have been &quot;McHistory.&quot; But
not everyone with three kids and a camper can afford to learn
history National Trust-style. &quot;Travel with fewer than 95
passengers aboard the splendid <I>Regina Renaissance</I>,&quot;
says the notice for the Trust's &quot;Red Sea Passage&quot; tour
to Egypt and Jordan.
<P>
<B>Wal-Mart: Public Enemy</B> 
<P>
Partly to refute allegations that it is indifferent to consumer
preferences and to the economic consequences of market forces,
the Trust promotes the economic benefits of historic preservation,
i.e. property values will rise, investment capital will be attracted
and businesses created by different kinds of preservation projects.
Left unsaid is the consequence that some preserved places will
become so costly that they will be commercially inaccessible to
those with modest means.
<P>
Certainly the Trust's recent campaign against Wal-Mart stores
suggests a hostility to consumer preferences. The Trust, headquartered
in the former home of Andrew Mellon on Washington's stately Embassy
Row, rallies opponents of the merchandise discount chain. Wal-Mart
has become the bane of anti-growth groups, labor unions and environmentalists.
Preservation elites believe Wal-Mart is a supreme symptom and
creator of the so-called &quot;sprawl&quot; they loathe. Sprawl
has become the &quot;major issue galvanizing the preservation
movement today,&quot; says the Trust's 1994 annual report.
<P>
In a recent issue of <I>Historic Preservation News</I>, Jonathan
Walters posits that &quot;sprawl-spawning megastores&quot; like
Wal-Mart have become &quot;public enemy number one&quot; in the
battle for the &quot;soul of small-town America.&quot; While Wal-Mart
is the biggest offender, preservationists have also set their
sights on K-Mart, Home Depot, Builder's Square, and price clubs
like Price/Costco and Sam's. The May/June issue of <I>Historic
Preservation News</I> noted approvingly that the Vermont Environmental
Board voted to deny Wal-Mart a permit to build on a field outside
the town of St. Albans.
<P>
Preservationists prefer places where people &quot;. . . can walk
from one destination to another.&quot; The Trust says it does
not oppose Wal-Mart per se, but prefers them to locate in &quot;smaller,
more sensitively designed stores in downtowns. . .&quot; Of course,
that is antithetical to the whole idea behind Wal-Mart: an easily
accessible big store built on cheap land and selling almost everything
at low prices. Wal-Marts and similar stores may not be as quaint
as Georgetown shops but they usually offer consumers more for
less.
<P>
The Trust is coordinating anti-superstore activity and serves
as a national clearinghouse of information for a growing network
of &quot;sprawlbusters.&quot; For $12 members can purchase <I>How
Superstore Sprawl Can Harm Communities (and What Citizens Can
Do About It),</I> a Trust guide for those who want to fight megastores.

<B>A New History?</B> 
<P>
The Trust's hostility toward Wal-Mart reveals how far it has strayed
from its original mission. The anti-Wal-Mart crusade is less about
preserving history than it is part of a general campaign against
suburban development. In this campaign, historic preservation
functions more as an argument than an objective.
<P>
As the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> noted as far back as 1991, &quot;America's
premier preservationist group has changed its ideas of what is
history and how to preserve it.&quot; When it was chartered by
Congress, the Trust concentrated on buildings and places associated
with great persons and events in early American history. In other
words, what it preserved had to be historical, not merely old.
<P>
Judging by stories in its newspaper, the Trust today seems concerned
with much that is of negligible historical significance and often
not very old:
<UL>
<LI>the Joan of Arc Plaza in New Orleans (erected in 1971), which
includes a 19th century statue of Joan of Arc and two French cannons;
<LI>a vintage McDonald's restaurant in Downey, California;
<LI>the Fair Park's Texas Centennial Building in Dallas built
in 1936;
<LI>a 1940 addition to a Georgia department store built in 1924;
<LI>a 1925 Honolulu bank;
<LI>Detroit's Tiger Stadium.
</UL>

<P>
The Trust newspaper also reports on efforts to save the world's
largest katsup bottle erected in 1949 in Collinsville, Illinois.
And in 1993, the group placed the entire state of Vermont on its
list of &quot;America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.&quot;
<P>
<B>Joining the Advocacy Chorus</B> 
<P>
The Trust's transformation was apparent from the program of its
1994 annual National Preservation Conference, whose theme was
&quot;Preservation, Economics, &amp; Community Rebirth.&quot;
<P>
One conference session on &quot;Redefining Historic Preservation:
Toward a New Preservation Manifesto&quot; asked the questions:
&quot;Has the field passed its image by? [and] Is it time for
a new definition?&quot; This &quot;advanced&quot; session explored
the idea of &quot;Getting beyond history and aesthetics to a new
paradigm of `human wholeness.'
<P>
The new paradigm consists of the &quot;five Rs&quot; of historic
preservation:
<UL>
<LI>restoring historic buildings, neighborhoods and human lives;
<LI>reweaving the built environment;
<LI>rebuilding authentic community;
<LI>reconstructing the local economy;
<LI>renewing human connections.
</UL>

<P>
The Trust's sympathy with &quot;diversity,&quot; the latest buzzword
in political correctness, was manifest in sessions on &quot;Making
Preservation Happen in Geographically, Politically, and Culturally
Diverse Communities&quot; and in a reception sponsored by the
African-American Landmarks Committee of the Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana, &quot;celebrating cultural diversity in
the preservation movement.&quot;
<P>
Besides workshops and seminars, the event included tour activities.
Some were unavoidably associated with historic preservation, like
a visit to Boston's North End. But there was also an &quot;Eco
Tour&quot; of the Boston Park Plaza hotel enabling participants
to see an &quot;environmentally sound&quot; hotel that integrates
&quot;environmental action into all daily decision making.&quot;
<P>
The Trust had come a long way from preserving the homes of founding
fathers and military heroes.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B> 
<P>
In view of the well-documented historical illiteracy of Americans
it is certainly worthwhile to protect the physical evidence of
our nation's past. But history is more than its remains. Age alone
and architectural significance give less value to Monticello than
its association with Thomas Jefferson. If preservation policies
violate the principles and ideals of American history including
property rights, the free exercise of religion, and entrepreneurship
then they are too high a price to pay. Preservation cannot be
used by privileged groups to deny others their rights or the benefits
of progress.
<P>
Preservationists must ask themselves whether their pursuit of
the past does violence to the lessons of American history. Congress
must ask whether continued taxpayer support for the National Trust
for Historic Preservation is justified.<P>

<p><blockquote><i>"...if they want to proclaim a truth or propagate some feeling by the encouragement of a great example, they form an association. In every case, at the head of any new undertaking, where in France you would find the government or in England some territorial magnate, in the United States you are sure to find an association. I have come across several types of association in America of which, I confess, I had not previously the slightest conception, and I have often admired the extreme skill they show in proposing a common object for the exertions of very many and in inducing them voluntarily to pursue it."

Alexis de Tocqueville, <br>
<i>Democracy in America</i>
<p>
Greyhound rescue associations are in the finest tradition of American voluntarism. Thanks primarily to their efforts, tens of thousands of racedogs who would have been euthanized once their racing days had ended  now are adopted into loving families.  Not only are ex-racers family companions, they are also used therapeutically to lift the spirits of the sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. 
The spirit that Tocqueville admired in American civil society takes many forms. <i>Philanthropy, Culture & Society</i> is committed to bringing you these stories.

Lucy Salsman is a small grey-haired woman with a warm smile and a New Hampshire accent that is not often heard in central Texas.  The retired nurse answers the door of her two-story suburban house north of Austin in a T-shirt that reads "Adopt a 45 m.p.h. couch potato" and sports a picture of a greyhound asleep on a couch.  At first glance, there's nothing to set Salsman's house apart from her neighbors', unless it's the sign on her gate with a picture of a running greyhound and the words, "I can reach the gate in two seconds.  Can you?" 
<p>Inside, Joshua, a large (waist-high), brindle (sort of tiger-striped) greyhound, who raced in Oklahoma under the name "Get 'em Home Alone," greets me at the door with a desultory sniff.  He's a sleek dog, with bony haunches and a slight limp that comes from some kind of degenerative disease in his hip.  Not finding me particularly interesting, Joshua ambles back to his blanket laid out behind a couch in front of a window.  In the middle of the room is a large pet carrierthe kind used on airplanes.  A dozing brown greyhound wearing a white T-shirt rests inside.  Lucy has had "Nameless" for less than an hour, just time to bathe him and put him in the crate to rest after a long day of travel.  He had been found wandering alongside I-35 near Waco, an hour and a half north of Austin. Because the dog had ear tattoos that marked him as a racing greyhound, a breeder kept him for a few days until the dog could be brought to Austin and placed with Lucy. She provides foster care to retired greyhounds through an organization called Greyhound Pets of America/Austin (GPA/A). 
<p>The Austin chapter, like hundreds of groups across the country, seeks to find adoptive homes for retired racing greyhounds. With the help of cooperating racetracks, breeders and trainers, GPA and other groups have saved thousands of dogsand perhaps the greyhound industry itselffrom almost certain death. 
<p>Greyhounds are beautiful dogs with an ancient pedigree.  Fans of the breed brag that they are pictured in art dating back to ancient Egypt.  During the middle ages, only noblemen could own them.  Though greyhounds were originally used for hunting rabbits and other small game, the dog's speed clocked as fast as 45 mphmade them a natural for racing in England and Ireland.  
<p>In the United States, the dogs have always been working dogs. First used to rid Midwestern farms of pests like jack rabbits, they were eventually turned into professional athletes.  Since 1906, the National Greyhound Association (NGA) has kept a registry of racing greyhounds.  There are about 4,000 owners and breeders who are members of NGA, and only dogs registered by that organization, or similar registries in England, Ireland or Australia, can race in the United States. 
<p>Because dog racing is a $4-billion dollar gambling industry, the dogs have to be closely regulated.  According to the NGA, it is the sixth largest spectator sport in America, attracting 27 million fans to 55 tracks in 18 states.  Within ten days of birth, breeders have to send a description of each puppy, including sex and color, to the NGA in Abilene, Kansas.  At three months, the dogs are "marked up" and tattooed.  During this procedure, each greyhound is examined thoroughly and every distinct marking is sketched on a drawing, right down to its toenail color and spots.  Each dog also is tattooed in both ears.  One ear contains the kennel registration number, and the other the dog's birth month, year, and litter number.  The only number unique to a greyhound is the litter number, which tells in what order the dogs from a particular litter were tattooed. Every greyhound must be marked up and tattooed before he can be registered and raced at a track. Every time a dog races, track officials check his litter number, age, and markings to make sure that the right dog is racing. 
<p>During the 1980s, the greyhound industry grew as state officials, eager to find alternative sources of revenue, looked to various kinds of gambling. In 1994, the industry contributed $226 million in taxes to state and local governments, up from about $30 million in 1974. In addition, each track employs from 500 to 600 people.  But by the 1990s, the bloom was off the racing rose. Competition from other sports, lotteries, and even cable TV, cut into dog racing attendance.  Some smaller tracks and poorly financed breeders went out of business.  
<p>Another threat first appeared in 1984 when the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) began to target greyhound racing.  "We were just unprepared.  We had no way of dealing with it," said Tim Horan, managing editor of Greyhound Review.  "We didn't even have a pamphlet to give out on greyhound welfare." 
<p>The Humane Society claimed that huge numbers of dogs were put to death each yearanywhere from 30,000 to 80,000. The greyhound industry had no reply because it had not kept statistics.  Stories with names like "Race of Death" and "For Blood and Money," appeared in magazines and on TV. Well-publicized scandals concerning criminal breeders leaving malnourished racers to die did not help. It didn't matter that the NGA had, in the most publicized cases, been the whistleblower that called the authorities.  The racing industry suffered as animal rights groups called for the sport's elimination. 
<p>Although the NGA employs an inspector who conducts about 700 inspections of greyhound farms and kennels a year and has the power to ban for life those breeders who are found mistreating their dogsa penalty levied four times in 1994critics like Susan Netboy of the Greyhound Protection League of Palo Alto, California aren't satisfied. "Humane Societies should be working to make greyhound racing illegal," she has said.  "It doesn't matter what kind of legislation you pass, you can't enforce it." 
<p>The industry has taken a two-pronged approach to its public relations: get out accurate information to reporters and government officials, and actively promote greyhound adoption.  In the mid-1980s, small greyhound adoption programs run by animal welfare groups began to emerge, first in Florida and then around the rest of the country. Some breeders made their own agreements with greyhound adoption groups, and some tracks sponsored their own programs. In 1989, for instance, when Wichita Greyhound Park opened in Wichita, Kansas, it initiated an adoption program fully funded by the track.  Any individual who races dogs at that track must sign a contract that the dogs will enter the adoption program when they are through racing, unless they go back to the farm for breeding or race at another track.  
<p>In 1992, such individual efforts were given a major boost by the American Greyhound Council (AGC), a nonprofit entity founded in 1987 by greyhound trainers, owners, and racetracks; it gave a $100,000 grant to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) for a greyhound adoption fund. The donation kicked off a splashy campaign that raised the profile of greyhound adoption.  Its  slogan was, "We're athletes, we're beautiful, we're elegant, and we're yours." The industry continues to support adoption programs financially: it gives $40,000 annually to the ASPCA and also funds a toll-free adoption hotline (see page 6), manned by Greyhound Pets of America, that puts potential families in touch with the greyhound adoption group closest to them. The hotline fielded 42,000 calls in just its second year of operation.  The grant to the ASPCA also gave the greyhound industry and at least some animal welfare groups a chance to play on the same team. As Tim Horan of Greyhound Review puts it: "In the long run the number one goal is to adopt out these greyhounds."

<h3>A Dog's Life</h3>
Because greyhounds have a unique upbringing, adopting one is not like adopting any other dog from the local animal shelter.  Bobby Hibbs has been involved with dog racing in one way or another since the early 1960s.  His father owns  Y Knot greyhound farm just east of Austin, and he and his wife Jeanette own WildCat farm a couple miles away.    When Bobby was a boy he hated the dogs, mostly because they were a lot of work.  He had to help feed them and turn them out before he could go to school or participate in sports.  For nine years he installed elevators for a living, but when his dad asked him if he was interested in coming back to the farm, Bobby said yes.
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>The Humane Society claimed that huge numbers of dogs were put to death each yearanywhere from 30,000 to 80,000.  The greyhound industry had no reply because it had not kept statistics.</big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>The road to Wildcat Farm is lined with orange, blue, and yellow wildflowers. At a sharp bend in the road, past the road scraper smoothing out a new layer of yellow road fill, lies the Hibbs' whelping farm.  Here they breed puppies and care for them until they are three months old, when they are moved to the other farm. When I pull into the drive, a yard dog, who has the run of the property, barks angrily until Jeanette puts him in a run.  He seems insulted to be penned up like the greyhoundsand I begin to see the difference between a dog and a greyhound.  Despite the commotion, the greyhounds are silent.  They are not given to the inelegant task of barking.
<p>Right now the Hibbs' have just one litter of eight-month-olds and another litter of puppies that are about six weeks old at the whelping farm.  By greyhound standards the litter is small, only eight dogs, where 12 or 13 is common.  At mid-morning all the dogs are napping, sprawled out contentedly in holes that they have dug in the soft sandy soil.  At this age, the puppies look much like any other puppy.  Jeanette says they won't develop the classic greyhound look, with long legs and snouts, until they are two to three months old. The sandy runs are connected to a well-ventilated indoor pen by a spring door, so the puppies are free to go in and out. 
<p>Though the dogs do not go into training until they are 12 months old, they are given a carefully controlled diet, meant to prepare them for the rigors of racing, from the time they are weaned at about six weeks. Young dogs get fed once a day in the morning with a milky snack at night.  At two months, they move from a mixture of baby cereal and canned dog food to a diet made up of raw meat and dry dog food.  Each dog gets 3 to 3-1/2 pounds of food in the morning, plus a mixture made of milk, puppy chow, and left-over food in the evenings. 
<p>At three months the dogs are moved from the whelping farm over to the Y Knot farm.  There are now about 60 dogs outside and another 16 dogs inside the Y Knot farm.  Outside, the dogs have been fed and are frisky; the weather may have something to do with it.  Thick clouds hang low, threatening rain, and the brisk gusting wind takes the edge off the heat.  As Bobby and Jeanette walk along the runs,  the dogs climb up on the white iron fences eager to have their necks scratched and their backs patted.  Bobby calls some of them by nickname, and tells me about some of their peculiarities.  All  dogs outside are under a year old.  During the first year little is required of them.  Mostly the dogs runand sleep.  They chase after leaves skidding along the ground.  They get into impromptu races with the dogs in the runs next door.   They chase birds and can tear up any animal dumb enough to get into their runs.  
<p>"I've seen stray cats come in there and be destroyed," Jeanette says.  "We had a catMy husband warned my daughter, 'Amanda, I'm telling you. . . .'  'No, Daddy, it won't climb over that fence. . . .'  We had Sonny [the cat] here.  Sonny would walk the fence.  Sonny would go in with the puppies, the little puppies.  And he would be fine.  But one day he climbed in here with dogs about this size (eight months old).  When we got him out he didn't look like a cat anymore. He survived but we had to give him away.  Amanda never asked for a cat again."
<p>But at a year the dogs' lives change.  The dogs, nearly full size at that point, move  into a small air conditioned building furnished with a double deck row of cage-like crates about 2-1/2 feet wide, 3 feet tall, and 3-1/2 feet deep.  Crates like these are home to the racing greyhound until it retires.  When we enter the kennel, it is about 11:00 A.M., and  the dogs are resting.  They sprawl in their crates, some sleeping on their backs on the two layers of carpet that line the floors.  One has pushed his carpet aside so he can feel the cool concrete on his belly. In the background country music plays, and Jeanette says the radio stays on 24 hours a day both at the farm and in the kennel at the track. 
<p>Once the dogs are in training, their lives are subject to a rigid routine. "We turn them out four times a day to get exercise, go to the bathroom, get a drink of water."  The dogs get so accustomed to the routine "they have a time clock inside them that they know to the minute when it is time to turn out," Bobby Hibbs says.  Every turn out is supposed to last 45 minutes, but it is sometimes hard to get the dogs to cooperate.  "Honestly, you put a dog in the kennel, they don't ever want to be outside.  They love the house.  The only time they want to be out is when they run.  Especially in the heatin 10 minutes they're ready to go back in." Male and female dogs are turned out into separate pens, and all the dogs wear muzzles for protection.  Bobby explains that the dogs in training have been taught to go after the sound of a squawking object.  If a dog were to start squealing or whimpering, all the other dogs might turn on it.   
<p>The dogs have to learn several skills before they can go to the track.  They have to learn to be lead by a collar and by a lead. Outside, Bobby Hibbs demonstrates how resistant even a collar-trained dog can be.  The dog, weighing close to 80 pounds, plants both hind legs in the hard packed dirt, moving only grudgingly as Bobby tugs on the collar.  Though running comes naturally, the dogs also have to learn to chase after a lure.  Since it is illegal to use jack rabbits, trainers use a contraption called a Jack-a-Lure made of a mop and noisy squawker.  The dogs first learn to chase the noise, then learn to chase it in a circle, then train on a short track, and finally learn to start from a box.  It is at that point that they are ready to go to the track.  "We call them puppies until they go to the track," Bobby Hibbs says.  "Then they become racers."
<p>So what is a racer?  It is a dog that runs twice a week at speeds over 40 mph around an oval track ranging in length from 5/16 to 9/16 of a mile.  When it isn't racing, it is sleeping.  "They run around a few times and they get to rest for two days.  They're treated like royalty at the track.  Once they get that run in, the time in between, they actually live a lot better than a lot of people do," says Jeanette Hibbs.  Every track employs a veterinarian who examines each dog before every race to make sure it is healthy and fit to run.
<p>If a dog runs well in grade D races, it can move up to C.  And if it does well in C, it'll move up to B and then A, where there is a chance to make some real money for the owner and trainer.  The best dogs run in stake races, with purses of over $100,000.  The biggest purse ever was $130,153 offered in a stake race at the Woodlands in Kansas City, Kansas in 1995.
<p>When a dog's speed begins to fall off by a second or two, it drops from the high grade races to the lower until it is no longer able to compete professionally. That's when the dog gets turned over to a group like GPA/A.  Other dogs that are injured or are no longer able to pass their racing physicals also become eligible for adoption. Most dogs' racing careers last from one to five years.
<p>Turning a racer into a pet isn't always easy. The myths that people believe about greyhoundsthat they're vicious (because they wear muzzles when racing) or high-strungaren't true. But the dogs do have their peculiarities.  Some of them, for  instance, can't be trusted around small animals.  For them the instinct to chase is too strong, and they would never be at home with small dogs or cats.  That's why many groups place the dogs into foster care first, so they can figure out what kind of family would best suit a particular dog.

<h3>Racers Turned Pets</h3>
Liz Sheehan and her husband Kenneth have been greyhound owners for three years.  The young couple live in far northwest Austin, in one of the last subdivisions before the houses end and the prairie begins.  When it comes to the subject of their two greyhounds, Samson, an 80-pound red brindle male, and Hannah, a 55-pound "blue" (actually grey) female, they are passionate.   Liz speaks of the dogs as though they were her children, calling them the "greatest members of our family," and saying "I'm proud of them." 
<p>Although pride seems to be an odd word to use in describing two dogs who loll around the house a good part of the day, Liz talks openly about the changes she's seen them undergo. "Hannah had a wall in front of her. . . .  She didn't like people coming up to her too much.  She was a little afraid.  Anytime you came  too close to her, she would get real scared.  She was real shy in the beginning, but as you can see, she's come out of her shell."  Liz laughs as she adds this last sentence because both Samson and Hannah are aggressively investigating me and my 11-year-old son who is taking pictures.
<blockquote><i><b><big> Despite the commotion, the greyhounds are silent.  They are not given to the inelegant task of barking.  
</big></b></i></blockquote>
<p>"I think probably the best way to describe the transition they make is to say that they come to you as a greyhound,  turn into a dog, and then  into a pet," Liz says.  "These are not the same dogs I got when I first adopted them."  When I ask what that means, Kenneth interjects:  "All they know is a routine.  All of a sudden they don't have a routine anymore, so there is a lot of nervous anxiety.  They don't know what is going on." Samson, the first dog they adopted "did a lot of pacinghe did a lot of investigating.  He had to learn to trust us," Liz says.  After a while "they become more playful. . . .  They start trusting you more. . . ."
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>"There's nothing as thrilling...as actually meeting the breeder somewhere and taking the dogs off the trailer.  There was something about it that I had to kind of hold back my tears."
</big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>Training the big dogs to go to the bathroom outside is probably the easiest task since they are already accustomed to keeping their crates clean.  The Sheehans leave their dogs inside without incident for eight or nine hours at a time while they are at work. But some of the other features of daily life in a house can cause trouble.  "Samson had to be introduced to everything in the house.  TVs were a big thing for him. Most of the greyhounds have not seen anything, they've never been in a home.  Linoleumhe used to be afraid of walking on linoleum floors because at one point in time he kind of lost his grip.  Kenneth used to have to carry him . . . with his paws in the air like a little baby."
<p>Racing greyhounds spend most of their time with other dogs.  While they are talked to and handled by their trainers, they don't get the kind of individual attention a house pet would get.  When they retire, they often become the center of their family's pet universe.  So accustomed has Samson become to attention, that he will actually cry when Liz or Kenneth stop petting him.  Greyhounds also can become lonely if they are the only canines in a family.  When bored, the dogs can get into mischief.    The Sheehans have had to "Samson-proof" the house because he likes to chew thingsthe television remote control, a cordless phone, books, and paper.   That's why they adopted Hannah, who like "Nameless" had been abandoned at the side of the road in Waco.  Like "Nameless" her tattoos are illegible, so it is impossible to find out where she came from. 
<p>Although the Sheehans are greyhound owners, they actually volunteered for GPA/A before they adopted Samson.  "I was just fascinated with the dogs and I was fascinated with the idea behind the dogs," Liz said.   "I felt it was a good organizationthat the concept was very good in terms of finding homes for dogs.  I don't know, there was just something about it that kind of tugged at my heartstrings.  I could make a small difference, even if it was placing a few dogs or taking a few dogs myself.  I could make a difference. That's probably what other people feel as well. That's all that matters to me in the organizationplacing the dogs in good homes."
<p>The Sheehans don't have regular contact with the breeders or trainers; that's someone else's job in the organization.  But Liz remembers the first time she accompanied a group to pick up the dogs.  "There's nothing as thrilling . . . as actually meeting the breeder somewhere and taking the dogs off the trailer.  There was something about it that I had to kind of hold back my tears because I looked into their eyes and I saw how afraid they looked and how scared they looked because everything they had known had been taken away from them.  They were so used to their kennels and so used to where they were at, and then when I saw them coming off the truck, it was really a neat feeling knowing that we could make a difference with these dogs and find them great homes." 
<p>And what does GPA/A think about the breeders and trainers they work with? "We've built a relationship with them and it's based on respect and trust.  A lot of them have a really big interest in where their dogs are going, and they've worked with us and know we are going to give the dogs real good homes,"  Liz said. 
<p>GPA/A has placed 500 dogs since 1990 when it was founded.  Last year it placed 81. The organization is partially funded by a $100 adoption fee, which covers the cost of spaying or neutering the dogs, updating their vaccinations, cleaning their teeth, and giving them any other medical attention they need.  One of the chief activities of the organization is spreading the virtues of greyhounds as pets.
<p>Lucy Salsman is one of the dogs' most enthusiastic boosters.    On the day Chuck Hoover, GPA/A's president, brought "Nameless" to her, he also had another recently retired racer that he was delivering to another foster home.  Lucy describes her: "She had a little tiny face, and she was kissing everybodyshe was kissing him and kissing me and kissing Chuck.  She was a real sweetheart." Lucy's speech is peppered with words like "precious" and "sweet" when she talks about her dogs.  One of them was named Daisy.  "Daisy would carry a teddy bear everywhere," Lucy said.  "I'd say to her, 'Daisy, go get your baby, go get your baby and carry it.'  And she'd start in the living room and she'd come around the dining room, and around and around she'd go with that teddy bear." Terry, a white and brindle greyhound, prompts Lucy to say with a laugh:  "We should have just called her Terror, but she was precious."  
<p>It was love for greyhounds in particular and the desire to help them that brought Lucy into fostering.  "I'm really happy I got into fostering because I really love these dogs.  They're great.  I just love to do it so much.  I feel like I'm helping to take care of them. They're just so gentle and so nice, and when they get to be part of the family, they're just great."

<h3>Man's Best Friend and Therapist</h3>
Though most greyhound owners brag about the breed's intelligence, the dogs are not suited for every task.  Since they don't bark and are very gentle and submissive, they do not make good watchdogs.  These qualities have, however, prompted  interest in whether greyhounds could make good therapy dogs, ones that work with emotionally and physically disabled people.   Daisy, the dog with the teddy bear, now spends every day in a nursing home where her new owner works.  She visits with the patients until she's had enough, and then goes back to the office where she can be alone. 
<p>The Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital in Wichita, Kansas has two greyhounds that regularly work there.  Meagin is a certified assistance animal.  She has gone through rigorous training and testing so that she has become the arms, so to speak, for her master who is disabled and unable to carry more than five pounds. In addition to that work, she and another younger greyhound, Flo Jo, serve as therapy dogs in the rehabilitation hospital.  According to Linda Mansfield, Director of Clinical Services, Meagin and Flo Jo help stimulate brain-injured patients and motivate those who are beginning a painful course of therapy.  She says sometimes a patient will talk to a dog more readily than to a therapist.  "When people are just starting to recover, they relate better to the dogs,"  Mansfield said.  In her opinion, the dogs are actually performing tasks in the hospital that people could not accomplish.  At this point, the Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital is the only rehab hospital she knows of that uses greyhounds as therapy dogs.  But Mansfield has received inquiries from across the country.  She thinks the dogs' docile nature, especially among older patients, ideally suits them to the task.
<p>Wherever greyhounds go, they get noticed.  In Austin, Ralf and Camille Lukner adopted two retired racers because "we like to rollerblade.  There aren't many dogs that can go that fast."  Since greyhounds are sprinters, though, they don't always make the best running companions, and it turned out that only one of the Lukner's dogs likes to run distances.  Whenever they go skating with the dogs, they attract a lot of attention from other skaters and runners.  People may be cautious because of the dog's sizea male can weigh up to 80 pounds, and a female, 60 pounds, but they all want to know what kind of dog it is.
<p>Lucy Salsman and her husband Frances received similar attention when they traveled with greyhound Joshua to New Hampshire.  At many of the motels, those walking smaller dogs would want to keep away from Joshua, but they also were curious about him.  Many had never seen a greyhound before and others wanted to know how they could adopt.
<p>It is a lot easier to adopt a greyhound now than it used to be.  More and more tracks are running their own programs.  Shoreline Star racetrack in Bridgeport, Connecticut opened its own track-funded program last November, placed its first dog in December, 1995 and by May, 1996 had placed 60 dogs directly and given 12 to 14 others to various adoption groups.  The American Greyhound Council has a web page on the internet, and there are web pages devoted to many other greyhound adoption groups.  By calling the American Greyhound Council's toll-free number, even people in states without racing can get in touch with adoption programs. 
<p>Greyhound adoption has also successfully reduced the number of dogs euthanized, according to industry statistics.  In 1992, 49,000 greyhounds were born, 9,000 were adopted, and 23,000 were euthanized.  In 1993, 43,000 greyhounds were born, 13,000 adopted, and 16,000 euthanized. In 1994, 42,000 were born, 14,000 adopted, and 15,000 euthanized.  Last year, 16,000 were adopted and 12,000 were euthanized.  The trend over the past four years has been for breeders to raise fewer dogs and adopt out more.

<p>Has the greyhound industry been able to convert its enemies into friends? The Humane Society of the United States still wants to shut the industry down.  Campaign 2000 is an effort to ban racing in every state.  So far, it has been successful in getting greyhound activity, including AKC coursing events, banned in some states where there are no racetracks and no organized opposition. Jacque Schultz, administrator of the Greyhound Adoption Fund for the ASPCA, would also like to shut the industry down, even though her organization benefits from its generosity.  "If I could make greyhound racing shut down tomorrow, I would," she said. But Tim Horan points out, the worst thing for the dogs would be to shut down 52 racetracks.  "Immediately, you'd have [approximately] 150,000 dogsthere would be mass graves.  There aren't enough people to adopt them all." 
<p>The dog racing industry and its critics have agreed upon greyhound adoption, but for somewhat different reasons.  The industry promotes it because it is good for business and the "right thing to do."  Some animal rights advocates support it because they believe they are rescuing animals from an inhumane lifestyle.  Though critics might want ultimately to shut the tracks down, for now the two sides can agree:  Greyhound adoption works and supporting it has been good for the industry, good for the dogs, and good for families that love the dogs.

<p><i>The advent of Christian cost-sharing ministries provides a new, viable option to conventional health insurance.</i>
<p>
<p>Jessica was helping her mother hang clothes in the muggy August heat, doing her best to reach the line strung between a hulking pine tree and the old baby-blue house. The Jacksons lived there nearly rent-free, a godsend for the family since father Charles was a seminary student at Jackson, Mississippi's Reformed Theological Seminary. As a home-schooler Jessica pitched in to help around the house as much as possible, but now she needed some help of her own. The clothesline was barely out of reach of her 10-year-old arms. She canvassed the back yard and spied a small plastic play slide, a perfect makeshift stool, she thought. But just after  positioning herself  under the line, the toy slid out from under Jessica's feet. She fell awkwardly on her elbow, sending a sharp pain through her whole arm.
<p>"We heard this shrill scream that we thought was a dog," recalls Jessica's mother, Connie, 36. "Then we looked outside and saw that it was Jessica."
<p>The Jacksons were frantic. 
<p>They put ice on their child's arm. But time and cold compresses did not lessen the pain or inflammation. Finally, they decided to take Jessica to the nearby Baptist Medical Center. The drive was a tense one. Besides worrying for their daughter's welfare, another thought  ran through both Connie and Charles's minds, one not too far from many parents during such times as this: Will our insurance pay?
<p>

<blockquote><big><i>Joe Maxwell is national editor of World magazine. He lives in Madison, Mississippi, with his wife and three boys.  </i></big></blockquote>
<p>
<p>These days, more and more people share a similar storyworrying not only for the welfare of an injured or sick family member, but for the willingness of their health insurer to honor its contract and cover the claim. Moreover, many families today still don't even have medical insurance, making the ride to the hospital even more unnerving. 
<p>More than 40 million Americans lack health insurance, according to 1993 census figures; many of these have jobs that do not offer health coverage; 12 million children like Jessica are not covered, and many don't qualify for Medicaid due to their parents' salary level.
<p>The problem is often twofold: First, there is the growing cost of treatment: In 1972 the per-capita medical expenditure for the average American was $387; that figure jumped to $3,294 by 1993; by the turn of the century, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that number will be at $5,712. Health expenditures nationwide jumped from 7.7 percent of the GNP in 1972 to 13.9 percent in 1993 with projections of 16.4 percent, or $1.6 trillion, by the end of the decade.
<p>A second problem is the lack of portability of health insurance coverage, the vast majority of which is provided to Americans not on an individual basis, but through an employer's plan. Congress has been debating new bills to alleviate skyrocketing premiums and lack of portability. A bill passed 100 to 0 in the Senate and sponsored by Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy seeks to address the problem by creating new federal standards and programs. Yet it is highly questionable whether the plan is desirable: the Senate bill will add to the federal bureaucracy, and it  threatens to force the existing insurance industry to raise premiums to offset the costs of covering those who would have been previously rejected as bad risks.
<p>But there is an exciting option, one that predates the modern health insurance industry but which promises to expand dramatically in the years ahead. These are the growing number of Christian cost-sharing groups in which thousands of people join together to meet not only financial, but also spiritual and emotional burdens.
<p>

<p>The digital clock reads 3:45 a.m. and the alarm rings in Joel  Smith's bedroom. He and his wife live a comfortable life in a spacious, modern log-cabin home situated on a forested hill by a fish-stocked lake in north Mississippi. 53-year-old Joel managed a massive manufactured home plant in Lexington, Mississippi for years before moving into the insurance business as a state representative for John Hancock Life Insurance in the early 1980s. For more than a decade now, he has sold life insuranceand health insuranceto scores of Mississippians who trust him for more than just his good business sense. They rely on Joel because he is a licensed minister in the Church of God in Cleveland, Tennessee and the lay-pastor of a rural church of 300 that meets in an attractive prefab log cabin building just down the road from Smith's home.
<p>Each morning, as a ceiling fan whizzes overhead in the dark, the Smiths nudge each other out of bed and onto their knees. On the nightstand next to their king-size bed sits a Bible and Joel's reading glasses. Next to that is a magazine article titled, "The Precious Blood of Jesus," and a digital clock/phone radio.
<p>Their morning routine includes a call to 1-800-PSALM 33 to get a recording of the most urgent requests from their fellow cost-sharing members. The couple is soon deep into prayer for people they've never met but with whom they share a common bond and commitment. The Smiths are spending an early Friday morning praying for the members of their Christian health care group who have suffered sickness or injury requiring them to file claims. The members of the Melbourne Florida-based Christian Care Medi-Share Program to which the Smiths belong conduct a 24-hour prayer chain, seven days a week for those participants facing needs. More importantly, people involved in the program also write each month to other group members with  needs.
<p>"The whole thing to me is based on life-style," says Joel, as he  sits with his legs crossed in the foyer of his church, a Bible on one side of the table in front of him, a calendar listing his insurance sales calls on the other. "It's incumbent on every member to be responsible and honest."
<p>Responsibility and honesty, says Joel, are too often lacking in how individuals treat their conventional health insurance plans today. By contrast, the Smith's Christian Care Medi-Share program emphasizes conscientious self-monitoring. Moreover, it offers members 100 percent coverage for less each month than most conventional group insurancea little less than  $200 per family.
<p>Over the last half-decade, several Christian cost-sharing groups resembling the Christian Care Medi-Share group have sprung up. They include: Samaritan Ministries in Greenfield, Indiana; the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter in Barberton, Ohio; All Saints in Tyler, Texas; and Helping Hands in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 
<p>While specifics vary from group to group, these Christian cost-sharing groups all share a basic philosophy summarized  in Galatians 6:2: "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ." Without exception, these are groups of Christians banded together  to care for one another.
<p>"In our nation's past, our forefathers were quite familiar with bearing one another's burdens," states a brochure published by one cost-sharing group, Samaritan Ministries. "Today, our mentality is far from that of our ancestors. We still have the mandate to bear one another's burdens, but we hardly know what that means anymore. If our barn burns down or an emergency medical problem arises, the insurance company takes care of it and our friends, relatives and neighbors have little participation in restoring us to our former state. We don't need each other in the way we used to. We're not knocking insurance companieswe're merely saying there is a better way for Christians who desire to minister to the body of Christ while  providing for their own medical needs and being thrifty with their money."
<p>The Smiths' membership in the Florida-based Christian Care Medi-Share Program resembles other Christian care groups in its operation:
<ul>
<li>Potential members are screened to validate a sincere Christian commitment; some groups accomplish this by requiring membership in a local church and attendance at least three out of every four Sundays; others simply interview an applicant's pastor to verify the person's faith in Christ.
<li>Once accepted, a member enjoys coverage usually equal to or exceeding that offered by most conventional employer-provided plans. 
<li>The Christian Care Medi-Share plan is as follows:  After a $250 deductible, 100 percent coverage is provided up to $1 million at a monthly cost of $85 per member, $150 for two persons, and $195 per family of three or more. Eight-five percent of a monthly family membership fee of $195 goes to pay the medical bills of another member that month, 6 percent is used for processing needs/claims, and 9 percent is used for administrative costs and disease prevention education. 
<li>Every Christian care ministry stipulates that membership is contingent upon living a healthy life-style. This means not smoking, not using illegal drugs, and not engaging in sex outside of marriage. Several groups, including the largestChristian Brotherhood Newsletterprohibit any drinking, while others including the Christian Care Medi-Share Program permit it in moderation. 
<p>These ministries point to widely published statistics indicating that up to 80 percent of all diseases result from the consequences of life-style choices. The American Medical Association estimates that up to 40 percent of all hospital patients are treated for problems resulting from alcoholism; the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services in 1993 reported that $188 billion is spent each year on health care resulting from unhealthy life-styles leading to high rates of cancer, accidents, AIDS and heart disease. 
<p>Such figures account for many of the hefty increases in conventional health insurance premiums in recent years. Proponents of Christian cost-sharing ministries say they shouldn't have to support the destructive life-styles of others with their premium dollars. 
<p>Says John Reinhold, president of the Christian Care Medi-Share (CCMS): "Our members believe in sharing and caring, but they do not wish to subsidize those . . . who choose to live in a way which inevitably leads to a premature breakdown in mind and body, i.e. using tobacco, abusing chemicals and toxic substances, taking drugs, gluttony."
<p>Christian cost-sharing groups encourage self-regulation by their members.  Christian care groups rely on individual members to screen their medical bills for excess and mistaken charges, a practice often indirectly discouraged by conventional health insurance plansgovernment or privatewhere participants take the attitude of "getting back from the system everything they have paid in over the years."
<p>When a member incurs a needwhich conventional insurance would call a claimhe reports it to his cost-sharing group's national office. Some, like the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, "publish" the needs of their members in a monthly newsletter, assigning each member a specific person to pray for and to receive his monthly support check. Each member then mails a monthly membership fee directly to the member whose need they've been assigned, along with a card or letter of encouragement.  Other groups including CCMS let members send their monthly dues to the main office, which then redistributes the resources to those particular members with needs. Members receive a note about the specific person and need to whom their monthly dues are applied, and they are encouraged to write and pray for their recovery.

<p>
Dear Miss/Mrs. Gillespie,
<p>My name is Abby Van Ness. I am 10 years old. I will be 11 on June 24th. My family is supporting you this month. I hope that you recover soon from the automobile accident. It must be very painful and I don't think I would like it if I were in the situation that you are in now. I am praying for you and the Lord is watching over you. Now, I'll tell you a little bit more about myself. My father is the pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Lexington, Mississippi. My mother is an Ocupational (sic) Therapist. She works at

Heritage Manor in Greenwood, Mississippi. She works NORMALLY (emphasis is original) two days a week. But that's about to change. I have two sisters and one baby brother. His name is Peter. (Besides his nicknames, middle name, and last name.) My oldest younger sister is named Kate. (Her full name is Mollie Kate Van Ness.) My other sister's name is Sarah. (HER full name is Sarah Rose Van Ness.) Peter is only one so he's not old enough to have any hobbies. Kate loves to sing. She is 7 years old. Sarah is 4 years old and is at an acting silly age. My hobbies are: Reading, Swimming, and acting. I think that one of them later might be: Running Track. I can run half a mile in about four minutes and 37 seconds! I'm going to run a race against my aunt. She's very athletic. She says an eight minute mile is good. Well, hope you enjoyed reading this letter!

<p>
<p>No conventional health insurance provider could offer this kind of personal service. Abby's mother, Jody, smiles as she discusses her belief in the Christian cost-sharing concept; she is conservative-to-the-core, and she likes playing an active role in her health coverage, both spiritual and financially. An occupational therapist in the Mississippi Delta, Jody says she regularly sees how medical groups routinely overcharge insurance companies for their services. "I am overpaid, by far," she says.
<p>By contrast, Jody's cost-sharing group asks her to be wise in how she files needs/claims, and to scrutinize her medical bills for errors or overcharges. The fact that she and other members of her Christian cost-sharing group have an active claim in the financial interest of their organization is a strong incentive for each member to work to keep costs down. "I see the waste when health coverage is done with other people's money," she says, sitting outside her Lexington, Mississippi, house, watching one of her girls climb an old magnolia tree. A mongrel squirrel dog named Charlie rests nearby in the cool dirt. "I believe that I know enough to spend enough to take care of my children wisely."
<p>In this sense, health insurance has always boiled down to this philosophical questionwho can best care for prioritizing an individual's health needsthe individual, or an impersonal company or government agency? 
<p>
<a name="care"></a>
<h3>Taking Care of One Another</h3>
<p>Some form of health insurance has been in existence for centuries. The ancient Chinese were thought to pay their local doctor during times of health so that he would care for them during times of sickness. Ancient Greeks had benevolent societies in which members pooled resources for medical care; Rome adopted the practice. Early Christian records indicate church members cared for each other physically and financially, as well as spiritually. And in medieval Europe, members of trade guilds foreshadowed employer group insurance, caring for each others' needs during times of sickness. 
<p>Health insurance in its modern form, however, is a relatively new phenomenon, developing long after American companies were offering marine, fire, and life insurance to customers. 
<p>Modern insurance in the United States began when individuals "wrote their names under" an agreementthus the term, "underwriter"promising to pay a certain sum if a ship met with disaster on the ocean. In exchange, they gained an interest in the potential profits the ship's cargo might bring. A mariner would get numerous underwriters to help absorb risks, which soon became actuarially calculable. 
<p>With time and growing expertise in the mathematics of calculating risk and statistical odds, groups of people organized to insure not only the risks of marine travel, but also risk of the destruction of businesses and neighborhoods by fire. The Friendly Society for the Mutual Insuring of Houses Against Fire was created by a royal charter in 1735 in Charleston, South Carolina. Benjamin Franklin founded the Philadelphia Contributorship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire, in 1752. And by 1759, the Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia banded together to form the country's first life insurance corporation, which still exists today as the Presbyterian Ministers' Fund. 
<p>When it came to health and accident insurance, however, there was little movement for decades. In the days of primitive medical knowledge and skill, people remained well-served by neighborly care and generosity; hospitalization and the rampant rise in costs of medicine and services were a thing of the future. The first medical insurancea sickness policyappears to have been offered by the Massachusetts Health Insurance Company in 1847 in Boston. The policy covered treatment of that day's major infirmities. The first accident policy was apparently offered by the Travelers Insurance Company to James Bolter.  For $5000 it insured his walk home from the post office. Bolter's monthly premium? Two cents. Fraternal Benefit Societies became the first real purveyors of group health coverage: the Ancient Order of United Workmen, founded in 1868,  is generally credited with being the nation's first fraternal insurance company. Other groups followed, including the Sons of Norway in 1895, the Aid Association for Lutherans in 1899, and the Catholic Knights of Columbus Insurance Society.
<p>By the advent of this century, nearly 50 companies sold accident policies, since accidents were actuarially predictable. Sickness, on the other hand, was notstatistics were still sketchyand companies steered clear of offering sickness policies. With the onset of the Great Depression, however, hospitals and doctors found themselves treating hundreds of patients who had lost their capacity to pay for health services. The medical community responded by creating the nonprofit Blue Cross, offered by hospitals, and Blue Shield, offered by physicians. The first such group is traceable to a schoolteachers' organization in Dallas that worked with Baylor University to arrange for monthly prepayments for future hospital and physician care. 
<p>Private, for-profit insurance companies took note. Until then, they offered only life, fire, and marine insurance, along with crop and other casualty policies. But with the growing progress in statistical calculation, and the budding success of group health plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, commercial companies began seeing the profit to be made in insuring health as well. Moreover, with the advent of the two world wars, big employers began to offer what is now considered commonplace: group policies for their employees.
<p>Such group plans allowed for maximum purchasing and insuring power at the minimum cost. Companies offered group policies in part because skilled labor was scarce in war times and competition for good workers was high; offering group coverage was a means to recruit the best workers. Group plans also offered a nice tax deduction at a time when American corporations were facing ever-growing tax burdens. Moreover, the Supreme Court ruled just after WW II that health insurance was a legitimate bargaining chip in labor-management negotiations.
<p>

<h3>A New Way of Thinking</h3>
Whether private or public, for-profit or not-for-profit, group health insurance was becoming a fixture in the United States. And it didn't take long for Americans to develop a whole new attitude toward caring for their health needs. They dropped their long-held reliance on neighbors, church, and the kindness of local doctors in favor of coverage by impersonal insurance plans. By 1940, the nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield in America estimated that it had 4 million clients, compared to 1.2 million using commercial health insurance services. But by 1951, the situation was reversed, and the commercial companies surpassed the nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield groups in number. As of 1950, 77 million people had some form of hospitalization coverage.
<p>Since WW II, commercial health insurance, along with the government's own insurance plansMedicaid and Medicarehave grown rapidly and adapted to the needs of the market. Hospitalization plans expanded first: by 1970, about 70 percent of all private expenses for hospital care and more than 40 percent of all doctors' expenses were covered by voluntary insurance. Soon, "major medical" policies were created by commercial companies to insure individuals for a maximum amount of coverage minus a preset deductible. 
<p>Another trend has developed: some companies are now self-insuring, offering their own employees coverage instead of purchasing it from an outside company. Often companies who self-insure cite actuarial figures for their employee base showing less health risk than the average American. These companies therefore conclude they shouldn't have to pay higher rates to subsidize the unhealthy life-styles of an insurer's other clients. That, they say, is just good business. Only a half-century ago health insurance plans were considered a luxury. Now they are touted by some as a fundamental "right."

<h3>Alternative Life-styles</h3>
John Reinhold enjoyed a long, successful career as a businessman and charity fund-raiser before founding the Christian Care Medi-Share in 1992. He and well-known Christian financial counselor and author Larry Burkett headed up the Great Commission Foundation for Campus Crusade for Christ that sought to raise $1 billion for the organization. With time, Reinhold began contributing his talents to the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, recruiting new members in the Florida area. Then he and a group of Christians launched their own cost-sharing group, the Christian Care Medi-Share group, styled along the same lines as CBN but with some minor adjustments.
<p>Ironically one day a CCMS ministry executive approached Reinhold. "[He] informed me that my weight made me ineligible for our ministry of sharing," recalls Reinhold. "You see, we have thousands of members who share each other's medical bills, and there are certain restrictions voted by the members so that we are in compliance with biblical life-styles. So here I was, one of the key players who formalized the sharing program, exempted from the ministry sharing."
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>Most of the Christian cost-sharing groups encourage healthy living, but don't cram it down members' throats. </big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>Since then Reinhold has taken stock of his own nutritional needs. He's lost more than 70 pounds, enabling him to go off of prescription drugs and relieving his problems with arthritis and his heart condition. Today, Reinhold, along with several medically trained CCMS members, writes a column in the quarterly Christian Care Medi-Share's newsletter on improving members' nutrition and living healthier life-styles.  Helping One Another offers health quizzes and reviews books on the effects of over-eating and using caffeine.
<p>Most of the Christian cost-sharing groups encourage healthy living, but don't cram it down members' throats. Says Reinhold, "There are some basic things that we can do to make positive changes in our lives to better serve our Lord as well as assist in holding our monthly costs in line."
<p>Reinhold points to figures showing that those living and eating according to biblical ideals live longer and better. For instance,  Reinhold asserts, Seventh-Day Adventists live an average of seven to nine years longer than other evangelicals, due mostly to observing nutrition tips from the Old Testament forbidding eating pork. Fifty percent or more of Adventists are lacto-vegetarians, as well. Life-style, life-style, life-style forms the heart of Christian cost-sharing ministries' success and attraction.
<p>Several years ago, Christian journalist and author Ken Walker began lamenting the fact that his dollars were going to support the unbiblical life-styles of others. When his wife left her job to work in a ministry, the couple was left without health insurance, so Walker began investigating available major medical plans. One insurer's representative casually lamented that her insurance company would not subsidize her birth control pills, "but they will pay for my abortion."
<p>"Those words cut into me like a knife," recalls Walker. "I realized this company wasn't unique; most health insurance plans follow these and other ill-advised policies. I didn't want to participate and, no matter how indirectly, subsidize such practices."
<p>After contact with Larry Burkett's staff,  Walker looked into the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter. He was pleased with what he found. The group did not offer coverage for abortion or unwed pregnancies. Moreover, the Walkers liked the fact that their monthly checks were sent directly to another member who had a "published" need, putting the Walkers directly in contact every month with another Brotherhood member both financially and in prayer. 
<p>This philosophy of mutual care and concern is based in Christian teaching as old as the institutional church itself. And while Reinhold and several other groups have modified the idea first set forth by the Illinois-based Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, CBN remains the largest cost-sharing group, with 80,000 members. CBN founder Bruce Hawthorne started his program after experiencing the concept of Christian care in his own life. Hawthorne's 16-year-old daughter died in a car wreck, then three medical emergencies involved his other children, and finally Hawthorne's wife and another daughter died accidentally the next year. Hawthorne, who at the time worked at the Barberton, Ohio Rescue Mission, was left with $54,000 in hospital bills, and could only seek the aid of local believers. He mailed a request for material help to each of the 13,000 people listed on the rescue mission's mailing list. Forty-five days later, he'd accumulated enough money to offset his bills. 
<p>"When I should have been at the very bottom emotionally, I was experiencing spiritual and emotional elation," he said in an October 1995 article in Sound Mind Investing. "I realized that there was a need for [this] if for no other reason, for the support that one needs while going through a tragedy."

<h3>In Good Hands</h3>
The most important question for insurance consumers is this: Will the policy pay? That's what ran through Charles and Connie Jackson's minds as they drove their little girl, Jessica, to the hospital to repair her broken elbow. When they arrived at the emergency room, an attendant asked Charles to provide some health history on Jessica. Charles sat  nervously waiting as the clerk requested proof of his health coverage.  He pulled out his wallet and handed the clerk an attractive plastic card provided by his cost-sharing ministryThe Christian Care Medi-Share Association.
<p>"It just looks like any other insurance care," Charles recalls. "They just took it and Xeroxed it."
<p>Charles thought for a moment that he might offer an explanation concerning the group's novel approach, but decided against it. He realized the clerk showed no signs of skepticism. She was processing his claim like any other. "She didn't ask, so I didn't offer," says Charles.
<p>Charles' cost-sharing ministry boasts that, "to-date, no member has ever been refused treatment by any medical entity." In some instances, members have routed questions from their medical provider to the group's home office via a toll-free number. In every case the medical provider's concern was addressed: Will this coverage pay? Numerous state insurance regulators have challenged the concept of Christian cost-sharing ministries, but without success. Eight states have actually passed laws exempting cost-sharing groups from insurance regulation. In Florida, such groups are regulated under charitable solicitation laws.
<p>Jessica Jackson's  parents paid the first $250 of her medical bill as a deductible, and then the Christian Care Medi-Share group picked up about another $700 in expenses. The couple says they are now convinced not only of the biblical-basis for cost-sharing but of its practicality as well
<p>There is one other benefit. For every thousand families who join the Jackson's group, Christian Care Medi-Share, at least $2 million of their after-tax income is kept out of the current "health-care machine," notes CCMS membership chairman Robert Dixon.  He adds, "Those who join are grateful that behind us is a multi-million dollar 'safety-net' and beneath us are the everlasting arms."

<h2>A Century of Service: Palmer Home for Children</h2>
By Joe Maxwell
<P>
Easter 1907 had just passed and summer was at hand. The lawn surrounding
Palmer Orphanage's two large brick buildings was a carpet of green,
&quot;so inviting to the little ones,&quot; wrote Florence Foster
Frierson, the orphanage's head matron and the wife of Palmer superintendent
William V. Frierson.
<P>
Mrs. Frierson was a devout Presbyterian who loved watching a summer
rainstorm, seeing new growth break through the Mississippi soil,
or hearing children recite their catechism from beginning to end
for the very first time.
<P>
On this April day, she rode to the local train station with a
cheerful heart. But in seconds, it was broken. Mrs. Frierson heard
a baby cry and ran to the arriving train: there the frail form
of a dying woman trembled as she descended the train steps. Two
&quot;older tots&quot; stayed close by her; a man accompanied
them, carrying a crying infant. &quot;My heart leaped into my
throat, and for a moment I seemed ready to yield to a flood of
tears,&quot; Mrs. Frierson recalled.
<P>
A Christian mother, ill with cancer, was bringing her children
to the Palmer Orphanage. &quot;These three little girls, although
badly spoiled having had a sick mother so long are promising children,&quot;
reported Mrs. Frierson. As the mother bid her offspring good-bye,
Mrs. Frierson could only watch and pray. Then the woman turned
to Mrs. Frierson and, with tears streaming down her face, made
this last request: &quot;Teach my children to meet me in heaven.&quot;
<P>
Palmer Home for Children in Columbus, Mississippi has a glorious,
gut-wrenching, and godly history filled with countless true stories
of God's awesome and sometimes awful movements among his people,
of men and women committed to his service, and of children always
the children who have formed the heart and soul of Palmer Home.
<P>
More than one hundred years after its founding in 1895, many incidentals
about Palmer Home have changed. But, remarkably, despite the flux
of American and church history, its essence remains intact.
<P>
Today, Palmer Home mends the scars of and models evangelical Christian
values to some seventy-five boys and girls from broken or needy
homes. As pundits and policymakers debate the &quot;issue&quot;
of childcare and consider the &quot;options,&quot; Palmer Home
offers the reality of a century's experience in long-term residential
group childcare.
<P>
Orphanages established by Christian communities were popular refuges
for children in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
(There were as many as 1,000 in America in 1919.) But they fell
from favor, and foster care programs regulated by secular governments
took their place. By the 1960s and 70s, the vast majority of orphanages
had closed, and their children were placed in foster care, a system
which often handled them as players in a game of musical chairs.
Remarkably, Palmer Home for Children survived.
<P>
Three distinct periods characterize the existence of Palmer Home.
In some measure, they reflect larger historical developments in
the nation and in attitudes toward child welfare. Palmer was founded
in the post-Civil War South, a traumatic period of economic poverty
and racial segregation, but deep religious faith. Its growth under
superintendent John Frierson, responded to the rise of Progressivism,
the Great Depression, and two world wars. Palmer's current character
was forged in the post-war years as a New South overcame racial
divisions and social isolation. Despite government's burgeoning
role in the work of child welfare, which has threatened to undermine
local initiatives and religious authority, Palmer Home has retained
its independence as a faith-based charity supported by voluntary
gifts and bequests.
<P>
Here is its story.
<P>
<B>Palmer's Founding: A Charity in the Post-Civil War South</B>

<P>
Palmer Orphanage, now Palmer Home for Children, was founded by
William States Jacobs, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church
of Columbus, Mississippi, a small town in the northeastern part
of the state. The son of the founder of South Carolina's Thornwell
Orphanage, he challenged his congregation to start its own orphanage
which he named after Benjamin Morgan Palmer, a leading Southern
Presbyterian churchman.
<P>
Palmer received its charter on April 29, 1895. Fifteen acres of
land were purchased and by 1898 a two-story building was erected
at a cost of $3,000. Records show that every congregation in town,
including the Jewish synagogue, helped in the construction, as
did a &quot;committee of outsiders,&quot; interested citizens
not involved in church affairs. By 1904, 45 boys and girls were
living separately in the two buildings. Palmer Orphanage was debt-free.
<P>
A year later, Civil War veteran William Frierson became Palmer
Orphanage's third superintendent. Frierson had fought in the Battle
of Gettysburg where he was wounded and captured by Union forces.
An ordained preacher advanced in years when he arrived at Palmer,
Frierson was a tough and principled Southern Calvinist. With his
wife Florence, he established the moral tone and the philosophical
backbone of Palmer Orphanage.
<P>
In their newsletter, <I>The Charity Ledger</I>, William Frierson
laid down the priorities of the orphanage: &quot;First, the material
interests of the home must be looked after. . . . Second, the
spiritual interests of our children must not be neglected. The
head and the heart both need cultivation. . . . Besides the regular
morning and evening devotional exercises, our children attend
Sunday school and preaching at the Presbyterian church where their
advantages are first class.&quot;
<P>
For the next 70 years Palmer's children would sing in the Columbus
First Presbyterian Church choir. They would attend its Sunday
services and comprise much of its youth group. Their social life
would center on church activities.
<P>
The children were clearly the delight of the Friersons and the
matrons who assisted them. The orphanage soon took on the feel
of a family. One pastor from Vicksburg dropped off four children
and stayed for two days. He would write: &quot;I have never seen
a healthier or happier looking lot of children. . . . What pleased
me most was the family-like atmosphere of it and the absence of
that machinelike government that may be seen in so many institutions.
I noticed that the children ran over to your house whenever they
felt like it with the same confidence that any little child runs
to its father's house.&quot;
<P>
Early records show that the matrons made Palmer a home. Miss Pressly,
the little boys' matron, took her boys for walks to the Tombigbee
River. Other matrons took girls and boys on picnics in the woods,
gathering flowers and berries, and singing songs. Both child and
adult at Palmer Orphanage enjoyed the country. Life was simple,
and it was governed by the seasons and the weather more than we
can imagine.
<P>
One day Florence Frierson watched as Miss Pressly said good-bye
to two young boys. She was to begin her one month's summer leave.
(Imagine 70 children, three caretakers, and no air-conditioning!)
Miss Pressly walked to the front gate, kissed the two boys good-bye,
and turned away. One child, William, called out, &quot;Miss Pressly!&quot;
and ran to kiss her yet again.
<P>
Donors were faithful to Palmer Orphanage in those early days,
and improvements were made to the campus. By 1909, there were
67 children. Palmer had almost two girls for every boy in 1911.
These ratios varied, but they reflected the greater mobility of
older boys who could leave and move into the world to find manual
work. In 1912, expenditures overtook receipts by $1,212 and the
trustees became concerned as the orphanage began to run a constant
debt. By 1915, with the Kaiser on the march and cotton at five
cents a pound, one report noted the campus was &quot;beginning
to suffer from want of repairs.&quot;
<P>
The elderly Friersons' letters to supporters were filled with
gentle but urgent pleas for monetary as well as prayer support.
As if to deny the effects of time and the scarcity of resources,
Florence observed in one: &quot;In talking with one of our faithful
workers yesterday, we agreed that we would look no longer at circumstances,
and would put discouragement behind us, while we labor on for
these little ones.&quot;
<P>
John Frierson, the son of William and Florence, could tell that
his parents needed him and that it was time to return to them.
A successful lawyer and teacher in Port Gibson, a town in southwestern
Mississippi near the Mississippi River, he bid his friends good-bye
and joined his parents at Palmer in 1910.
<P>
A 1912 note from John Frierson to supporters suggests the orphanage's
plight: &quot;From a human standpoint the outlook is cloudy. The
close of the fiscal year for . . . 1911 found us several hundred
dollars in debt, due to the falling off of receipts during the
summer months, our increased expenses for necessary improvements,
failure of [a] well, confinement in [the] hospital of [a] child
for months, and other things. . . . Unless our friends come up
more generously to our help, the balance will be against us before
the end of March. . . . Friends, the work is yours. We are your
servants.&quot;
<P>
<B>The John Frierson Years: A Standard-Bearer for Troubled Times</B>

<P>
Pete Robinson didn't mind the mile walk to school over hilly roads
that often were dusty or muddy. For decades, he and other Palmer
children did a lot of walking. But on this day Pete, a sparkplug
of a teenager, was making a different trek, one that surely caused
his bones to quiver more than any nail-driving tackle he endured
quarterbacking Columbus' high school football team.
<P>
Pete made his way downtown to the law offices of John Frierson
near the First Presbyterian Church, where the Palmer children
regularly attended. Before he knew it, he was being greeted by
a secretary. &quot;Have a seat and let me go get Mr. John,&quot;
she said. Before he could get comfortable, Mr. John beckoned.
<P>
By this time, around the 1930s, &quot;Mr. John&quot; had grown
to be a thin, tall man with a wrinkled face, drooping jowls, and
a slightly pointed head, all of which was covered by his magnificent,
perfectly combed, gray hair. The bachelor-lawyer and full-time
surrogate father of hundreds was a portrait of Presbyterian distinction.
<P>
He removed his glasses and took time to talk a bit with Pete about
his transgression. Mr. John was calm and gentle. He cared about
each child. But Pete had broken the rules, and he knew full well
the consequences.
<P>
Mr. John took off his belt and applied it to Pete's backside.
The high-school quarterback, who was recently inducted into the
National Wrestling Hall of Fame, never doubted he warranted the
licks and felt he profited from them. It often hurt much more
just to disappoint Mr. John. Pete and other boys would say routinely
for years to come: &quot;I never got a whippin' I didn't deserve.&quot;
<P>
Frierson also understood, however, that children deserved support
and encouragement, even when they acted impulsively. Once, in
December of 1935, a girl left Palmer and married a boy without
telling Mr. John, who was concerned when he heard of the girl's
choice in mates. Nonetheless, he wrote her a letter that said
this, in part:
<P>
&quot;<I>Of course we were all surprised and shocked to hear of
your marriage and I regret the manner in which it occurred. It
is the first time that we have had a run away marriage. It was
altogether unnecessary on this occasion. I have always dealt openly
and frankly with all you children. You were old enough to marry
and make up your own mind and if you had told me that you were
going to marry and had made up your mind to marry I would have
gone with you to stand by you on such an occasion. I want you
to know of my love and affection and continued interest for your
happiness.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;I sincerely hope that you will think seriously and put
into practice all the principles of righteousness and faith and
trust that we have endeavored to instill through all these years.
You will need them now, more than ever, and if you and [your husband]
determine upon the course of life that the Bible maps out you
can succeed and get along, live useful lives and be happy.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;I am enclosing to you a check for $10 with love and good
wishes embraced therein. Sidney will get your things together
and send them to you wherever you are.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;With sincere love and prayers for your welfare, I am,</I>
<P>
<I>Your friend,</I>
<P>
<I>John Frierson&quot;</I> 
<P>
Experiencing a consistent and caring discipline, many children
came to realize that they had stumbled upon a prize living out
in that cow pasture-turned-orphanage: a lanky, loving man who
was there for them in good times and bad. John Frierson, in this
sense, was the standard at Palmer Home for Children against whom
all others would be measured. He was the benchmark of consistency,
selflessness, and caring.
<P>
Frierson was Mississippi's representative to the White House Conference
on Child Health and Protection called by President Hoover and
held in Washington, D.C. in 1930. By this time, a new class of
&quot;professional&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; social workers
was calling for federal aid and action to develop comprehensive
codes governing the supervision and support of children who had
no homes. They argued that traditional, church-run efforts were
sentimental and sloppy. And they were hostile to orphanages. Men
like Charles Loring Brace, founder of the New York Children's
Aid Society, attacked orphanages for what he considered their
&quot;institutionalization&quot; of children. He and others campaigned
for what has become the modern system of foster-care placement.
The novelist Theodore Dreiser, the editor of <I>The Delineator</I>
women's magazine from 1907-1909, urged systematic government involvement
in childcare and published case histories of children offered
for adoption.
<P>
Frierson's correspondence makes clear that he didn't like it.
Frierson's words concerning the growing role of government in
caring for children seem almost prophetic today. &quot;I became
convinced and am still convinced that the adoption plan is wrong
for an orphanage. . . . There is no assurance of any religious
influence,&quot; he wrote. Government rule-making, he felt, practically
guaranteed that there would be no serious regard for religion
in the character formation and moral upbringing of children.
<P>
John Frierson was more than just a local lawyer with some ideas
about church and government. He was a scholar of Latin and the
classics, a reciter of good poetry, and a principled civic leader
who matched wits with the notorious Mississippi governor Theodore
Bilbo, who once called Frierson a &quot;pious, church-fed hypocrite&quot;
after Frierson dealt him a minor political defeat.
<P>
In one unfortunate respect, Frierson was a man of his time and
place, accepting racial segregation as a fact of life. But unlike
Bilbo's determined efforts to inflame racial hatreds, Frierson's
strong Christian convictions however tainted by cultural dictates prompted
him to treat all men and women with respect. Palmer's charter
establishing a home for &quot;white orphans or children of reputable
character, one of whom is dead&quot; was changed to admit black
children in the early 1970s. Palmer's present administration is
committed to serving children of all racial backgrounds, and three
black children currently live at the home.
<P>
Palmer's children surely knew little of the South's tortuous path
toward racial justice. Instead, each morning they saw Mr. John
walk up and down their ranks as they stood for inspection before
school outside the Lindamood building, named for a local donor.
And in the evening, they could hear the operas that he played
on his record player. The girls would entertain their boyfriends
in Mr. John's parlor as he read in a chair nearby. And anyone
was welcome to borrow books from his personal collection.
<P>
The campus was increasing in size and scope. By 1929, Mr. John
reported that the Palmer Orphanage comprised 110 acres, four brick
buildings, one brick laundry, a brick dairy, two good barns, a
smokehouse, and &quot;a splendid herd of Jersey cows.&quot; &quot;The
properties are worth $80,000,&quot; he stated, while the yearly
deficit had grown to $7,888.90.
<P>
In 1931, Palmer Orphanage was in the same shape structurally.
But the financial ruin of the Great Depression was hitting more
than New York stockbrokers. Mr. John found more and more destitute
children knocking on his door, and the care for a typical child
cost $20 a month. He told a church synod meeting in 1931: &quot;We
have not increased our capacity for children and do not intend
to, but it [is] impossible for us to deny children who need these
benefits when we have a place to put them.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Rhythm of Life at Palmer Home</B> 
<P>
A day in the life of Palmer Home remained pretty much the same
for decades. The rooster crowed before sunrise, waking the sleepy
girls in the Lindamood building and the boys in two nearby buildings.
By five o'clock or shortly thereafter, several older boys were
walking through the muggy darkness to the back barn, where they
milked a herd of dairy cowswhich they often named after the girls.
In the days before refrigeration the boys would fill large milk
pails and place them in a three foot-deep cement trough filled
with cold artesian water.
<P>
Meanwhile, teams of older girls worked in rotation on monthly
assignments, rising early to make biscuits and toast. There was
hired help, too. As Mr. John recalled in his memoirs:
<P>
&quot;A negro woman was the cook, with the help of the older girls
to bring in the food to the table and to wash the dishes after
meals. A negro man for the garden and lot, and three older boys
to milk the cows. There were coal fires in grates, the coal had
to be carried up stairs to the rooms, and the ashes brought down.
The lighting was by oil lamps and the wicks were trimmed daily
and the chimneys cleaned.&quot;
<P>
At six o'clock a bell would ring. The girls would break their
huddle by the floor heater where they were memorizing their daily
Scripture or catechism, and then everyone would converge on the
dining hall. Girls wearing pants or curlers were sent back upstairs
to change. Miss Clara Swoope, Miss Zina Witherspoon, or another
of the matrons would hear children recite their &quot;memory work&quot;
for the day. After recitation, the children could enter the dining
hall, sit down, and wait.
<P>
Ring! Mr. John struck his bell and called for silence, then a
blessing was offered and the eating began. &quot;Watch the milk
this morning,&quot; one boy might whisper, &quot;the cows have
been eating the bitter weed!&quot; After breakfast, Mr. John read
a Scripture for the day from his Bible. Then everyone sang a song
and were adjourned for school. Before departure, they reassembled
in front of Lindamood, where Mr. John reviewed their appearance.
<P>
Then off to school. In its first decade, Palmer established its
own two-room schoolhouseone room for the boys, the other for the
girls. But by Mr. John's time, all Palmer children were attending
local public schools, and stories abound of friendships made with
children from town. Palmer children were invited to local family
homes and participated in all school activities.
<P>
After school, a few boys stayed for sports practice, but most
children returned home and did chores: girls shucking corn or
shelling beans around the house; the boys in the gardens or among
the livestock. On Saturdays, for years, the girls scrubbed the
stove, piece by piece, and cleaned chickens for Sunday dinner.
<P>
At six o'clock in the evening another bell rang, and the children
reassembled for supper, after which Mr. John read to them from
whatever book he might be consuming, perhaps <I>The Black Rose</I>
or <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>.
<P>
All agreed that it was wonderful listening to Mr. John read: &quot;He
had a good, solid presentation voice,&quot; recalled Pete Robinson,
who came to Palmer at six years of age in 1926 after his father
was killed working in a lumberyard.
<P>
Often the sound of Mr. John's firm voice was all a child needed
for motivation. Billy Wray, who attended Palmer from 1930 until
1943, recalls the day the boys chose to swim at the river instead
of work on the farm. That evening Mr. John announced, &quot;Well,
I drove around Bolin's Bend this afternoon and I noticed more
grass than corn down there.&quot; Mr. John's voice made its point.
&quot;The next day we were down there getting the grass out of
the corn,&quot; recalled Wray in an interview.
<P>
Nights were spent at study hall, or in sitting and talking and
watching younger children play jacks on the sidewalk. Often Mr.
John would have children over to help them with their studies.
&quot;We would go over at night for him to help us with our homework,&quot;
recalled Evelyn McPhail, now a co-chairman of the Republican National
Committee who works with RNC chairman Haley Barbour. McPhail grew
up at Palmer in the 1940s and 50s. &quot;We'd be waiting our turn;
you'd sit on a little stool at his feet, and he would take the
book and sit there and help you with your Latin lessons.&quot;
<P>
Mr. John doled out the discipline according to the sex of the
offender. While boys might feel the sting of a curtain sash, girls
were rarely physically punished. They were made to sit with Mr.
John at his house and listen to classical music! One thing was
clear: mutual love and respect always prevailed. Perhaps no event
better illustrates this than one of the sadder moments in Palmer's
life: it was 1935, and Matron Clara Swoope was dying. Mr. John
recounted it this way:
<P>
&quot;I came home from Jackson one Friday night in 1935. After
breakfast Miss Clara followed me to my house and said, `Mr. John,
I went to see Dr. Lehmberg while you were gone and he told me
I was going to be sick. I want you and him to talk and tell me
what I must do.'&quot;
<P>
Mr. John and the doctor agreed that, in her late stage of cancer,
she should forgo treatment. He offered her a room at his house,
but the other matrons decided to set up Miss Clara in her own
room at the head of the stairs. Some days passed, and Miss Clara's
condition worsened. A local pastor came to visit and pray with
her. &quot;I think my sins have been forgiven,&quot; she told
him. &quot;Your sins, Miss Clara? You've got no sins,&quot; he
replied.
<P>
Mr. John, knowing that she was &quot;passing from earth to heaven,&quot;
prayed for Miss Clara, reading John 14:1-4. Then he and the children
sang &quot;When the Gates Swing Outward.&quot;
<P>
Early Saturday morning, November 23, 1935, Clara Swoope died and
was buried the same day. &quot;She knew and loved a child,&quot;
Mr. John said. &quot;It was not a detached interest, nor was there
any coddling familiarity, but an inspiring expectation of the
best to come. . . . Miss Clara was the finest expression of cultured
Christian womanhood: modest, retiring, self-effacing, the very
best kind of guide to youth. Her memory will be sacred, and a
benediction for years to come. She was indeed a servant of God
to the end of her days. She was so wise and so good and we are
thankful for her.&quot;
<P>
Palmer youth were taught to live useful lives. Fifteen Palmer
men served their country in World War I, and 54 in World War II.
When the Mississippi River flooded to record levels in 1927, two
Palmer girls who were working at Greenville, Mississippi called
Mr. John to let him know the levee had busted. &quot;Don't you
think we should get out of here?&quot; one asked. &quot;Well,
honey, do they need you?&quot; he queried. When she said yes,
he told them to stay where they were and sent some Palmer boys
to help out, too.
<P>
Mr. John never stopped loving his children. He was strong for
them to the end. Yet time finally caught up with Mr. John, and
it threatened to catch up with Palmer.
<P>
The money never seemed to be there. By 1945, the oldest boy at
the orphanage was a mere 14, and Mr. John was forced to supervise
the milking. In his 1947 superintendent's report to the Mississippi
synod, Frierson stated plaintively: &quot;For the improvements
that are desirable and necessary, I hardly know how to relate
it.&quot;
<P>
Finally, in 1950, Mr. John Frierson retired from Palmer Orphanage.
Perhaps he foresaw the hard times and struggles that were to come.
On December 7, 1957, Mr. John died at the age of 81, seven years
to the day that he retired. In his forty years at Palmer, John
Frierson had served some 600 to 800 children.
<P>
One day in 1959, the attorneys sent Palmer an official letter
accompanied by a check for $6,657.02 payable to the orphanage
from the estate of Mr. John F. Frierson. After paying for his
burial expenses, Mr. John had designated that whatever funds were
left be given to Palmer. During four decades of service, Mr. John
had taken no salary, sustaining himself on his lawyer's income.
<P>
One Calvinistic account of John Frierson's father, William, had
observed that his life was &quot;fraught with usefulness.&quot;
It added that his son &quot;John . . . [is] now filling places
of usefulness and honor.&quot; As his good Calvinist father before
him, and his beloved matron Miss Clara, Mr. John had led a useful
lifedown to his last dollar.
<P>
<B>Palmer's New Era: Change and Continuity</B> 
<P>
When Mr. John moved out of Palmer's life, &quot;Papa Joe&quot;
Davis moved in. God once again proved sovereign for Palmer Home.
<P>
Photos abound of Papa Joe playing with the children. One shows
him on his knees near Christmastime, giving a youth a ride on
his back. It was said that if you would collect the pecans, Papa
Joe would bake you a fruitcake.
<P>
Davis endeared himself to the children. Howard Kelly, a Palmer
resident from 1953 to 1962, recalled the children's initial impression:
&quot;He was a big man. I expect he weighed over 230 pounds. He
probably stood 6-2, 6-3; he had a size 52 belt. As a child saw
him, he was even bigger. He got your attention!&quot;
<P>
Papa Joe tried to maintain the Frierson legacy. But society was
changing all around Palmer. Children began growing their hair
long and rebelling against their parents. The music they listened
to was decidedly different from Mr. John's operatic arias. Davis
needed to negotiate these changes with care.
<P>
For instance, Mr. John had centered the children's lives on what
happened at Palmer Home. He had allowed young men to visit Palmer
girls only in his parlor and in his presence. Davis let the girls
go out on dates. Palmer's young women were encouraged to participate
in the activities of the larger society.
<P>
Papa Joe also addressed the need for more housing at Palmer. But
instead of constructing dormitories, he built cottage-style homes.
This shift in building type actually represented a shift in the
idea of what an orphanage can be. It became less a village and
more a gathering of family-sized homes. This important shift reflected
new ideas in the best way to care for children. Today Palmer houses
its children in seven cottage homes staffed by seven sets of houseparents.
<P>
The new construction took money. Like those before him, Davis
knew that he had to make the orphanage's resources stretch as
far as they could. &quot;I never really had to ask for the money
to build those cottages,&quot; recalled Davis. &quot;I just made
known to the churches what our plans were to care for these children,
and the money came in.&quot; A Palmer trustee once said, &quot;Joe
Davis will take 50 cents and get a dollar's worth for it.&quot;
Davis was helped by the South's post-war prosperity and by his
abilities as a fundraiser and money-manager.
<P>
Palmer continued its tradition of self-sustaining frugality. For
instance, when an old building was scheduled for demolition, the
bricks were cleaned and stacked so that they might be used to
construct the new cottages. The farm program continued, also,
raising beef cattle and hogs to provide meat for the children
and staff. But the home also embraced the modern economy, using
its resources to create more wealth for its children's benefit.
Palmer planted ten of its acres with pine trees that were intended
for sale to a paper mill.
<P>
Davis saw Palmer through the upheaval of the sixties and seventies.
&quot;I never really noticed any effect on our children at Palmer
Home. We just kept doing what we had always done: Give them the
most love and most opportunities we could,&quot; he said.
<P>
Nonetheless, Palmer has seen more changes as the years went by.
Palmer was made responsible to an independent Board of Directors
in 1979, ending official presbyterian governance of on-site administration.
Trained counselors, administrators and nurses have been added
to the staff of houseparents, increasing their expertise in dealing
with troubled children. And the process of admitting children
has been refined. Referrals come from churches, distressed parents
who voluntarily yield their children, the courts and social agencies.
<P>
Still, Palmer continues to specialize in providing homes for children
with promise. Each Palmer child has suffered indignities. One
hundred percent of the current residents come from broken families:
75 percent out of drug or alcohol abuse; about 15 percent out
of physical abuse; and upwards of 50 percent suffer from neglect.
Palmer makes a special effort to hold together siblings who might
otherwise be split up in modern foster care. Currently, Palmer
has ten sets of two siblings, four sets of three siblings, five
sets of four siblings, one set of five siblings and another of
seven. &quot;Virtually all our kids come from a family that is
below the poverty line,&quot; says Dr. Rob Crankshaw, Palmer's
director of counseling services. &quot;We find that a lot of the
parents came from good middle or upper middle class families.
But because of drug abuse or related situations, they just can't
hold jobs, get into all kinds of trouble, and they plunge into
poverty.&quot;
<P>
Since Davis's retirement in the late 1970s, four other men have
led the Palmer Home for Children. Their's has been the responsibility
of defining and carrying out the mission of a privately-funded
Christian orphanage. This is not easy in a secular society whose
institutions are heavily funded and regulated by government. Moreover,
as House Speaker Newt Gingrich discovered, many Americans have
very unfavorable stereotypical images of orphanages.
<P>
Today, Ed Waldron is executive director of Palmer Home for Children,
a post he held as the institution celebrated its 1995 centennial.
A Ph.D. in higher education administration with years of experience
in childcare, Waldron presides over a $1.8 million budget and
a staff of 20 who provide the care for some 75 boys and girls.
Palmer Home is preparing to improve and expand its programs as
it enters its second century of service.
<P>
Yet despite all that is new, the essentials remain. Palmer is
still covered with the sounds and sights of children, and with
the sounds and sights of adults watching over them.
<P>
Some of the current caretakers have the exuberant heart of a Florence
Frierson. Others have the strong countenance of a William or John
Frierson, capable of stopping a child cold in his mischief, or
repairing a broken spirit with one firm, kind glance. And the
many successors to Miss Clara Swoope remain on campus, housemothers
who quietly make everything all right.
<P>
A walk around Palmer's campus today would bring joy to Mr. John's
eyes. &quot;They are bright and interesting and as carefree and
happy as if they owned a bank or, perhaps, more so. Why shouldn't
they be? They have lots of fresh air and water, and a sufficiency
of food and clothes, and good friends and jolly playmates.&quot;
John Frierson wrote those words in 1912. Today, Palmer Home for
Children ensures that they still ring true.

<h2>MacArthur's Genius Awards</h2>
<b><I>The Oscars of the Multicultural Elite</I></b><BR>
By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Wooster">Martin Morse Wooster</a>
<BR><BR>

<blockquote>
<P><i>&quot;At the risk of revisionism or of blasphemy, I also 
suggest that the merits of the star system and of elitism, which is a 
star system extended to a highly refined group, be recalled.  
The onerous dangers of the star system have been exposed: 
the confusion of star and movement, of elite and group; the 
selection of the `star' through the media or through current 
governors, not through the movement; the feeding of the egos of 
the few while the many suffer malnutrition.&quot;</I>
<P>
<P><a href="pcs-196a.html">Catharine R. Stimpson</a>, 
<br>Director,
<br>MacArthur Fellows Program (1974) 
</blockquote>
<P>It happens every summer.  Sometime during the dog days 
of June or July, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation announces the <a href="pcs-196b.html">winners</a> of the annual MacArthur 
Fellows Program, the so-called &quot;genius grants.&quot;  Around 20 
people, some famous, many obscure, are awarded unrestricted 
five-year grants of between $150,000 and $350,000  which they 
can use for any purpose they desire.
<P>
The MacArthur Fellows Program is a relatively small part 
of the giant MacArthur Foundation's activities.  In 1994, 
the foundation awarded $130 million in grants, of which $6 
million was allotted to the fellows program and an additional 
$500,000 on an allied trust.  Between 1989 and 1994, the 
MacArthur Foundation approved $736 million in grants, of which 
$48 million, or seven percent, was allotted to the fellows program. 
 Nearly every other division of the foundation has a 
larger budget, and some of MacArthur's divisions, such as the 
programs to promote world peace and the health program, 
have budgets twice as large as the MacArthur Fellows program.
<P>But despite its low budget, the Fellows program 
probably generates most of the publicity about the MacArthur 
Foundation, and explains why MacArthur is one of the few 
recognized &quot;brand names&quot; in the foundation world.  There are two 
reasons for this.  First, as <I>The New Republic's 
</I>Robert Wright once noted, the  MacArthurs are one of the few awards 
individuals can obtain.  Most of the time, most of the money in 
the philanthropic world goes to other non-profits, and 
individuals can't get money unless they affiliate themselves with an 
organization.  But since MacArthurs go to people and not to 
groups, everyone in America can daydream about getting one.  Had 
the MacArthur Foundation decided to award the same amount 
of money to 20 or 25 organizations each year instead of 
to individuals, the MacArthur Fellows program would have 
remained obscure.
<P>Second, the process of awarding MacArthurs 
eliminates most of the grantsmanship and paperwork
 associated with philanthropy.  Though the MacArthur Fellows routinely go 
to people who support causes to which John D. MacArthur 
would be opposed, the program certainly follows John D. 
MacArthur's philosophy of charity.  MacArthur, a hard-headed 
skinflint, routinely rejected anyone who came to him asking for 
money; the MacArthur Fellows similarly turn down all people 
who apply for grants, even if (as has apparently happened more 
than once) you go to MacArthur Foundation headquarters at 
South Dearborn Street in Chicago and claim that God came to you 
in a vision and demanded you receive a MacArthur fellowship. 
 The MacArthur Fellows program is one of the few activities 
of American philanthropy where you don't have to worry 
about pleasing a program officer to get a grant.
<P>
Moreover,  the people who get MacArthur fellowships 
can do whatever they want with the money. This ensures that 
the MacArthur Foundation seal of approval frequently goes 
to eccentric and radical endeavors.  According to former 
MacArthur fellows program director Kenneth Hope, if a MacArthur 
Fellow wanted &quot;to start a revolution in Afghanistan, here's 
the MacArthur Foundation with its face hanging out saying 
there was something special about that individual.&quot;
 (<a href="/crc/pcs/pcs-196b.html">Past Winners</a>)
<P>&quot;Old John D. MacArthur would perhaps be horrified 
by some of the labor organizers and activists who have gotten 
his money,&quot; essayist Richard Rodriguez noted in a 1994  article 
in the<I> Los Angeles Times</I>.  &quot;Yet, there remains about 
the MacArthur prizes a faith that is deeply Protestant, 
individualistic and capitalistic.  Give the artist big money and you 
will create big art.&quot;  Or, as son J. Roderick &quot;Rod&quot; 
MacArthur announced in a 1979 interview in 
<I>Forbes</I>, &quot;Like the Renaissance princes, we'll fund Michelangelo.&quot;
<P>
It's certainly true that many of the MacArthur recipients 
have been distinguished Americans,  For example,  two of the 
recent Nobel Laureates in Literature, Joseph Brodsky and 
Derek Walcott, had been MacArthur Fellows before they won 
the Nobel Prize.  And occasionally, there is a non-leftist 
recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, such as philosopher 
Leszek Kolakowski, essayist Stanley Crouch,  or Robert Woodson 
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.
<P>
Far too often, however,  recipients of MacArthur 
Fellowships are  members of the hard left.  In a recent essay in 
<I>U.S. News and World Report</I>, John Leo noted that the 1995 
MacArthur Fellows included a feminist musicologist who argued  
that classical music largely consisted of &quot;aggressive pelvic 
pounding&quot; and a historian who argued that the history of the 
American West was the story of greedy, power-mad white males 
oppressing everyone else.  &quot;The truth is that the MacArthur 
awards, launched in 1981 to reward high achievement and high 
promise, are not what they once were,&quot; Leo wrote.  The 
science awards still seem to be given out fairly, but other 
selections pretty much have much more to do with politics than 
with achievement or potential.  A lot of the award winners are 
either ideologues...or low-luster laborers in the traditional 
vineyards of the left.&quot;
<P>
The idea of the MacArthur Fellowships originated 
with William Kirby, John D.  MacArthur's lawyer and a member 
of the MacArthur Foundation board until his death in 1990. 
 According to the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>, sometime in the 1970s Kirby read an article by cardiologist George 
Burch calling for foundations to be more adventurous in 
their grantmaking.  Kirby passed the article on to Rod 
MacArthur, who found the idea of making scholars self-sufficient 
appealing.  Within a few weeks after John D. MacArthur's death 
in 1978,  Rod MacArthur had perfected the idea of the 
MacArthur Fellowships and had recommended that they be the 
primary purpose of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation.
<P>
Kenneth Hope,  a Rod MacArthur aide who 
subsequently directed the MacArthur Fellows program between 1982 
and 1992, described Rod MacArthur to  the<I> New York 
Times Magazine</I>: &quot;MacArthur was the kind of guy who 
harangued total strangers in restaurants about PCB levels in 
whitefish.&quot; MacArthur's fanaticism ensured that he would promote 
the MacArthur Fellows Program even though some of his 
advisers apparently warned him that unrestricted grants to 
individuals were not a good idea.  According to a 1979 article in 
<I>Science</I>, Murray Gell-Mann, the eminent physicist who 
subsequently became a member of th
e MacArthur Foundation  board,  reportedly told MacArthur that &quot;if he had received a windfall as 
a young scientist, he might have gone into real estate 
speculation.&quot;
<P>
It took two more years for the foundation to define the 
size and scope of the MacArthur Fellowships. This was an  
unsettled time in MacArthur Foundation history.  Between 1978 
and 1983, Rod MacArthur launched a barrage of lawsuits 
against the Foundation, charging that the foundation board was 
mismanaging the sale of Bankers Life, the giant insurance 
company created by John D. MacArthur and willed to the 
foundation upon the founder's death.  Because of the Tax Reform 
Act of 1969, the  foundation had to sell at least 80 percent of 
Bankers Life stock, because under the Tax Reform Act, a foundation 
can not own more than 20 percent of a company's stock.
<P>It's clear that part of the reason Rod MacArthur was 
hostile to the Foundation board was ideological, since Rod  was 
very liberal and the members of the board opposing him, such 
as radio commentator Paul Harvey and former Treasury 
Secretary William Simon, were conservatives.  &quot;We're mostly a bunch  
of Midwestern businessmen devoted to free enterprise and 
opposed to government controls,&quot; one board member told 
<I>The American Spectator'</I>s Joshua Muravchik in 1992. Paul 
Harvey added that he was appointed to the MacArthur 
Foundation board because John D. MacArthur &quot;knew we mostly feel 
the same way about things that he did.&quot;
<P>
But because of Rod MacArthur's lawsuits, the 
Foundation board was expanded to include liberals who did not know 
John D. personally.  By 1981, the conservatives had quit, 
ensuring that the MacArthur Foundation would be as liberal as 
Rod MacArthur.  But the younger MacArthur continued to sue 
the board until very shortly before his death in 1984.
<P>
According to John Corbally, the MacArthur 
Foundation's first president,  &quot;for a while the board was devoting only 
about one-quarter of its meeting time to program activities and the 
rest to the litigation.&quot; 
<P>&quot;I recall counting more than 30 lawyers at one board 
meetingthere was literally not a seat available,&quot; added 
MacArthur Foundation executive vice-president James M. Furman in 
a 1987 interview in the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>.
<P>
It's unclear how all this turmoil affected the 
MacArthur Fellows program.  Kenneth Hope  told the 
<I>Washington Post i</I>n 1992 that the tension at the time was so great that he lost 
15 pounds during the first year of planning the program, due in 
part to endless late-night sessions and countless arguments.
<P>But it's certainly probable that had Rod MacArthur 
not launched his war against the MacArthur Foundation board, 
the MacArthur Fellows program might be far larger.  According 
to Hope, the MacArthur Foundation did resist two of 
MacArthur's ideas, awarding lifetime fellowships and tying the list 
of recipients to a list of world problems the foundation wanted 
to solve.  &quot;When we started this,&quot; Hope said, &quot;the first thing 
Rod asked me to do was to come up with a list of the 
world's problems.  His idea was that we would approach the 
individual through the problems.&quot;   (The 
MacArthur Foundation did award a few lifetime fellowships, but stopped this practice 
after Rod MacArthur's death.) 
<P>
<br>
<B>On the Lookout for Genius</B>
<P>
By 1981, the internal conflicts over the fellows program having been solved, 
the MacArthur Foundation picked 100 talent scouts to find prospective fellows.  
Since 1981, the names of these scouts have been kept secret, but the first list was leaked 
to <I>New York Times Magazine</I> writer Anne Matthews.  A few of the nominators, 
such as Woodrow Wilson Center director James Billington and philosopher Allan Bloom, were 
conservatives, but nearly all of the others were well-known liberals, 
including English professor Houston Baker, Jr., Carnegie 
Foundation president Ernest Boyer, <I>The New Republic 
</I>columnist Robert Brustein, author Frances FitzGerald, Independent Sector 
chairman John Gardner, literary critic Alfred Kazin, National 
Public Radio chairman Frank Mankiewicz, author Toni 
Morrison, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission chair 
Eleanor Holmes Norton, producer Joseph Papp, director Arthur 
Penn, cartoonist Garry Trudeau, and literary critic Helen Vendler. 
 Since then, prominent liberals known to have served 
as judges include historian John Hope Franklin, Children's 
Defense Fund president Marian Wright Edelman, former 
M.I.T. president Jerome Weisner, scientist Jonas Salk, physicist 
Murray Gell-Mann, and Center for Community Change director 
Pablo Eisenberg.
<P>This collection of the great and the good might very well 
tend to give prizes to  people very much like themselves.  When 
the first MacArthur Fellows were announced  in 1981, their 
harshest critic was <I>The New Republic'</I>s Michael Kinsley who 
noted that many of the recipients were winners of Pulitzer Prizes, 
or were tenured professors at Harvard, or, in the case of author 
and poet Robert Penn Warren, had been winning prizes for 
over fifty years before getting a MacArthur.  &quot;Given one or two 
of the names,&quot; Kinsley wrote, many people could come up 
with half a dozen others without knowing what the list was for.  
It could be this year's honorary degree recipients at Princeton, 
or a Presidential Commission on the Future of Values, or 
the celebrity endorsers for a particularly tony Scotch 
advertising campaign.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Not one of the first MacArthur fellows is 
suffering from lack of recognition for his or her talents,&quot; Kinsley added.  &quot;What's more, not 
one really faces financial obstacles in exercising 
his or her creativity.  They are already doing 
whatever it is the MacArthur Foundation admires them 
for doing; many are already doing quite well at it, and presumably they will keep on doing it, unless this windfall encourages them to stop."
<P>
Moreover, Kinsley argued, the MacArthur Fellows 
program contradicted the &quot;rugged individualism&quot; inherent in the life 
of John D. MacArthur, a heroic entrepreneur who began his 
career penniless and died a billionaire, never receiving a grant 
from anyone.  &quot;The basic theory of meritocracy is that in a 
free society the meritocratic virtuesimagination, daring, 
hard workwill produce their own reward, and in John 
D. MacArthur's case, for better or worse, they did.&quot;
<P>
The MacArthur Fellows program, Kinsley concluded, &quot;is 
not merely silly, but snooty; an exercise in invidious distinction 
for its own sake.&quot;
<P>
Despite Kinsley's trenchant criticisms, the MacArthur 
Fellows program has changed remarkably little between 1981 
and today.  Only one internal critique of the program has appeared. 
 According to a 1989 article in the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>, when Adele Smith Simmons became president of 
the MacArthur Foundation in 1988, a review was undertaken of 
the Fellows program to see how it could be improved.  
One criticism was that no business leader had ever received 
a MacArthur fellowship.  &quot;We're competing with other 
mechanisms that reward people, and prominent among them has 
been the marketplace,&quot; Kenneth Hope responded.  &quot;There's 
little case for giving it to a millionaire.&quot;  No businessperson has 
won a fellowship since this review was made.
<P>In 1985, a MacArthur Fellowship was given to a man 
who was once denied a grant by John D. MacArthur.  According 
to author Denise Shekerjian, at an unspecified time (probably 
in the 1970s) Patrick Noonan, later to be president of the 
Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Fund, went to the 
Palm Beach, Fla. coffee shop where John D. MacArthur spent 
his days drinking coffee and making deals. &quot;You know, 
Mr. MacArthur, sir...saving the park 
lands...important wetlands...national heritage...ecology,&quot; Noonan 
expounded. &quot;Young man,&quot; MacArthur retorted, &quot;I've never given 
away anything in my life, and I'm not about to start now.&quot; He 
ordered Noonan to pay for his coffee and left.  Nonetheless, 
Noonan became a MacArthur Fellow in 1985, and the land he 
hoped MacArthur would donate became the John D. MacArthur 
State Park in 1989.
<P>By the early 1990s, the MacArthur Fellowship program 
had ceased to be a philanthropic novelty.  The New York Times</I>, which placed the yearly announcement of the 
MacArthur Fellows on its front page, pushed the announcement farther 
and farther back in the paper; by 1994, the announcement 
barely made the third section of the <I>Times</I>.  And when Kenneth 
Hope decided to quit as director of the program, the reason he 
gave was that the job had become routine.  &quot;I still love the 
program a great deal, but I wasn't getting the sort of inspiration I 
had before,&quot; Hope said.
<P>Nor was it clear what sort of inspiration the 
MacArthur Fellowships have provided.  In 1983, MacArthur 
Foundation president John Corbally announced that the foundation 
was 
conducting an internal review of the program to see what 
the fellows produced with their grants.  That review was 
apparently not made public, nor has any other systematic review known 
to have been undertaken since that time.
<P>
<P><B>Character, Productivity and Benefits</B>
<P>There is, however, a fair amount of anecdotal evidence about the 
uses fellows make of their MacArthur grants.  About five percent of 
the fellows, according to Matthews,  are unable to handle the stress the 
fellowships create, and suffer from writer's block or other  stress-related illnesses.
<P>&quot;If you are a good person to begin with,&quot; former MacArthur 
Fellows selection committee chairman William J. McGill told Matthews, 
&quot;a MacArthur makes you saintly and helps your work.  If you 
have flaws, the absolute freedom of the award quickly 
magnifies them.  If you have some deep personal weakness, some 
mean stress, a MacArthur will assuredly tear you apart.&quot; 
<P>The evidence suggests that the MacArthur Fellowship 
is most useful when it is given to younger scholars at the start 
of their careers.  When African-American essayist Henry 
Louis Gates Jr. received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, he was 
an untenured junior member of the Yale faculty.  During 
his fellowship, he wrote six books and became an important writer. 
 &quot;At a time when I was struggling to become a literary critic, 
(the MacArthur) gave me the self-confidence to be bold and 
experimental,&quot; Gates told the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>.  Gates added that he used the MacArthur money to make several 
trips to Africa as well as to much of the United States.  &quot;I can't 
stress how important that was in my work.&quot;
<P>Tina Rosenberg, a free-lance writer, was inexplicably 
awarded a MacArthur award in 1987 at age 27. The prize helped her 
win a book contract to write about Latin America.  &quot;If not 
for MacArthur, I wouldn't have written the first book,&quot; she told 
the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>.
<P>
But for every success story, there is usually a tale of how 
the MacArthur blocked or even retarded a career.  Robert S. 
Root-Bernstein's  1981 MacArthur prize prevented him from 
getting a job.  At the time Root-Bernstein won the award, he had 
just received a doctorate from Princeton in biochemistry and 
was looking for a full-time position. The Salk Institute cut off 
his postdoctoral fellowship.  Former professors, envious of 
Root-Bernstein's prize, gave him the cold shoulder.  He ended 
up doing volunteer work at the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in Los Angeles.  Not until Root-Bernstein's 
MacArthur fellowship had nearly expired did he finally find a job 
teaching introductory  biology at Michigan State.  &quot;I got dumped 
back into the same narrow-minded system I was liberated from,&quot; 
he told the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>.
<P>
The stories of Gates, Rosenberg, and Root-Bernstein, 
however, are not typical because they were young and 
untenured when they won their MacArthur Fellowships.  It's far 
more typical for a MacArthur to be awarded to an older, 
tenured professor, usually at an Ivy League school.   By 1987, 
for example, five MacArthur Fellowsphysicist David 
Gross, physicist Joseph H. Taylor, historian Robert Darnton, 
physicist Edward Witten, and astrophysicist James Gunnall lived 
on Hartley Avenue in Princeton, New Jersey, and all taught 
at Princeton University.
<P>
As<I> Los Angeles Times</I> reporter Elizabeth Venant 
observes, the MacArthur Fellowship &quot;has not redirected the work or 
lives of most winners with full-time university jobs.&quot;  Many  
professors used their MacArthur awards to fund an IRA, or for 
the college education of their children, or as a down payment on 
a house.  Douglas Osheroff, a Bell Laboratories physicist, 
told the <I>New York Times</I> that he primarily used the $184,000 
he received to &quot;buy computers and make some home 
improvements.  It's nice to have money in the bank.  It gives you a 
certain freedom.&quot;
<P>
It's unclear that the MacArthur Fellowship has much 
influence on the older, heavily-credentialed recipients who tend 
to receive the award.  One-third of MacArthur recipients are 
over age 50, and when Roy Hoopes interviewed some of   them 
for <I>Modern Maturity</I>, he found that the major effect of 
the MacArthurs was to act as a credential that generated 
more income from lecture fees and other assignments.  Some of 
the people Hoopes interviewed regretted that they did not 
receive the award when they were younger and hungrier.  
&quot;Twenty-five years ago,&quot; literary critic Irving Howe said, &quot;the grant 
would have been three times more helpfulwhen you are 
younger and trying to get established.&quot;
<P>
It is also unclear how much the MacArthur Fellowships 
help artists though   it seems to have helped writers, who work alone. 
 Novelist and film director John Sayles, for example, used 
the first year of his fellowship to write screenplays for such 
popular films as <I>Clan of the Cave Bear</I>.  Sayles then used the 
income from these screenplays to finance films. 
<P>
But many of the MacArthur grants to artists have gone 
to people who have created theatre or dance companies,  and 
the recipients have used their grants to aid the ventures they 
have created.  For example, documentary film maker 
Frederick Wiseman used his MacArthur fellowship to prepare 
short scenes from potential future projects, which he then showed 
to other possible grantmakers.  For artists who have to meet 
a payroll, the evidence suggests that the MacArthur most 
resembles more conventional grants, save that the tedium 
of proposal writing is eliminated.
<P>
When J. Roderick MacArthur was dying of cancer in 
1984, he suggested that it would take a decade for the effects of 
the MacArthur Fellowships to be made clear.  Now that the time 
has passed, it's clear that the MacArthurs have had much 
less impact than most observers predicted in 1981.  Some 
younger scholars have used the MacArthur award to buy time to 
produce substantial works.  Many older scholars have been aided by 
the MacArthurs to a more comfortable retirement.  But despite 
the efforts of over a thousand anonymous talent scouts, 
the MacArthur Foundation has failed to find anyone as talented 
as Michelangelo.
<P>
The primary effect of the MacArthur Fellowships has 
been, as Michael Kinsley predicted, to act as a credential.  If 
someone received a MacArthur Fellowship, the unsaid logic goes, 
they<I> must</I> be important, or why would they receive the prize? 
<P>
<br><B>A Multicultural Trophy</B>
<P>
But even this argument is coming under question.  
The appointment of Catharine Stimpson as MacArthur 
Fellows director in January 1994 has ensured that the program 
has become a captive of  the multicultural left.   The 
MacArthur Foundation was always among the most liberal of the 
big foundations; as early as 1990, <I>The New 
Republic'</I>s Robert Wright observed that &quot;it is true that the MacArthur 
Foundation, the most commonly cited example of woolly-minded 
`60s-era liberalism, does indeed deserve this distinction.&quot;  But 
although MacArthur Fellows have tended to be liberals, the 1995 
recipients (the first completely under Stimpson's control) are 
even more left-wing. They include the editor of a left-wing 
news service, a lawyer who spent his career fighting the 
death penalty, and  a feminist filmmaker.
<P>The 1995 recipients, <I>New Criterion</I> editor
 Hilton Kramer told  the <I>Chronicle of 
Philanthropy</I>, were &quot;the straight politically correct, multicultural ticket,&quot; adding that director 
Stimpson had &quot;completed the total destruction of the MacArthur 
fellowship program, in regard to any kind of intellectual or 
artistic distinction.&quot;
<P>If the MacArthur Fellows continue to reward obscure 
leftists, it's likely that the lustre of the prizes will dim.  How can 
the MacArthur Foundation claim that all &quot;geniuses&quot; in America 
are women or minorities?  &quot;The MacArthur Foundation is free 
to finance political activists and gender ideologues who believe 
in symphonic rape,&quot; observes <I>U.S. 
News'</I>s John Leo.  &quot;but let's have no more prattle about `geniuses.'&quot;
<P>The MacArthur Fellowships are also losing their 
distinction because many of the recipients are, 
well,<I> silly,</I> a point best demonstrated by Jack Hitt in the November 1995 
<I>Esquire</I>.
<P><I></I>Every other year the MacArthur Foundation holds a 
convention in Chicago for MacArthur Fellows.  Though the meeting is closed to the 
press, the enterprising Hitt snuck in.  What did he find? Seminars such as &quot;Would 
Tyrannosaurus Rex  Eat a Lawyer?&quot; and  
&quot;What Shells Teach Us About Evolution and Economics,&quot; and informal debates 
among the fellows as to whether or not crack dealers could be turned into 
stockbrokers. Hitt's response to the convention is simplehe laughed.  For laughter, 
Hitt wrote, &quot;is almost as close to a sin as 
you can get these days.&quot;
<P>But Hitt's response is the right way to approach the 
MacArthur Fellows program.  At their heart, they are a 
philanthropic enterprise that borders on farce.  The story of the 
MacArthur fellows is not tragic or heroic, but comic; it is the story of 
an unclothed  emperor of the charitable world.  For the 
MacArthur Foundation has yet to answer one fundamental question 
about the fellows programwhy should anyone take it seriously?

<h2>Thinking about Welfare Replacement
</h2>
<br>
By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Olasky">Marvin Olasky</a>
<P>
For too long the welfare debate has been the same old same old.
Liberals have emphasized distribution of bread and assumed the
poor could live on that alone. Conservatives have complained about
the mold on the bread and pointed out the waylaying of funds by
&quot;welfare queens&quot; and the empire-building of &quot;poverty
pimps.&quot;
<P>
Now, however, there is beginning to be talk not about reforming
the welfare systemwhich often means scraping off a bit of moldbut
about replacing it with a revolutionary centrist system based
in private and religious charity. Such a system was effective
in the 19th century and will be even more effective in the 21st,
with the decentralization that new technology makes possible,
if we make the right changes in personal goals and public policy.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement necessary? Because in America we now
face not just concern about poor individuals falling between the
cracks, but the crunch of sidewalks disintegrating. An explosive
growth in the number of children born out of wedlocknext year,
one of every three of our fellow citizens will begin life hindered
by the absence of a father is one indication of rapid decline.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement morally right? Because when we look
at the present system we are dealing with not just the dispersal
of dollars but the destruction of lives. When William Tecumseh
Sherman's army marched through Georgia in 1864, about 25,000 blacks
followed his infantry columns, until Sherman and his soldiers
decided to rid themselves of the followers by hurrying across
an unfordable stream and then taking up the pontoon bridge, leaving
the ex-slaves stranded on the opposite bank. Many tried to swim
across but died in the icy water. Similarly today, many of the
stranded poor will soon be abandoned by a country that has seen
welfare failure and is lapsing into a skeptical and even cynical
&quot;compassion syndrome&quot;unless we find a way to renew the
American dream of compassion.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement politically possible? Because there
is broad understanding that the system hurts the very people it
was designed to help, and that the trillions of dollars spent
in the name of compassion over the past three decades have largely
been wasted. Conservatives who want an opportunity to recover
past wisdom and apply it to future practice should thank liberals
for providing a wrecked ship. And liberals should support welfare
replacement because, given the mood of the country, the alternative
to replacement is not an expanded welfare state, but an extinct
one.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement practical? First, because nonprofit
organizations based on traditional poverty-fighting principles
are displaying much greater effectiveness than their governmental
counterparts; groups such as Voice of Hope in Dallas, CityTeam
in San Jose, the Right Alternative Family Service Center in Milwaukee,
and Clean and Sober Streets in Washington, D.C., are all having
success where governmental programs have failed, and at a fraction
of the cost. Second, because new means to get more resources to
those groups with an alternative welfare vision are now under
development. For example, not long ago a tax credit for citizens
who would joyfully support a neighborhood charity, but hate the
idea hurling more dollars down the federal HHS drain, was a gleam
in the mind's eyes of a few; now, such a proposal is gathering
steam.
<P>
<B>The Death of Hope</B> 
<P>
The destruction of life through the current welfare system is
not often so dramatic as that which occurred in 1864, but the
death of hope is evident every day. During the past three decades
we've seen lives destroyed and dreams die among poor individuals
who have gradually become used to dependency. Those who stressed
independence used to be called the &quot;worthy poor&quot;; now,
anyone who will not work is worthy, and mass pauperism is accepted.
Now, those who are willing to put off immediate gratification
and sacrifice leisure time in order to remain independent, are
called chumps rather than champs. We've also seen dreams die among
some social workers who had been in the forefront of change. Their
common lament is, &quot;All we have time to do is move paper.&quot;
Those who really care do not last long, and one who resigned cried
out, &quot;I had a calling; it was that simple. I wanted to help.&quot;
Some social workers take satisfaction in meeting demands, but
others, who wanted to change lives, become despondent in their
role of enabling destructive behavior.
<P>
We've seen dreams die as &quot;compassion fatigue&quot; deepens.
Personal involvement is down, cynicism is up. Many Americans would
like to be generous at the subway entrance or the street corner,
but they know that most homeless recipients will use any available
funds for drugs or alcohol. We end up walking by, avoiding eye
contactand a subtle hardening occurs once more. Many Americans
who would like to contribute more of their money and time are
weighed down by tax burdens. We end up just saying `no' to involvement,
and a sapping of citizenship occurs once more.
<P>
We've seen dreams die among children who never know their fathers.
At the end of a very enjoyable movie from the 1980s, <I>The Princess
Bride</I>, a character named Inigo Montoya has been chasing for
over twenty years a six-fingered man who killed his father. Finally
he has the six-fingered man at swordpoint, and says in words he
has long rehearsed, &quot;My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed
my father. Prepare to die.&quot; The vile murderer begins to plead
for mercy. Inigo Montoya, says, &quot;Offer me money.&quot; The
six-fingered man says, &quot;Yes.&quot; Montoya says, &quot;Power,
too, promise me that.&quot; &quot;All I have and more.&quot; &quot;Offer
me everything I ask for.&quot; &quot;Anything you want,&quot;
the six-fingered man says. Inigo Montoya then runs him through
with the sword, saying, &quot;I want my father back, you son of
a bitch.&quot; A six-fingered government's programs have contributed
to the removal of fathers, and nothing else can replace them.
<P>
Some would say that the death of dreams is inevitable. Big business...
big government... big charity. Wake up and smell the cyanide.
Mass civilization requires impersonal welfare. Yes, we lose the
personal touch, but there is no alternative if resources are to
be efficiently and equitably dispersed. That's the pessimistic
positionbut the success of small, community-based groups shows
that it is not inevitable for the American dream of compassion
to die.
<P>
<B>The Realism of Welfare Replacement</B> 
<P>
Past performanceunder circumstances as materially difficult as
those of todayalso suggests that the dream can live. Today we
have lots of theories about fighting poverty, but it is not necessary
to be moving in the theoretical plane. The testimony of successful
anti-poverty programs a century ago and today is that those embodying
personal involvement and challenge, both material and spiritual,
can change lives even under hard circumstances.
<P>
For instance, our predecessors who helped others to move out of
poverty, and then turned their attention to the next group of
immigrants and impoverished, did not have it easybut they persevered.
Theirs were not the good old days. Work days were long and affluence
was rare, and homes on the average were much smaller than ours.
There were severe drug and alcohol problems and many more early
deaths from disease. We are more spread out now, but our travel
time is not any greater. Overall, most of the problems paralleled
our own; the big differences are the increases in illegitimacy
and divorce. Most of the opportunities and reasons to help also
were similar; a big difference in this regard is that our tax
burden is much larger, and many Americans justifiably feel that
they are paying for others to take care of problems.
<P>
Community-based poverty-fighters today also have it hardand the
task is perhaps harder because, in theory, we have improved our
poverty-fighting techniques The bottom rungs of the ladder are
no longer so low: we've removed the bottom rungs, leaving many
people stuck on the ground. Over the past three decades we have
fought a war on poverty that has also struck down three other
enemies of the left: we've waged a war against shame, a war against
family, and a war against God. And yet, when we take away shame,
we take away deterrent; when we take away family, we take away
the soil in which compassion best grows; when we kick out religion,
we also remove the greatest incentive to help and be helped. <I>Newsweek</I>
recently had a cover story about the need to bring back shame;
maybe we are learning.
<P>
Some on the left say that, without welfare, poor folks are forced
into &quot;demeaning&quot; jobs. But in the weekly news magazine
I edit, <I>World</I>, we recently had the shamelessness to put
on the cover a photo of a 65-year-old man who has had a shoeshine
shop in south central Los Angeles for many years, and is revered
in the community. Teenagers come to him for counsel, and some
use his wisdom on the way to gaining positions of trust and authority.
(One person we quoted, who was full of praise for the &quot;demeaned&quot;
shoeshiner, is now a police chief nearby.) Sure, we can pride
ourselves in removing the bottom rungs of the ladder, but then
many people are stuck on the ground. We need to reemphasize the
fact that it is not demeaning, but noble, to work hard to support
a family.
<P>
There's a lot we can learn in this regard from a wonderful Western
produced in 1961, <I>The Magnificent Seven</I>. It tells of how
seven Texas gunfighters come to the defense of a village that
previously had succumbed to a bandit gang; its best scene comes
toward the end, when a gunfighter played by Charles Bronson is
surrounded by a circle of admiring children. &quot;We are ashamed
to live here,&quot; one boy says. &quot;Our fathers are cowards.&quot;
The gunfighter replies, &quot;You think I am brave because I carry
a gun, but your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility
for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your mothers, and this
responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton. It bends
and twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
And there's nobody that says they have to do this. They do it
because they love you and because they want to..... I have never
had this kind of courage, running a farm, working like a mule
every day with no guarantee what will ever come of it. This is
bravery. It's why I never even started anything like that. It's
why I never will.&quot;
<P>
Some supporters of big government snarl about &quot;turning back
the clock&quot; to smaller-scale approaches, but it is not bad
to turn back the clock to that type of bravery. Besides, we truly
turn back the clock when we stick with the centralization developed
in the 1930s and the 1960s. We will be turning back the clock
in the 21st century if we repeat the mistakes of 20th century
centralization. We need to make the vision of the 19th century
relevant to the 21st by updating strategies and devising new projects
and tactics. That is already happening even in Washington, D.C.,
in nonprofits such as Martha's Table, which uses computers and
love in after-school programs; the Gospel Mission, which uses
insights of modern psychology within a biblical framework; and
Clean and Sober Streets, where up-to-date information about drug
effects is put into use within a system that provides an old-fashioned
choice: Shape up or ship out.
<P>
<B>A Positive View of People</B> 
<P>
Furthermore, if we fall into the pessimistic view that people
are problems, we are also turning back the clock, this time to
the 1970s when Zero Population Growth was hot. Population paranoia
should have been laid to rest by the experience during the 1980s
and 1990s of city-states like Hong Kong and Singapore, crowded
and without natural resources, yet rapidly ascending in economic
potency. Recent Asian experience shows once again that every mouth
comes with a brain and a pair of hands, and that each brain and
pair of hands, when trained, can perform wonders. Poor people
are assets to be liberated rather than problems to be subsidized:
They are resources, not victims.
<P>
If we focus not on weaknesses but on the strengths and competitive
advantages of inner cities, including location, then we can put
legs on a vision that at its core is simple: We need compassion
that is personal, spiritual, and challenging. We often hear today
that the problems of poverty are incredibly difficult. That is
only partially true: The problems themselves are solvable; summoning
the will to solve them is what often seems beyond us. The easy
way out is to look to government programs, slightly modified.
But there is no need to settle for so little: Those who have faith
and determination throughout the country are showing the opportunities
for effective compassion.
<P>
Members of Rosedale Park Baptist Church in Detroit's inner city,
for example, know what needs to be done. Pastor Hamon Cross, Jr.,
tells those who have been sucked into dependency, &quot;I gotta
hurt ya before I can help ya.&quot; The church offers free counseling
services, but clients must pledge to study specific scriptures
bearing on their problems, to discuss them in counseling sessions,
and to hear and take notes on a good sermon each week. The goal
is transformation, not just training.
<P>
Homeless women helped at St. Martin de Porres House of Hope in
Chicago learn what they have to do. &quot;Dysfunctionality, and
an often total lack of understanding of personal responsibility
and discipline&quot;that is the main cause of homelessness, according
to Sister Connie Driscoll, who founded and heads the 100-bed shelter
that is operated without any government funds. The women who come
to her, she notes, &quot;almost always have the money to pay their
rent, but they often do not. They spend the money on something
else, and they don't pay the rent on time, month after month,
until the landlord evicts them.&quot; Those women need not a Day
Timer but something that will flip the hourglass of their existence
before all the sand runs out.
<P>
Even <I>The New York Times</I> occasionally stumbles across the
core of the problem, noting last October 22 that three-fourths
of welfare recipients who leave the rolls later return, often
lamenting &quot;what they called their bad attitudes or insufficient
drive.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Crucial Importance of Attitude</B> 
<P>
Attitude: the technically-best training program in the world will
not work for manyprobably mostpeople on unless their minds are
reconfigured. One problem with the low-level maintenance that
welfare provides is that necessity is the mother of personal change,
and AFDC or SSI payments remove that necessity. Steve Gilkenson,
program administrator at the McAuley Mission in New York City,
and a man who has been through tough times himself, suggests that
&quot;The problem today is nobody's able to hit bottom, they just
bounce around the bottom, and every couple of months someone picks
them up.&quot; With decreased welfare payments, he suggests, &quot;our
chapel would be fuller and our audience would be soberer.&quot;
<P>
Some people say that welfare replacementemphasizing shelters like
the McAuley Mission or its counterparts in many cities, rather
than soulless government barracks; emphasizing abstinence-based
programs like Best Friends or True Love Waits rather than governmental
sex education; emphasizing tough anti-addiction programs as CityTeam
in San Jose does, rather than the numerous soft government variantsis
unrealistic. But the truth is, any program that emphasizes material
end results without first examining beliefs, values, and the attitudes
that arise out of those basics, is one that may look good in a
bureaucratic notebook, but is out of touch with fundamental needs.
<P>
Welfare replacement will come, slowly, but the administrators
and social workers whose livelihoods depend on the current system
will fight and kick all the way. They won't come right out and
oppose effective private programs, but they willin response to
public demandpromote programs that on the surface taste great,
but which over time will prove to be far less filling than what
private groups offer. The professionals will put lots of equations
on the reform blackboard, and tell the rest of us that only they
know what the higher math means. To respond well, we will need
to borrow a response from Mrs. Einstein when a reporter asked
her whether she understood the theory of relativity. &quot;No,&quot;
she responded, &quot;but Albert does, and I trust Albert.&quot;
We'll need to develop our own Alberts, not by trusting those whose
livelihood depends on welfare state payments, but those who practice
true compassion on mean streets.
<P>
<B>A Different Kind of Expertise</B> 
<P>
In California, for example, we'll want to skip the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I> but spend time at a gospel-proclaiming inner city church,
such as St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ. There, in southeast
San Diego, the fellow playing the bongos on stage may have been
a drug addict a year ago, and the man in a suit in the next pew
a recently-released convictbut a spiritual transformation has
swept both of them, and hundreds others, into a new life. As one
church leader, businessman Richard Smith, Jr., points out, the
church's goal is to deal with not just poverty, which is a relatively
easy material problem, but impoverishmentlong-term hopelessness,
humiliation and degradation, a culture unto itself. It takes more
than money to redeem the lives of those who have become spiritually
destitute.&quot;
<P>
In Colorado, a visit to Step 13, a rehabilitation program for
substance abusers, will throw more light on alternatives to the
SSI program than will an academic conference. Rough-hewn Bob Cote,
a former substance abuser who runs Step 13, now labels SSI &quot;Some
Sort of Insanity&quot; or &quot;suicide on the installment plan,&quot;
because of the alcoholics with standing accounts at liquor stores
who benefit from the government's tender mercies. (He is equally
sarcastic about popular estimates of the extent of homelessness,
based on reports from local shelter providers of how many people
they have housed, &quot;Drift from D.C. to California, be counted
as 1,942 people.&quot;) Cote, not a religious man, still emphasizes
that any program to be effective must produce an internal change,
not just an external change in job-pursuit manners which will
be temporary at best. The social work pros and profs, he insists,
just don't get it: &quot;50 masters degrees vs. 3000 street people,
who's gonna win?&quot;
<P>
In Georgia, rather than listening to those who believe in magic flick
the wand, provide new housing, and the problem of poverty goes
poof!we will need to hear explanations such as the one coming
from Summerhill Neighborhood head Douglas Dean: &quot;We're not
just talking about changing people's physical environment. We're
talking about spiritual change, changing people's hearts. A lot
of people have come here with quick fixes that have failed and
left people discouraged.... Churches can break through that discouragement
by telling the truth and showing people how to rebuild family
life.&quot;
<P>
In Michigan, to get a more accurate portrait than that offered
by liberal social workers, we will have to check in with Mary
Jackson, a cheerfully maternal, middle-aged black woman who eleven
years ago deliberately moved into the Smith Homes, a rough inner
city project, in order to help youngsters there. She runs a weekly
Bible club program for about three dozen children and is frank
about the problems of &quot;lazy&quot; project residents who have
been on welfare for years and have a &quot;deeply embedded&quot;
entitlement mentality: &quot;They just want to stay in their own
little worlds..... They think somebody owes them something.&quot;
Ms. Jackson was especially irritated when welfare mothers whose
children attended a week-long summer camp refused to pay the $50
fee: &quot;It's not like they don't have any money. They can afford
to get their hair and nails done and wear leather coats that working
people can't afford.&quot; Michigan welfare reform will succeed
only when the moms Ms. Jackson sees begin treasuring their children
above their nails.
<P>
In Missouri as in other states, there will be much wailing about
&quot;what will happen to the children&quot; if significant welfare
reform kicks in. To find out, we won't want to ask Children's
Defense Fund publicists but we will need to listen to Jerry Hayes,
who heads the Sunshine Mission in St. Louis and has set up an
MBA programmind, body, and attitudeor kids likely to fall prey
to the street culture of irresponsibility. Hayes personally understands
the difference between that culture and an opportunity culture:
As a child he lived part of the time in a government housing project
with his mother, and part of the time with a great aunt who made
it a priority to quiz him each day on Bible verses and teach him
the value of hard work and thrift. He understands that the cultures
cannot readily be merged; they have antithetical values, and a
person needs more than a government training program to move from
one to another.
<P>
In New York, there is great concern about what will happen to
&quot;the homeless,&quot; but paying much attention to the official
reports will teach us little. Instead, we'll want to talk with
Gilbert Gilliam, who combines the beefy look of an ex-football
player, the withered look of an ex-addict, and the quick smile
of someone whose life has changed: Gilliam, 38, is a shelter security
guard at the McAuley Mission and the person who has the greatest
opportunity to make or break the program. (Like secretaries in
many offices and sergeants in the army, security people truly
run shelters.) Gilliam, if he were in charge of an anti-drug program,
says he &quot;wouldn't hire nobody who hadn't gone through the
downfall. It doesn't take much when you're detoxing to fall under
bad influences, so the best thing is to be that person's contact`just
me for breakfast and dinner.' And if you don't know drugs yourself,
you don't know what it's like and people can fool youto be successful
here, you gotta have that gut feeling that enables you to tell
someone, `I know when you're bull-jiving me.'&quot;
<P>
What we've been getting from liberal theoreticians for years are
reams of bull-jiving but those who are matadors in the bullring
have a different perspective. In Oregon, Don Michel, executive
director of the Union Gospel Mission, doesn't equate welfare change
with mean-spiritedness, because he has watched people trading
food stamps for drugs. Michel now tells reporters about his changed
attitude: &quot;I thought just handing out food and clothes without
question was a very compassionate thing to do. But what I think
now is when you give things out without accountability, you're
participating in that person's harm.&quot; He sees that services
are available for those who want to change, but most will not
change unless they are forced to: &quot;It's never been true that
there is an absence of service.... there is an absence of motivation.&quot;
Michel wants to push hard: &quot;What sounds coldhearted to people
not exposed to this population is just reality.&quot;
<P>
<B>Drowning one-third of a nation</B> 
<P>
What Michel calls the &quot;absence of motivation&quot; is the
critical hole in much naive talk about homeless people restoring
some order to their lives, or people on welfare going to work.
Necessity is the mother of change, and our removal of urgent necessity
from the lives of many poor people has also taken away the impetus
to productive behavior. Realistic welfare replacement and coddling
cannot coexist.
<P>
We will need to insist that realism means taking into account
more than material conditions. The War on Poverty defined realism
as emphasizing dollars and cents rather than children's need for
a two-parent family, but the 1960s idea that a woman's place is
in her own apartment, with a husband optional, contributed to
a single-parent pathology that has ravaged the black community;
that pathology is now becoming general, with about one out of
four white babies born to single women, and the percentage apparently
rising each year. Our economics-only, supposed realism has damaged
two generations, and indexes of leading cultural indicators suggest
that the damage will be visited to the third and fourth generations.
<P>
Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 described one-third of the nation;
sunk into material poverty; Americans are a far more affluent
people now than sixty or so years ago, but the dire news is that
almost one-third of Americans are deprived in more severe ways
that they ever were. Now, nearly one-third of children are essentially
fatherless at birth, and nearly one-third of high school seniors
read at the &quot;below basic&quot; level, which means that essentially
they cannot function as readers.
<P>
We tend to focus on dropouts, but every year schools dump 750,000
more semi-literates into the workforce, and it's no surprise that
they have trouble achieving good wages at work. It goes against
the feminist impulses of recent years to concentrate particularly
on the need for men to be equipped to find good jobs, but men
need to be breadwinners if women are to have the choice to stay
home with their children. It is vital that fathers (whose sustained
presence is desperately needed if families are to be stable, teenaged
boys disciplined, and crime reduced) not to be relegated to the
low-rent realms of the playboy philosophy, hopping from bed to
bed.
<P>
Reducing illegitimacy and reemphasizing fatherhood are two key
steps to rebuilding marriage and family. The extent of our cultural
loss is conveyed in an anecdote offered by Anne Gordon; she is
the wife of &quot;Coach&quot; Wayne Gordon who twenty years ago
came from Iowa to the North Lawndale area of Chicago, set up a
weight-lifting machine in a local storefront, and conducted Bible
studies there between the grunts and groans of high school guys
who might otherwise have spent their time in gang-banging. Wayne
and Ann Gordon have since been instrumental in establishing of
the Lawndale Christian Center, which includes a gym, a full-service
medical clinic that provides health care to over 4,000 individuals
each month, a development corporation that buys and rehabs abandoned
buildings, and a computer-crammed learning center that provides
after-school tutoring. But along with all the improvements, Mrs.
Gordon recalls the visit of a woman who &quot;came to our house
one night at dinner time. She knocked on the door and we were
all sitting around the dinner table eating and she said, `Do you
all do this every night?'.... It seemed to her like a big event,
whereas to us it was just part of family life and very normal.&quot;
All of the improvements in North Lawndale will avail little unless
the tender mercies of a family dinner become normal activities.
<P>
The question of the hour concerning welfare replacement, and one
for the rest of this century, is how to make the normal an everyday
occurrence rather than an exhibit for an anthropological museum.
Welfare replacement is more than changing the welfare system;
it will only be possible if the educational system, the teen sexuality
culture, and the adoption system also change. In all of these
areas, the same old same old must live no more, if those who have
been enslaved in government welfare and school systems are to
have a new start.
<P>
<B>A Time for Optimism</B> 
<P>
Can the country make that start? Some may think it impossible
for a nation that has gone far into the jungle to hack its way
out. And yet, there is some historical precedent. England at the
time of the American Revolution was a morally sick society, but
the efforts of William Wilberforce and others helped to give it
a much improved nineteenth century.
<P>
In the United States, the 1840s and 1850s were decades of spiritism
and free lustNew Age theology and sexuality. The Civil War expansion
of government power introduced welfare practices that were previously
frowned upon. In 1873 one of every ten persons in Brooklyn (then
an independent city) took weekly rations from public storehouses.
Other cities were not far behind in their offerings.
<P>
Critics of such programs did not give up, however. They proved
that governmental provision &quot;does more hurt than good, and
makes more paupers than it relieves.&quot; They wrote not only
about funds wasted through promiscuous distribution to alcoholics
and addicts, but about &quot;compassion&quot; properly understoodsuffering
with and challenging those in distress. By the late 19th century
their efforts were proving successful. Reformers in large cities
were able to abolish indiscriminate relief, and able-bodied men
returned to the marketplace; an abundance of warm-hearted but
hard-headed charities dealt with special cases. Combining vision
and realism, our predecessors produced solutions that were not
panaceas, but did delay for decades an epidemic of illegitimacy,
and saved from misery thousands of children.
<P>
Today, after thirty years of social excess, the epidemic is upon
us. Liberal scholars complain of the &quot;feminization of poverty,&quot;
since female-headed households are the main locus of poverty,
but they do not acknowledge the triple-A causative factors: a
decline in adoption, an increase in adultery, and an AFDC system
that emphasizes the pseudo-independence of deeply dependent young
women. Americans concerned about poverty a century ago not only
saw cause and effect more clearly but came up with programs that
worked then and can work now, even in the face of a more extensive
social breakdown. We have far greater wealth now than Americans
did a century ago; do we have the will?

<h2>Bringing Daddy Home: <I>The Fatherhood Movement</i></h2>
<br>
By Patrick and Gwen Purtill 
<P>
For thirty years social analysts have attempted to persuade Americans
against common sense, and increasingly against common experience,
that family disruption does not seriously harm children. That
effort is rapidly losing ground. There is a large and growing
body of empirical evidence showing that widespread fatherlessness
is wreaking physical, emotional and spiritual havoc on children.
<P>
During these years, advocates of &quot;alternative families&quot;
justified family breakup by arguing that traditional families
were a widespread source of real pathology. The argument simply
does not hold water. For example, traditional families are less
prone to domestic violence than stepfamilies, single-parent families,
or co-habitating couples. The argument against the traditional
family has been dominated by the false comparison of fictional
models to real families. Traditional families are condemned as
&quot;dysfunctional&quot; when they fail to live up to the <I>beau
ideal</I> styled by a popular therapist. But the true comparison
is between the traditional family and its real world counterparts:
single-parent families, stepfamilies, and co-habitating couples.
Judged by that standard, the married, biological family emerges
as the best environment for children.
<P>
Certainly many traditional families have problems, which range
in gravity from everyday mutual annoyance to serious physical
abuse. And of course, there are examples of wonderful stepfamilies
and even single-parent families. But an adequate understanding
of the issue demands that we know the rule before we begin to
take account of the exceptions. And if we are serious about doing
what is best for our children, we will promote the institutions
that are likeliest to secure their happiness and well-being.
<P>
In virtually every case, &quot;family disruption&quot; or &quot;alternative
families&quot; means growing up without a father. Children deprived
of their fathers find it harder to develop normally into happy
adults. Young boys first learn how to treat women by watching
their fathers. Likewise, young girls learn what is, and what is
not, acceptable treatment by men. Children who grow up without
their fathers are much less likely to enjoy successful marriages
themselves later in life. Additionally, they tend to suffer a
variety of problems, including &quot;higher than average levels
of youth suicide, low intellectual and educational performance,
and higher than average rates of mental illness, violence and
drug use.&quot;1
<P>
Moreover, the family is the means by which children learn to interact
with others. Through the mutual bonds of affection and responsibility
in the family, children learn to extend their sense of affection
and duty to members of the larger community. &quot;Authority,
stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute
the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within society,&quot;
says the catechism of the Catholic church. &quot;The family is
the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values,
begin to honor God, and make good use of freedom. Family life
is an initiation into life in society.&quot;2
<P>
Perhaps the most alarming consequence of father absence is that,
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
&quot;children from disrupted families are at a much higher risk
for physical or sexual abuse.&quot;3 But, as many researchers
now point out, the three social problems most on the minds of
Americanseducation, poverty, and crimeall find a common taproot
in father absence.
<P>
Numerous studies show that children who live with both biological
parents have a great advantage. They tend to perform better in
class and on standardized tests. And they have fewer problems
with their peers. According to one study, for example, children
living apart from their biological fathers are 40 percent more
likely to repeat a grade in school and 70 percent more likely
to be expelled.5 Children from disrupted families also are less
likely to graduate from high school or to attend college than
are their peers from intact families.
<P>
Changes in family structure have had an even more dramatic impact
on poverty. Since 1970 the number of American children living
in poverty has been rising steadily. Nearly three quarters of
the children living in single-parent families will spend part
of their childhoods in poverty, an experience shared by just 20
percent of children in two-parent families.6 Moreover, for children
living only with their mothers, poverty is not necessarily a short
term drop in an otherwise reasonably comfortable childhood. For
22 percent of these children, it lasts for a period of seven years
or longer.7
<P>
The last 35 years have seen violent crime in America increase
more than 500 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Justice,
juveniles make up &quot;the fastest growing segment of the criminal
population in the United States.&quot; According to the <I>Journal
of Research in Crime and Delinquency</I>, &quot;the best predictor
of violent crime in a neighborhood is the proportion of households
without fathers.&quot;8 Nationally, more than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions come from fatherless homes.9
Moreover, most violent criminals are males who grew up without
fathers, including 60 percent of rapists10 and 72 percent of adolescent
murderers.11
<P>
Indeed, there is growing bipartisan agreement that father absence
is not merely one among many factors indicating risk for criminality.
Rather, it is the single most important factor. In a paper published
by the Progressive Policy Institute, Elaine Kamarck and William
Galston assert, &quot;The relationship [between family structure
and crime] is so strong that controlling for family configuration
erases the relationship between race and crime and between low
income and crime. This conclusion shows up time and again in the
literature.&quot;12
<P>
<B>Illegitimacy: The Norm in America's Inner Cities</B> 
<P>
Each year in America nearly one million children are born to unmarried
women. That is one child out of every three, a 400 percent increase
since 1960 when only 5 percent of all births were to unmarried
women.13 Many single mothers never marry or remarry. Even those
who eventually marry usually spend about six years as a single-parent.
For black women, it usually is much longer.14 Between working
and the responsibilities of rearing a child alone, these women
have little time to devote to romance. Despite tabloid stories
featuring the births of love children to fabulously wealthy Hollywood
superstars, the overwhelming majority of unwed mothers are poor
women with a high school education at best.
<P>
In the inner city, where single-parent families are the norm,
education is elusive, poverty sprawls across generations, and
crime is omnipresent. According to social scientist Charles Murray,
the black illegitimacy rate in inner citiescurrently at over 80
percent has created a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; culture with
&quot;the values of unsocialized male adolescents made norms physical
violence, immediate gratification and predatory sex.&quot;15
<P>
The disintegration of urban black families has created living
conditions previously unimaginable in the United States. In some
communities, the ideal of responsible fatherhood is reduced to
a teenaged boy buying diapers for the mother of his children.
The question is no longer whether current welfare policies are
bad for America's poorest families, but how to control the damage
they already have dome.
<P>
<B>Institute For Responsible Fatherhood</B> 
<P>
AFDC created an economic incentive for widespread illegitimacy.
But The Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Revitalization
is working to reverse this one family and one father at a time.
Reuniting fathers with their families is the most promising solution
to the misery and turmoil in the inner city and the Institute
is working at the front lines of that battle. According to its
founder and president, Charles A. Ballard, apart from looking
to a father for a child support check, much of our society &quot;looks
right through him.&quot;
<P>
Charles Ballard does not need statistics to know what can happen
to a boy growing up without a father. He is one of the statistics.
Ballard describes himself as an angry young man who dropped out
of school, fathered a child with a woman he had no intention of
marrying, and, finally, landed in prison. But in prison, of all
places, the familiar pattern broke. He became a Christian and
committed himself to becoming a real father to the son he then
hardly knew.
<P>
Upon release from prison, Ballard took jobs wherever he found
them. Finally he persuaded his son's mother, who had since married,
to let him adopt their child. &quot;There were times,&quot; he
says, &quot;when I had no idea what to do. Many times, my only
refuge was the knowledge that for all my faults as a father, I
was better than nothing.&quot;16 It took six years of hard work,
but he went to college and got his degree. Since 1982 Ballard
has worked with men in the Hough neighborhood in the heart of
Cleveland, teaching them to be good fathers to their children.
In the neighborhood around his center, two out of three children
are born out of wedlock.
<P>
What Ballard's Institute does there is far from standard issue
social work. &quot;If we believe that every individual has the
potential to control his life, then we must treat each person
with respect,&quot;17 he insists. Among other things, that means
not doing for anyone what he can do for himself. The Institute
does not spoon-feed a father through the bureaucracy or schedule
classes for him. A man who is going to be a good father to his
children needs to develop the initiative and confidence to take
responsibility for himself and his family. By the time a man leaves
the program, he already has accomplished formidable goals by himself.
<P>
Ballard believes that if you really listen, you will discover
that these young fathers already want to take care of their children,
and they even have some idea of how to turn their lives around.
But they need guidance and moral support. More than anything else,
however, they need role models. Consequently, Ballard has trained
what he calls Outreach Specialists who work from a mentor/protege
model of nontraditional, intensive, one-on-one guidance. They
ask a father for a commitment to four goals:
<UL>
<LI>Legally acknowledge paternity of his children.
<LI>Decrease at-risk behavior.
<LI>Stay in school, or return for a GED.
<LI>Obtain a job and begin to contribute to the care of his children.
</UL>

<P>
Separate group sessions for fathers and mothers are held weekly,
and combined group sessions for both parents are held monthly.
But the outreach specialists spend the majority of their time
working in the homes of their proteges. Meetings are held there
to deal with problems at the source. During the early phase of
the program, it is not uncommon for the outreach specialist to
see the father three times per week. Outreach specialists are
available to their proteges by pager 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. Mentors discuss long term (5-to-10 year) goals with these
fathers, then work backwards to develop specific 90 day plans.
<P>
One of the primary functions of the outreach specialist is to
serve as a role model to his proteges. Each must adopt what Ballard
calls a &quot;risk-free life-style.&quot; Those who challenge
young fathers to walk the straight and narrow must live according
to the same rulesfree of &quot;tobacco, alcohol, other drugs,
abusive behavior, sex outside of marriage, obesity or other high
risk behaviors.&quot;
<P>
At the outset, the father and mother often are not on friendly
terms. Therefore, the outreach specialist always contacts the
children's mother and anyone else, such as a grandparent, who
is deeply involved in rearing the children. Even if a father does
not seek custody of his children, one of the program's central
goals is to develop a respectful, cooperative relationship between
mother and father. A fringe benefit of Ballard's method is that,
after learning to work together for the good of their children,
many parents in the program eventually marry. But at minimum,
children will see their parents treating one another with respect.
<P>
With funding from the Ford Foundation, The Institute for Responsible
Fatherhood and Family Revitalization is embarking upon a tremendous
expansion this year. Ballard is working to replicate his Cleveland
operation in Nashville, Yonkers, San Diego, Milwaukee, and the
District of Columbia. Each of these cities has shown an interest
in the program as well as a base of support within the community.
Mr. Ballard and his family currently are relocating to Washington,
D.C. to manage all of these programs from a central office. It
is difficult to predict how well the Institute will succeed at
maintaining the integrity of Ballard's intensive one-on-one approach
and at requiring hard virtues of outreach specialists in distant
cities.
<P>
<B>Divorce: Life Without Father Hits the Middle Class</B> 
<P>
But escalating rates of illegitimacy tell only half of the story.
There is more than one way to grow up without a father. An estimated
one million children each year go through the divorce or separation
of their parents. Although the rate has fallen somewhat since
its peak in the early 1980s, the last three decades have seen
the divorce rate in America triple.
<P>
Divorce has a profound impact on child well-being. Children of
divorce, along with their mothers, almost always suffer economically.
Fathers typically see their financial position improve somewhat
after divorce. But even if child support arrangements were perfectly
equitable, women and children would still suffer economically
from a family breakup. The crucial fact is that very few men have
the financial wherewithal to support two households, particularly
if they later remarry and father more children. In the overwhelming
majority of cases, single mothers will always have to work full
time while struggling to care for their children alone.
<P>
More surprising, however, is the extent and duration of emotional
damage suffered by these children. Only in cases involving physical
violence do children show signs of relief over family breakupeven
when the parents' relationship was an unhappy one.18 The California
Children of Divorce Study has documented elevated levels of depression,
underachievement, and difficulty maintaining stable love relationships
into adulthood.
<P>
<B>Mary and the Legacy of Divorce</B> 
<P>
This weekend Mary is helping her stepmother with a birthday party
for her nine-year-old stepsister. Mary, a white, 28-year-old woman,
lives in a Washington, D.C. surrounded by close friends. She holds
a master's degree from a private university. She is passionate
about her faith and her social work. And she has a tendency to
take in strays.
<P>
She sees her father and stepmother regularly, but having a relationship
of any kind with her father came with difficulty. Her younger
brother Mark remains bitter. They both were too young to remember
their parents' divorce. But they remember what came afterward:
isolation, poverty, humiliation, even physical danger. They knew
that everyone else in their family was middle class and upper middle
class but they were poor.
<P>
After the divorce, Mary and Mark moved to the West Coast with
their mother, Linda, to be closer to her family. They moved into
a townhouse after a short stay with Mary's godparents. A neighbor
took care of the kids during the day while Linda finished Montessori
training. Even with Papa, Linda's father, paying rent, &quot;we
ate peanut butter and jelly every day,&quot; remembers Mary. &quot;But
at least there we knew people. We had friends.&quot;
<P>
Because Linda desperately needed a better paying job, the threesome
moved when an offer came from a small town in the southwest. That
is when things really fell apart. They had no money, no friends,
and the local Methodist church made it clear that they were not
welcome. Linda was shocked. After all, she hadn't wanted the divorce.
She had been abandoned with two small children.
<P>
Destitute in a town far from anyone they knew, Linda worked two
jobs, and sometimes three, to make ends meet. During that time,
both Mary and her little brother were abused by strangers. There
was simply no one to protect them.
<P>
For all this, Mary and Mark can still be considered fortunate.
They lived in a relatively stable single-parent home. There was
no revolving door ushering new members into their &quot;family,&quot;
and old ones out. Nevertheless, they moved every year until Mary
was seven. Like most divorced mothers, Linda was constantly forced
to move for better jobs or cheaper housing. New friendships that
might have grown into a valuable support system for Linda and
the children were continually severed. &quot;Dad was not in the
picture at all then,&quot; says Mary. He had remarried and moved
East. They met him for the first time at the instigation of their
new stepmother, Joan, when Mary was seven. After that, they went
to visit on an annual vacation. &quot;Joan really tried hard.
But it was always stiff and awkward.&quot;
<P>
Then Linda got a job in a large city nearby. Because she would
be teaching in a public school, she would be drawing a larger
paycheck. Both Linda and the children were happy to be leaving
after two years. It had seemed an eternity. As they moved into
their new apartment, things looked up for the first time. But
soon, the school board realized that Linda had not completed a
course in state history. She kept her jobbut lost half her salary.
Their car was repossessed. And again they were forced to move,
this time into a smaller apartment shared with someone who delivered
newspapers with Linda in the early morning. &quot;Nothing had
prepared Mom to be poor, and she didn't know how to do it,&quot;
Mary says. &quot;On payday she would go out and spend all of the
money on food. By the third week of the month, the food would
run out and there was just nothing to be done about it.&quot;
<P>
Finally Linda completed the state history course and her full
salary was reinstated. Most importantly, they found a church that
wanted and welcomed them. It was a large, affluent Methodist church.
From that day on, they were never truly hungry again. Groceries
arrived when they were needed. No name, no notejust food. Anyone
could see that they were poor. But now someone was paying enough
attention to know when they were desperate.
<P>
The youth ministers took Mary and Mark under their wings. They
frequently called the children at home and they discretely provided
money to include them in youth activities. Likewise, the adults
of the church went out of their way to give time and attention
to the kids and to Linda. According to Mary, &quot;Mom needed
men to talk to. Mark was growing up, and she just didn't know
what to do with him.&quot; He had never known adult men and it
was beginning to show. There were constant school and discipline
problems.
<P>
Despite Linda's efforts, and the church's support, both kids were
falling in with bad crowds. When Mary finished junior high, she
asked to go to a private school. &quot;I didn't like what my friends
were doing, but they were my friends. I needed to break away.&quot;
So Mary worked during the summer and with Linda's help saved enough
money to attend a Catholic girls school. Mary suspects that her
grandparents helped. Still, the high tuition returned the family
to hardship. So Mary wrote her father, who came through. &quot;He
was always more willing to help with me than with Mark.&quot;
<P>
Mary and Mark were fortunate in several ways. Unlike most children
in a single-parent household, Mary and Mark both attended good
schools and completed college, even if they were not eating well.
And both have managed to avoid the most disturbing social ill
traceable to father absence: crime. But Mary is the first to admit:
&quot;I don't trust men. I can't do it.&quot; Last year, she left
a job she liked in part because she was unable to communicate
with her male boss. &quot;I should have stood up for myself. And
I know I wasn't playing the role he wanted me to play in the firm.
But I just couldn't confront him.&quot;
<P>
Mark has not begun to recover. Mary says, &quot;He simply cannot
form friendships with normal men. And he dates mean, manipulative
girls who completely envelop him. If they don't mistreat him,
he leaves. He is in his mid-twenties now. I don't know what will
happen to him.&quot; Moreover, neither Mark nor his father have
attempted to form a relationship. Since graduating from college
Mark has drifted aimlessly. Although he is not lazy, he works
only sporadically. Unable to form stable relationships, he treats
even his job as just another transitory experience.
<P>
Mary and Mark exemplify the catch-22 of divorce. Mark clearly
needed his father, and perhaps he would have benefited from a
stepfather in the house. But children, especially girls, often
find themselves in an adversarial relationship with their stepfathers,
competing for the time and affection of their mothers. As Barbara
Dafoe Whitehead reports, &quot;In general the evidence suggests
that remarriage neither reproduces nor restores the intact family
structure.... Indeed, children living with stepparents appear
to be even more disadvantaged than children living in a stable
single-parent family.&quot;19 Too often, the additional time and
income available to adults who remarry is not invested in the
children.
<P>
<B>National Fatherhood Initiative</B> 
<P>
The National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI) hopes to take a comprehensive
look at the issue of fatherlessness. As Mary's experience indicates,
the problems of growing up fatherless are not limited to urban,
black neighborhoods. They are not even limited to the poverty
most divorced women and their children suffer. There are unforeseeable
consequences for children who know that their father chose not
to live with their mother even though it meant he would not live
with them. The drama, scope, and gravity of fatherlessness in
the inner city make it a social problem of greater urgency. But
surely we should not expect poor minorities to live by standards
set, but not lived, by policymakers in the suburbs.
<P>
As Commissioner on Children, Youth and Families in the Bush Administration,
Dr. Wade F. Horn began speaking in 1991 on the importance of fathers
and of the two-parent family for child development. At first he
says, &quot;People would stand up and leave the room.&quot; They
aren't leaving anymore. Last year, Don Eberly, president of the
newly-formed National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI), asked Dr. Horn
to serve as the group's director. Conceived as a research and
education organization, NFI recently began to accept individual
memberships. &quot;We were constantly getting phone calls from
men who had seen us speak or read an article. They wanted to know
how to join, and we just got tired of telling them they couldn't.&quot;
<P>
The message that played so badly four years ago but is drawing
crowds today is a simple one. According to Dr. Horn, &quot;The
two-parent family is not just different, which is what everyone
used to say. The two parent family is better. Even if everyone
can't have that, we need the ideal. I never make this a moral
argument. There is plenty of empirical evidence.&quot; NFI has
worked to see that the evidence is given a public hearing.
<P>
&quot;We have to get rid of the myth of the superfluous father,&quot;
says Horn. &quot;A man's worth as a father is independent of his
economic status. Fathers should not be judged by the size of their
wallets. And we should not be trying to make men into assistant
mothers. Fathers play a unique and irreplaceable role in the lives
of their children.&quot;
<P>
The masculine role in nurturing children is not widely appreciated
because it does not fit into the modern definition of paternal
love. Fathers and mothers relate differently to their children.
Fathers tend to encourage their children to strive for excellence.
They push their children to be successful. And they are quick
to offer guidance and support. Because fathers demand the best
from their children, they are pivotal in character formation.
<P>
Fathers also tend to spend more time playing with their children.
Because their play is more physical than mothers', from team sports
to horseplay around the house, it becomes an important factor
in teaching children when and how to take risks. According to
NFI literature, &quot;This is a perfect example of how fathers
and mothers together form a terrific parenting team. Father encourages
risk taking. Mother encourages caution. Together, they give the
child a perfect message: try new things; use judgement; if you
get hurt or fail, we are here to comfort you.&quot;
<P>
According to Horn, it is very important that Americans realize
that &quot;men are very unlikely to be committed and responsible
fathers in the long term outside of marriage.&quot; If a child's
parents are not married, even men who try hard to be good fathers
tend to disappear from their children's lives after the first
two-and-a-half-years. But children need the love and support of
their fathers for more than just a couple of years. Moreover,
fathers who develop visiting relationships with their children
cannot replace full-time parents.
<P>
Early in his career as a clinical psychologist, Horn observed
that it was not unusual for child psychologists to believe that
they were more important to the children they treated than parents.
&quot;I remember thinking that I must have been absent on the
day they handed out the magic wands. There was no way that I,
with all of my expertise, could do for a child in a couple of
hours a week what the commitment of the parents could do. In my
experience, most parents were genuinely trying to do what was
best for their children.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The experts tend to get very caught up in the minutia of
what parents must do with their children at six months, eight
months, two years. And they predict terrible consequences if their
plan isn't followed to the letter. Actually, in nearly every case,
fathers just need a few general principles. They can work out
the application for themselves.&quot;
<P>
The three principles Dr. Horn tries to convey to fathers can be
summed up as time, commitment and responsibility. Love covers
a multitude of sins. And Dr. Horn believes that if fathers are
true to these three principles, everything else can be worked
out.
<P>
<B>Time</B>: For the last two decades, experts have said that
parents could get away with spending very little time with their
children, as long as it was &quot;quality time.&quot; Dr. Horn
says, &quot;This was a wonderful salve for parental guilt, but
a lousy way to rear children.&quot; Fathers should spend plenty
of time with their children. What families do together is less
important than their spending time together.
<P>
<B>Commitment</B>: A man must be committed to his marriage; and
he must keep his commitments to his children. Commitment shows
up in little ways every day. If you tell your child that you are
going to do something, stick to that commitment. More than anything,
you show commitment by spending time with your children. Fathers
should be willing to work as hard at their families as they do
at their careers.
<P>
<B>Responsibility</B>: A father's primary responsibilities include
insuring that his children are well fed, safely housed, and clothed.
In addition, he should teach them good manners and self-discipline.
How these matters are handled is best determined by each couple
according to its circumstances. But a father should not blame
someone else if his children are unsupervised, ill-mannered, or
not eating properly.
<P>
NFI works to persuade Americans that Washington policy formulas
cannot solve the problems their own families and communities face.
NFI President Don Eberly is quick to point out that government
policies alone, however worthy, will not rebuild America's families.
Consequently, the National Fatherhood Initiative focuses primarily
on challenging, from the ground up, the idea that fathers are
dispensable.
<P>
In October of 1994, the Initiative convened the first National
Summit on Fatherhood, which is planned as a bi-annual event. The
Summit, held in Dallas, Texas, featured board members David Blankenhorn,
actor James Earl Jones, Dr. Louis Sullivan, former U.S. Secretary
of Health and Human Services, and congressman and former pro football
star Steve Largent. Vice President Al Gore delivered one of the
keynote addresses. After the success of the Summit, NFI launched
the National Fatherhood Tour, featuring NFI board chairman David
Blankenhorn. The goal of these tours is to promote grassroots
efforts dedicated to fostering fatherhood in local communities.
<P>
Most recently, NFI has been accepted as a client of the Ad Council
and hopes to air its first public service announcements in early
1996. This year NFI published <I>Father Facts</I>, a monograph
by Dr. Horn which compiles the most compelling data on fatherhood
in a usable format.
<P>
NFI's actions at the community level will be complemented by its
most ambitious goal. Although still on the drawing board, NFI
hopes to work in five pilot cities bringing local leaders together
to create a &quot;father friendly community.&quot; Two cities
have already asked for NFI's help.
<P>
Community leaders will be asked to sign a statement supporting
the importance of fathers, and back up their commitment with three
to five specific actions supporting fatherhood in their communities.
The owner of a local radio station, for example, might commit
to airing public service announcements. A business leader might
commit to respecting an employee's family responsibilities and
to encourage other community businessmen to do likewise. The goal
is to have community members encourage one another to meet family
responsibilities and to dispel the &quot;myth of the superfluous
father.&quot;
<P>
<B>Vive La Difference</B> 
<P>
For 2,500 years, the Western philosophical tradition has spoken
on gender with one voice: women and men share in all that is essential
to human nature. Differences, in this respect, are less significant
than similarities. Nevertheless, those differences are immutable
and important for it is the differences between women and men
that form the basis of the family. Rail against them, we may.
Diminish their importance, we certainly have tried; but eliminate
them, we cannot. Even the most savage, totalitarian, Marxist regimes
were reluctantly forced to concede to human nature on this issue.
Through brutal repression families could be distorted, but they
could not be eliminated.
<P>
Failing to respect the differences and complimentary nature of
the sexes breaks down the bonds of affection in the family. The
competitive rather than cooperative spirit it sows has resulted
in widespread mistrust within an institution designed, among other
reasons, to promote the happiness of its members.
<P>
Those who see marriage as merely a contractual agreement between
consenting adults tend to view with suspicion its restrictions
upon individual liberty. Even some who wish to defend the family
as necessary find themselves in the awkward position of arguing
that while a stable society needs stable families, and stable
families need fathers, men may be happier outside of the family.
<P>
However, the evidence suggests that the bachelor's life is anything
but carefree. As George Gilder writes, &quot;In general, compared
to others in the population, the single man is poor and neurotic...
disposed to criminality, drugs, and violence. He is irresponsible
about his debts, alcoholic, accident prone, and susceptible to
disease.&quot;20 These qualities tend to slough off quickly upon
marriage, only to reappear after the loss of a wife through death
or divorce.
<P>
In short, while men may be quite capable of taking care of themselves,
they tend to do so only when they have families who need them.
Single men have almost twice the mortality rates as married men.21
<P>
At the outset of the sexual revolution, progressive pundits liked
to say that the institution of marriage, having outlived its usefulness,
was dying a natural death. But the facts of life have not changed.
Married men still earn some 70 percent more than singles <I>of
either sex</I>.22 And, far from being a liberating experience,
single motherhood is the surest route to poverty. In fact, 94
percent of the AFDC (welfare) caseload is single-parent families.23
Economically and socially, marriage subsidizes a life support
system for &quot;alternative families&quot; because they have
proven too weak to survive on their own.
<P>
Nevertheless, a handful of radical feminists argue that bringing
men home will only make matters worse for some women and children.
This undoubtedly is true but deceptive. It is like banning penicillin
because some people experience a serious allergic reaction to
it. It makes the perfect the enemy of the good. Unfortunately,
it also is an indication of how divorced some elements of the
feminist movement are from the actual experience of the large
majority of Americans. Finally, it demonstrates the ability of
a small, but well-organized coalition to perpetuate a distorted
view of family life through its influence within the academic
community.
<P>
Responsible fatherhood may not be easy. But it is natural. No
twelve-step legislative program is necessary for its recovery.
The government needs only to cease penalizing and discouraging
traditional families. Our cultural institutions, with the help
of human nature, can do the rest.
<P>
Half of anything is a lot. Half of all marriages end in divorce.
Half of all divorces involve children. Half of America's children
are growing up with only half of their parents.24 Half of the
children who do not live with their fathers have never even darkened
his doorway. It is increasingly clear that children who grow up
without their fathers don't stand half a chance.

<h3>PROMISE KEEPERS</h3> 
<P>
Another group with a message for men is Promise Keepers, and it
has been packing football stadiums all across the country. In
May more than 50,000 men paid $55 each to attend a conference
at RFK stadium in Washington, D.C. Judging by the crowd, Promise
Keepers appeals to men of all races, professions, income levels,
and political inclinations. The message they come to hear is that
a &quot;real man&quot; worships God, loves and respects his wife,
and supports his children. Eight more conferences are scheduled
through October 1995, and five of them are already sold out. All
are in major sports arenas capable of holding large crowds.
<P>
Only the National Organization for Women could possibly feel threatened
by a group of men as wholesome and diverse as the one gathered
at RFK. But, right on cue, NOW vice president Rosemary Dempsey
told the <I>Washington Post</I> that Promise Keepers was promoting
&quot;a not-very-well-cloaked misogynistic message.&quot;
<P>
Former University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney founded
Promise Keepers in 1990. In the past year, its staff and budget
have grown more than five-fold. McCartney's goal is to reconnect
men with religion and a moral life by persuading them that men
can and should be masculine even as they worship God. Although
the organization requires no dues and is not membership-driven,
its program asks men to make seven promises: to honor Jesus Christ;
to have close male friends; to practice spiritual, moral, and
sexual purity; to be faithful to wife and children; to support
the church; to defy racial and denominational barriers; and to
go out and encourage the world to do the same.

<p>
The social and political war over 
		school choice has many battle
		fields, but none may be as important as the struggle now occurring in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which pits low-income and minority parents against the Milwaukee Teacher's Union, the National Education Association and the ACLU.  The conflict, described by author Daniel McGroarty in a new book, Break These Chains: The Battle for School Choice (Prima, 1996), is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court after the Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked 3-3 this spring on the issue of the program's constitutionality.  The outcome of the case of Jackson v. Benson  "will determine the future of the nation's most promising educational reform," says Institute for Justice attorney Clint Bolick, who represents the 1,500 parents and students participating in the program and who is pushing to expand it to 15,000 students.
	As part of a campaign to kill the voucher program in the cradle, a Milwaukee group called "Rethinking Schools" has published a 32-page pamphlet titled "False Choices: Why School Vouchers Threaten Our Children's Future," and it is working with the Milwaukee teachers union and the National Education Association to see that it is widely distributed.  McGroarty writes that the pamphlet's objective "is to taint the very idea of vouchers by portraying it as inherently racist."  In an introductory essay, Robert Lowe, editor of the eponymous newspaper put out by the group, charges that "the first school choice program provided white students in Virginia public funds in order to attend private academies in order to avoid attending public schools with blacks."  A cartoon in the Rethinking Schools newspaper, distributed free to teachers, shows black and white students drinking from separate water fountains. By poisoning a debate over educational policy with the red herring of racism, opponents of school choice think they can kill the program.
<p>
	Fortunately Rethinking Schools and its allies have formidable opponents whose advocacy of school choice in Milwaukee cannot be vanquished by whispers of racism.  One is former school superintendent Howard Fuller, who pronounced the public schools in his city "a failing system."  Fuller told Foundation Watch "I support low income vouchers.  People with money already have choice.  People like Bill and Hillary Clinton have choice.  Vouchers empower poor people, and I support the expansion of vouchers to sectarian and religious schools."  Fuller resigned as superintendent after a bruising battle with the teachers union over vouchers.  An African-American who holds a doctoral degree in Education (and who is married to the former Detroit Superintendent of Schools),  Fuller is currently a professor of education at Marquette University.
	Another choice advocate is Polly Williams, the African-American Democratic state representative from inner-city Milwaukee who broke with her party's leadership to push the choice program through the Wisconsin legislature.  A passionate believer in doing whatever it takes to secure opportunity for those she represents, Williams told McGroarty,  "The way I saw it, the system is preparing our children for slavery. Look at the situation: Drop out by tenth grade, get into the street life _ when you should be walking across that stage getting a diploma, you're standing in front of a judge wearing chains."
	Williams' statement is a sharp retort to the white liberals who provide the funding for Rethinking Schools, a group who make convenient use of Rethinking Schools' race-baiting to mask their own interests in maintaining the school system as a municipal power base and source of job security. For, contrary to the claims of Rethinking Schools, in the 1990's the push for school choice has come from advocates like Fuller and Williams and from black parents whose children are trapped in collapsing urban school systems.  School choice has become a weapon against the very forces of the white liberal power elite, forces which have impoverished the inner city and racially segregated its schools despite decades of political promises, court orders, and school busing.
	More rigid ideologues than pragmatic educators, the editors of Rethinking Schools are unmoved by the facts of the matter.  They allege that schools of choice will unfairly siphon the "cream" of Milwaukee students, the best and brightest, from the public schools, making them 'islands of excellence for the already privileged.'  In fact, Milwaukee's choice program is limited to families at or below 175 percent of the poverty line and the privileged have left the system.  But Rethinking Schools would rather kill the chance for low-income children to acquire a superior education in order to maintain control over a system that gives all children an equally inferior one. 
<p>
<a name="flow"></a>
<h3>THE EDUCATION MONEY FLOW: <br>
JOYCE'S TIDAL SHIFTS</h3>
<p>
Rethinking Schools' anti-school 
		choice tracts have been published 
		with financial support from the New World Foundation of New York City and the Joyce Foundation of Chicago.  In describing their motivation, James Miller, president of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, says that "Rethinking Schools is the new socialism.  It has just been repackaged.  They are very, very left of center, and to a large degree they are just apologists for the status quo in education."  
	With assets of some $21 million, the New World Foundation  has never shrunk from the notoriety which its support for far-left causes has provoked.  When the New World Foundation was chaired by Hillary Clinton (before she became First Lady) it funded such groups as the pro-Sandinista Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES) Education Fund, the conspiracy-minded Christic Insitute, SANE/FREEZE, and the National Lawyers Guild.  So its support for Rethinking Schools is not surprising.
  	Rethinking Schools' other patron is, however, far richer and, appropriately has been far more circumspect.  Chicago's Joyce Foundation was founded in 1948 by Beatrice Joyce Kean, whose family-owned timber business yielded profits which were invested and managed with the guidance of the family's law firm, Lord, Bissell and Brook. When she died in 1972, ninety percent of her fortune went to the Joyce Foundation. Today, the Joyce Foundation is among the top fifty private grantmaking foundations in the United States, with assets listed at $587,899,563 as of December 31, 1995.  Last year the foundation awarded some $21 million in grants in eight program areas.  
	Joyce's education division awarded the largest sum _ $7,157,740 _ to forty-three grantees.  It may be presumed that Rethinking Schools grant application was reviewed by one or more of the division's program officers. Warren Chapman was formerly an official of the Illinois State Board of Education and the Illinois Department of Corrections.  He holds a doctorate in education.  Ellen Alberding, an MBA who doubles as an investment officer for the foundation, was a scheduler on Senator Adlai Stevenson III's Democratic gubernatorial campaign and worked in development for the Express-Ways Children's Museum.  Her husband was counsel to Mayor Richard Daley.  Peter Mich, who also holds a doctorate in education, previously worked for the Boys and Girls Clubs where he specialized in computer technology.
	Last year, the Joyce Foundation gave $100,000 to Marquette University's Institute for the Transformation of Learning to support a book project to be developed jointly by Rethinking Schools editor Robert Lowe and choice supporter Howard Fuller.  Fuller told Foundation Watch  that the Joyce grant was specifically "not for support of school choice." Fuller, who has also received support from Milwaukee's pro-school choice Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation for other projects supportive of vouchers, says Joyce wanted him to conduct a project in cooperation with Lowe "looking at the social relationship of teachers to kids."  Fuller said he worked with Rethinking Schools because they do "professional development for teachers, work for more teachers in the school system, and look at developing a rigorous curriculum.  I'm not going to say I'm not going to work with you on these things because you oppose school choice." 
	Meanwhile, Joyce's education division awarded Rethinking Schools more than three times as much money to fight Fuller on the school choice issue.  In 1995, the decade-old organization _ whose principal activity is publication and distribution of a quarterly tabloid newspaper and associated propaganda pamphlets _ received a grant of $348,380 "to publish and disseminate two booklets on school vouchers, school choice, and the issue of school equity; and to publish a series of articles about school-to-work, educational standards, assessment, and school accountability (3 years)."  
	The Joyce Foundation-subsidized articles were published in the organization's Rethinking Schools  tabloid.  Like the anti-voucher booklet, they were full of venom.  The Spring, 1996 issue, looking more like a 1960's-era copy of The Daily Worker or The Militant than an educational publication, featured articles with sloganeering headlines -- "Stop the 'English-Only' Nonsense" and "'Stand for Children' June 1 in Washington" -- alongside advertisements for pamphlets with titles like "Rethinking Columbus," which promised to "critique traditional versions of the conquest and its legacy." 
	Particularly noteworthy is Rethinking Schools  "Special Report"  by editor Barbara Miner entitled "Splits On The Right."  A credit line reads: "This package on the right wing was made possible through a grant from the Joyce Foundation." Accompanied by unflattering pictures of Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Lamar Alexander, William Bennett, and Phyllis Schlafly, among others, the report described the political forces that it sees arrayed against Rethinking Schools in the fight over school choice. Miner reports that Robertson has been charged with advocating "an authoritarian theocracy" and adds parenthetically, "The paramilitary right is generally considered a distinct phenomenon, although it maintains strong links to some groups within the religious right."  She suggests that other conservatives _ significantly nameless, because to name anyone at all would reveal how baseless  her charges are _ demonstrate a "willingness to espouse blatantly white supremacist and anti-Semitic views."  Repeatedly, Miner makes assertions of the "bigotry, white supremacy, homophobia, and theocratic authoritarianism of the religious right."    
	Miner's feature asserts that the Christian right wants "education based on rote obedience and memorization, and prefers to provide children ready-made answers instead of encouraging them to think for themselves."  The issue carries a number of sidebars.  One, headlined "Bradley helps bankroll movement," attacks parental rights groups.  It blames "Republican guru"  William Kristol and Bradley Foundation president Michael Joyce for "building a movement for parents' rights as a way to counter the women's and gay movements and to rally people against the 'nanny state.'"  Also included is a three-page spread in tiny type listing "Economic Conservatives and Religous/Far Right Organizations" (including  Capital Research Center, publisher of Foundation Watch), "Progressive Groups Monitoring the Right Wing," and "Conservative Publications," a list which includes The New Republic.
	Other indicators of the publication's skewed view of reality include a "Multicultural Resources" listing which features such items as "Mother Jones, One Woman's Fight for Labor," "Sexual Harrassment Institute," "Teasing and Bullying Workshops," "Viva La Causa!" and "Overcoming Homophobia in the Elementary Classroom."  A crude cartoon called "Something For Nothing" shows a member of Congress  calling for repeal of the Emancipation Proclamation and asking, "Without slavery, how can we compete with China?"
	Howard Fuller is charitable when asked about the Joyce Foundation's support for Rethinking Schools.  He says, "Sometimes both sides get out there.  I like [Joyce Foundation president] Debby Leff. I have great respect for [education program officer] Warren Chapman and what he's trying to do to make change for kids."  The opinion of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute's Miller is more candid: "Rethinking Schools is way out there on the fringes," Miller told Foundation Watch, "and I'm sure that the Joyce Foundation people are aware of that."
	But when asked about the publications she funded with Joyce Foundation money, Foundation president Deborah Leff pleads ignorance.  "I don't know everything that group did," she told Foundation Watch when asked about the special section smearing conservatives.  "We did not fund Rethinking Schools to publish photos of Ralph Reed and Phyllis Schlafly.  We funded them on the choice issue." 
	Yet managing editor Barbara Miner told Foundation Watch that Joyce was probably aware of her group's activities, and suggested calling the Joyce Foundation to inquire. Her organization distributes 40,000 free copies of Rethinking Schools quarterly in the Milwaukee area and that "pretty much our only function is one of publishing."  She added that "Joyce has never dictated to us what to say.  But as with any grant proposal, we mentioned that there were several articles about several big issues in the education reform movement which were currently of concern."
	When asked, if Joyce did not know or approve of it, why Rethinking Schools gave the Joyce Foundation printed credit for its support of the  feature articles bad-mouthing conservatives and the Bradley Foundation,  Leff responded, "I apologize for not being familiar with the publication.  Grantees are going to put forward different perspectives, and just because a grantee takes on a position, there is no one position that's right.  That's wrong.  God help us if we have such a narrow debate so that there's only one way to go. We identify smart people, differing people."
	Some find Leff's explanations difficult to swallow. "That's a crock," says Miller.  "Did she know that Rethinking Schools were the major people who drove out [former Milwaukee superintendent of schools] Howard Fuller?  They are connected to a bunch of people who call themselves the New Party and Progressive Milwaukee, and all basically have the same address. There was a major election in Milwaukee right before Fuller resigned. The teachers union was heavily involved and the reformers lost.  Rethinking Schools was very much involved in that kind of stuff. They are totally opposed to school choice." 
	Miller's own think-tank, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, received Joyce funding for work on the school choice issue before Leff became president in 1992.  But Miller subsequently spoke with Joyce staff members who told him, off the record, that "no one like us would get funded with them again, not while Debbie Leff was there."
	Leff, says Miller, is rather unlike her predecessor, Craig Kennedy.  "Kennedy was different, in that he was interested in new ideas.  It didn't matter who you were, it was what you were interested in doing," he explained.  "I think she's interested in new ideas if they're politically correct.  But if you're not politically correct, you're not going to get funded.  Everybody who seems to get money from them in Milwaukee is way left-of-center, and the dividing issue in getting money in Milwaukee is: Are your opposed to private school choice?"
	Dr. Chester Finn, director of the Educational Excellence Network and a former Department of Education assistant secretary for educational research, agrees with Miller.  "I have had no direct knowledge of the Joyce Foundation since she took over," he told Foundation Watch.  "I knew it quite well under Kennedy.  It was one of the most interesting and open-minded foundations.  It gave me some support to study school reform in Chicago.  It was characterized by inquisitiveness, receptivity to standards and heterodox thought. I would never have thought of it as a fellow-traveller of the education establishment when Craig was running it.  I even talked to the board sometimes."
	Finn says the atmosphere changed when Kennedy left the foundation to work for Chicago businessman Richard J. Dennis.  "Craig left and this woman from the world of television arrived. I never met her.  A lot of people I know just rolled their eyes.  It was no longer an interesting, unconventional, or open-minded place under her leadership.  A kind of window closed, a shade came down.  There was no further communication.  All gone."
	Leff retorts sharply to complaints from past recipients like Miller and Finn, "If you haven't applied for funds, you can't get them."  Paula Wolff, a Joyce board member since 1989 and currently president of Governors State University in University Park, Illinois, adds that shifts in foundation priorities are normal over time, and that no one should expect the same grantees to be funded when new administrations take over foundations. "There certainly have been some new initiatives, rewriting of the guidelines, but foundations are changing all the time," she told Foundation Watch.

<h3>CHARLES U. DALY:  STILL<br>
A POWER BEHIND THE THRONE</h3>
<p>
School choice is but one example 
			of the debate over shifting fund
			ing policies at the Joyce Foundation since Deborah Leff departed New York City and ABC News for the foundation presidency in Chicago (salary $180,000). Yet one prominent member of the Joyce board disagrees with the perception that there has been a real change in priorities.  
	Charles U. Daly is a veteran of "Camelot."  A personal friend of members of the Kennedy family and keeper of its secrets as director of the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston and, currently, director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, Daly is a former president of the Joyce Foundation.
	He served on the search committee which chose Leff from a shortlist of eight finalists, "all of whom were women," he told Foundation Watch proudly. "It was time for a change from the white Anglo men," he added (Daly is Irish and maintains a farm in Ireland). A practicing Catholic, he notes with some pride that even under Leff,  "you won't find Joyce funding abortion."
	Daly held the presidency of the Joyce Foundation from 1978-86 after serving as vice-president for government and community affairs at Harvard University (1971-76) and vice-president of the University of Chicago for public affairs and development (1964-71). He is a smart politician of the old school, bluff, gruff, and tough. He salts his conversation liberally with profanity and is at once charming and intimidating. Daly makes it impossible to doubt his assertion that his gamble of putting 80% of the assets of the foundation into the stock market allowed it to grow from $160 million in 1986 to over $500 million today. He also claims credit for convincing Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to change the tax laws in a way which permitted foundations to expand rather than expend their portfolios.
	An active Democrat, and traditional Kennedy liberal, Daly is a staunch champion of Leff ( who made a personal contribution of $1,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1992 ) and believes she is supporting precisely the kinds of social concerns which  excited him when he headed Joyce.  Trained as a journalist (he has a masters degree from Columbia Journalism School) the Dublin-born Daly was a White House staffer in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He has edited three publications: Media and the Cities, The Quality of Inequality, and Urban Violence.  
	A self-professed risk-taker and high-stakes gambler,  he likens selecting Joyce grantees to his Korean War service as a Marine: "A lieutenant said, `I know damn well not enough of you are doing well, because not enough of you are getting killed.'" Leff should wear criticism like a purple heart, Daly thinks -- it means she's doing her job at Joyce. "Kennedy did a better job than I did," Daly told Foundation Watch, "and Leff is doing a better job than either of us did.  I think it is a place that is not afraid to be on the cutting edge.  I welcome that sort of continuing change."
	Leff is precisely the type of  president Daly had in mind, one who would shake things up. "The last thing we wanted was some busted-out university president who wanted to put on a tweed coat and enjoy life," he added.  "I think independent foundations ought to be independent.  Let's not all get in the same club.  I get so frustrated on all this  'lets get together and fund things...' In other areas of society, you'd call the antitrust lawyers in."
	Daly says Leff must be allowed to decide her own priorities.  "You hire the chief executive and let that person do the job.  The problem is you get used to the same people telling you you're terrific.  So you're funding Checker Finn and everyone tells you you're doing great work."  Daly says he approves of  the new directions Leff is charting.  He seems happy that Leff is annoying people.  "I see any kind of lock-step stuff as a problem area," he told Foundation Watch.  "There should be true free enterprise in foundations."
	Yet Daly's own testimony gives evidence that Leff is taking the foundation away from where Daly might have led it. Daly said he liked to fund both sides of a debate, and like that his successor, Craig Kennedy, funded the Heritage Foundation, "so you could talk to them." When pressed, he admits that during his tenure he was not personally against school vouchers.  "We put money into St. Ignatius," he recalled. "I asked Professor John Hope Franklin, `Have we screwed up the public school system by supporting private education?'  And he said, `Anything you can do to help a child get an education is worth it.'  There is some balance."  However, Daly was skeptical of the Bradley Foundation's program of grants of scholarship money to the poor children of Milwaukee, arguing, "For a foundation to piss away its assets on scholarships is not the best thing to do."  Daly did confess that he had himself attended Columbia Journalism School on a $600 scholarship (Leff was on scholarship at Princeton).
	However, Daly's faith that Leff shares his commitment to independent thinking and debate may be misplaced. She told The Chicago Tribune in 1993: "Would I fund a dissenting point of view just to have a dissenting point of view? No. It may not be valuable toward reaching [a program's] goal, especially considering the foundation has very limited funds."
<p>
<a name="greens"></a>
<h3>FUNDING THE GREENS</h3>
<p>
True to Daly's account, Leff has 
			maintained some longstanding 
			Joyce programs.  The foundation has a tradition of support for environmentalism, and it is a major supporter of efforts to clean up the Great Lakes.  Last year the foundation made sixty-one grants totalling $6,154,413 to environmental projects, making this area its second largest program expenditure.  
	One foundation insider told Foundation Watch that Joyce's environmental grants traditionally mix support for "wacky" political advocacy groups with more praiseworthy mainstream efforts.  And Jonathan Adler, director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and author of Environmentalism at the Crossroads (Capital Research Center, 1996) observes that the foundation "is one of the few philanthropies that has made grants to Greenpeace."  A $20,000 award was made to the radical environmental group in 1993 for "Eco-Clean," a "green" drycleaning method which does not use solvents.  
	In 1995, Joyce gave $750,000 to San Francisco's Tides Foundation for environmental projects; $225,000 to Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a Washington, D.C. consumer advocacy group whose founder, Ellen Haas, now oversees food labelling, food stamps and the school lunch program as President Clinton's appointee in the Department of Agriculture; and $50,000 to the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice "to identify and develop strategies for implementing President Clinton's Executive Order on Environmental Justice."
	A $100,000 grant went to the Union of Concerned Scientists Biotechnology Policy Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Adler told Foundation Watch, "They've been heavily involved in biotechnology _ in stopping it.  Why does anyone ever want to stop progress?"  But Leff strongly defends biotechnology's critics, arguing "If you start introducing genes into crops, there is a risk that the crops will become pesticide resistant over time.  You don't know what the long-term ramifications of what that gene-splicing will be.  Is it going to be for better or worse?"
	Adler observes that Leff's attitude would block most scientific research because her demands can never be satisfied.  No one can ever fully anticipate the consequences of a new technology before it is implemented.  "I think some of their funding of that area reflects a skeptical view of the value of technology. They gave some money to the Rockford Institute once, the Chronicles people, for anti-progress environmental stuff.  It was an effort by Jeremy Rifkin-types to woo paleo-conservatives."
	Leff disagrees: "We're not against biotechnology.  We are just looking at industrial tradeoffs.  We are working with industry people.  We are concerned about the midwestern United States.  We are deeply concerned about the vitality of the region."  A $200,000 grant to the Environmental Defense Fund "to encourage the use of market incentives to reduce air pollution" offers some evidence that Leff is right to deny that the Joyce Foundation is reflexively anti-business.
	Kara Kellaher Mikulich and Margaret O'Dell are the program officers for Joyce's environmental grantmaking.  O'Dell, at Joyce since 1989, previously worked in the University of Chicago's department of Foundation Relations. Mikulich, who arrived in 1996, is a Stanford law school graduate, was finance director for Senator Edward Kennedy's 1988 campaign, and worked for Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA), prior to stints with private law firms and a job as staff attorney at the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago.

<a name="funding"></a>
<h3>FUNDING EMPLOYMENT</h3>
<p>
Employment is a third area of Joyce 
		Foundation concern.  About two-
		thirds the size of the environment program, the division last year spent $4,477,373, under the supervision of Mikulich and Unmi Song, an M.B.A. who was formerly a vice-president of Bankers Trust Company.  A political edge is evident here as well, with grants of $100,000 to the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C.; $100,000 to the Women's Legal Defense Fund; and $60,000 to the 9 to 5 Working Women Education Fund.  Carin Clauss, brought on the Joyce Board of Directors by Leff,  and U.S. Solicitor of Labor in the Carter administration, served on the litigation committee of the ACLU Women's Rights Project, and knew Leff from her political activities [see box on page 8]. Other large grants went to more mainstream projects such as $100,000 to MIT "to investigate policy and investment strategies for the metalworking industry in the Midwest region to increase its international competitiveness while expanding job opportunities."  The foundation is also a major funder of sometimes controversial  "school-to-work" programs.
<p>
<a name="gun"></a>
<h3>"GUN VIOLENCE"?  SQUASH IT!</h3>
<p>
Grants in the area of "gun vio
		lence" are the most evident sign 
		of Leff's impact on the Joyce Foundation.  Under her personal supervision _ Leff is listed as program officer in the Foundation's annual report _ Joyce gave $1,170,392 to ten projects last year.  Among them were the Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan in Chicago, which got $140,000 for "a national coalition of groups committed to a public-health approach," $42,500 to Johns Hopkins University's Center for Gun Policy and Research "to develop and promote an advertising code for firearms," and $200,000 to the Violence Policy Center in Washington, DC. (For more about gun-control groups see "Gun Control: Is theTide Turning?" by Austin Fulk, Organization Trends, June 1996.)
	Leff says she first became aware of the issue when she worked at ABC News and "looked at the number of gun deaths in Bangladesh compared to the number of gun deaths in Harlem.  To hear that men in Harlem lived less long than men in Bangladesh was shocking."  Perhaps because of the Kennedy assassinations, Daly is also a strong proponent of initiatives to deal with crimes committed with guns.  
	Leff argues that since "nobody wants 40,000 Americans to die of gun violence," the solution is obvious: "Let's take it out of the political debate and make it a consensus."  To achieve consensus on an issue that turns on the interpretation of the second amendment to Constitution, Leff resorts to the popular appeal of therapy and the authority of medicine rather than law.  
	She went to Jay Winsten, a biology Ph.D. on the faculty of the Harvard School of Public Health's Center for Health Communication, whose specialty is public relations campaigns -- most famously for the "Designated Driver." Leff gave Winsten  $50,000 in 1993 "to develop strategies to get the public to think of gun violence as a public health problem." That same year Joyce gave the Harvard School of Public Health $93,500 to conduct a Harris poll to determine "how the connection between guns and health can be made."
	In an April, 1996 Weekly Standard article called "Handgun Control, M.D." Tucker Carlson described the logic underlying Leff's approach: "Framed in medical terms, gun-related mayhem begins to look like one of society's most easily solved problems _ nothing at all like the complex affliction that has stymied the best efforts of police, judges, and criminologists for better than a century. If violence is a disease, the cure is simple: Get rid of the guns." 
	But as Carlson points out, "guns aren't pathogens; not biologically, not even metaphorically. Genuine pathogens, as any doctor knows, cause disease when introduced into a pathogen-free environment. Considering that there are more than 200 million privately owned firearms in the United States, only a miniscule fraction of which are ever used in acts of violence, guns don't qualify under this definition." Carlson argues there is no shooting epidemic, since the incidence has remained fairly steady in recent years and even declined in some localities. The medical metaphor won't work. 
	No matter. The facts of criminal justice won't stand in the way of  Leff's goal: "changing social norms." What gun owners saw as a second amendment right was instead a medical problem and the reason Leff turned to   Winsten, who developed Harvard's "Squash it" campaign at Leff's instigation.
	Winsten  works with gang members and "gangsta rappers" to get his public relations message across. He asks recording artists to include a "Squash it" lyric, and has developed his own gang-like hand signal. The Harvard professor arranges for public service announcements on television by "gangsta rap" stars. His goal is not to eliminate violent songs, but to add to them the option of walking away from confrontation. Unlike Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), former drug czarWilliam Bennett or National Political Congress of Black Women president C. Delores Tucker, Winsten likes and approves of "gangsta rap."
	He argues, "Gangsta Rap is going to continue to have violent images in it. I don't believe it caused what's happening on the streets. It's a reflection of it." Instead, Winsten maintains his goal is to provide listeners with a choice _ to fight or to walk away. He explains, "If there's a point where someone makes a business decision to walk away, offering two options, you can choose to fight or not to fight, I'm more than willing to settle for a mixed message."
	Winsten (who told Foundation Watch he did not believe the Beatles were promoting LSD use in "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" when he heard the song as a youth) has great faith that urban youth can learn nonviolent conflict resolution through "gangsta rap." One Winsten script for a P.S.A., by Vinnie of  "Naughty By Nature", illustrates Harvard's "Squash it" approach: 
	No argument is worth winning especially if it means you could lose your life. You can keep your self-respect without getting into a bunch of senseless violence. When you're involved in an argument that looks like it's going to get ugly, show that you're the strong one. Just walk away. Yo, it may not be easy at first but you can handle it. You're strong. And walking away from confrontation is the thing you'll have to learn for self-preservation. So, you, avoid the drama. Squash it (hand signal).
 	There can be no better illustration than these lyrics of what Jeffrey R. Snyder has called the "Nation of Cowards" approach to crime. Writing in the Fall, 1993 issue of The Public Interest, Snyder notes, "The media and law enforcement establishment continually advise us that, when confronted with the threat of lethal violence, we should not resist, but simply give the attacker what he wants...How can one who believes that the essence of his dignity lies in his self-determination passively accept the forcible deprivation of that self-determination?"
	Yet that is precisely what Winsten wants. And incredibly, the member of Harvard's public health faculty does not advocate that inner-city youth report crimes to the police. It is a strange position for a professional working in the field of public health, dependent as it is on epidemiological reporting data.  Yet Winsten told Foundation Watch, " When you walk up to the cop, do you think anything is going to happen?  It's like a parking violation to write up the theft of a gold chain. The criminal justice system has zero credibility with these kids." 
	Winsten's decriminalization approach -- and the concomitant medicalization of urban crime -- transfers police authority to kids who belong to criminal gangs and the singers who glorify them.. "They see that one arrest after another they are back out on the street, and [law enforcement] has major problems with credibility in the inner-city," he said. "Gangsta rappers" have credibility with street hoodlums the police lack.

<h3>STATEHOUSE SELLOUT: <br>
JOYCE MONEY FOR POLITICS</h3>
<p>
One other major Joyce Founda
			tion priority is a special Project 
			on Money and Politics directed by Lawrence N. Hansen, formerly a professor at George Washington University who headed the "Democracy Agenda Project."  Hansen was once vice-president of the failed Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, which was well-endowed by Richard Dennis, and whose board included  Henry Cisneros, Alan Sagner (a Clinton appointee to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting), and Peter C. Goldmark, Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation (see Foundation Watch v.I, n.4, May, 1996,  "The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism"). He also had been administrative assistant to Senator Adlai Stevenson III (D-IL) and Vice-President Walter Mondale. Hansen made thirteen grants totalling $1,082,190 to this project in 1995.
	Joyce grants in this category include a $30,000 grant to the leftist magazine Mother Jones for articles on the 1996 campaign finances of the 1994 freshman class in Congress; $200,000 to the Center for Responsive Politics to track campaign contributions; $80,000 to National Public Radio to cover campaign finance issues; $75,000 to the Radio Television News Directors Association for seminars on campaign finance; and $30,000 to the Tides Foundation to monitor radio coverage of money and politics. 
	The Center for Public Integrity in Washington, D.C. is on retainer with ABC News, Leff's former employer. It is headed by Charles Lewis, like Leff a former television producer (for Nightline and 60 Minutes). Last year it received $109, 912 from Joyce for a project which resulted in a special series The Indianopolis Star: "Statehouse Sellout: How Special Interests Hijacked the Legislature."   Of course, the story paid scant attention to the interests of foundations, or the power of their money (for example, Joyce grants approved by Daly during his presidency stopped the World's Fair from coming to Chicago). The Star's front page photo caption read "Money Talks," the lead read:
	Something was missing from the Indiana General Assembly last year. Oh, the lawmakers were there, all right. The lobbyists were out in force. And so was big money. Nowhere in sight? Democracy.
	Such apocalyptic and hysterical language is echoed in Leff's "President's Letter" in the Joyce Foundation's 1995 Annual Report. Featuring the quotation from the Star, Leff's prose reads as if it had been ripped from the 1960's manifesto of a  New Left Radical:
	The date: 1996. 
	The place: Governments across America. 
	The crimes: Theft of the American people's confidence in the institutions that govern them. 
	Assault on the belief they have a voice and that those they elect will listen to them. 
	Leff concludes her letter with an impassioned call to arms:
	In the past, Americans have rallied when democracy is in danger.  It is time we do so again.
	Before it is too late, Charles Daly and the board of the Joyce Foundation should take another look at the direction their Foundation is heading. The warning signs are clear for those who wish to see them.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>

	There are several errors of fact in your recent essay on the Rockefeller Foundation, but there is one in particular that I would like to correct. In describing John Frohnmayer's visit to Artists's Space in 1989 and the confrontation he faced on that occasion, you report that I was present.  I was not there. I realize that you are quoting John when you write this; he and I have spoken, and he confirms he has written and reported this as fact. But he mis-remembers (it happens to us all), and I simply want to set the record straight.
	John and I met many times, and sometimes we disagreed, but not in that place and not in that way.
<p>
Alberta Arthurs<br>

<p>
	John Frohnmayer was provided with a copy of Albera Arthurs' letter and has not retracted his statements. However Susan Wyatt, who organized the event, has a plausible explanation for the misunderstanding. She told Foundation Watch, "She was not there. He made an error. She was invited, there was a list of names that was released to the press before the meeting, but she did not come."
<p>
	In regards to the Bruce Nauman works referred to in the "article" you did about the American Center in Paris: You are blatantly misrepresenting the artist's work. Her's what you wrote, and what remains on your web page as of my writing this:
<p>
  Fred Henry was no stranger to the gross and disgusting. His Bohen Foundation had been a sponsor of a Bruce Nauman exhibit that was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum. It featured neon signs flicking "F--- and Die," "S--- and Die," and depicted excited male sexual organs and a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals.
<p>
	The work which included the words Americans use but can't seem to hear or type is "100 Live and Die." In this piece, columns of 2 1/2" neon letters spell out 100 different verb phrases, including "F--- AND DIE" as well as "BREATHE AND DIE." Each verb is presented twice. Once with the words "AND LIVE" and once with the words "AND DIE." The words "f---" and "s---" are the only two out of the seven one can't say on network television which are included in this work. This work occupies a wall space of approximately 12' x 16', and the sequence of the illumination of the 100 word patterns happens over a period of about ten minutes, as I remember it.<p>
	The "depicted excited male sexual organs" your editor refers to are probably part of another neon piece where, in a two image sequence, a cartoon sillhouette of a clown doesn't have an erection and then has an erection.<p>
	The most hysterical dis-informational reference is to "a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals." These works are either straight aluminum or bronze castings of taxidermy forms, or groupings of the styrofoam forms themselves. Hint: These are the forms that taxidermists use to fill the skin of the animals hunters shoot.<p>
	Your inability to convey even the tiniest evidence that you have a clue as to what is going on culturally makes me distrust you even more than the image of the "Capitol" on top of the word "Capital."<p>
	Your veil is thin.<p>

	We stand by our account of the Nauman show.

For Joyce Foundation President Deborah Leff, Sisterhood has been Powerful
<p>
	Deborah Leff has long been a political activist. The fourty-four year old, five-foot two, never-married brunette is a protege of Michael Pertschuk, head of the Federal Trade Commission in the Carter Administration (she listed him as a reference when she applied for the Joyce job). Pertschuck says Leff was in his inner circle because "she was both a lawyer and a journalist." Pertschuk now heads the Advocacy Institute, which provides "strategic planning" to "those who advocate social and economic justice." From 1980 to 1981, she was director of the FTC's office of public affairs. She had helped design and implement Ralph Nader's consumer complaint study in 1974 while working at the Center for Responsive Law. Among her FTC projects was a ban on advertising to children (dropped when Ronald Reagan won in 1980).  Joyce gave Pertschuk's group $150,000 over two years shortly after Leff became president. <p>
	Leff's other cause has been the feminist movement. She entered Princeton on scholarship in 1969 at the recommendation of a family friend, the first year the University accepted women.  There she displayed a knack for cultivating powerful protectors. Leff was on University committees with then-president William Bowen, now president of the Mellon Foundation (see Foundation Watch vol.1, no.2,  "How they took the Stars and Stripes off the American Center in Paris"). Chosen University Scholar and Mademoiselle college guest editor, Leff rapidly became drawn into the feminist movement, joining the National Women's Political Caucus _ despite opposition from her mother (a National Institutes of Health researcher). "To her, women's movement people were a bunch of bra-burners," Leff told an interviewer. "She had made it on her own...and she just didn't see a need for it." <p>
	At the National Women's Political Committee, Leff came under the protection of Liz Carpenter, Lady Bird Johnson's confidant.Within a year, she was NWPC political director and receiving course credit for her activity.  Her  senior thesis was study of  media and the women's movement  She was "stunned" when she interviewed Walter Cronkite and he referred to feminist "nuts in the movement." Leff did not inform him she was politicial director for the NWPC. She did not obtain permission to sell her interviews. And she failed to find a publisher for her thesis, chapters of which remain sealed to this day.<p>
	 After Princeton, Leff went to work for Nader (a Princeton alum) and then studied law at the University of Chicago. There, Leff joined the "women's caucus" which filed a sex discrimination complaint against the school.  Her attempted transfer to Yale Law School failed when she was rejected. Leff graduated in 1977, went to work for the Carter administration, and the university later settled the case. <p>
	Leff joined Nightline as a field producer in 1983 on the recommendation of a feminst already at ABC News. She joined the "ABC News women's advisory board" with Carole Simpson to protest sex discrimination at the network.  Leff was promoted to senior producer on Nightline, World News Tonight, and 20/20 but never got  the job she wanted: executive producer for  Peter Jennings.<p>
	Through American Council of Learnerd Societies president Stanley Katz (whom she had known at the University of Chicago Law School), Leff contacted Adele Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation (and dean of students when she attended Princeton).  Simmons passed her name on to Jan Piercy,  a MacArthur consultant  and First Lady Hillary Clinton's Wellesley roomate, who then recommended Leff to Joyce.<p>

<h2>From The Editor:</h2>
<P>
This is the first issue of <I>Foundation Watch.</I> Our motto
is &quot;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&quot;
<P>
Philanthropic foundations are growing increasingly important in
the United States, not only for how much they give, but for those
who get their grants. While individuals (who still provide the
bulk of contributions) usually wish to help other individuals
in need, many foundations have a more ambitious agenda. They see
grantmaking as a catalyst for social change.
<P>
The impact of this sector is clearly considerable. As the federal
budget begins to shrink, foundations will be called upon to fill
in the gaps. How will they respond?
<P>
That is the question which will undergird our reporting and is
the rationale for starting this publication. We maintain a critical
point-of-view, but we wish to be fair.
<P>
We look forward to thoughtful responses from interested readers,
and invite those with opposing points of view to contribute to
a lively debate.
<P>
We also look forward to <a href="mailto:info@crc.org">receiving letters to the editor, guest
columns, and your story ideas</a>. In coming months, we hope to add
a variety of features to our coverage of philanthropy, including
interviews, profiles, and book reviews.

<h2>PBS's National Issues Convention and the Charles F. Kettering
Foundation: The Power of Money in Politics</h2>
<P>
<I>In this election year, an imposing array of well-endowed American
foundations, following the lead of the Charles F. Kettering Foundation,
have been quietly funding a set of civic education projects. These
projects purport to promote clearer thinking about democracy by
improving the way journalists cover it. Last month their endeavors
aimed for a national audience on PBS's broadcast of the National
Issues Convention. The outcome suggests that neither democracy
nor journalism was well served.</I> 
<P>
Television watchers who tuned into the National Issues Convention
in Austin, Texas (broadcast live on PBS on the night of January
20th and morning of January 21st) could see what appeared to be
a worthy endeavor in civics education. The Convention was billed
as an opportunity for over four hundred ordinary American citizens
to talk with presidential candidates, policy experts, and with
each other about their genuine concerns.
<P>
PBS viewers saw a &quot;town hall&quot; event intended to be informative
rather than confrontational. In separate segments, casually dressed
Americans asked carefully worded questions about the economy,
foreign policy, and family values to Vice President Al Gore, who
represented President Clinton, and to Republican Presidential
candidates Senators Richard Lugar and Phil Gramm, former Governor
Lamar Alexander and Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes, Jr. Jim Lehrer,
host of PBS' nightly <I>Newshour</I>, moderated the broadcasts,
which totalled nine and a half hours on the PBS schedule.
<P>
Professor James S. Fishkin, chairman of the department of government
at the University of Texas, had provided the blueprint for the
Convention. It was financed by major philanthropic foundations
and touted by a significant minority of the national media. And
it received advice and counsel from Washingtonbased political
elites. PBS called its undertaking &quot;The Democracy Project.&quot;
The $4 million cost of organizing and televising the National
Issues Convention was the first major investment by PBS in election-year
coverage for 1996.
<P>
Viewers would have no way of knowing that &quot;The Democracy
Project&quot; is but one part of a larger and long-standing project
to reshape American politics. Key players include the Charles
F. Kettering Foundation (assets $167 million) and its ally the
Public Agenda Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts (assets roughly
$2 billion) and the James S. Knight Foundation (assets approximately
$800 million).
<P>
The enterprises of these foundations travel under a number of
different names. The Kettering Foundation refers to its support
for &quot;encouraging deliberation.&quot; The Pew Charitable Trusts
fund programs in &quot;civic journalism,&quot; while the Knight
Foundation funds &quot;public journalism.&quot; Sometimes one
foundation &quot;fronts&quot; for another. For example, over $1
million over the last four years has been funneled from the Knight
Foundation through the Kettering Foundation for &quot;public journalism&quot;
projects.
<P>
When these foundations refer to &quot;deliberation&quot; and &quot;civic&quot;
and &quot;public journalism,&quot; they seem to refer to particular
proposals for reforming the way the media covers political debate
and election campaigns. Reporters are chastised for reporting
on the horse-race, &quot;who's ahead?&quot; aspects of campaigns
and for relying on sound-bites to convey candidates' positions.
Instead, the media are urged to be more serious and analytical.
<P>
This public agenda has a far more troubling private purpose. The
foundations hope to use a tamed media to change the way citizens
listen to candidates and learn about issues. By transforming the
way they select and present &quot;news,&quot; the newly &quot;re-educated&quot;
media will &quot;improve&quot; citizen decision making about politics.
&quot;Better&quot; candidates will be elected to public office
and &quot;better&quot; public policies will result.
<P>
In reality, the grantmakers are funding a multimillion dollar
experiment to reorganize the American political process to their
own liking, to protect their own priorities and privilege their
own programs.
<P>
National Issues Convention promoters wish to preempt the exciting
rough-and-tumble of American elections and replace them with a more
manageable &quot;deliberative&quot; process. This process is intended
to stifle genuine political disagreements, under the rubric of
&quot;deliberation,&quot; consensus, and nonpartisanship.
<P>
If the backers of the Convention have their way, sharp passions
will be smothered and political arguments muffled in a great liberal
stew of &quot;dialogue&quot; cookedup by PBS, the Kettering Foundation,
the Public Agenda Foundation, and their network of other government
and foundation-financed agencies.
<P>
At best, such programs would serve up pablum that cannot satisfy
the hunger of Americans for real public debate. At worst, the
body politic would be poisoned by a diet of thought-control.
<P>
<I><B>THE MEDIA'S NEW ASSIGNMENT: CREATING THE &quot;IDEAL CITIZENRY&quot;</B></I>

<P>
Liberals and conservatives love to complain about how the media
covers politics.
<P>
Pundits such as Anthony Lewis, David Broder and James Fallows criticize
the media for fostering a low level of public discourse. They
say public policy debate is pushed to the sidelines by corporate-controlled,
profit-oriented outlets which pander to the fascinations of a
mass public. The result is tabloid TV, Willie Hortonstyle political
advertisements, and photoops for politicians like the Contract
with America signing on the Capitol steps. Liberals conclude that
voters are kept ignorant because the media does not provide the
information they need to make rational decisions.
<P>
Conservatives answer that Americans are politically frustrated
because an iron triangle of government, special interests, and
the media shade the facts about government spending, taxes, education,
and crime. &quot;Reporting&quot; on television network news and
in major daily newspapers too often ignores or slyly denigrates
the genuine grievances of ordinary Americans while pushing the
public agenda of liberal elites. They say Rush Limbaugh provides
information which the American people otherwise would not hear.
<P>
The thesis underlying the National Issues Convention purports
to answer both of these concerns. It is developed in Professor
James Fishkin's book, <I>The Voice of the People</I> (Yale, 1995),
which is a sequel to his earlier <I>Democracy and Deliberation
</I>(Yale, 1991).
<P>
Fishkin argues that the media needs a new assignment if the American
republic is to achieve its full potential. He opines that the
media should not treat election campaigns as sporting events in
which one side scores points against the other. He suggests that
journalists pay less attention to the positions and promises of
the candidates.
<P>
Instead, he proposes that the media be of service to American
democracy by helping to educate<B> </B>its citizens about politics
and government through face-to-face encounters in small groups.
<P>
Fishkin says that to become &quot;ideal citizens&quot; ordinary
Americans need to be informed by &quot;nonpartisan&quot;and &quot;unbiased&quot;
factual materials instead of by partisan rhetoric. These materials
will give them a shared background for understanding the issues
of the day. Citizens can then sort through their findings by engaging
each other in facetoface discussions. This will help them learn
from each other's diverse experiences, hash out individual differences,
and find common ground. Disinterested experts will be available
to help them &quot;come to public judgement.&quot;
<P>
The result should be that rational &quot;deliberation&quot; replaces
&quot;debate.&quot; The ideal citizen will base his electoral
decisions on solid information and rational deliberations instead
of on soundbites and emotion. Last month's National Issues Convention
represented a major commitment by PBS and grantmaking foundations<B>
</B>to Fishkin's reform project.
<P>
Fishkin hands the media a plum assignment. His proposal plays
to the interest some in the media have to be more than passive
recorders of the day's events. It offers the media the chance
to be players in the political game, not mere reporters on the
sidelines. Fishkin means to mobilize the media to &quot;educate&quot;
voters to think the way he wants them to think. And his goal is
congruent with the aims of the large and powerful foundations
such as Kettering, which has worked with him since at least 1991.
Fishkin's &quot;deliberative poll experiment&quot; provides a
veneer of academic respectability to the &quot;Kettering technique.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS</B></I> 
<P>
Like Texas itself, the National Issues Convention event was nothing
if not big. PBS devoted some nine and a half hours to coverage
of the affair. Hundreds of newspaper and television reporters
flew into Austin from across the country.
<P>
On the day before the event, The Poynter Institute for Media Studies,
a private foundation which controls the stock of <I>The St. Petersburg
Times</I>, held its own seminar to instruct journalists on covering
the National Issues Convention.
<P>
And New York University's Project on the Press and Public Life,
which is supported by the Knight and Kettering foundations, offered
journalists seminars on how to cover the actual 1996 campaign.
<P>
Before the broadcast, in December of 1995, the National Opinion
Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago had polled
a random sample of<B> </B>900 citizens across America on their
political opinions. In January, some 600 were invited to travel
allexpensespaid to the University of Texas at Austin. Four hundred
fifty-nine arrived despite the East Coast blizzard. The participants
were welcomed by Governor George W. Bush, enjoyed free lunches
and dinners, went linedancing, and were further buoyed by $300
in spending money.
<P>
For four days these &quot;delegates,&quot; each supposed to represent
375,000 fellow Americans, listened to addresses by presidential
candidates -- but not Clinton, Dole or Buchanan -- and met in
small discussion groups to &quot;deliberate&quot;over public issues.
<P>
Facilitators trained by the Charles F. Kettering Foundation guided
their deliberations, and both facilitators and public participants
read discussion materials prepared by the Public Agenda Foundation
at the request of the Kettering Foundation. At the end of the
exercise, participants were polled a second time to determine
how the process of &quot;deliberation&quot; had affected their
thinking.
<P>
Fishkin had predicted that the process of deliberation would refine
and elevate the views of the Convention participants. At a Washington
press conference on January 25 and on a nationally-televised PBS
special the next evening, Fishkin announced results from the Convention's
&quot;deliberative poll.&quot;
<P>
Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes, Jr. must have been sorry he agreed
to participate in the Austin pow-wow. The press release for Fishkin's
Washington, DC appearance trumpeted polling results showing support
for the flat tax dropped from 43.5 percent in December to 29.8
percent. This drop happened after Convention participants had
the opportunity to &quot;deliberate&quot;-- and after three Republican
rivals and the Vice-President of the United States had savaged
his proposal.
<P>
However, other post-deliberation poll results reflect a muddle
of opinions, some liberal, some conservative, some confused and
contradictory.
<P>
After the four days spent in small and large &quot;facilitated&quot;
discussions in Texas, &quot;delegates&quot; who reported believing
that the average worker does not receive a fair day's pay for
a fair day's work went up from 26.6 percent to 40.4 percent; that
the amount the U.S. is spending on education and training is too
little increased from 71.9 percent to 86.3 percent; that economic
pressure is the biggest problem for the American family rose from
35.5 percent to 50.7 percent; that making divorce harder to get
would strengthen the family climbed from 36.1 percent to 56.7
percent; that the federal government should not cut spending on
foreign aid to reduce the federal budget deficit ticked up from
9.3 percent to 20.6 percent (still leaving roughly 80 percent
in favor of cutting foreign aid); that federal programs such as
welfare<B> </B>should be turned over to the states <I>increased
</I>from 49.5 percent to 62.5 percent (Newt Gingrich, call your
office!)<B>.</B> 
<P>
In foreign policy, those agreeing to send the American military
to foreign trouble spots increased from 20.8 percent to 37.7 percent.
And those who expressed overall disagreement with an isolationist
foreign policy rose from 33.7 percent to 47.8 percent.
<P>
Yet, despite Fishkin's early predictions of change, other views
remained rock solid after &quot;deliberation.&quot; For example,
both before and after polling showed more than 80 percent of the
delegates believe that the economy can function only if businesses
make good profits; 68 percent think that the traditional family
has suffered a breakdown; 72.8 percent held that the post-Cold
War U.S. should shift resources from military to domestic needs;
68 percent continued to believe prayer in school would be somewhat
useful or very useful; 88 percent held that moral education in
the schools would be somewhat or very useful.
<P>
In short, the results were vague and confusing. While the delegates
desires seem quite predictable, the results undermined Fishkin's
own prophecy that delegates would be better able to make &quot;hard
choices&quot; after the &quot;deliberative process.&quot; Americans,
as one might expect, wished to have their cake and eat it, too,
even in his &quot;deliberative poll.&quot;
<P>
Nevertheless, Fishkin told reporters that the process of deliberation
helped Convention participants to act &quot;more like ideal citizens,&quot;
giving their judgments what he called a &quot;recommending force.&quot;
He argued,&quot;These people become representative of what the
country could come to if people were more engaged in the issues.
It is meant to be a poll with a human face. The real power of
this event is in the voice of the people.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin said he hoped the occasion would be a prototype for future
citizen gatherings. Yet newspaper accounts of the Convention's
actual procedures have cast doubt on such expectations. According
to <I>Washington Post </I>reporter John Yang, factual errors were
often not even corrected in the moderated group discussions. This
has led some to wonder how the &quot;deliberative process&quot;
was different from an ordinary barroom or dorm room &quot;bull
session.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin responded to the observation that delegates were sharing
ignorance by asserting, &quot;We were terribly concerned that
moderators might intrude their own views by giving facts to citizens.
So the moderators had to sit back. It was not their role to correct
them. Other citizens might. In the real world, when you are engaged
in political discussions, you might not have your facts exactly
right. The point was that people were not meant to make a political
judgement.&quot;
<P>
Similarly, the claim to rational deliberation has been undermined
by participants who reported emotional interchanges in group meetings.
One moderator explained, &quot;Emotion is very much a part of
it. There were many emotional moments in our conversation. I keep
coming back to the welfare mother in our group who got $10.90
twice a month from child support from the father of three of her
five children. There were times where there were tears in the
room, too. I think the level of emotion came from how close we
felt to each other.&quot;
<P>
When asked about the crying jags, Fishkin said, &quot;There's
emotion involved in the way people make judgements, can't take
it out completely, value judgements take emotion as well.&quot;
Yet Fishkin had earlier said the value of &quot;deliberation&quot;
was its rationality, not arousal of feelings.
<P>
Finally, the presidential candidates continued to make stump speeches
and hurl soundbites. No improvement there. Vice President Al Gore,
for instance, violently attacked the flat tax, calling it &quot;a
huge tax cut on those who are most able to pay, and a huge tax
increase on those who are least able to pay.&quot;
<P>
During his session Gore even resorted to an audience &quot;show
of hands&quot; to ratify his opinions, which Jim Lehrer did not
stop, simply saying, &quot;You're the Vice President.&quot;
<P>
One might also question whether the 459 Convention delegates were
truly representative of the American public. They were meant to
be a random sample of citizens by age, race, sex, region, marital
status, and voting history. But were they?
<P>
Former CBS News polling director Warren Mitofsky asserted that
such a small, and effectively self-selective sample, could not
represent the public: &quot;It's not deliberative, and it's not
a poll.&quot; Andrew Kohut, former director of the Times Mirror
polling center and an advisor to the project concurred, &quot;It's
not a poll.&quot;
<P>
Even non-experts could question the delegate sample: a mere seven
percent of the group earned $40,000 $49,000; 18 percent listed
&quot;Other&quot; as religion, rather than Protestant, Catholic
or Jew, and 12 percent listed &quot;None.&quot; Young people seemed
to outweigh the elderly: only 9 per cent were aged 6069, 12 per
cent aged 5059, and 21 percent aged 4049. NORC could not provide
a breakdown by occupation, and it did not provide statistics giving
comparable U.S. averages for age and occupation.
<P>
<I><B>DEVELOPING &quot;THE KETTERING TECHNIQUE&quot;</B></I> 
<P>
So what were the foundations get
ting for their money, if not a poll? <BR>
On its face, the Convention appears to have provided a pleasant
and perhaps edifying vacation for some four hundred Americans,
air-time for some Presidential candidates, a moment of celebrity
for Professor Fishkin, and stupefying boredom for anyone mistaken
enough to have watched the PBS coverage.
<P>
A closer look at the organizations and individuals supporting
the Convention provides clues to the real agenda and issues at
stake. <B> </B>Materials published in support of the Convention
suggest that the issues raised in the televised &quot;deliberative
poll&quot; owe less to the real concerns of the American people
or even the professional interests of<B> </B>Professor Fishkin
than to the long-standing interests of the Charles F. Kettering
Foundation. Under the direction of its president, David Mathews,
the Foundation has developed and promoted its ideas on &quot;encouraging
deliberation.&quot; It may well be that what Fishkin calls the
&quot;voice of the people&quot; is actually the &quot;Voice of
Kettering.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin's deliberative polling techniques are not unlike those
used by the National Issues Forums which the Kettering Foundation
has sponsored since 1981. (The one major difference is Fishkin's
selection of the Convention's participants by random sample rather
than by pure selfselection.) Moreover, both the National Issues
Convention and the National Issues Forums use materials on public
affairs prepared by the Public Agenda Foundation. Both also rely
on intensive small group discussions with moderators and use participant
polling<B> </B>before and after group discussions.
<P>
The Kettering Foundation was established in 1927 by Charles F.
Kettering, inventor of the automatic starter and the Delco generator.
A private operating foundation headquartered in Dayton, Ohio,
with offices in Washington, DC and New York City, Kettering maintains
a staff of twenty-five full-time professionals and about as many
support personnel. Kettering says it does not make grants, although
its grants are clearly reported on the IRS forms of the Public
Agenda Foundation. Nor does it publish an annual report. It reported
spending almost $8 million dollars in 1992. Kettering is ostensibly
non-partisan, and the roster of board members includes several
corporate executives and Republican Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa.
<P>
A recent brochure summarizes the Foundation's mission and methods:
&quot;Kettering treats politics in its broadest sense: politics
as a dimension of everyday life rather than only what officeholders
and governments do. The research is done for practical purposes;
it goes into crafting `tools' (study guides, community worksbooks,
and other exercises) that help a public act responsibly and effectively
on its problems.&quot; The Foundation reports that these materials
are used by a network of over 6,000 civic and educational organizations,
ranging from literacy groups to religious groups and neighborhood
associations.
<P>
Kettering's interest in reshaping the deliberative process can
be traced back to the early 1960s<B> </B>during the Cold War.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->At that time, the
foundation was a supporter of the Dartmouth Conference, a project
of <I>Saturday Review</I> editor Norman Cousins, a Kettering board
member. The Conference's mission was to ease U.S.-Soviet tensions
by promoting East-West &quot;understanding.&quot; It did this
by<B> </B>sponsoring &quot;face-to-face&quot; meetings between
selected Soviet and American citizens.
<P>
The concept of promoting personal encounters between people of
different backgrounds to talk about politics was established in
this dubious context. From the first Dartmouth meeting in 1960
through subsequent international affairs programs in the Soviet
Union and China in the late 1980s, Kettering has always taken
a keen interest in promoting discussion processes &quot;designed
for situations where traditional negotiation and mediation are
of limited usefulness.&quot;
<P>
At home, Kettering's support for the Domestic Policy Association,
the original sponsor of what became the National Issues Forum,
had a similar aim. Other Kettering projects have included the
Community Foundations Network, which links local foundations with
one another; Youth At Risk Forums and Classroom Forums, held in
cooperation with schools and colleges; the Humanities Project,
done in collaboration with libraries and educators; the Civil
Society Exchange, to smooth international relations in the way
of the Dartmouth Conference; Public Journalism seminars, and the
Public Voice PBS program, sort of stripped-down versions of the
National Issues Convention. All share the same premise that &quot;public
talk fosters knowledge, deliberation, and reason qualitatively
superior to narrowly focused and particularized points of view...&quot;
<P>
One 1987 project was described in the Kettering newsletter thus:
&quot;prisoners at the Westville Correctional Center in northern
Indiana have taken on a new role: that of public policy experts
on farm, immigration, and crime issues.&quot; This event was repeated
at a number of other prisons.
<P>
Clearly, the National Issues Convention was a logical outgrowth
of these Kettering activities. They have been described as &quot;deeply
interdependent&quot; and &quot;mutually reinforcing&quot; by president
David Mathews. &quot;They fit together like one of those pyramids
of oranges in a supermarket,&quot; he wrote in <I>Connections</I>,
the Kettering newsletter.
<P>
<I><B>THE PEOPLE OF KETTERING</B></I> 
<P>
<B>DAVID MATHEWS </B>The president of Kettering, age 61, is a
political &quot;independent&quot; who was Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare in the Ford Administration from 1975-77,
then president of the University of Alabama. He joined Kettering
in 1981. Mathews whose salary of over $190,000 a year is more
than Bob Dole's, Phil Gramm's or Al Gore's<B> </B>is also a trustee
and member of the executive committee of the Public Agenda Foundation.
<P>
Mathew's foreword to a 1991 Kettering study, <I>Citizens and Politics:
A View from Main Street America</I> referred to &quot;the erosion
of political legitimacy&quot; which requires changes to &quot;the
basic conditions of political practice.&quot; Mathews expressed
concern over the public's distrust of politics and government,
but marvelled at its involvement in local community affairs. He
concluded, &quot;The real challenge is to get the formal political
system reattached to the politics that people practice in trying
to deal with local problems.&quot; Interestingly, the study was
conducted by Richard Harwood, a former staffer at the Public Agenda
Foundation.
<P>
In 1980, in the <I>Washington Post</I>, writer Walter Shapiro
described Mathews as &quot;...the best recent example of a cipher
in the cabinet. As one high ranking veteran of the Ford White
House put it, 'We sent Mathews to HEW and never heard from him
again. He used to show up at cabinet meetings every three or four
weeks but nobody was ever sure why...'&quot;
<P>
Mathews' one major venture into the headlines may have stimulated
his interest in &quot;deliberation.&quot; <I>The Swine Flue Affair:
Decision Making on a Slippery Slope</I>, a special report prepared
by Richard Neustadt for Joseph Califano, Mathews' successor at
HEW, concluded that<B> </B>Mathews played a central role in the
failure of<B> </B>a 1976 federal program against an epidemic which
never materialized, an enterprise which cost taxpayers $135 million,
left 12 people dead, and over 250 paralyzed.
<P>
On March 15, 1976, Mathews wrote OMB director James T. Lynn, &quot;There
is evidence there will be a major flu epidemic this fall...The
projections are that this virus will kill 1 million Americans
in 1976.&quot; In fact, the only deaths reported from swine flu
were those resulting from Mathews' vaccination program.
<P>
As detailed by<B> </B>Neustadt, the litany of Mathews' failures
in judgement included:
<UL>
<LI> &quot;overconfidence by specialists in theories spun from
meager evidence;&quot;
<LI> &quot;conviction fueled by a conjunction of some preexisting
personal agendas;&quot;
<LI> &quot;zeal by health professionals to which make their lay
superiors do right;&quot;
<LI> &quot;premature commitment to deciding more than had to be
decided;&quot;
<LI> &quot;failure to address uncertainties in such a way as to
prepare for reconsideration;&quot;
<LI> &quot;insufficient questioning of scientific logic and of
implementation prospects;&quot;
<LI> &quot;insensitivity to media relations and long term credibility
of institutions.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
Not surprisingly Mathews is also trustee of the Public Agenda
Foundation -- and a member of its executive committee. Kettering
gave over $1 million to the Public Agenda Foundation in 1992.
<P>
Some years earlier Mathews was an executive committee member for
a Public Agenda project, &quot;Public Summit,&quot; which challenged
Americans to engage in &quot;cooperative problem solving&quot;
with the Soviet Union.
<P>
<B>ROBERT KINGSTON </B>Fishkin worked closely with Kingston, editor
of <I>The Kettering Review</I>, to train moderators for two earlier
British public affairs telecasts based on his book and in preparing
subsequent procedures for the Convention.
<P>
Kingston, born a British subject, has considerable experience
in directing programs for public uplift. Like Mathews, he was
an official in the Ford administration. As a former acting chairman
of the National Endowment for the Humanities, he ran comparable
discussion groups on the 200th anniversary of the Declaration
of Independence. Later, Kingston headed the College Board, which
administers the national Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT). Kingston's
fee as a Kettering &quot;Associate&quot; was $132,431 in 1992.
<P>
<B>DIANE EISENBERG </B>Eisenberg, another Kettering &quot;Associate,&quot;
was the first to initiate discussions with Fishkin about the project
in 1991, in her work for the foundation's Washington, DC operation.
She is a classic &quot;educrat,&quot; former Washington representative
of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges and
executive director of the Washington, DC<B> </B>Council for the
Advancement of Citizenship. Eisenberg was paid $94,011 by Kettering
in 1992.
<P>
<B>NOELLE McAFEE </B>Fishkin's assistant director for the National
Issues Convention and a graduate student in the department of
philosophy at the University of Texas, McAfee is also an editor
of <I>The Kettering Review </I>and has worked with Kettering for
eight years. In 1987 and 1988, she worked as an &quot;organizer&quot;
with &quot;Congress Watch,&quot; a project of the Naderite group
Public Citizen. At the time, Public Citizen was helping to organize
the vicious media and political campaign to defeat President Reagan's
nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
<P>
<B>KATHERINE FANNING </B>Fanning is chairman of the board of the
Kettering Foundation. She is former editor-in-chief of the <I>Christian
Science Monitor </I>and<I><B> </B></I>the mother of Frederick
W. (Ted) Field, a Hollywood movie producer and heir to the Marshall
Field family fortune worth an estimated $700 million. (According
to <I>The Los Angeles Times</I><B>, </B>Ted Field is the fifthlargest
donor to the Democratic Party, having personally contributed over
$1.2 million since 1986. Field explained his partisan generosity
this way: &quot;I consider the Religious Right in the Republican
Party to be very close to Nazism.&quot; He also owns the gangsterrap
label Interscope Records, which Sen. Bob Dole has criticized for
producing songs containing violent and offensive lyrics.)
<P>
In the late 1980s Fanning was a member of the PBS program policy
committee.<B> </B>Currently she sits<B> </B>on the board of the
Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, which has assets of over one
billion dollars. Out of annual grants exceeding $40 million, the
Mott Foundation contributed $300,000 to The Kettering Foundation
in 1993.
<P>
In the area of &quot;public affairs broadcasting,&quot; the Mott
Foundation has granted $70,000 to the Council on Foreign Relations
for a weekly NPR series on international issues and $49,450 to
the Tides Foundation of San Francisco to &quot;support the devlopment
of an eightpart series for public television and other forums
that will explore major American Issues.<B>&quot;</B> The Tides
Foundation's Institute for Global Communications helps provide
computer networking for PeaceNet, EcoNet and feminist groups,
among other political advocates.
<P>
The Mott Foundation has also contributed $500,000 to Independent
Sector, $290,000 to the Union Institute and $75,000 to the National
Council for Responsive Philanthropy, all liberal social policy
outifts which have well-developed networking strategies.
<P>
<I><B>&quot;DELIBERATION,&quot; BUT NO DEBATE</B></I><B> </B>
<P>
Key to the &quot;Kettering Technique&quot; is the sidestepping
of direct debate on specific issues, an emphasis on collective
decision-making by groups, and the goal of consensus.
<P>
Many of the Convention's discussion group moderators, some trained
by Kettering, others fulltime Kettering employees, had experience
in running earlier National Issues Forums.
<P>
Predominantly educators, they were told to begin each session
by distributing a preforum ballot to determine initial participant
attitudes. The &quot;ground rules&quot; begin with Rule Number
One in bold faced capital letters:
<P>
&quot;MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DISCUSSION WILL NOT BE A DEBATE. Stress
there is work to do, and that the work is to move toward making
a shared choice on a public policy issue. The work will be done
through deliberation.&quot;
<P>
Deliberation sounds suspiciously like group therapy. Among Kettering's
other guidelines are, &quot;Get beyond the initial positions people
hold to their deeper motivations...&quot; and &quot;WORK THROUGH
(emphasis in original) the conflicting emotions that arise when
various options pull and tug on what people consider valuable.&quot;
<P>
To avoid &quot;debate,&quot; it appears that genuine philosophical
and religious disagreements were deliberately sidestepped. For
instance, in the PBS broadcast, speakers from the liberal People
for the American Way and the conservative Concerned Women for
America said that they agreed in their support for &quot;family
values.&quot; By prohibiting debate, the Kettering &quot;rules
of engagement&quot; forced a phony verbal consensus.
<P>
Dr. Everett Carl Ladd, president of the Roper Center for Public
Opinion Research, has called Fishkin's method &quot;flawed science
and dubious democracy.&quot; As editor of the December 1995 issue
of the journal <I>The Public Perspective</I>, Ladd published a
series of essays raising objections to the National Issues Convention.
Scholars criticized the absence of a control group, selectivity
and bias in briefing materials, the likelihood that group dynamics
would affect individual perceptions in the polling sample, and
the danger that participants would attempt to please event organizers.
Far from promoting the ideal citizen<B>, </B>the Kettering Technique
appears to use controlled small groups to manipulate the individual's
perception of reality.
<P>
Before the event, Fishkin had replied that these are &quot;empirical
matters which the National Issues Convention will provide the
data to address. Let us get the data and see.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>INSIDE THE PUBLIC AGENDA FOUNDATION</B></I> 
<P>
Kettering relied on the Public Agenda Foundation to select the
topics for the delegates' reading and discussion. Founded in 1975
by pollster Daniel Yankelovich and Cyrus Vance, Jimmy Carter's
Secretary of State, the Public Agenda Foundation is a $3 million-dollar-a-year
operation based in New York City which conducts polls and focus
groups for foundations and corporate clients on a variety of issues.
It has also coordinated many of the issues used in &quot;public
journalism&quot; special issues of Knight-Ridder newspapers. One
paper, the <I>Tallahassee Democrat</I>, even called its series
&quot;The Public Agenda.&quot;
<P>
Public Agenda's 1992 annual budget was $3,319,158. Public Agenda
received a total of $1,197,475 in &quot;general support&quot;
from Kettering in 1992, as well as $400,000 from the Ford Foundation
and $100,00 each from Metropolitan Life, Baxter Healthcare, and
IBM. Union Carbide contributed $208,000, the Carnegie Corporation
$225,000, and the Markle Foundation $427,000.
<P>
The organization received grants of $10,000 from the New York
Times Company Foundation, $150,000 from the Edna McConnell Clark
Foundation, $250,000 from the Bohen Foundation, $50,000 from the
Ford Foundation, $16,000 from the Markle Foundation, $7,500 from
General Mills, $5,000 from Ford Motor Company, and $149,000 from
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to study the priorities
of American &quot;opinion leaders.&quot; The research was used
to make programming decisions for PBS.
<P>
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave Public Agenda $250,000
in 1992<B> </B>to prepare materials for small group discussions
and polling on health care options.
<P>
Public Agenda's &quot;policy review board&quot; provides further
evidence of its private issues agenda. It has included John W.
Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Johnson
Administration and founder of Common Cause; Newton Minow, co-chair
of the advisory board for the National Issues Convention; economist
Lester Thurow, a panelist on the Convention broadcast; D.C. delegate
Eleanor Holmes Norton; Children's Defense Fund founder Marian
Wright Edelman and CDF then-chair Donna Shalala, and David Mathews.
<P>
Retired Admiral Bobby Inman (a Public Agenda trustee), Elliott
Richardson, and George Romney are about as conservative as the
list gets.
<P>
Public Agenda has prepared background materials and conducted
polling for Kettering's National Issues Forums since 1981.
<P>
Even earlier, it prepared the 1976 presidential debate briefing
books for Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford on three issues: foreign
policy, inflation and employment, and moral leadership.
<P>
For the Convention, Public Agenda did not restrict itself to the
most-talked-about issues. According to a tabloid distributed to
delegates, the Foundation chose to include issues &quot;that citizens
are having a hard time sorting out for themselves.&quot; Public
Agenda and the Kettering Foundation<B> </B>selected three major
themes for discussion by Convention participants: &quot;Mission
Uncertain: Reassessing America's Global Role,&quot; &quot;Pocketbook
Pressures: What Should Be Done About Them?&quot; and &quot;The
Troubled American Family: Which Way Out of the Storm?&quot;
<P>
Public Agenda selected issues that it thought the public ought
to care about. But it managed to avoid the debate over education
choice and Goals 2000, the death penalty, &quot;three-strikes
and you're out&quot; crime legislation, drug policy, or, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's favorite, the information revolution and
the economic potential of cyberspace. Instead, Public Agenda focused
on America's place in the world and on arguments over the cause
of the wage-gap in the current economy.
<P>
The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) received $500,000
for its polling work. According to Warren Mitofsky, this was more
than ten times what CBS would pay for an election-year opinion
poll. But the questions NORC asked were based on materials provided
by Kettering and Public Agenda<B>. </B>In response to a call from
Capital Research Center, a NORC spokesman confirmed that its questions
were developed in consultation with the two foundations in addition
to Fishkin. NORC's representative said that it often works from
a list of client questions when it is on contract.
<P>
<I><B>HOW SPECIAL INTERESTS DEFINED THE &quot;PUBLIC AGENDA&quot;
</B></I>
<P>
If the Austin agenda was not set by the participants themselves,
where did Public Agenda get its priorities? The answer, of course,
is that the &quot;deliberative&quot; conclusions of Fishkin's
prototype &quot;ideal citizens&quot; are mere surrogates for the
conventional wisdom of the government and foundation liberal elites
who line the Northeast corridor.
<P>
For, after being concocted by the Kettering and Public Agenda
foundations, the Convention's issues were reviewed and approved
by a distinguished advisory board of ex-officeholders and lobbyists,
many of whose current clients include government-dependent special
interests.
<P>
Calling the advisory board's cochairs &quot;the voice of the people&quot;
with a straight face would be a stretch. They included former
United States Representative Bill Frenzel, a fellow at the Brookings
Institution; Newton Minow, remembered for calling television a
&quot;vast wasteland&quot; several decades ago, but since then
a director of CBS and an attorney at the Chicagobased Sidley and
Austin law firm who sits on corporate and foundation boards; and
super-lobbyist Charles E. Walker, nemesis of the capital gains
tax. At one time Walker's firm reportedly had 129 lobbying clients
registered with the clerk of the House of Representatives.
<P>
Other board members included former Senator David Boren (D-OK),
president of the University of Oklahoma, a federal grant recipient;
former Representative William Gray (D-PA), who heads the United
Negro College Fund; and erstwhile liberal Bill Galston, who was
President Clinton's domestic policy czar.
<P>
No wonder the role of government was the overriding concern of
the National Issues Convention. If the delegates had known more
about the backgrounds and interests of those advising their meeting,
they might have reconsidered its basic assumptions.
<P>
<I><B>THE PEOPLE OF PUBLIC AGENDA</B></I> 
<P>
Also revealing are the interests of Cyrus Vance and Daniel Yankelovich,
co-founders of the Public Agenda Foundation, whose board of directors
lists Judith Davidson Moyers, wife of PBS ominipresence Bill Moyers.
<P>
Department store mogul Maurice Lazarus is chairman of the executive
committee. Other trustees include Adm. Bobby R. Inman (Ret.),
Ann McLaughlin, former Secretary of Labor in the Reagan administration,
businessman Sidney Harman, and William T. Coleman, Jr., from Secretary
of State Warren Christopher's law firm, O'Melveny and Meyers.
Frank Stanton, former CBS president, is a member emeritus.
<P>
<B>CYRUS VANCE</B>, the chairman of the board, is a quintessential
establishmentarian. He is a director of The New York Times Company,
a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a director
of the liberal nonprofit Center for National Policy, formerly
headed by UN ambassador Madeline Albright and chaired by Vance's
successor at State, Edmund S. Muskie.
<P>
Last year Vance was hired by<B> </B>Archer Daniels Midland to
defend the agribusiness giant against federal charges of price-fixing
in its sales of high-fructose corn syrup. Vance also reportedly
donated $1,000 to President Clinton's legal defense fund.
<P>
1992<B> </B>political contributions by Vance include $250 to Senator
Arlen Specter, $250 to Geraldine Ferraro's 1992 Senate bid, two
$1,000 contributions to the Democratic National Committee, $450
to Rep<B>. </B>Les Aspin and $1,000 to the Clinton for President
Committee. In 1994, he gave $1,000 to Senator John Chafee, $1,000
to the Democrats' Senate Victory '94, $1,750 to Senator Daniel
Moynihan, and $250 to Tennessee's Jim Cooper.
<P>
<B>DANIEL YANKELOVICH</B>, Public Agenda's president, is chairman
of DYG, Inc., a private polling company. He also sits on the board
of directors of the Kettering Foundation, which pays him $12,000
in annual compensation. Yankelovich has served on the board of
the Loral Corporation, a defense contractor with annual revenues
of over $1 billion; and he is on the boards of directors of telecommunications
giant US West and the Meredith Corporation, a media giant whose
$790 million in annual revenues derives from publishing magazines
like <I>Better Homes and Gardens</I>, broadcasting, real estate,
and franchising.
<P>
Yankelovich contributed $500 in 1998 to Les Aspin, $1,000 in 1992
to Jane Harman, a liberal California Democratic candidate for
Congress, and $500 again to Harman in 1994. Harman's husband,
Sidney, is on the board of directors of the Public Agenda Foundation,
as noted earlier.
<P>
In a 1995 article in<B> </B><I>Mother Jones</I>, &quot;Restoring
Public Trust,&quot; Yankelovich urges liberals to recover their
moral authority by &quot;internalizing the public's point of view&quot;
in order to better change public perceptions of the liberal agenda.
This tactic follows the model used by the Convention.
<P>
<I><B>SPREADING THE `KETTERING TECHNIQUE'</B></I> 
<P>
While a breakdown of revenue sources was not available at press
time,<B> </B>the National Issues Convention received considerable
support from a range of interests. The Kettering and Public Agenda
connections and<B> </B>the fundraising skills of lobbyist Charls
E. Walker helped attract financial and in-kind support from private
corporations like American Airlines, Freddie Mac and Southwestern
Bell; from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a United Parcel Servicebased
philanthropy; and from public sector institutions like PBS, the
LBJ presidential library, the city of Austin, and the University
of Texas. They supplemented the initial in-kind support for the
project from the Charles F. Kettering Foundation, whose research
and materials were the basis of the &quot;deliberation.&quot;
<P>
Who benefitted? The noted historian Daniel Boorstin has provided
a way to understand the significance of the National Issues Convention.
In his 1987 study, <I>The Image</I>, Boorstin observed that modern
society has created a new public phenomenon. It is situated between
real events, which are the subject of history, and staged propaganda,
which substitutes lies for truth. Boorstin called it the &quot;pseudo-event.&quot;<B>
</B>It would provide &quot;..synthetic facts which move people
indirectly, by providing the `factual' basis on which they are
supposed to make up their minds.&quot;
<P>
The first targets of those who organize pseudo-events are fact-hungry
journalists, and it is they who have most to lose from programs
like the National Issues Convention and further applications of
the &quot;deliberative poll.&quot; Similarly, &quot;public journalism&quot;
projects imperil the credibility of the American media which may
end up serving as propagandists for the agenda of grantmaking
foundations.
<P>
But as for most American citizens? They probably have much less
to fear.<B> </B>Would the Convention delegates act on their &quot;deliberations&quot;
when they returned to their homes?
<P>
Or is it not more likely that they will consult their real principles,
life experiences, and interests once liberated from the enforced
group-think of the &quot;Kettering Technique?&quot;<HR>

<h2>PBS's &quot;Democracy Project&quot; : Is It Really The Democrat
Project?</h2>
<I>Although they profess impartiality,a look at the list of
key personnel in PBS's &quot;Democracy Project&quot; reveals a
number of players with ties to the Democratic Party or the Johnson,
Carter or Clinton Administrations:</I> 
<P>
<B>Gerald Baliles</B>, PBS Chairman of the Board, former Democratic
Governor of Virginia;
<P>
<B>Ervin Duggan</B>, PBS President, former White House Speechwriter
for LBJ, former assistant to Secretary of State CyrusVance (Chairman
of the Public Agenda Foundation) and HEW Secretary Joe Califano
in the Carter Administration;
<P>
<B>Tom Epstein</B>, PBS Director of Communications, former Deputy
Political Director in the Clinton White House, handled California
for 1992 campaign;
<P>
<B>Ellen Hume</B>, Executive Director of PBS's &quot;Democracy

in the Clinton Administration's State Department;
<P>
<B>Sharon Rockefeller</B>, President, WETA, Washington, PBS &quot;Democracy
Project&quot; host station, wife of Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV,
Virginia Democrat, and donor to Clinton in 1992.<HR>

<h2>National Issues Convention Sponsors Show A Liberal Bent</h2>
<P>
<I>Although the Kettering Foundation was not listed as a sponsor
in the on-air television credits (a Kettering spokesman preferred
the term &quot;collaborator&quot;), the PBS broadcast noted three
&quot;underwriters.&quot; They were the <B>Annie E. Casey Foundation,
Freddie Mac</B>, and<B> Southwestern Bell</B>. </I>
<P>
Robert V. Pambianco recently characterized the <B>Annie E. Casey
Foundation</B> -- a United Parcel Servicebased philanthropy whose
board contains current and retired UPS executives -- as a &quot;progressive
philanthropy&quot; which &quot;rarely strays from the liberal
social agenda&quot; (see CRC's<I> Organization Trends</I>, December
1995). Grants included: $200,000 to the Children's Defense Fund,
formerly chaired by First Lady Hillary Clinton; $5.1 million for
Sustainable Milwaukee, &quot;nothing more than a creation of the
radical left&quot;; and $252,00 to HandsNet, &quot;a conduit for
political information aimed at mobilizing activists.&quot;
<P>
Austin Fulk and Stuart Nolan analyzed the donations of <B>Freddie
Mac </B>and <B>Southwestern Bell</B> (in CRC's <I>Patterns of
Corporate Philanthropy IX</I>, 1996) and scored giving on a scale
of 1 to 8 from left to right.
<P>
<B>Freddie Mac</B>'s gifts included $129,800 to the Children's
Defense Fund, $25,000 to Planned Parenthood, and $10,000 to the
Center for Population Options. Its score was 2.55 and its giving
pattern &quot;Liberal.&quot;
<P>
<B>Southwestern Bell</B> gave $45,000 to NAACP chapters and $25,000
to the Public Agenda Foundation. The phone company's score was
3.52 and giving pattern analyzed as &quot;Center-Left.&quot;<HR>

<P><br>
<a name="ridings"></a>
<h2>Ridings New President of Council on Foundations</h2>
<P>
Dorothy S. Ridings was appointed president of the Council on Foundations
on February 5th. President of the League of Women Voters from
1982 to 1986, Ridings has been publisher of Florida's <I>Bradenton
Herald</I> since 1988, and an executive with Knight-Ridder. Ridings
is a trustee of the Ford and Benton foundations, an advisor to
the Knight and the Mary Reynolds Babcock foundations, and active
in committees of Independent Sector.

<center><h2>
Why Is New York Times Columnist Maureen Dowd Driving the White House Crazy?
</h2></center>
<img src="/crc/images/cw-0796.gif" ALIGN = "left">
<p>
Maureen Dowd is the iconoclast of The 
	New York Times. She is known for her 
	feisty and cutting accounts of life in 
	Washington, especially her tart ridicule of the antics of the current occupants of the White House. This has made her public enemy number one for President Clinton's supporters in the press. James Fallows, a Carter speechwriter and Clinton appointee, blasted Dowd in his book Breaking the News, objecting to this opening sentence from a June, 1994 news story: "President Clinton returned today from a sentimental journey to the university where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted and didn't get a degree." Fallows said the columnist's caustic style "aggravates today's prevailing despair and cynicism about public life." Following his lead, Dowd was lambasted as a "fifties sweater girl" in The Nation by feminist Susan Faludi and charged with "making mischief" in The New Yorker by James Woollcott.
<p>
Dowd is so radioactive at the White 
	House that when press secretary 
	Michael McCurry accidentally found 
	himself joking about her writing before a briefing on terrorism, he begged assembled reporters, "Isolate the 'I agree with Maureen Dowd' part, guys." One reason Dowd is unpopular -- and pointedly not invited to state dinners at the White House -- is her savage criticism of the First Couple.  In a column headed "The State of the Fish," she describes Hillary Clinton's memories of working in an Alaskan seafood processing plant during summer vacation, and quotes the First Lady's description of fish as "purple and black and yucky looking." Comparing the fish to Mrs. Clinton's professional and business record, Dowd concludes: "If anybody notices something yucky about her financial and political entrails they are supposed to trust that she is working for the greater good... As she must remember, the fish rots from the head down.'" 
<p>	
Dowd was not always a political pundit. But she 
		is no stranger to controversy. During the 
		Reagan years, she created a stir with a page one story drawing on Kitty Kelley's biography of Nancy Reagan -- reportedly assigned by an editor who received an advance copy of the book from Kelley's agent, Kathy Robbins, who asked that the naughty bits be rushed into print. After her editors placed the story on the front page,  Dowd was chewed out by then executive editor Max Frankel, who felt the gossip was unfit to print.  Only the intervention of Joseph Lelyveld (Frankel's successor as executive editor) persuaded Dowd, practically in tears, to stay on the job. It was good for the paper that she did. Dowd was made White House correspondent in 1988 and nominated for a Pulitzer prize in 1992. In 1994 Times columnist Anna Quindlen presented her with a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Within a year, Quindlen would resign her job, and Dowd took over the position of resident essayist for the woman's point of view. 
<p>
Compared by some to Maureen O'Hara, Dowd
		drives a zippy Mazda Miata convertible, and 
		remains loyal to her Hibernian roots, praising President Clinton when he visited Ireland, and writing in her column about lunching at "The Irish Times" pub on Capitol Hill with The New Yorker writer Michael Kelly, newly named editor of  The New Republic . Dowd was squired around town by Crossfire's Michael Kinsley before he departed for Seattle, Vanity Fair reported. But she is intensely private, and little is known about her personal life. Only once has Dowd been victimized by the tabloid press, in revenge for columns satirizing Barney's,  the New York temple of fashion intimidation. A practical joker pretending to be her stormed into the store  and demanded a discount -- resulting in a Page Six story in The New York Post headlined "Dowd in dither over discount denial."  Dowd fought back in print in The Times.  Her alibi: She was in Washington interviewing Senator Strom Thurmond at the time of the alleged incident. Thurmond graciously confirmed her account, and later the prank was revealed to be a hoax by Spy magazine. No wonder she prefers maintaining a Woman of the Year pose as a "woman of mystery." 
<p>
Darling of her paper's editors and publishers, 
		Dowd is also respected by her peers. Liberal 
		Times columnist Frank Rich worked with her covering the 1992 political conventions. Rich, then Times drama critic, told Culture Watch, "It was great fun, and I had the time of my life working with Maureen," who was the paper's White House correspondent. They were good friends then and are good friends now, he says. Dowd's writings are widely read and quoted in Washington, whether she is chastising "Bill Clinton's style of casuistry and prevarication," conjuring up a debate between  Elizabeth ("Sugar Lips") Dole and Hillary ("Sister Frigidaire") Clinton, or noting how "novelistically interesting" Bob Dole's candidacy has become, dubbing him "the candidate of not." Dowd commented, "If we voted on the basis of overcoming adversity, Bob Dole would win easily. But we want to know where he's going as much as where he came from." Against the Kansas Republican's primary opponent, she argued that "you don't have to be anti-Catholic to be anti-Buchanan," citing William Bennett and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, but also pointed out that she and Pat Buchanan are "two peas in a pod," Irish-American journalists from northwest Washington. Dowd revealed that her mother asked her not to be mean to Dole's rival for the Republican nomination because "he's one of us."  Another column tagged President Clinton "the man from Hot Springs, the old hangout of gamblers and roues where he grew up...the golden boy who leaves his messes behind for others to clean up, sliding out of predicaments that would be fatal to less nimble pols. " A keen observer of America's hurly-burly, she punctured the hype around the tragic flight of seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff by simply saying, "Why didn't we all just get up and begin screaming: THIS IS CRAZY?" So influential is Dowd's writing that Fallows notes she "has found herself cited in almost every article about excess cynicism in the press."
<p>
Not bad for a working-class Irish-American girl, 
		born in 1952 to Michael Dowd, a District of 
		Columbia police inspector whose duties included assignments on Capitol Hill. A good student, Dowd is remembered fondly by her senior year homeroom teacher at Immaculata High School, class of 1969. "She was outstanding," Sister Petra (S.P.) told Culture Watch, "and very promising."  Dowd earned  her English literature degree from Catholic University, and began her career in journalism at the age of twenty-two at the dictation desk of the now-defunct Washington Star.  She patiently paid her dues for almost a decade, writing obituaries and weather stories, writing her way onto the sports pages (then written by guys for guys) and  the paper's city desk and "Portfolio" section, which competed with The Washington Post's "Style" section in covering society and fashion. Dowd was loyal and stayed on even as other staffers migrated elsewhere during the paper's final days. After the Star closed, Dowd was hired by Time magazine, which moved her to New York in 1983. She joined the metropolitan section of The New York Times a few months later, then transferred to the Washington bureau in 1986, where ever since she has delighted readers with her caustic observations on politics and politicians. Now the focus of celebrity gossip in the national press, Dowd's every word echoes in the corridors of power. She is definitely unpredictable as a writer, calling herself a "pathological truthteller." Her motto remains: "No one is safe."

<P>
<H3>SEMINAL TRIBE</H3>
  <H4>  <EM> Hopwood, et al., v. State of Texas</em><BR></H4></CENTER>

<P>Cooperating Counsel:  Theodore B. Olson, Douglas Cox (Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher)<p>
What can we tell you?  In a landmark decision, a panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that 
the University of Texas Law School may not take race into account in admitting students to its illustrious institution.  
<P>
<P>The Law School, the court held, had produced no evidence that its affirmative action program was in any 
way tailored to redress the present effects of its own past discrimination, there being no such cognizable effects.  
Moreover, racial &quot;diversity&quot; is not a compelling government interest that would permit the government to discriminate on 
the basis of race.  Justice Powell's lone opinion in 
<I>Bakke</I>, the Fifth Circuit declared, was never the law of the land.  
The court expressed confidence that the defendants would henceforth cease to consider race  in student admissions; 
should they fail to do so, the court added, the plaintiffs may be entitled to compensatory and punitive damages.
<P>
<P>The defendants have vowed to ask the Supreme Court to review <I>Hopwood</I>, to the dismay of many liberal 
civil rights groups.  They have also hired Harvard eminento Laurence Tribe.  Making his first appearance on the 
defendants' motion for an emergency stay of the Fifth Circuit's order and decision, Tribe argues that the observance of 
non-discrimination norms would confront UT with administrative burdens, which is what the segregationist South told 
the courts some three decades ago.  Tribe argues further that the damages provision of Title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded institutions, is <I>unconstitutional</I>, especially in light of the 
Supreme Court's recent decision in the <I>Seminole Tribe</I> case.  Last we looked,<I> we</I> were supposed to be the extremists.
<P>
<P>Judge Jerry Smith's opinion speaks for itself, and we will permit it to do so 
(<I>see</I> excerpts nearby.)  But we'll comment upon a few aspects of the Fifth Circuit's ruling that aren't entirely obvious.
<P>
<P>Judge Smith's opinion owes its persuasiveness largely to the recognition of the weaknesses of Justice 
Powell's <I>Bakke</I> opinion, which enshrined the notion that diversity justifies small race preferences or &quot;plus factors.&quot;  In letter and spirit, the Powell opinion prohibits &quot;rigid&quot; quotas and permits no more than limited, flexible, and temporary preferences of the kind state agencies may use to redress the on-going effects of their own past discrimination.  But in real life, given the higher ed establishment's impulses, diversity-based preferences tend to drift into permanent 
racialism and <I>de facto</I> quotas (as happened at UT).
<P>
<P>Arguably, the very notion of preferences as a &quot;non-decisive&quot; &quot;plus factor&quot; is incoherent:  Unless a race 
preference is so small as to be irrelevant, it will be decisive in the marginal case; we're just haggling over the size of the 
preference and the number of cases in which it will be decisive.  Similarly, the distinction between &quot;rigid quotas&quot; and 
&quot;flexible&quot; diversity-based preferences has proven a mirage.  Diversity advocates insist that minority participation must be 
more than &quot;token.&quot;  And when a tiny thumb on the race scales doesn't produce the desired result, lo! we're back to 
a proportionalist standard of &quot;meaningful&quot; representation and to racial preferences whose scope or weight is 
determined by the need to obtain an &quot;adequate&quot; number of minorities.  That is, we're back to quotas in disguise.
<P>
<P><B><I>VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO THEODORE B. OLSON AND DOUGLAS COX OF GIBSON, 
DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER FOR THEIR</I> PRO BONO <I>ASSISTANCE.  WITHOUT THEIR COURAGE, SKILL, 
AND DETERMINATION,</I> HOPWOOD<I> WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.</B></I>
<P>
<P>Finally, unlike remedial preferences, diversity-based preferences cannot be temporary.  In a free country, 
institutions will <I>never</I> match a social engineer's diversity standard.  Thus, any deviation from some preconceived, 
fanciful norm of racial diversity will justify renewed racial meddling.  Whatever the so-called civil rights groups may say, 
&quot;diversity&quot;--as they understand it--isn't even inspired by the ideal of a colorblind Constitution.  
<P>
<P>As for a <I>proper</I> understanding of diversity, Judge Smith's opinion leaves considerable latitude: 
universities may consider a host of factors in admissions, including factors other than merit and factors that correlate highly with race.  What universities may <I>not</I> do is to use race, either for its own sake or as a proxy for permissible characteristics; or to use permissible criteria for racial reasons or in a racially discriminatory manner.
<P>
<P>Predictably, diversity fanatics have denounced this holding as &quot;absurd,&quot; as an endorsement of &quot;affirmative 
action for rich alumni kids but not for minorities,&quot; etc.  On the other hand, the idea that admissions need not be based 
on merit may distress some conservatives.  To us, the Fifth Circuit's holding seems exactly right; we suppose this makes 
us moderates.
<P>
<P>The diversity crowd is right to insist that universities need not admit &quot;strictly on merit.&quot;   Of course, merit is 
not remotely so subjective as diversity enthusiasts suggest.  But, as we've readily conceded throughout the 
<I>Hopwood</I> litigation, lots of things other than test scores may enter into a decision as to who would make a good lawyer (race, 
we submit, isn't one of them).
<P>
<P>That aside, factors other than merit may play a legitimate role in education.  Yale may try to admit a few 
applicants from Arkansas, on the theory that Arkansas is best run by Elis or that Arkansans add value to the Yale's student body. 
 (You wouldn't understand, unless you've been to Arkansas or Yale.)  State institutions may prefer in-state applicants 
and have quotas on outsiders.  Whatever one thinks of these practices as a matter of policy, they're not 
unconstitutional--and not remotely as destructive and divisive as racial preferences.
<P>
<P>For starters, racial preferences don't end with admissions. In due course, its beneficiaries demand their own 
faculty (diverse and supportive), their own bureaucracy for minority concerns 
(<I>ditto</I>), their own curricula and degrees 
(Victims Studies), their own housing (segregated), speech codes, sensitivity training, etc.  Alumni kids have not been observed 
to make similar demands.
<P>
<P>
<P>Similarly, what we learn upon encountering a marginally qualified alumni kid on a public campus--as an 
empirical matter, a rare occurrence--is that some rich folks' kids are dunces, and that the government is corrupt.  What else 
is new?  Under racial preferences &aacute; la UT, on the other hand, students can tell who was admitted under lower 
standards simply by looking at people's skin color.  This is a very nasty thing.
<P>
<P>The long and short of it is that government constantly &quot;discriminates&quot; among its citizens.  Many such 
distinctions are unjust, arbitrary, and inefficient.  But none carries the stigma and the explosive force of race.  Only religion 
comes close.  But we wisely prohibit the state from making distinctions based on religion. 
<P>
<P>Race (and here again, the diversity folks have a point) is central to people's lives--so central that people 
easily come to blows over it.  But this isn't an argument for public race consciousness.  It's the central reason why race, 
unlike other factors, must <I>not</I> be taken into account; why race, like religion, must be put beyond the reach of the state. 
 <I>Hopwood</I>, whatever may eventually come of it, is a huge step towards this elusive goal.

<BR><BR><BR>
<B>FROM JUDGE JERRY SMITH'S OPINION</B>
<P>The law school has presented no compelling justification ... that allows it to continue to elevate some races over 
others, even for the wholesome purpose of correcting perceived racial imbalance in the student body.
<P>
<P>[The law school's] disparate standards greatly affected a candidate's chance of admission.... [B]ecause the 
presumptive <I>denial</I> score for whites was a TI [Texas Index, a computation of both LSAT and GPA] of 192 or lower, and the 
presumptive <I>admit</I> TI for minorities was 189 or higher, a minority candidate with a TI of 189 or above almost certainly would be 
<I>admitted</I>, even though his score was considerably below the level at which a white candidate would be 
<I>rejected</I>. ...  The stated purpose of this lowering of standards was to meet an &quot;aspiration&quot; of admitting a class consisting of 10% Mexican Americans and 5% blacks .... 
<P>
<P>[T]here is now absolutely no doubt that courts are to employ strict scrutiny when evaluating all racial 
classifications, including those characterized by their proponents as &quot;benign&quot; or &quot;remedial.&quot; ...  Under the strict scrutiny analysis, we ask two questions:  (1)  Does the racial classification serve a compelling government interest, and (2)  is it narrowly tailored to achievement of that goal?
<P>
<P>We agree with the plaintiffs that any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for the purpose of achieving 
a diverse student body is not a compelling interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Justice Powell's argument in 
<I>Bakke</I> garnered only his own vote and has never represented the view of a majority of the Court in 
<I>Bakke</I> or any other case.  Moreover, subsequent Supreme Court decisions regarding education state that non-remedial state interests will never justify racial classifications.  Finally, the classification of persons on the basis of race for the purpose of diversity frustrates, rather than facilitates, the goals of equal protection.
<P>
<P>Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher 
education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race.  
It treats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals.  It may further remedial purposes but, just as likely, may 
promote improper racial stereotypes, thus fueling racial hostility.
<P>
<P>The use of race, in and of itself, to choose students simply achieves a student body that looks different.  Such a criterion 
is no more rational on its own terms than would be choices based upon the physical size or blood type of applicants....
<P>
<P>Law schools specifically may look at things such as unusual or substantial extracurricular activities in college, which 
may be atypical factors affecting undergraduate grades.  Schools may even consider factors such as whether an applicant's 
parents attended college or the applicant's economic and social background.....  [But to] believe that a person's race controls his point of view is to stereotype him.
<P>
<P>Finally, the use of race to achieve diversity undercuts the ultimate goal of the Fourteenth Amendment:  the end of 
racially motivated state action.  Justice Powell's conception of race as a &quot;plus&quot; factor would allow race always to be a potential factor in admissions decisionmaking....
<P>
<P>[T]he use of race to achieve a diverse student body, whether as a proxy for permissible characteristics, simply cannot be 
a state interest compelling enough to meet the steep standard of strict scrutiny.  These latter factors may, in fact, turn out to 
be substantially correlated with race, but the key is that race  itself not be taken into account....
<P>
<P>The Supreme Court has &quot;insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved 
before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.&quot; ...  [T]he district court erred in 
expanding the remedial justification to reach all public education within the State of Texas.  The Supreme Court repeatedly has 
warned that the use of racial remedies must be carefully limited, and a remedy reaching all education within a state addresses a 
putative injury that is vague and amorphous.
<P>
<P>By the late 1960's, the school had implemented its first program designed to recruit minorities ... and it now engages in 
an extensive minority recruiting program. ...  The vast majority of the faculty, staff, and students at the law school had 
absolutely nothing to do with any discrimination that the law school practiced in the past. ... In such a case, one cannot conclude that 
a hostile environment is the present effect of past discrimination.  Any racial tension at the law school is most certainly the 
result of present societal discrimination and, if anything, is contributed to, rather than alleviated by, the overt and prevalent 
consideration of race in admissions.
<P>     
<P>In summary, we hold that the University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a factor in deciding which 
applicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived effects of a hostile environment at the law 
school, to alleviate the law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to eliminate any present effects of past 
discrimination by actors other than the law school.

<P>
 
<BR>
<B>SAY WHAT?</B>
<P>University of Texas Provost Mark Yudof called 
<I>Hopwood</I> &quot;the A-Bomb.&quot;  This was to remain the single astute 
and accurate observation from the Quota Camp. 
<P>
<P><B>*</B> John A. Blackburn, dean of admissions and Chairman of the Department of Frontal Lobotomy at the University 
of Virginia, called <I>Hopwood</I> &quot;an incredibly stupid decision.  All of us are dazed, wondering, 'What does it mean?'&quot; 
(<I>Chronicle of Higher Education</I>, March 29.)  The decision means what it saysread it.  
<P>
<P> <B>*</B> On the UT faculty, affirmative action stirs strong emotions, shame not among them.  At a 
post-<I>Hopwood</I> meeting for concerned UT students, a minority student complained that UT students seem to think that minorities are admitted 
under relaxed standards and implored Dean Michael Sharlot and Professor and defense counsel Sam Issacharoff to tell 
everyone that this wasn't so, &quot;like you told us at the minority orientation dinner.&quot;  Go right ahead. 
<P>     
<P><B>*</B> Announcing the defendants' decision to take 
<I>Hopwood</I> to the Supreme Court, Texas Attorney General Dan 
Morales expressed confidence that the Fifth Circuit's ruling would be overturned because &quot;the vast majority of Texans are not racist. 
 The vast majority of Americans are not racist.&quot;  That's one way of endearing oneself with the federal judiciary.
<P>
<P><B>*</B> John Sexton, dean of N.Y.U. law school at N.Y.U. and incoming President of the Association of American 
Law Schools, said that &quot;The enlightened admissions committee will choose ... students who play well with each other,&quot; and 
let's hope they're adults.  &quot;You start with a set of musicians, all of whom are virtuoso, and try to choose some violinist, some 
oboists, and some woodwinds.&quot;  
(<I>Chronicle</I>, April 5.) Let windbag conduct the crowd 
and--<I>presto!</I>--it's like the Yoko Ono Band playing Schoenberg.
<P> 
<P><B>*</B> Brandy Copley, UT Law School student, opined that &quot;we [whites] need to be arbitrarily discriminated against 
to redress past wrongs.&quot;  (<I>Texas 
Lawyer</I>, March 25.)  Who is &quot;We,&quot; Kemosabe?  &quot;Sean McCann, a white senior at 
Texas-Austin, [said] that white males are more likely to die of mad-cow disease than to be the victims of reverse discrimination.&quot;  
(<I>Chronicle</I>, April 5.)  Why is it that reverse discrimination never seems to hit the people who deserve it?
<P>
<P><B>*</B>  Throughout the litigation, the defendants harangued Cheryl Hopwood for her failure to submit with her law 
school application a statement on her history of personal hardships (such as a childhood in poverty).  But Cheryl Hopwood 
didn't want to win the <I>Queen For A Day</I> sweepstakes; she wanted a fair shot, which UT didn't give her.  To us, her reluctance to 
tell the world that she, too, was a <I>VICTIM</I> is a sign of dignity; UT's enlightened admission committee concluded that she's 
too dumb to become a lawyer.  On the same note, Michael A. Olivas (University of Houston Law Center) berated the 
plaintiffs for their arrogance in demanding their &quot;rightful seat&quot; at UT Law 
(<I>Chronicle</I> , March 29).  Buried under a mountain 
of evidence to the contrary, Olivas squealed that &quot;it was not 'lesser qualified' minorities who displaced the 
<I>Hopwood</I> plaintiffs.&quot;  
<P>
<P><B>*</B> UT maintains that there are no race-based preferences and, moreover, that the abolition of non-existent preferences 
in the wake of <I>Hopwood</I> would entail the &quot;virtual resegregation of higher education,&quot; to quote UT Austin President Robert 
M. Berdahl, who in turn echoed the UT attorneys' briefs in 
<I>Hopwood</I>.  This prediction is most plausible on the 
assumption (blurted out not long ago by the President of Rutgers University) that Blacks are naturally incapable of participating fully 
in American life--a belief that has also sustained such fine Texan traditions as segregated water fountains.
<P>
<P>Berdahl &amp; Co. differ with this interpretation.  They claim that the Texas K-12 school system is doing a lousy 
job, especially for Black children.  This is probably true; the schools may well be run by men of Mr. Berdahl's competence 
and integrity.  Still, having set aside some 25 Black seats at UT Law, and having filled two-thirds of them with Blacks from 
outside Texas, what does Berdahl expect from the thousands of kids who are trapped in the Texas school system--a medal?
<P>
<P><B>*</B> It's not our business to run UT's admission system.  But since UT won't shut up about resegregation, we'll offer an 
easy solution:  consider every applicant who meets the minimal qualifications for preferred minority applicants (which, 
according to UT, means &quot;fully qualified&quot; for UT Law).  In 1992, this pool would have been about 20 percent minority.  Then, have 
a lottery for the seats. UT would still be a Top-30 law school.  Except, it's now a Top-20 law school.  It wants to be a Top Ten 
law school, and it can't be tops with the merely qualified students:  it needs the best, few of whom will be of the desired minorities. 
 UT, in short, wants to be an elitist institution with a democratic veneer.  
<I>This</I> is UT's real &quot;compelling interest&quot; for 
race discrimination.  The hell with it.

<H3>THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOM</H3>
<H4><EM> Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute, et al.</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>
<P>Cooperating Attorney:  W. David Paxton, Esq. (Gentry, Locke, Rakes &amp; Moore)
<P>
<P>Leave it to the feminist shock troops to turn a proceeding over alleged rape--recognized by all concerned as a 
serious matter--into an ideological circus.
<P>
<P>In a case pending before U.S. District Judge Jackson L. Kiser, the nominal plaintiff, Christy Brzonkala, a 
former student at Virginia Tech, has raised federal and state claims against Virginia Tech and three individuals.  The 
individual defendants are male Virginia Tech students and, much to their detriment, members of its football team.  We serve as 
co-counsel to one of the defendants, Antonio Morrison.
<P>
<P>The case arises from the following facts:  Returning from a party at around 2:00 am on a fateful morning in 
September 1994, Brzonkala and a female friend knocked on the dorm room door of the defendants, whom they had never met.  
They were let in.  The talk quickly turned to sex.  Brzonkala's friend left; no attempt was made to hold her back.
<P>
<P>At this point, the accounts diverge.  Brzonkala claims that Morisson and his roommate, James Crawford, took 
turns raping her.  Morrison denies the rape allegation, and has steadfastly maintained that he was involved only in a 
consensual encounter.  Crawford denies any involvement with Brzonkala, and even she admits that Crawford left shortly after 
her friend did. Crawford returned some time later with a teammate, Cornell Brown; in a prank on Morrison, the two 
clamored that the coach was checking up on the players.  Morrison hurried the girl out of the room. 
<P>
<P>We'd be happy to demonstrate that Morrison is telling the truth, were it not for the fact that the requisite 
documents--principally, transcripts of two hearings on the case at Virginia Tech--are under a protective order.  For now, let's just 
say that Morrison's story, unlike the plaintiff's, fits with the accounts given by his buddies and by Brzonkala's friend; that 
there is no physical evidence to suggest rape; and that 
<I>none</I> of the numerous officials called upon to examine the case has 
been able to find Morrison or Crawford guilty of rape. On April 10, 1996, a grand jury refused to indict the two.
<P>
<P>Brzonkala did not seek medical treatment after the alleged incident, and she did not complain to any public 
authority until April 1995, seven months after the alleged incident.  Then, she fell into the hands of the Virginia Tech women's center. 
 At the center's urging, Brzonkala brought administrative charges under Virginia Tech's &quot;Abusive Conduct Policy,&quot; 
alleging &quot;gang rape&quot; by Morrison and Crawford.
<P>
<P>On less than a week's notice, Morrison and Crawford were drummed through a hearing that featured the 
usual irregularities.  For instance, there was never a face-to-face confrontation between the accuser and the accused; 
Brzonkala testified over the phone.  Asked to describe the alleged rapists (whose pictures she claimed to have recognized in a 
football program given to her in April 1995), just about the only thing Brzonkala got right was that the offenders were 
black.(Brzonkala herself is white.)
<P>
<P>No disciplinary measures were taken against Crawford, meaning that the hearing committee didn't buy the rape story. 
 Morrison was found guilty, though not of rape but of &quot;sexual misconduct.&quot;  It was not explained what precisely 
that misconduct might be.  Perhaps, it was consensual, interracial sex; perhaps, it was Morrison's rude, post-coital remark 
that &quot;you better not have any diseases.&quot;  In any event, Morrison was hit with a one-year suspension, effective immediately.
<P>
<P>Trouble was, the policy on sexual misconduct had not been published at the time of the event; Morrison had 
violated a standard he had no way of knowing.  Thus, the suspension was set aside, and a new hearing--as problematic, from 
a procedural perspective, as the first-- was held.  Morrison was found guilty of the offending &quot;diseases&quot; remark, and the 
one-year suspension was re-instated.  In an act of courage, Virginia Tech's Provost (her- self a woman) determined that 
the penalty was a bit much for a single remark and deferred the one-year suspension, meaning that Morrison was placed 
on probation.
<P>
<P>It appears that at this point, the American Association of University Women referred the plaintiff to Eileen 
Wagner, an attorney and long-time feminist activist.  Wagner took Brzonkala to federal court, so to speak.  She alleges, on 
the plaintiff's behalf, a sex discrimination claim against Virginia Tech under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.  In essence, 
she claims that Virginia Tech &quot;discriminated&quot; against Brzonkala by granting Morrison due process (such as it was) 
&quot;solely because he is a member of Virginia Tech's all-male football team.&quot;  Virginia Tech has moved to dismiss the claim.


<P>
<P>Wagner further asserts federal claims against the individual defendants under the federal Violence Against 
Women Act.  This statute owes its 1994 enactment in large measure to Ms. Lorena Bobbit, a feminist matron saint who hacked 
off her hubby's organ with a kitchen knife, took the bleeding thing for a car ride, and eventually tossed it onto a 
Virginia highway, where state troopers found it and returned it to its rightful owner.  (The owner recently had the object 
surgically enlarged, perhaps to facilitate its retrieval in the event of another untoward accident.  But we digress.)  
<P>
<P>For NOW President Patricia Ireland, the Bobbit affair &quot;underscore[d] the need for Congress ... to get about 
the business of passing a comprehensive violence against women act.&quot;  Congress complied, and threw everything into the 
Act but free meat cleavers.  Of relevance to the Brzonkala case is VAWA's creation of a federal tort claim for crimes 
against women that are motivated wholly by discriminatory animus toward the victim's gender.  (Nothing wrong, it appears, 
with rape by people who <I>like</I> women.)
<P> 
<P>We have moved to dismiss the VAWA claims against Morrison on the grounds that the enactment exceeds 
Congress' power under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although the plaintiff, NOW, and 
the Justice Department are opposing this motion, we think we have the better argument.  But while the VAWA claims 
are pending, they merit closer inspection.
<P>
<P>The evidence of Morrison's misogynist animus is said to consist of his alleged failure to use a condom during 
the alleged incident; the &quot;disease&quot; remark; and an allegation by the plaintiff's roommate that Morrison once graphically 
expressed his desire of having sex with drunk girls.  Morrison categorically denies making the latter remark, which the 
witness claims to have overheard in a dining hall full of football players. 
<P>     
<P>The suit further alleges assault and battery, false imprisonment, and defamation (on the theory that Morrison's 
insistence that any sex was consensual amounts to an accusation of fornication, a crime of moral turpitude in Virginia).  
These state law claims might be viable  assuming that the plaintiff can prove them, which she cannot.  Wagner's federal 
claims, on the other hand, are transparently absurd.  Why, then, does she assert them?
<P> 
<P>The answer is that Eileen Wagner and a gaggle of feminist groups are on a crusade against misogynists, 
especially college athletes.  Wagner herself has told us so:  in response to our motion to dismiss the VAWA claim, she 
submitted a harangue (reprinted nearby) that's lifted nearly verbatim from the works of Suzy Estrich and Kathy MacKinnon. 
 When she filed the suit, Wagner demanded $8.3 million in damages, this being the amount Virginia Tech earned in 
last year's Sugarbowl game.  She demands &quot;an injunction directing Virginia Tech to provide at least five hours of 
mandatory sexual assault awareness education to student athletes ... and to bring nationally recognized speakers on 
sexual harassment and sexual assault issues to its university forum at least twice a year.&quot;  And, Wagner wants the 
entire starting line-up and coaching staff of Virginia Tech's football team to appear at trial, for whatever bearing the 
testimony may have on the case.  For good measure, Wagner asserts a VAWA claim against Cornell 
Brown--Crawford's fellow prankster, whose only conceivable crime is that he, too, is a male football player.
<P>
<P>As Wagner said on the <I>Geraldo Show</I>, she wanted a test case for VAWA.  Having dragged Christy Brzonkala 
into an awful case, Wagner has been trying to divert attention from the facts and to frame the case as a referendum on 
an issue.  We can't stop her.  But let's be clear what the issue is:  To make a point about misogyny, the NOW clan is 
trying to hang a rape charge on innocent black men.  
<P>
<P>By all means, let's have a vote.<P>

<B>ON A MISSION FROM MOLLY YARD</B>
<P>From Plaintiff Brzonkala's Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's 
federal claims under the Violence Against Women Act:  
<P>
<P><I>Plaintiff believes her case will forever change the cavalier attitude widely used to dismiss the sufferings of sexual 
assault survivors everywhere.....  Plaintiff anticipates this litigation will re-focus crime prevention efforts for sexual assault on 
the behavior of the perpetrator ....  Plaintiff expects this litigation to dissect the ancient misogynistic myth that women 
secretly desire to be raped ....  Further, she hopes for a wide national debate about why the &quot;no means yes&quot; myth still persists.... 
 Plaintiff expects litigation in this forum will set a high level for national legal discourse about the true seriousness of 
criminal sexual assault as it affects the majority of American victims--females.

<H3>TOE TO TOE</H3>
<H4><EM> Scallet v. Rosenblum, et al.</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>
<P>Cooperating Attorney:  Ted Scallet, Esq.
<P>
<P>Still more news on the abuse of sexual harassment charges comes from the University of Virginia's Darden 
Graduate School of Business Administration.  The School's decision to brand an inconvenient faculty member as a sexual 
harasser has led to two lawsuits--a defamation action in state court, and a federal lawsuit over violations of the teacher's 
First Amendment rights.  
<P>     
<P>Our client, Robert &quot;Cid&quot; Scallet, became Darden faculty member in 1985.  He taught a first-year Analysis &amp; 
Communications course, to wide acclaim among his students.  In May 1992, Darden fired Scallet, ostensibly for poor 
management of the A&amp;C course (which Scallet wasn't managing at the time); &quot;lack of collegiality,&quot; whatever this might mean; 
and &quot;undermining the mission of the school,&quot; whatever it might be.
<P>
<P>This was classic pretext.  The real reason for Scallet's removal was that Darden's powers-that-be hated his 
politics (left-wing) and his popularity with students (considerable).    Scallet did indeed raise issues of diversity and other 
liberal nostrums in class.  However, prior to his firing, Scallet never received any official notice that the Darden folks in charge 
of overseeing him and his course had a problem with his teaching.  In fact, his personnel file was squeaky clean.
<P>
<P>Scallet's removal did not go over well with Darden's students.  Over half of them signed a petition to &quot;let Cid 
teach,&quot; to no avail.  Scallet himself requested a grievance hearing.  Seventeen months and two investigations later, the 
University had still not published a decision on Scallet's grievance.  In March 1994, Scallet sued.
<P>
<P>Soon after Scallet had filed his original grievance, though, it had occurred to the Darden deans who fired him 
that, since they didn't have a plausible reason for the action, they had better make one up.  Accordingly, various officials 
started to spread rumors that Scallet was &quot;evil and dangerous&quot;--specifically, that he harassed women.  
<P>
<P>In depositions, the Darden folks averred that two incidents of &quot;harassment&quot; played a particularly large role in 
Scallet's removal.  First, over a year before he was fired, Scallet reprimanded a female teaching assistant for her lousy 
performance and personal conduct.  Scallet insists the TA had it coming, and by the looks of it, he's right.  The details need not detain 
us; what matters is that at the time, the &quot;victim&quot; complained about Scallet's behavior to his higher-ups, who consulted 
about the matter with the Equal Employment Office, which--miraculously--told Darden that Scallet's behavior wasn't 
sexual harassment but a routine personnel squabble.  The deans told Scallet not to worry about it.  It was only 
<I>after</I> Scallet's removal that the deans changed their minds.
<P>
<P>The second allegation is that Scallet once jumped on a table in the front of his classroom and wiggled his toes in 
a provocative manner.  Word of this shocking behavior came from a female faculty member, who heard it from the 
TA mentioned above, who heard it from a student, who heard it from another student.  This isn't even hearsay; it's the 
grad school version of Let's Play Gossip.
<P>
<P>The mudslinging intensified when UVA's lawyers got into the act.  Led at the time by the esteemed Jim Mingle, 
who is now at Cornell and working his legal magic on Jim Maas (see 
<B>MINGLE-RANDEL WRANGLE</B>, page 13), UVA's 
legal team made additional allegations against Scallet.   These ranged from the swinish and invented 
(<I>e.g.</I>, a claim--which has Scallet hopping mad--that he described his wife's sexual prowess to a teaching assistant) to the factual but irrelevant 
(<I>e.g.</I>, umpires ejected Scallet a decade ago from a couple of softball games for protesting close calls).  All of this fruit of the 
loon stuff is the result of the University's post-firing detective work; none of it was raised before or at the time of Scallet's 
firing, never mind being relevant to it.
<P>
<P>In January 1996, a federal district court found that Scallet's in-class speech was not protected under the First 
Amendment.  This strikes us as flat-out wrong.  While public universities have a perfect right to control their curricula, they 
<I>can't</I> fire teachers without putting them on notice that the institution has a problem with their teaching.  As noted, Scallet 
never had such notice.  An appeal to the Fourth Circuit is pending.     
<P>
<P>And there's another thing educational institutions can't do:  they can't defame their employees in an effort 
to create a pretext for indefensible personnel actions.  Scallet's defamation claims against various Darden officials 
are pending in state court.


<P><B>SEX, LIES, AND WE SWEAR THIS IS TRUE</B>
<P>On March 27, Michael Greve participated in a panel debate on 
<B><I>Sexual Harassment:  Scholarly Definitions 
and Everyday Realities</B></I>, sponsored and aired to colleges around the nation by Black Issues In Higher Education.  The 
other speakers were Anne L. Bryant of the American Association of University Women; Beth Wilson (Vice Provost, 
Columbia); EEOC Counsel Ellen Vargyas; and the authors of the blockbuster 
<I>Race, Gender, and Power In America</I>, Emma 
Coleman Jordan and Anita Hill.
<P> 
<P>Justice Clarence Thomas's oath at his 1991 confirmation hearings--a filmclip of which was shown at the start of 
the program--was one of the few truthful statements in a two-hour &quot;debate&quot; that was actually a serenade to the 
Loathsome Dove, a/k/a A. Hill. Still, in the presence of feminism's leading ladies, Greve held his own (if one may still say so).  
Asked by one of the hosts to describe the travails of CIR client Don Silva, who was drummed out of his teaching job over 
two harmless remarks of a mildly sexual content, Greve said that the female complainants against Silva had gone 
&quot;berserk,&quot; whereupon the panelists went berserk and harangued Greve for failing to validate women's narratives.  Anita 
&quot;Call-Me-Ms.&quot; Hill was stumped when a caller asked how soon after an event harassment complaints must be brought; the 
correct answer is ten years after it didn't happen.
<P>
<P>Greve further discussed the gender wars, with special emphasis on the 
<I>Maas</I> case, at the <B>University of Texas 
Law School</B> in Austin (March 4); at the <B>Denver Chapter of the Federalist Society's Lawyers 
Division</B> (March 7); and at <B>Chase Law 
School</B> of Northern Kentucky University on a panel with, among others, Professors Lino Graglia and Richard 
Delgado, critical race theorist extraordinaire (March 29). 
<P>
<P>Delgado, who is actually a nice fellow, said that hate speech codes might not restrain sophisticated racists but would 
at least catch uneducated people such as coal miners.  This was not a good thing to say in Northern Kentucky.  
Delgado disavowed any radical ideas about regulating &quot;hate speech&quot;; all he wanted was an FDA for speech, to make sure 
the product would be safe and effective.  This was not a good thing to say to Greve.  Finally, Delgado complained about 
being the only person of color on the panel.  This was not a good thing to say to Graglia, a Sicilian who protested that he'd 
beat Delgado hands-down on a straight melanin count.
<P>
<P>Among other gender news items, the <B><I>Weekly 
Standard</B></I> (January 15) published CIR Director and Cornell 
Professor <B>Jeremy A. Rabkin</B>'s expose of the Maas affair and other edifying spectacles at Cornell.  And the 
<B><I>Roanoke Times</B></I> wrote a long and even-handed article on the Virginia Tech affair and the Violence Against Women Act, quoting CIR's views 
on these matters at considerable length.  So long as we get a fair hearing, we win.

<H4><EM> Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>

<P>Cooperating Counsel:  Michael A. Carvin (Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp; Trowbridge)
<P>
<P>On March 26, the state of Ohio agreed to pay $368,000 in damages and fees to settle our reverse 
discrimination lawsuit against Ohio State University on behalf of Jerry Henry, owner of a family-owned painting business in 
Columbus.
<P>
<P> Jerry Henry was excluded from bidding on OSU's painting and maintenance work under a categorical, 100 
percent minority set-aside program for which Mr. Henry failed to qualify on account of pigment (he's Caucasian).  
OSU's policy was being administered pursuant to Ohio's Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) Act, which establishes a 
15 percent set-aside &quot;goal.&quot;  Unable to find an adequate number of minority vendors in some lines of business, 
OSU made up the &quot;shortfall&quot; by establishing exclusive minority fiefdoms in areas where minority contractors are 
more readily available, including painting and maintenance.
<P>
<P>In March 1996, after a prolonged and pointless effort to defend this policy, OSU agreed to a settlement that, 
in addition to effecting the aforementioned monetary tranfer, prohibits OSU from using &quot;race, color, national 
origin, gender, social or economic diasadvantage, or any other factor other than standard State procurement policies 
and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->

<BR>
practices, in awarding painting contracts.&quot;  (The prohibition on social or economic disadvantage ensures that 
OSU can't resurrect its policy under a &quot;neutral&quot; disguise.)  The court will retain jurisdiction for five years.  Should 
OSU violate the decree during this period, the court may impose &quot;all sanctions and remedies authorized by law or equity.&quot; 
<P>
<P>The settlement followed our motion for summary judgment and a deposition of OSU's designated 
representative--both undertaken by CIR Director Michael A. Carvin, and both proving OSU's utter inability to defend its 
set-asides.  While we remain profoundly grateful to Mr. Carvin for his outstanding contribution, having him conduct 
the depos was massive overkill:  given OSU's position, its representative would have folded under questioning by 
an advocate of modest skills and sophistication, such as a daffodil.  
<P>
<P>Did OSU, Mr. Carvin asked, have any evidence of institutional discrimination, past or present, against 
minority contractors?  No.  Did the state of Ohio possess such evidence?  No.  Did OSU compare its set-asides to the 
availability of minority contractors in a given industry?  No.  Did OSU periodically review its set-aside policies to ensure fairness? 
 No. Did it occur to OSU that the categorical exclusion administered against Mr. Henry might be more unfair 
and extreme than the 15 percent set-aside required by the MBE Act?  No.  Will the set-aside program be terminated 
when its goal of remedying discrimination has been achieved, or will it continue forever?  The latter.  
<P>
<P>Asked, finally, what conceivable justification OSU had for its no-whites-need-apply policy, OSU's rep alleged 
a nationwide conspiracy among paint producers and suppliers to deny blacks access to paint (excerpts reprinted nearby). 
 But that's not a fact; it's affirmative action on acid.  
<P>
<P>The Ohio set-aside fish rots from the head of Republican Governor George V. Voinovich.  Until recently, 
Voinovich professed great fondness for set-asides.  By way of explanation, he pointed to discrimination against his Balkan 
immigrant ancestors--conduct that is lamentable both in its own right and for its failure to impede Voinovich's ascent to 
the pinnacle of Ohio politics.  But we suspect that Voinovich's quota enthusiasm has more to do with the fact that 
some subcontinental Indians have ponied up over $250,000 for his political campaigns.  The Guv rewarded the 
generous donors by cutting them in on the set-aside deals. One might view this as evidence of the dangers of immigration. 
 (&quot;Quotas for Indians?  Let them be 
<I>our</I> Indians!  American Indians First!&quot;)  To us, it's proof of piggishness.
<P>
<P>Ohio has taken pride that post-<I>Henry</I>, the MBE statute is still standing.  Voinovich and the Ohio legislature 
are planning to revise the law so as to steer more money to &quot;economically disadvantaged&quot; businesses, including, 
presumably, Indians and other victims of Voinovich's political shake-downs.  Meanwhile, the State and OSU have vowed 
to defend the MBE set-asides, despite the 
<I>Henry</I> settlement.
<P>
<P>If we can't get rid of the MBE masterplan, we'll shoot the set-asides down one by one, at 368 grand a pop.  
Next time, our office plants will do the depos. 
<P>     
<P>
<P><B>OH BOYCOTT</B>
<P>Under questioning by Michael A. Carvin, Esq., Ohio State University's designated representative and 
principal administrator of its set-aside programs revealed a shocking civil rights violation.
<P>
<P><I>A:  Sometimes I would just put [a contract] out for bid as a set-aside.  Then, as we did our pre-bids and walked 
through the specifications, certain requirements would emerge.  The minority vendors perhaps could not meet certain 
specifications or did not have access to certain products that might be required.
<P>
<P>Q What do you mean that they didn't have access to products?
<P>
<P>A Well, they may not be--they may not have access to products from a manufacturer, that a majority company could 
go out and get from a manufacturer.
<P>
<P>Q Let me start over.  Are there paint manufacturing companies in the United States that refuse to sell paint to minorities?
<P>
<P>A  There were at that time [1988].
<P>
<P>Q Did you know that activity was grossly illegal?
<P>
<P>A No, I didn't know it was illegal. It is stuff that had been going on for a long time.

<H4><EM> Smith, et al., v. Virginia Commonwealth University</EM><BR></H4></CENTER>


<P>Cooperating Counsel:  Charles J. Cooper, David Thompson (Shaw, Pittman, Potts 
&amp; Trowbridge); Bradley Cavedo (Shuford, Rubin &amp; Gibney)
<P>In November 1995, the Fourth Circuit heard <I>en 
banc</I> arguments in <I>Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth 
University</I>, a case that could shape up as CIR's next blockbuster. VCU, which hasn't discriminated against female faculty in its entire 
history, one fine year decided to dole out over $400,000 in salary increases--to women only.  It did so based on a regression 
analysis showing an &quot;unexplained&quot; pay gap between the teaching salaries of men and women on the faculty--provided, mind 
you, that you ignored performance factors such as teaching ability and scholarly publications.  To VCU, though, the gap 
&quot;could only&quot; be the result of sex discrimination, as opposed to the unexamined merit variables.  
<P>
<P>We've long enjoyed our cooperation with the American Association of University Professors:  the AAUP has 
stood firm in the defense on free speech and of robust protections for the accused in sexual harassment proceedings.  For 
example, the AAUP has made a big difference in the Maas affair, and has filed a fine 
<I>amicus</I> brief in<I> Scallet v. Rosenblum</I> (like, 
<I>Smith,</I> a CIR case currently before the Fourth Circuit.  Thus, we report with regret that in 
<I>Smith</I>, the AAUP sided with VCU. 
<P>
<P>Whatever may have made the AAUP lose it in this case, it can't be the merits.  It's true that other universities 
have dished out &quot;gender adjustments&quot; on even shoddier evidence than VCU's, such bribes having become the fashion in 
higher ed.  But this observation goes to the cravenness of public institutions, not to fairness or legality.  
<P>
<P>In a superb oral argument for the plaintiffs, Chuck Cooper showed that there are perfectly innocent explanations 
for the pay &quot;gap&quot; at VCU even 
<I>before</I> you get around to the merit business--for instance, the greater willingness of 
male faculty to accept higher-paying administrative positions.To award gender-based pay raises under such circumstances 
is rank sex discrimination, which is unlawful under Title VII.  Or so we think.

<H3>THERE THEY GO AGAIN </H3>
<H4><EM>Lamprecht v. Federal Communications Commission </EM><BR></H4></CENTER>
<P>Cooperating Counsel:  R. Hewitt Pate (Hunton &amp; Williams)
<P>Tom Lamprecht bears the distinction of being a permanent CIR client, having been with us since the day we hung 
out our shingle seven years ago.  
<P>
<P>In 1988, the FCC, under its then-extant gender preference scheme, denied Lamprecht's application for a 
broadcast license for a station in Frederick, Maryland, and instead handed it to a female applicant, a certain Ms. Marmet.  
(Ms. Marmet's lawyers are perennial players in the FCC's race and gender racket, a fact that bears on the tortured history of 
this case.)  We appealed.  In then-Judge Thomas' last decision on the court, the D.C. Circuit declared the FCC's gender 
preferences unconstitutional.  
<P>
<P>On remand, the FCC again awarded the license to Ms. Marmet, having conveniently re-arranged its scoring factors 
to reach this pre-determined result.  While we were appealing this decision as patently arbitrary and capricious, the 
D.C. Circuit, in <I>Bechtel v. FCC</I> (1993), junked the FCC's competitive licensing scheme and told the Commission to come up 
with regs that bear some semblance to rationality.  Our appeal was remanded for further consideration in light of 
<I>Bechtel</I>.
<P>     
<P>To this day, the FCC has failed to come up with new regs.  The principal hang-up, it appears, is that the FCC 
remains fond of race and gender preferences but can't find a way to make them constitutional under binding law and 
precedent, including the Supreme Court's 1995 
<I>Adarand</I> decision.
<P>
<P>In December 1995, despite our pending appeal and the lack of valid regs, the FCC staff granted Ms. Marmet's 
request to transfer the license to &quot;her&quot; station, which she has been running under an operating permit while the 
<I>Lamprecht</I> controversy has been droning on.  The staff conveniently neglected to inform Mr. Lamprecht and his attorneys of this decision.
<P>
<P>In February, we asked the FCC to reverse its decision on the license transfer.  Should this prove unavailing, 
we'll go back to the D.C. Circuit.

<H3>MINGLE-RANDEL WRANGLE</H3>
<H4><EM>James B. Maas v. Cornell University </EM><BR></H4></CENTER>

<P>Cooperating Counsel:  David A. Stoll, Esq.
<P>
<P>In January, the New York Supreme Court in Tompkins County heard oral arguments on Cornell's motion 
to dismiss our $1.5 million lawsuit on behalf of psychology professor James B. Maas, one of Cornell's most 
distinguished faculty members and most beloved teachers.  No word from the court yet, but there have been other developments 
of note.
<P>
<P>In 1994, four female former students alleged that Maas was excessively &quot;affectionate&quot; and &quot;friendly.&quot;  This 
&quot;harassment&quot;--social hugs and kisses, invitations to family birthday parties, and small gifts--occurred in front of 
Maas's wife or other third parties.  Little of it was even arguably of a sexual nature.  Virtually all of it was, by all 
appearances, welcomed and appreciated at the time.
<P>
<P>Maas was sentenced by the so-called Professional Ethics Committee (PEC) of Cornell's College of Arts &amp; 
Sciences.  The PEC's procedures were designed to make women &quot;comfortable&quot; to come forward and to &quot;level the 
playing field&quot; between the impotent accusers and the omnipotent accused.  Unfortunately, due process appears to be one 
of the things that makes the process &quot;uncomfortable&quot; for complainants, and the PEC lacked even the most 
elementary procedural protections for the accused.  For instance, Maas was barred from questioning the complainants.  
Participants in the ostensibly confidential process leaked the complaints and the prosecutor's &quot;findings&quot; to the 
<I>Cornell Daily Sun</I>, with predictably deleterious consequences to Maas's reputation.  And there were no rules of evidence or 
relevance.  Consequently, the lack of proof for any particular charge posed no obstacle to a guilty verdict:  the 
PEC concluded that Maas's &quot;inappropriate&quot; behavior 
&quot;<I>in effect</I> ... constituted sexual harassment.&quot;  Similarly, the PEC 
found that a single, six-year-old allegation of breast touching (which Maas fiercely denies) was 
<I>unproven</I>, but nonetheless &quot;especially egregious&quot; and suggestive of &quot;a pattern over time.&quot;  
<P>
<P>Then-still-Dean Don Randel, the Pontius Pilate of the Maas case, declared himself powerless to review the 
PEC's findings (&quot;Facts?  What are those?&quot;), only to turn around and declare the PEC's findings and the procedures 
just dandy.  In other words, Randel told the mob it should feel free to hang Jim Maas--and washed his hands.  In 
language later published in a Cornell press release, Randel observed that &quot;Maas was not found to have had, or sought, 
an intimate sexual relationship with any of his students nor to have engaged in the physically abusive behavior&quot; 
but nonetheless pronounced Maas guilty of the offense, whatever it may have been.
<P>
<P>Lately, though, Jim Maas has been celebrating a personal pentecost of sorts.  Doubters have examined his 
scars, and found that something went terribly wrong.  And the chorus of opposition to the administration's position on 
sexual harassment procedures, limited only a year ago to Cornell's two-and-a-half conservative faculty members, now 
includes most of the faculty and even some self-proclaimed anarcho-feminists who so often speak in strange tongues.  
<P>
<P>Don Randel deserves considerable credit for this revolt.  Only after months of dithering did he obey a 
faculty resolution and appoint a faculty committee (under the Chairpersonship of Prof. Henry Shue) to look into what 
went wrong and why with the PEC procedures.  Then, with uncharacteristic promptness, Randel and Cornell Counsel 
James Mingle sprung a draft of new, campus-wide sexual harassment procedures on the barely constituted Shue 
Committee and on the startled Cornell community, declaring that the new procedures would go into effect shortly.  
<P>
<P>Above Cayuga's waters, the core of the Randel/Mingle draft quickly became known as the &quot;sentence first, 
hearing later&quot; procedure:  the accused can demand a hearing only after he's been found guilty of sexual harassment, on 
the theory that the proceeding that led to the verdict was merely &quot;investigative.&quot;  This brilliant idea is consistent 
with Cornell's position in the pending <I>Maas</I> case--to wit, that the PEC gave Maas more procedures than he was entitled 
to, since he was entitled to none.  It's also consistent with the procedures at the University of Virginia, where Mingle 
was General Counsel before coming to Cornell. 
<P>
<P>(In another maneuver, Mingle is resisting our request for documents on past sexual harassment proceedings 
at Cornell's statutory colleges.  He insists that Cornell's public colleges aren't subject to New York open records 
laws since they aren't really public but operated with state money under a contract with the state, for what this distinction 
is worth.  We have filed suit to obtain the documents, and we can't wait to see what it is Cornell doesn't want us to know.)
<P>
<P>The Mingle/Randel draft caused consternation and alarm all around.  The American Association of 
University Professors criticized it as wholly inconsistent with the AAUP's guidelines and basic principles of academic due process. 
 Professor Mary Beth Norton, architect of the PEC procedures, denounced attempts to undermine faculty 
self-governance on sexual harassment matters in an article in the 
<I>Chronicle of Higher Education</I>.  In a letter to Randel, 29 of 
the Law School's 34 faculty members took strong exception to any procedures under which &quot;the trial follows the hanging.&quot; 
 Randel made known that the draft wasn't really a serious proposal but merely the biggest trial balloon since 
the Hindenburg in the end, at last.
<P>     
<P>In March, the Shue Committee published its findings--which, to some extent, 
<I>we</I> could have written.  The Committee stressed the imperative need for a right to face and cross-examine one's accusers, statutes of limitations, 
an explicit presumption of innocence, specific charges and findings, protection of confidentiality, rules of evidence, 
and numerous other protections Jim Maas demanded but never received.  In a pointed rejection of the PEC's verdict in 
the <I>Maas</I> case, the Shue Committee stressed that &quot;there is no such thing as 'in effect ... sexual harassment,'&quot; this being 
&quot;too much of a 'fudge phrase' to be appropiate in a finding on which sanctions are based.&quot; 
<P>
<P>At long last, the Mingle-Randel tag team circulated a revised draft of new procedures.  While still far 
from perfect, the new draft is at least partially consistent with the AAUP's guidelines and the Shue Committee's 
report--and diametrically opposed to the position Cornell continues to defend in court.  We suppose that's progress. 
<P>
<P>We can't help but wonder, though, what ordinary corporations--which are accountable to shareholders--would 
do to an officer who sits by as one of the institution's most valued and productive employees gets smeared in the 
national press; forces the employee to file a highly publicized and, for the institution, embarassing lawsuit; and incites a 
palace revolution among the workforce.  
<P>
<P>Cornell, of course, didn't ding Don Randel; it made him provost.  This would be none of our business, were it 
not for the fact that Randel now has a huge personal stake in preventing an acceptable agreement between Jim Maas 
and Cornell:  any such agreement would be an admission that things went terribly wrong in the 
<I>Maas</I> case--and on Randel's watch.  But if Randel wants to fight the Maas case to the bitter end, we're ready.
<P>

<H3>HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>Soon to be published by the American Enterprise Institute: Michael Greve's monograph on 
<B>The Demise of Environmentalism in American 
Law</B>.  Seemingly far removed from CIR's ordinary concerns, this excellent tome actually 
sheds light on the strange logic of the &quot;hostile environment&quot; claims CIR has opposed so long and adamantly:  just as the 
Endangered Species Act permits the piping plover to allege discomfort over the property owner's insistence on raking his 
beach, so members of the endangered female species may now complain under civil rights law about unwanted compliments 
and pictures of the Naked Maya.  
<P>
<P>The book isn't out quite yet.  But some day, our prints will come.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, Greve peddled portions of the book to assorted audiences.  On February 29, he debated 
environmental racism with Professor Sherilyn Ifill at an event co-sponsored by the 
<B>University of Maryland Law School</B>'s Federalist 
Society, Environmental Law Society, and Black Law Students Association.  Greve spoke out against racism and for the 
environment.
<P>
<P>Three months earlier, at the invitation of the 
<B>Goldwater Institute</B> and the <B>Federalist 
Society</B>, Greve addressed environmental issue at a conference on judicial mandates.  He spoke out against such mandates unless they're issued for 
CIR clients.  Greve was fortunate to share the panel with Professors Chris Stone and Richard Lazarus and Akin, Gump's 
Roger Marzulla--and fortunater still to complete a full round of golf without encountering Judge Randolph, who wields 
five-irons Mingle
and gavels to humiliating effect.  The proceedings of the conference will appear in the 
<I>Arizona State Law Journal</I>.
<P>
<P>On February 12, Greve addressed affirmative action at Stetson College's 16th 
<B>Annual Conference on Law and Higher 
Education</B>.  Among the 500-plus lawyers, educators, and administrators with unconstitutional job titles 
(<I>e.g.</I>, Associate Dean for Affirmative Action), Greve's confident and accurate prediction of a CIR victory in the 
then-still-pending <I>Hopwood</I> case produced hysteria; his suggestion that universities could keep the race game going by  perjury and 
the shredding of evidence was greeted with emphatic approval.
<P>
<P>Way back in November 1995, Greve debated Ralph Neas on affirmative action before the 
<B>Allegheny County Bar Association</B> in Pittsburgh.  Mr. Neas said that anti-preference legislation would not and should not go anywhere in 
Congress because the Republicans would realize that most of the benefits of such programs go to their wives and daughters, 
as opposed to disenfranchised minorities.  With this pro, Greve rested his con.
<P>
<P>Greve also debated Professor Margaret Montoya on civil rights at the 
<B>University of New Mexico Law School</B> (March 6), before the 
<B>New York Bar Association</B> (April 16), and at 
<B>St. Thomas Law School</B> in Miami (April 18).
<P>
<P>On February 17, Greve spoke at the <B>University of 
Minnesota</B> on the subject of academic freedom, at the invitation 
of the <B>Minnesota Students' Association</B> and the 
<B>Minnesota Association of Scholars</B>.  And on May 5, Greve will appear on 
a panel with Alan Kors (University of Pennsylvania) and Nadine Strossen at the 
<B>National Association of Scholars</B>' Annual Conference in Washington, D.C.  The topic is Free Speech and Higher Education.  Greve will argue that there's no 
good argument against free speech, except perhaps what now passes for higher education.

<P>
<P>We have settled our reverse discrimination lawsuit on behalf of &quot;Michelle Doe,&quot; a 14-year-old girl from 
Corpus Christi.  As reported, Michelle applied to an environmental study program called &quot;Planet Earth,&quot; a summer study 
camp financed in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and administered by a University Outreach Program 
sponsored by Texas A &amp; M University.  Being Caucasian, Michelle was denied admission because the NSF's funding 
guidelines specified that Planet Earth was to be reserved for selected minorities.
<P>
<P>The defendants have agreed to settle the case for $20,000 in damages and fees.  They have also promised not 
to discriminate in the future.  The feds will take steps to ensure that summer science camps that discriminate on the basis 
of race, sex etc. will no longer receive NSF funding.  Until 1999, the NSF will submit its program brochures to CIR 
for inspection and compliance review. 
<P>
<P>If this case serves as a precedent, we'll soon oversee the entire federal government:  a slew of departments 
and agencies, from Defense to Energy to Agriculture to the EPA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), still 
fund minorities only programs. 
<P>
<P>How do we know this?  Why, having been denied admission to Planet Earth, Michelle cast about for another 
summer program and stumbled upon a nifty six-week science apprenticeship program for high school students.  Run, like 
Planet Earth, by Texas A &amp; M, the program involves lab work in biochemistry.  It pays room and board scholarships, as well as 
a stipend.  The apprenticeship program is partially funded by the USDA and NIH.
<P>     
<P>This time around, Michelle was told she shouldn't even bother to apply:  the summer apprenticeship program 
is reserved for applicants who can identify themselves as Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native, or 
Pacific Islander/Asian. We're cloning our first 
<I>Doe</I> complaint as we speak.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, in Delaware, the United States Department of Justice is participating in the so-called Redding 
Fellowship, a summer clerkship program for first-year law students.  Run by the Delaware Bar Association, the program 
pays participants $600 per week for eleven weeks of work with various state and federal agencies and private law firms, plus 
a $2,000 payment upon successful completion.  Eligibility for the program is limited to members of selected minorities.  
<P>
<P>The program's namesake, Louis L. Redding, is familiar with such restrictions:  the first black (and highly 
distinguished) member of the Delaware Bar, he was the plaintiff's counsel in 
<I>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority</I>, an 
important 1961 civil rights case in which the Supreme Court ruled against the race-based exclusion of black customers from 
lunch counters.  As far as we're concerned, these games don't cease to be odious when they're being played 35 years later and 
in reverse.
<P>
<P>Yes, the Delaware Bar once discriminated against Blacks.  But this nefarious past fails to explain how Asians 
and Hispanics made it into the Redding program; why the program is targeted at law students who are not from Delaware; 
and why the feds think they can participate in a program that's plainly unlawful.  The Redding program doesn't even pretend 
to interest minority youngsters in the practice of law.  At best, it's an attempt to induce minorities to practice law in 
Delaware rather than someplace else; at worst, it's PC on autopilot.
<P> 
<P>We are challenging the program on behalf of three unsuccessful Caucasian applicants.  Something tells us the 
case won't go to trial.

<P>CIR's merry band of warriors increased in strength and numbers.  On April 1, 
<B>Hans Bader</B> (Harvard Law School, Class of '94), joined CIR as Associate Counsel and third full-time litigator.  
<B>Kipp Coddington</B>, formerly of the firm of Ropes &amp; Gray, is CIR's new Counsel and Director of Communications; he will assume his new position on May 1.
<P>
<P>In December 1995, <B>Seung Baik</B> finished his internship with CIR, under the auspices of Cornell University's 
Washington program.  In January, <B>Curt Levey</B> (Harvard Law School, Class of '98) spent a one-month, Harvard-paid 
clerkship with CIR.    <B>Robert Alt</B>, a student in political science at Azusa Pacific University, has been spending part of 
his Semester-in-Washington as a research assistant with Judge Robert Bork and is now with CIR.
<P>
<P>Over the summer, we'll be joined by <B>John 
Sheahan</B> (Chicago Law School) and by <B>Howard 
Nielson</B> (Chicago Law School).  Mr. Nielson's clerkship will be paid by the firm of

<P><P><B>IN OTHER CASES</B>
<P>
<P>Ron Reisner's reverse discrimination lawsuit against John Jay College is proceeding apace.  The case arises 
over John Jay's repeated failure to appoint Reisner to a tenure-track faculty position, despite his excellent credentials 
and equally excellent faculty evaluations.  Memos and other materials obtained through discovery show that John 
Jay refused to hire Reisner because he isn't diverse but Caucasian.  The College administration viewed the faculty's 
painstaking search and evaluation process, under whose rules Reisner should and would have been hired, as a charade 
to disguise a minorities-only hiring policy.  The process was 
<I>supposed</I> to be a joke, and Reisner was supposed to be 
the clown in the diversity circus.  We predict he'll have the last laugh.
<P>
<P>CIR star litigator Michael Rosman schlepped to California on our First Amendment lawsuit on behalf of 
three Berkeley residents who were &quot;investigated&quot; for almost a full year by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.  Our clients ran a neighborhood association to oppose, through constitutionally protected speaking and 
petitioning, the conversion of a local motel for use by homeless, severely dysfunctional residents.  So HUD went 
after them, on the theory that peaceful opposition to HUD-favored housing projects violates the Fair Housing Act.  
HUD demanded our clients' membership lists, copies of newspaper articles and letters, and transcripts of public meetings.  
<P>
<P>In a January 5 decision, U.S. District Judge Patel denied the defendants' motion to dismiss our damage 
claims, calling HUD's argument that <I>no</I> investigation could run afoul of the First Amendment &quot;striking in its audacity.&quot;  
Mr. Rosman, on his West Coast trip, presented our clients' demand for injunctive relief, which is 
<I>sub judice</I>.  
<HR>
<P>In a long-running dispute, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, affectionately known as &quot;FAM 
YOU,&quot; disciplined assistant professor and CIR client Gerald Gee for a single controversial remark in his Public 
Relations class.  (The remark contained a racial epithet, but was in no way calculated to insult.)  When six students 
complained, characterizing the remark as &quot;derogatory,&quot; &quot;unethical,&quot; and &quot;most importantly, inappropriate,&quot; FAMU declared 
Gee guilty of &quot;racial harassment&quot; and imposed a two-week suspension.  After a court hearing on our motion for a 
preliminary injunction, FAMU agreed to revoke what remained of Gee's suspension.  We have filed for partial 
summary judgment.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>A TALE OF TWO BUDGETS</B></FONT><BR><B> By Tom McClintock</B></P>





"[The Governor] was aided in his [budget] by the strength of California's economy, which gave him more new money to distribute than he had a year ago," reported one major newspaper.  Education was a big winner, said the state Finance Director, simply reflecting "that the budget is roomier this yearand that the Governor will devote more money to education whenever he can." There were expressions of bi-partisan support, with the Senate Democratic leader calling the budget "relatively generous in terms of funding for the status quo."<P>
Again of the state budget, a major newspaper said, "[it is] a big-spending document made possible by rising revenues from the state's recovering economy." Another crowed, "The biggest winnerwas--as it should have been--education." More expressions of bi-partisan support heard. Said the Assembly Democratic leader, "When you look at this budget from the standpoint of working men and women, seniors and children, this budget does the best we can for them."<P>

Same show. Different years. The first observations were made eight years ago when George Deukmejian unveiled his 1988 spending plan; the second were made this week, when California's 1996 state budget was adopted. We have heard this song before.<P>

1987 and 1988 were fat years for Sacramento's budget-writers. In 1987, surging revenues--and polticians' eagerness to spend them--pushed the budget over the state's maximum spending limit for the first and only time. In 1988, state expenditures exploded 10.3 percent in a single year. A billion dollars of new funds for education produced a truce in the feud between Deukmejian and state schools superintendent Bill Honig (although test scores continued to decline).<P>

Everyone but a few conservative malcontents were effusive in praise for their mutual munificence. Sighed one Republican assemblyman as he surrendered to temptation, "I guess we'd better spend all this new money before the big spenders get hold of it."<P>

But in mid-1988, the economy began to turn downward, and within a year red ink was seeping onto the state's ledgers.<P>

California's experience was typical of the states that shopped til they dropped in the 1980's. Writing for the Cato Institute in 1991, budget analyst Stephen Moore summarized the fiscal wreckage of California and other high-spending states with words which should be haunting in 1996: "With few exceptions the states with the most severe deficits today are those that saw their economies and tax revenues grow rapidly over the past decade, but allowed spending to grow even faster."<P>

The growth of California spending, for example, had outpaced the national average by 15 percent during the 1980's. Beneath the "Iron Duke's" dour exterior, it turns out, there beat the heart of a party animal.<P>

According to Moore's study, the frugal states that had restrained their growth in the 1980's as a whole avoided crippling tax increases and massive budget deficits when boom turned to bust. Many ran surpluses.<P>

California, of course, was not one of them. As recession ravaged revenues could no longer maintain the bureaucracies in the style to which they had grown accustomed, lawmakers attempted to fill the widening budget gaps with unprecedented tax increases and borrowing. The record-shattering 1991 tax hike plunged the state's economy from recession to near-depression, while California's total debt skyrocketed from $18.2 billion to $28.6 billion between 1990 and 1994.<P>

Deukmejian at least maintained a three percent reserve until the last year of his administration, without which the state's fiscal plight would have been even worse. This year's budget provides about one third of that cushion.<P>

California's 1996 budget repeats the 1988 experience in almost every detail. State spending will leap nine percent in a single bound, and Sacramento's solons have been able to appease every bureaucrat in town. Three billion dollars more will go to California's public school system this year, although serious proposals to change performance incentives were abandoned.<P>

The old parable of the ant who stores a surplus in the summer to endure the winter while his cousin the grasshopper first feasts then starves is as true for governments as it is for families and businesses. Frugality in good years softens the bitter choices in the lean ones.<P>

Ironically, an administration which has grappled for six years with the harsh consequences of profligacy now sets in motion the same cycle for its successor when the economy turns downward again.<P>

It's the same old song, a familiar California medley: "Let the Good Times Roll," followed by "The Party's Over."<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>THE HIGH COST OF RACIAL AND GENDER PREFERENCES</B></FONT><BR><B> By Tom McClintock</B></P>



It is ironic that one of the hottest political controversies today revolves around an issue which the nation's founders declared a "self-evident" truth 11 generations ago: "that all men are created equal." <P>
The debate over the racial preferences inherent in modern "affirmative action" programs ultimately will turn on differing notions of justice and equality before the law. But there is a secondary issue which should also be noted. When arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. Sometimes they are the direct costs of preferential programs. More often, they are the indirect costs of inflated prices, bureaucratic delays, and overall inefficiencies which are inescapable consequences of restricting competition. <P>
Racial and gender quotas now permeate virtually every aspect of California's government, including the awarding of state contracts, the hiring and promotion of state employees, the admission of students to the state's universities, and the appropriation of funds for school children. These laws cost California taxpayers and consumers at least $343 million annually, and quite probably several times this amount. <P>
The direct cost to state government alone for administering and implementing race and gender based programs exceeds $155 million each year. In virtually every office of California's bureaucracies, coordinators are paid to shuffle mountains of paperwork to administer racial and gender preferences. In response to a recent inquiry from Governor Pete Wilson, agencies which account for less than half of state spending estimated their administrative costs for racial and gender programs to be $12.8 million.  <P>
According to the Legislative Analyst, $47 million is spent annually for race-based programs in the state's two university systems and another $10 million in the public schools and community colleges. (According to other studies, the cost to the universities could be as high as $274 million annually). $82 million is spent annually on "voluntary desegregation" programs in the schools, even though no finding of past racial discrimination has been made. <P>
There are also significant indirect costs. California state government requires that fully one fifth of all state contracts must be set aside for companies owned by specific racial groups or women. As the bidding pool is reduced, prices rise, and California taxpayers must pay between $41 million and $48 million due to restricted competition. <P>
Another indirect expense is the cost of delays in awarding contracts because of the complexity of complying with quotas. In response to a survey by the Construction Industry Research Board in 1986, 78 percent of contractors reported delays in awarding affirmative action contracts. Furthermore, according to the Department of General Services, the time for submitting bids has increased an average of four weeks to allow bidders time to comply with these requirements. These delays cost taxpayers at least $15 million annually. <P>
Under this panoply of racial and gender laws, any business which wants to bid for a state contract must go to extraordinary lengths to recruit minority and woman businesses, including advertising in minority trade publications and meticulously documenting their recruitment efforts. According to the state's Little Hoover Commission, this costs each bidder an average of $1,000 per contract, or $240 million annually. Who pays? Ultimately, consumers pay through higher prices, taxpayers through higher government costs, employees through lower wages, and investors through lower earnings. <P>
Other costs are impossible to estimate. Perhaps the largest(and the most tragic(is the opportunity cost to society of racially discriminatory practices which divert resources from their most productive use. If a highly qualified young woman is denied admittance to the UCLA School of Medicine solely because of her Asian ancestry, how much have we detracted from the potential safety and prosperity of our society? <P>
The price tag for official discrimination in California runs from a low of $343 million to more than $677 million, strictly to maintain a system of racial and gender discrimination in state law. But this doesn't tell the whole story. There are a number of bureaucracies and businesses for which cost information is not readily available and some costs are simply incalculable. Finally, these estimates are for California state government only; they do not account for similar costs incurred by cities, counties and special districts, which would easily double the numbers. <P>
Official discrimination inflicts irreconcilable damage upon the founding principles of the nation; it poisons the social tolerance which is a necessary condition of a free people; it undermines respect for the law and for governmental institutions. These are social costs, and they are astronomical.   <P>
But it also costs money. A lot of it. <P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Diversity is Good--Discrimination Isn't</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#E6E8EA" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#008080" ALINK=000080>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>DIVERSITY IS GOOD--DISCRIMINATION ISN'T</B></FONT><BR><B>By Paul Marshall</B></P>

Governments, universities and corporations are caught up in the same "diversity" craze. They routinely defend discrimination by relying on Justice Powell's commendation of "exposure...to students as diverse as this nation of many peoples" in the 1978 Supreme Court Bakke case.  <P>
Of course, as Shelby Steele has said, "No one really knows what diversity means." But that has not dampened the enthusiasm. Currently, three-quarters of the 50 largest U.S. firms have "Diversity Managers." The federal government grades for "promoting diversity" on its management appraisals. The San Francisco School Board adjusts admissions to produce "value-added diversity."<P>
The Clinton Administration defends this with monotonous regularity. On May 24, it urged the Supreme Court to overturn Texas vs. Hopwood, which outlaws discriminatory university admissions, on the grounds of "achieving meaningful educational diversity." 
However, the Clinton Administration has a narrow view of diversity. Hopwood has a blue-collar background, is married to a serviceman, raising a disabled child, and was too poor to take up a partial scholarship to Princeton. The Appeals Court in Hopwood said she "would bring a different perspective to the law school." <P>
For the administration, this is the wrong kind of difference. They want the law school to be able to exclude her because of racial quotas.  <P>
This plea for discrimination causes many conservatives to reject diversity entirely. That would be a mistake, since genuine diversity is marvelous. One of the wonderful things about America is that people have come here from all over the world. Our lives can be enriched by knowing men and women with different views and histories. At a more mundane level, imagine how boring life would be if we were all Puritans and could eat only English food. <P>
The problem is not real diversity, but the use of discrimination in service of a counterfeit "diversity." Real diversity grows when free and equal people make choices about their lives without government control or manipulation. Quotas and discrimination can never produce real variety. They only enforce an administrator's view of who people are and what they should do and think. The result is conformity.<P>
Our universities, corporations, politics and media don't need imposed sameness. In a country rent by "culture wars," we need the challenge of differing and well-formed ideas.
But our universities, are remarkably alike. In the humanities and social sciences, the faculty are routinely secular and liberal. What is desperately required is not more ethnically and sexually "diverse" liberal clones, but people with alternate political, cultural and religious views. <P>
Yet people with religious faith,for example,are often marginalized. Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, testified before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that he would advise evangelical Christians looking for a career in the media to remove hints of their faith from their resume. "I would say leave it off, just as twenty years ago, if you were a member of a gay rights organization, I would have said leave it off."<P>
Commissioner Robert George noted that religion "doesn't seem to be treated as an issue in diversity, even among people...[responsible] for promoting diversity within their organizations." <P>
Instead, we are left with the dubious proposition that there is something called a "woman's voice" or a "black voice." But women who are conservative Catholics are not well represented by women who are radical feminists, and vice versa. Nor are African-American Pentecostals well represented by secular liberals. <P>
The solution is not some new, approved religious quota. This would only add to the disease. Individual believers are no more reducible than anyone else to a group identity. Instead we need free exchange and competition in place of liberal bias.<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court recently drove this point home. On June 13, in Bush vs. Vera and Shore vs. Hunt, it struck down bizarrely-shaped, racially-gerrymandered voting districts. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asserted, in the major opinion, that such "districts cause constitutional harm insofar as they convey the message that political identity is, or should be, predominantly racial." <P>
Real diversity is good. Discrimination isn't. As O'Connor said, government shouldn't encourage the assumption "that people will vote or think" according to skin color.<P>

President Clinton said that he will dispatch FBI agents to Saudi Arabia to help in the investigation into who committed the terrorist act, and he said he would "make sure that those responsible for this hideous act are brought to justice." <P>

That was seven months ago, last November 13, when a terrorist attack killed five Americans and injured 60 others in Saudi Arabia.<P>

On June 25, 1996, after it was reported that another bomb blast killed 19 Americans and injured 105 more in Saudi Arabia, President Clinton said that he will dispatch FBI agents to Saudi Arabia to help in the investigation to find out who committed the terrorist act and he said "those who did it must be brought to justice."<P>

Forget it.<P>

The Saudis captured and beheaded four terrorists who might have been involved in last November's attack, but it resulted in little if any deterrence. If we are serious about stopping terrorism against Americans we must fight terrorism as we fight a war. When a hand-grenade lands in a foxhole in a battle, there is no attempt to find who threw it because it's irrelevant. The enemy must be attacked as a whole.<P>

When President Franklin Roosevelt requested a declaration of war against the Empire of Japan, he did not say, "Yesterday we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, and we are going to do everything possible to find out who those individual pilots, navigators, and bombardiers were, and bring them to justice." That would have been a guarantee that we would have lost the war. Those individuals were nothing more than tools of a larger enemy.<P>

The larger enemy today is the Nation of Terrorism. It is irrelevant if an individual group responsible for a particular attack is called "The Movement for Islamic Change" or "The Tigers of the Gulf" or some other name. Upon which terrorist group should we retaliate? Any of them.<P>

President Clinton should call a Joint Session of the Congress to request a declaration of war against terrorism, and "that from this day forward, the United States of America will regard terrorism as a sovereign state--as a nation in itself. The Nation of Terrorism is a chain of bases, training camps, safe houses, and other facilities that dot portions of the map of the world, going into and out of other sovereign states. The non-contiguous configuration that the Nation of Terrorism has enjoyed has been a shield, since its citizens-by-choice have assumed that they would always be regarded as part of other sovereign states that surrounded them. That shield must be a thing of the past.<P>

"I am not requesting a declaration of war against Iran or Iraq or Libya or Syria or Cuba or North Korea or Sudan, but against the bases of terrorism within those countries and other countries, as long as those governments permit such bases to exist within their borders.<P>

"As Commander in Chief, I will see to it that if any American is terrorized--indeed, if one hair on the head of an American is touched in hostility--there will be an immediate retaliation by the Government of the United States of America. Our military will be directed to strike at an unannounced terrorist target we think appropriate within the archipelago of 'islands' that have been built and inhabited within the existing borders of other sovereign states.<P>

"This will be a clear edict that we are no longer searching for individual terrorists alone when we can find them, but instead, we are at war against Terrorism and we have found it.<P>

"We must recognize that the Nation of Terrorism has already declared war against the United States and our nation will not allow that to continue.<P>

"If terrorists feel that our retaliatory policy puts them at risk of being targeted for individual acts of terrorism that they did not commit, there is only one option for their future safety: get out of the terrorism business.<P>

"My fellow Americans, our policy of searching is done. A new policy of swift and sure and severe retaliation against the Nation of Terrorism will be in immediate effect after you in the Congress make such a formal declaration. Let that declaration be a warning, the only warning to be given, that the citizens of the United States are to be secure against violence on their person wherever they travel throughout the world.
"Thank you and goodnight."<P>

 INDEPENDENCE DAY</B></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><B>By Charles R. Kesler</B></P>

As the Fourth of July approaches, Americans can look forward once again to the rockets' red glare and bombs bursting in air, not to mention some tasty burgers and hotdogs. But the nation's 220th birthday is also an occasion to look back on the changes in American politics since the glory days of the Revolution.<P>
Americans still believe, as the Declaration of Independence proclaimed, that the purpose of government is "to secure these rights," but our understanding of what those rights are has shifted so dramatically that we may speak of two distinct eras in our politics--the era of natural rights and the era of entitlement rights.<P>
In 1776, America claimed its independence on the basis of certain "unalienable rights." Jefferson elsewhere called these "natural rights" or "the rights of man," meaning that human beings received them from nature--or from "nature's God"--and that they were prior to government and even to society. <P>
As Jefferson put it in his last letter, written shortly before July 4, 1826, the Declaration meant to show that "the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God." On the contrary, all men were created equal, and their Creator intended that this equality of rights be respected by all merely human governments.<P>
Government's job was to secure our rights for us better than we could on our own. The Founding Fathers disagreed among themselves as to how extensive the resulting governmental powers had to be, but these were disagreements about means, not ends. However great the national government's powers needed  to be, no one doubted that its proper purposes were limited to a few great objects.<P>
Alexander Hamilton specified them as "commerce, finance, negotiation, and war," though to his mind they also comprehended "implied powers" sufficient to allow for a national bank, the encouragement of manufactures, and related "internal improvements." 
Jefferson's list was even shorter. In his First Inaugural Address, after enumerating the blessings that made the Americans "a happy and prosperous people," he drew attention to "one thing more" that was "the sum of good government" and would "close the circle of our felicities"; namely, "a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned."<P>
Today, however, most of American politics revolves around new kinds of rights, which in turn have called into being new purposes and institutions of government. The Constitution of 1787 is still with us, of course, but it has been overlaid by what Franklin D. Roosevelt once called "an economic constitutional order" based on a new "economic Bill of Rights." These rights are familiar to us as welfare rights or "entitlements," and include everything from Social Security and unemployment benefits to Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, and even certain kinks of affirmative action programs.<P>
These new rights are the very opposite of natural rights, insofar as natural rights precede--and therefore limit--all just government. The new social and economic rights flow <I>from</I> government. They are promises made by the government to the citizenry or to particular classes of citizens, designed generally to remedy their neediness or to satisfy their material wants. <P>
At the heart of today's social and economic rights is the notion that human dignity demands that society, acting through government, supply the defects of human nature. Rather than obeying or acting responsibly towards nature, as the Founders urged, the new rights attempt to overcome it. Health care, nutrition care, jobs, unemployment insurance, and old age benefits are not gifts of nature in the sense that, say, life and liberty are; we have no natural right to them, and hence Jefferson did not consider it the task of government to try to secure them for us. That was up to our own "industry and improvement," as he said.<P>
Of course, Jefferson would have agreed that jobs and proper health care are good things; he would have denied only that they were <I>rights</I>. For if they were rights, then it must be the duty of one's fellow citizens to supply them-and in principle, to remedy all the needs and wants of human nature. Since human desires are infinite, however, this would be a prescription for endless obligation, for a comprehensive servitude that would swallow up all freedom and individual responsibility. <P>
	This problem was apparent to the champions of the new kinds of rights. But statesmen like Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt argued that social and economic rights were necessary to relieve a new form of oppression that had emerged in American society after the Civil War and Reconstruction. The new oppressors were the large corporations and trusts that concentrated unprecedented wealth and political power in the hands of a few. <P>
Under these unprecedented conditions, the government had to intervene in order to restore economic opportunity for the little guy and to protect the working man's right to the fruits of his own labor. This economic analysis was dubious; and even if true, did not necessarily point to a revolution in the functions of government. But Wilson and Roosevelt insisted that new kinds of rights had to be added to the old forms of civil and natural rights--in order to protect American individualism from a threat the Founding Fathers could not have foreseen.<P>
In a crucial respect, however, the addition of social and economic rights did more than just pragmatically solve a novel problem: it promised to lift the nation to a higher moral plane. Wilson called this "the new freedom," meaning that it was not only different from the old but better, because it was supposedly less selfish. The bureaucrats who would be in charge of distributing benefits and opportunities to the people were supposed to be the least selfish of all, and their sense of disinterested moral superiority eventually set the tone of the era of entitlements: the condescension of governmental elites to the people they were presumably serving.<P>
Because they were "progressive" (not natural and unchangeable), the new rights could be implemented gradually and adapted constantly to the nation's changing economic and social conditions. The "economic constitutional order" was not implemented all at once, as in a political founding, but in stages, beginning modestly in the Progressive Era and accelerating in the New Deal and Great Society periods. <P>
Although presented as incremental reforms, the new agencies and departments created to carry out the new agenda were soon acknowledged to be so distinctive, so different in kind from the legislative, executive, and judicial functions of traditional American government, that they acquired a new name. Thus today we speak of "the welfare state," as though a new state or new form of government had been added to the one established by the Constitution.<P>
The chief business of the welfare state is to secure our new rights. This task involves, among other things, the large-scale redistribution of income through federal entitlement programs. Roosevelt, who launched the first and still most successful of these entitlements, defended them as affordable and just; but today, increasingly, they seem to be neither.<P>
Roosevelt claimed, even in the midst of the Great Depression, that American capitalism was phenomenally productive, that it was capable of producing "plenty" and that the redistribution of its "surplus" (a modest and fairly painless goal) was all that the welfare state required. But nowadays, the cost of American government, federal and state, exceeds 40 percent of the national income; and even at that high level, the federal budget is chronically unbalanced and all of the major entitlement programs, including Social Security, face impending bankruptcy in the next century. What's more, few Americans think they are undertaxed.<P>
Still, it proves difficult to cut or constrain entitlement spending because the second of Roosevelt's justifications remains powerful. The public remains convinced of the legitimacy or fairness of at least some parts of the contemporary welfare state. Many Americans have lost their enthusiasm for non-middle class entitlements (food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, etc.), which seem routinely to trap and corrupt their recipients; but the middle class programs remain popular, largely because of their resemblance to social insurance plans. <P>
Having been forced to contribute to them all of their working lives, at higher and higher rates of taxation, most people are loath to see their future benefits reduced. Yet surely the original proponents of the new rights would be chagrined to see their handiwork defended mainly on such self-interested grounds. And the rest of us should wonder whether the welfare state's corruptions have really been confined to the so-called underclass.<P>
In his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton proclaimed that "the era of big government is over." Neither he nor anyone else, however, knows what comes after it. Are Americans prepared to return to limited government? Is America on the verge of a revival of natural rights? On this Fourth of July, we need at least to begin to think through this possibility, if we are to make intelligent choices in the difficult years ahead.<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><B>THE CONSERVATISM OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</B></FONT><BR><B> By Thomas G. West</B></P>

The problem in America today is not that we have too much equality, too many rights, or too much democracy, as some critics say. The problem is that we are well along in a process of <I>abandoning</I> equality properly understood, and liberty and rights properly understood. On this 220th anniversary of America's independence, it is worth considering how those principles have been abandoned, and what can be done to restore them to their rightful and preeminent authority in our public life. <P>
America's freedoms have eroded, her families are disintegrating, and her women and children are subjected to levels of rape, exploitation, neglect, and abuse that America's Founders would never have tolerated. We can trace these problems to the abandonment of the principles of the Declaration of Independence by our elites, and increasingly by the people themselves.<P>

The Declaration of Independence states the founding principles in this way: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."<P>

In many conservatives today these words arouse contradictory feelings. On the one hand, they admire the Founding Fathers and therefore respect the Declaration. On the other hand, they fear that the problem in America today is too much equality, too many rights, and too much democracy. Liberals, after all, are always talking about how much <I>they</I> care about the rights of women and the poor, how we need more equality, how we must take power out of the elites and put it into the hands of the oppressed.<P>

Our liberties are contracting, not expanding. Anyone in the business world knows this is true of property rights. What is not as well known is that free speech, freedom of religion, and many other freedoms have also been substantially reduced in the twentieth century, especially in the past 25 years.<P>

For example, the Founders regarded enabling the public to make an informed decision about candidates in elections as the most important purpose of free speech. In 1971, for the first time in American history, government began to take this right away from a large class of Americans--those who cooperate or consult with candidates for public office. Such people are permitted to spend no more than $1,000 explaining to the public why their friends deserve to be elected. This campaign finance act was passed in order to limit the influence of the wealthy in elections. The idea behind the law was that since poor people can't afford to publish their views, rich people should be severely limited in what they can publish.<P>

What would the Founders have thought of a law punishing people for publishing their views on an election contest? This is what the Revolution was all about: government would not be permitted to say who would be permitted to publish and who would be forbidden. That had been the law in Old England. Such laws violate the right to liberty, and they are anti-democratic. John Adams wrote, "If the press is to be stopped and the people kept in ignorance, we had much better have the first magistrate and senators hereditary."<P>

The result of campaign finance laws is to "stop the press"--to cut down on public information about candidates who are not favored by the established media, the major networks and the leading daily newspapers. What candidates lose out under our campaign finance laws? Those who challenge the status quo, who oppose big government--in many cases, conservatives.<P>

No surprise, then, that government by the people has to a significant extent been replaced over the past century, especially in the past 30 years, with government by so-called experts far removed from responsibility to the electorate. Democracy is not gone, but it is much further eroded than most people are aware.<P>

This has happened in two ways. First, power has been taken out of the hands of private citizens and local communities, and shifted to more centralized and more remote bodies, such as state and national governments. Second, within these governments, power has been increasingly shifted away from elected officials (the president, governors, legislators) to unelected officials (bureaucrats, agents, and judges).<P>

Consider the rise of wetlands regulation. As it happens, government got the authority to regulate wetlands without passing any law. The relevant portion of the Clean Water Act simply requires permits "for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into the navigable waters" of the United States. Obviously, a swamp, a pothole, or a bog is not "navigable." Yet federal agencies, working in tandem with federal courts, have claimed, with a straight face, that "navigable waters" include all the "wetlands" in the U.S. This now includes, according to one set of federal regulations, land that has standing water on it for as few as 14 days a year.<P>

Wetlands regulation is but one example of how policy is often formed by officials--courts and agencies--far removed from the people. This policy process defies not only the Founders' principle of private and local control, but also the Constitution's requirement that we be governed only by laws to which our elected representatives give their consent. It also illustrates the government's contempt for the property rights of owners, who in some cases have been imprisoned for cleaning up, or building on, land they own.<P>

So much for our rights, and government by consent.<P>

Finally, our liberties are contracting because for several decades government has been in the business of undermining the conditions of freedom--namely, morality, family, and faith.<P>

The Founders believed that although freedom is every man and woman's birthright, a self-governing community that secures freedom is rare. In order for men to be able to govern themselves and not abuse their freedom, they need to have the habits and convictions that enable them to behave responsibly. <P>

James Madison once wrote, with his typical tough-mindedness, that if men do not have sufficient self-restraint, "Nothing less than the chains of despotism can keep them from destroying and devouring one another." But where do these moral virtues of moderation and justice come from? <P>

The Founders' answer: from knowledge of the rights of mankind, but above all from religion, which teaches us to restrain our passions and to respect the rights of others. Thomas Jefferson(the Founder most outspoken in his doubts about traditional Christianity-- was sensible enough to write in his <I>Notes on Virginia</I> that the liberties of a people will no longer be secure if they cease believing that their liberty is the gift of God.<P>

The government today is anti-religious in a whole host of ways. When the Supreme Court discusses religion, it uses words like "coercive," "divisive," "danger," and "irrational." In the name of the Bill of Rights, the Court has banned religion from public schools. Yet it is worth noting that the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights in 1789 also passed a law encouraging the teaching of religion in public schools in the Northwest Territories--the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.<P>

This hostility toward religion raises an intriguing question: If we refuse to acknowledge that foundation of our principles in "the laws of nature and of nature's God," what do our principles rest on? If liberty is not the gift of <I>God</I>, it must be the gift of <I>government</I>. But what government gives, government may take away. As Jefferson said, without God, liberty will not last.<P>

The government's hostility to morality and religion has had a profound effect on the family. Today, even liberals see that family breakdown is a problem. It is the direct or indirect cause of the vast majority of violent crime, child abuse, battering and exploitation of women, and much more.<P>

When the federal government changed its policy on welfare in the 1960s, it in effect began to subsidize divorce and single motherhood. Government's generosity made it possible, for the first time in American history, for large numbers of irresponsible women to get no-fault food, housing, cash, medical care, job training, higher education, and more. The new welfare policies made many males among the working poor a bad bargain for quite a few women who would have married them--and stayed married to them--before the 1960s.
At the same time that government has undermined the family by its perverse economic incentives, it has promoted the separation of sex from love and marriage. From sex education to easy abortion, from pregnant unmarried cheerleaders to homosexual rights, from no-fault divorce to free condoms--government sends young men and women the same message: just do it! <P>

Forgotten is the older view: that sex is part of the plan of God and nature for your life; that its noblest use is for the generation of children who will grow up under the daily harmonious guidance of a loving mother and father; that it is a fine thing to send children out into the world, so that they too can have the opportunity to engage in the pursuit of happiness and to polish and perfect their souls, just as the best of their forebears have done from time immemorial.<P>

The problems afflicting the health of the nation are vast indeed. It is easy to want to throw up one's hands in surrender. But Americans must devote themselves to the recovery of the healthy core of the older American tradition. On this Independence day, let us put our shoulders to the wheel, each of us doing what he can in the common enterprise of restoring "one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all."<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>REMEDIES FOR UC UNDERREPRESENTATION: RESIGNATIONS

</CENTER>

<P>

"Affirmative action" is a policy in search of a purpose. Recent attacks on the California Civil Rights Initiative and changes in University of California admissions procedures have produced a smokescreen of contradictory arguments in favor of racially discriminatory policies.

<P>

When opponents aren't patronizingly attacking the motives behind non-racial policies, or blurring the distinction between stopping discrimination and perpetuating discrimination, their most common justification has been "diversity," as if racially-charged criteria somehow lead to intellectual and cultural variety. However, as a goal, "diversity" has suffered major setbacks, in our courts.

<P>

When the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals outlawed in <I>Hopwood v. University of Texas</I> different admission standards for different races at the University of Texas last March, it ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court's supposed defense of "diversity" in its famous <I>Bakke v. Regents</I> decision was not a "binding precedent" since it "is mentioned nowhere except in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion." 

<P>

The Appeals Court also noted that the Supreme Court itself had ruled last year in <I>Adarand Constructors v. Pena</I> that racial criteria must pass a "strict scrutiny" test and that "the diversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny...."

<P>

Given the problems of "diversity," affirmative action proponents have dusted off the goal of, as UC Berkeley puts it, preferring "historically under-represented" groups in admissions. Note that the focus is not even underrepresented groups, but purportedly "historically underrepresented" groups.

<P>

This hedge is necessary since the group presently "underrepresented" is white high school graduates. In a recent Claremont Institute study, Michael Lynch shows that in 1993 whites were 54 percent of Berkeley's potentially eligible applicant pool but accounted for only 32 percent of acceptances. 

<P>

Hence the focus shifts to groups alleged to have been short-changed in the past. Somehow present admissions policies are meant to compensate for alleged past discrimination. This is an awkward and perverse position. 

<P>

Let us assume for the moment that the implied allegations about the history of UC admitting policies might be true. But even if it were so, present discrimination would do nothing about it.  

<P>

People who were unfairly excluded from UC in the past receive nothing. They didn't get a UC education then, they don't have it now. People who were unfairly admitted in the past still maintain their advantage. Absolutely nothing has changed. The claimed injustice remains. No present policy affects it.  

<P>

Instead, what is offered is more discrimination, this time against high school students who were not born at the time of their group's "overrepresentation." 

<P>

In short, today's children suffer for the alleged sins of their elders while the elders continue to savor the fruits of their transgressions.

<P>

Not only does this accept supposed past iniquities, it adds new inequities. It also camouflages one possible, if unpalatable, remedy to past "under-representation."

<P>

After all, if it is true that people in the past benefited from unfair admissions, then these people are still around in banks, foundations, the media, government bureaucracies--and universities.

<P>

One place they surely are is among the faculty and administration of the University of California itself. The University administration and teaching faculty must be teeming with people who gained their present positions through a historical process which "affirmative action" proponents now denounce. 
 
<P>

Even apart from biased student admissions, these people presumably have also benefited unfairly from a process of faculty hiring in which minorities were "underrepresented." Yet most University administrators and, according to reports, most faculty are committed "affirmative action" proponents. 

<P>

The solution to this problem seems to be fairly straightforward. A large proportion of the present UC faculty--let us call them white liberals--should resign. They are, if academic proponents of "affirmative action" are to be believed, unfairly advantaged and putatively less qualified than others.

<P>

The UC faculty probably does not wish to pursue this course. This is not surprising, and is perhaps understandable. But what the proponents of racially weighted policies among them at least could do is stop pretending that sacrificing today's teenagers will somehow atone for their own historically-acquired advantages.

<P>

In truth, the argument for remedying "historical under-representation" is incoherent. Most Americans know this. And, unless we see a large number of resignations from the University of California, we can conclude that their affirmative action advocates know it, too. Otherwise, they would be hypocrites. But that surely couldn't be true, could it?

<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE TERMINAL SILLINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT'S <I>ROMER</I> DECISION</font></b>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Ben Boychuk</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

In a 6-3 decision, the United States Supreme Court recently lit the fuse on one of the most contentious issues in America. The Court struck down an amendment to Colorado's constitution which said that homosexuals could not be given special rights. Under Amendment 2, gays and lesbians could not claim favorable status with the courts. They had the same rights as every citizen in the Rocky Mountain state. But they would not be able to use their sexuality for "minority status, quota preferences, protected status, or claim[s] of discrimination."

<P>

In the Court's opinion, minorities are only "equal" when they are separate but special. <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a unique reading of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It's not just wrong, it's dangerous.

<P>

The Court's convoluted argument, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, confuses special preference for equality under the law, and mistakes sanction for tolerance. It is a clumsy act of political cowardice, shrouded in the majesty of law. 

<P>

"It is a fair...inference from the broad language of the amendment," Kennedy writes, to say "that it deprives gays and lesbians even of the protection of general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings." He concludes, "This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws." 

<P>

Justice Antonin Scalia in his dissent characterizes this line of reasoning as "terminal silliness."  The Court, he writes, is arguing that "one who is accorded equal treatment under the laws, but cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws, has been denied equal protection of the laws." This is laughable, were it not so destructive. 

<P>

This decision is not an enlightened example of the court passing solid legal judgment. Rather, it is a symptom of America's overflowing, hubristic "rights talk," which can transform any misfortune or misconduct into an obligation for others to pay. 

<P>

This real issue at work in the Romer decision is not legal, but political. The people of Colorado were merely trying to prevent their children from being taught that homosexuality is deserving of special status under the law. Homosexuality may be legal in Colorado, but that makes it no less of a vice. 

<P>

With Amendment 2, Colorado's voters used the ballot to send the message that sex should be understood in its relation to bearing and raising children, the business of the family. But the Court in Romer disregards the long-cherished right of the people to enact religious and moral sentiment into law through the democratic process. 

<P>

Law is the expression of moral principles. We discriminate against incest and polygamy and drug-dealing because we believe these activities are a threat to society. We do not grant white, male heterosexuals3/4nor should we grant anyone else--special rights because we believe that this would threaten equality. Indeed, the Court makes a mockery of political self-determination. By striking down Amendment 2, the Court struck down a legitimate attempt by citizens to limit the unchecked granting of special rights.

<P>

Homosexuals in Colorado retained all of the rights guaranteed them under the state and federal bills of rights. The measure did not deprive them of the right to vote or to own property, nor did it strip away their protection from unreasonable searches and seizures or discrimination at the workplace.

<P>

As Scalia points out, Amendment 2 had no effect on a number of Colorado's laws, including the one governing pensions paid to retiring state employees. Homosexuals and heterosexuals alike are entitled to that benefit. The amendment would have simply prevented the state from making death-benefit payments to the "life partner" of a homosexual. The reasoning simply extends the logic that the state doesn't make such payments to the long-time roommate of a heterosexual employee. Nor would Amendment 2 have prevented assaults on homosexuals from being prosecuted, as the measure's opponents shamelessly argued. 

<P>

In essense, all Amendment 2 did--and this is what the Court didn't like but didn't have the temerity to say--was bar affirmative action for homosexuals. The Court has ruled in previous cases that homosexuality is not a "fundamental right"--states can, in fact, make homosexual acts punishible under the law. But the Court didn't overrule itself. The court stopped short of treating sexual orientation the same as race, age, or handicap. But the groundwork is there.

<P>

Activists wasted no time before playing this latest and possibly greatest legal trump in their political deck. A few days after the Court handed down its decision, an 18-year-old student in Hacienda Heights, California threatened to sue her high school after administrators refused to let her attend the senior prom with her 22-year-old lesbian lover. 

<P>

Cowed by the news of the Court's ruling, the school backed down. The girl's attorney, feminist agitator Gloria Allred, hailed the school's reversal as the first victory for homosexual rights under the Romer decision. Welcome to the gay '90s.

Hamas isn't waging a war against peace, it's waging a war against Israel. Hamas would welcome peace3/4after they have taken over Israel. All of it.<P>And from the outset, what is called the &quot;Peace Process&quot; has been a War Process. The government of Israel is resting its faith in Yasser Arafat who for most of his adult life had (and, we should safely assume, still has) the same objective as Hamas3/4to be done with Israel.<P>For decades, Arafat himself used terrorism to reach that objective, but it didn't work because Israel retaliated for every attack of the PLO with swiftness and severity. Does any reasonable person believe that Arafat has changed his ultimate objective rather than simply changing his transitory tactics?<P>Hamas wants peace to come about by terrorism while Arafat sees a smoother way3/4the gradual takeover of sections of Israel, under the short-range disguise of &quot;Land for Peace.&quot; That phrase should be recognized for what it is: a threat that land will be attempted to be seized by war if it isn't given away by peace. Why else would such a phrase have ever become part of the Mideast vocabulary?<P>But should any amount of land be granted under a threat? Would you give one room of your residence to an armed gang if it said it would give you peace in exchange? If Israel continues to give land for peace, it will have neither land nor peace.<P>But assume for a nave moment that Arafat has changed; that he truly wants no territory beyond Gaza, Samaria, and Judea. Then can he bring peace? At best, he only has control of the fatah faction of the PLO and apparantly has no control of Hamas' military wing, Izzadin el-Quazzi. We should have little doubt that Arafat sincerely wants the Hamas terrorist attacks to stop, but we should have grave doubt as to his reasons why. Hamas terrorism undermines Arafat's power and his own course of action in the slower, but more certain, dismemberment of Israel.<P>If Israeli policy remains as it is, &quot;Land for War&quot; will be the unintentional outcome for Israel.<P>What should Israel do? Other than severe retaliations against Hamas for each attack, it must undo what can legally be undone in the process it signed in Oslo and on the South Lawn of the White House. Secondly, at a minimum, the Golan Heights must be kept under Israel's total control rather than negotiating any of its control to Syria. There is already a striking territorial resemblance between the area's maps of pre-June 1967, and scheduled maps of 1997. And all of that is being done in the name of peace, which in 1967 was a guarantee of war.<P>All of those decisions are, of course, Israel's to make. The question is what should the United States do?<P>On Sunday, February 25, two young Americans, both in their 20s, were killed by Hamas terrorists. Those Americans were doing nothing more provocative than riding in a bus in Jerusalem. <P>It isn't that Americans have already forgotten the names of Sarah Duker and Matt Eisenfeld. We never learned them. Hardly a word has been said by President Clinton about the murder of those American citizens. <P>We should have retaliated immediately. We know, with precision, the location of the headquarters, safe-houses, and training centers of Hamas' military wing. It is true that in such retaliation we may not kill or capture the individuals responsible for that particular attack--but that shouldn't be the vital goal any more than it is a vital goal to find the grenade-thrower on a conventional battlefield. Retaliation is done against the enemy as a whole.<P>Beyond retaliation, we should encourage Israel to take all the necessary steps needed for its survival. And celebrate the victory of Benjamin Netanyahu.<P>That support and celebration would come naturally if President Clinton would recognize that a person or a nation can only make peace with those who want the same objectives. If those objectives are not compatible and one side strives to make peace alone, the achievement will be the peace of the grave. Too bad, but that's just the way it is.<P>It may well be that Israel, with President Clinton's encouragement, has already gone so far that it will continue to give away land as though that will bring peace, and our government will continue to influence Israel in that direction, saying that &quot;the Peace Process must continue.&quot;<P>I'm not a man who frequently quotes Shakespeare, but one phrase of his is particularly appropriate when land for peace becomes a policy--&quot;what fools these mortals be. &quot;<P>______________________________________________<P><I>Bruce Herschensohn is a Distinguished Fellow with The Claremont Institute</I><P><B> (c) The Claremont Institute	          May 24, 1996</B></td></tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>ANNIVERSARIES FOR DISSENTERS: 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PLESSY V. FERGUSON
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Ken Masugi</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

On May 18, we mark the 100th anniversary of <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I>, the infamous Supreme Court decision which enfeebled the post-Civil War Amendments designed to give freed slaves the rights and duties of American citizenship. The <I>Plessy</I> case marked the formal beginning of an era of legalized discrimination on the basis of race--an era in which we are mired still today.

<P>

The Supreme Court held in <I>Plessy</I> that it was perfectly reasonable for a state to racially segregate persons within its jurisdiction. The Court razed all but the most modest constitutional barriers to racist behavior by state and local governments. By making the astounding assertion that black Americans should not take offense at state segregation laws, the Court weakened the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement of &quot;equal protection of the laws. &quot; 

<P>

One hundred years ago, the American conscience was unburdened of any constitutional need to fight the degradation of segregation, and its separate but unequal treatment of black Americans.

<P>

Fifty years ago, baseball great Jackie Robinson's broke through the farce of a facade of segregation. An individual effort of excellence, encouraged by private business, shamed Americans into demolition of irrational discriminatory practices. 

<P>

It would be nice to report a happier ending: racial segregation dead and Jackie Robinson triumphant. But that would be too na&iuml;ve a gloss.

<P>

In 1954, just a few years after Robinson earned Rookie-of-the-Year honors for the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Supreme Court declared in <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> that segregation laws violated the Constitution. Yet this opinion did not truly challenge the bad principle of the <I>Plessy</I> case. The <I>Brown</I> opinion rested its conclusions on highly dubious psychological testing evidence--segregation made blacks feel bad and therefore become inferior--and not principles of constitutionalism and human dignity.

<P>

Thus the reasonableness standard of <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I> remains the law of the land: It is still constitutional for government to legislate upon the basis of race, as the vitality and range of racial preference programs, set-asides, and quotas throughout the land reflects. The century-old legacy of <I>Plessy</I> lives on, dividing Americans in as irrational ways as the segregation of baseball did 50 years ago. 

<P>

The fact remains, we have yet to embrace the famous &quot;color-blind Constitution&quot; standard defended by the sole dissenting justice in the <I>Plessy</I> case, John Marshall Harlan. To quote briefly from his thundering dissent:

<P>

<blockquote>
&quot;[I]n the eye of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant ruling class of citizens.  There is no caste here.  Our constitution is color-blind....In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved...&quot;
</blockquote>

<P>

Harlan was not being utopian. He argued that the equality of rights implicit in the rule of law can be a means of making us flawed creatures more reasonable, more civilized. But such rights can be beneficial only to the extent that they are exercised in a color-blind way, that is, devoid of the passion of racial preference.

<P>

Consider the example of abolitionist orator Frederick Douglass, America's greatest black thinker, who died just a few years before Harlan's declaration of principle. Douglass urged all Americans to renounce racial pride and taught the central significance of character for citizenship. &quot;The only excuse for pride in individuals or races is in the fact of their own achievement,&quot; he declared in 1889. To cultivate racial pride is &quot;a positive evil, &quot; Douglass said. &quot;It is building on a false foundation.&quot; 

<P>

As we continue to struggle with the flawed policies of racial preference, we need to benefit from the wisdom of dissenters of a century ago. It's hard to fathom that an equal period of time separates Jackie Robinson--that 20th Century embodiment of the lessons of Frederick Douglass--from the <I>Plessy</I> case and from Americans today. We still need to learn the lessons of Jackie Robinson and call forth and repeat that heroism in both high and modest circumstances today.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY: FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW BEST
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Thomas G. West</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

Until the 1960s, the principle of religious liberty was thought to require the separation of church and state, but not the separation of religion from politics. The American tradition was full of examples of government-sponsored prayers, religious music, and religious instruction.

<P>

The Supreme Court has declared quite a few of the older practices unconstitutional. Liberals attack these traditions as relics of an earlier era of religious bigotry. Conservatives have resisted the expulsion of religion from public life, but they don't quite know how to explain or defend the older approach.

<P>

The problem with the conservative defense is that it is based on a notion of religious liberty that is totally opposed to the American Founders. In today's view, largely accepted by liberals and conservatives alike, a forbidden "establishment of religion" exists whenever government supports or promotes a particular teaching on God.

<P>

The strangeness of today's approach, from the earlier standpoint, can be seen most vividly by this fact: by today's logic, it is unconstitutional to teach the Declaration of Independence in public school.

<P>

The Declaration contains four distinct references to God: he is the author of the "laws of God"; the "Creator" who "endowed" us with our inalienable rights; "the Supreme Judge of the world"; and "Divine Providence." 

<P>

The Supreme Court has ruled that government may not teach or practice religion. It may not exert "subtle coercive pressure" on students by prayers or religious instruction.  If the Declaration were taught in a public school as the truth, the teacher would "teach religion." She would be exercising "subtle coercive pressure" on students. She would be promoting an establishment of religion in violation of the First Amendment.

<P>

But this is absurd. Or are we really willing to say that our principles, announced in the Declaration at the moment of the nation's founding, forbid the public teaching of the source of our principles? Without an eternal foundation in God and nature, our rights become the arbitrary gift of government. And what government gives, government may take away.

<P>

Of course, teaching the Declaration has not been declared unconstitutional. But that is only because the Court has been unwilling to admit the full consequences of its view of  establishment. To avoid the public outrage that would follow if the Declaration were banned from the classroom, the Court falsely asserts that the document is not really religious. "Reciting official documents such as the Declaration of Independence which contain references to the Deity" bears "no true resemblance" to school prayer, says the Court. Such exercises, Justice William Brennan explains, "no longer have a religious purpose or meaning."

<P>

In other words, the Court will allow the theology of the Declaration to be taught in the classroom as long as it is understood that it belongs to a past that is dead and gone, that it has nothing to do with the world that we live in here and now, that it is not a living faith that holds God to be the source of our rights, the author of the laws of nature, and the protector and Supreme Judge of America.

<P>

The prevailing, incorrect view of religious liberty leads liberals to demand the elimination of the few remaining remnants of traditional morality and religious expression from public life. The limitation of marriage to a man and a woman, the lingering presence of Christmas holidays and songs in public schools, taxpayer support of legislative and military chaplains--all these holdovers of the repressive traditions of the past must go.

<P>

Conservatives, holding the same view of religious liberty, cannot defend themselves from these assaults. "Neutrality" between religion and irreligion necessarily results in a "naked public square." 

<P>

Liberals need to learn that although the right to free exercise of religion is indeed sacred, it is both appropriate and necessary for government to support sound religious convictions in a nation that means to remain free. They need to recover the Founders  understanding that a public life which allows no place for religious expression is not fit for human habitation. 

<P>

Conservatives need to learn not to be shy about their desire for public acknowledgment of the importance of God in our lives as long as every individual is protected in his natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and reason.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>THE GREAT UC BERKELEY ADMISSIONS WHITEWASH
</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Michael Lynch</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

On March 21, two days after the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found the University of Texas Law School guilty of race discrimination, the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) released the results of its seven-year investigation into the undergraduate admissions process at University of California at Berkeley (UCB). In its 15-page Letter of Finding (LOF), the OCR concluded, among other things, that "UCB does not maintain illegal quotas for Black Hispanic or Filipino applicants" and that the "admissions process, in place for students admitted in 1993, is lawful under Title VI" of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 

<P>

Proponents of racial preferences proclaimed the OCR's finding a vindication of UCB's affirmative action programs. Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel, a chief architect of UCB's admissions process, called <I>Hopwood v. Texas</I> "profoundly radical" and the OCR finding "a model of prudence" in a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> op-ed. Karabel concluded, "At stake is nothing less than the future of the American dream3/4that the United States should be the land of opportunity for all of its citizens."

<P>

Karabel has the first two issues inverted. His conclusion is right for the wrong reason. 

<P>

Some things simply can't be improved on with age. Among these is the Declaration of Independence's cogent statement of the American dream, rooted in this country's founding creed of human equality under the law: "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." 

<P>

It was this creed that Lincoln called the "standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all: constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and the value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere."

<P>

Lincoln's conception of equality is driving the current effort to abolish preferential policies.

<P>

Recognizing that race cannot benefit some applicants without hindering other applicants, the Court ruling in Hopwood rejected that race could be used in a non-discriminatory manner. "Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection," the court ruled.

<P>

In contrast, the OCR based its decision on the diversity standard set forth in Justice Lewis Powell's decision in the infamous Bakke decision. Under this standard, race and ethnicity can be considered so as to add to the educational diversity of the institution. As a result, it is erroneous to conclude from the OCR vindication of UCB that race is not a critically important factor in its admissions process. 

<P>

The OCR's own report shows that for most applicants, race is the most important factor, outside of grades and test scores. UCB judges applicants by radically different standards depending on their race and ethnicity. These different standards, according to the OCR's report, included:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
Wealthy African American, American Indian, and Chicano students who were California residents were automatically admitted in three academic achievement categories in which other California residents were automatically rejected, without even a file review.
<p>
Although UCB costs California's general fund more than $8,000 per student, wealthy, non-resident minorities were granted preferences over California residents who were not members of the right ethnic group. 
<P>
Wealthy, non-resident American Indian, African American and Chicano applicants were automatically accepted in two academic achievement categories in which other California residents were automatically rejected without even a file review.

<P> 
UCB's admissions process produces entering classes in which the only underrepresented students are white. This is perhaps why the school now targets "historically underrepresented" groups. The broader point is that by utilizing a race code, public officials are playing with dynamite in a state in which taxpayers can trace their roots back to 150 countries. 

<P>

Writing in a time in which race in America was primarily conceived as a Black/White issue, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, "the destinies of the two races, in this country, are indissolubly linked together and the interests of both requite that the common government of all shall not permit the seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law." It was also Justice Harlan who wrote "Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens." This is a proposition to which we should all rededicate ourselves.

<B><FONT SIZE=5>MRS. CLINTON'S VILLAGE</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Michael Warder</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps Hillary Clinton is right. Maybe it does take
a village to raise a child as she says in her new book by the
same name. On the other hand, it would take a village idiot to
regard this book as anything other than a 1996 presidential campaign
prop.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this widely publicized lite volume, not only does
Mrs. Clinton offer a series of Kodak moments in the life of the
Clinton family, she also sells hard the philosophy, programs,
and personnel of the Clinton administration. As if that is not
enough, Mrs. Clinton weighs in against &quot;the resurgence of
anti-government extremism&quot; in America and those who &quot;advance
narrow religious, political, and economic agendas.&quot; One gets
the impression that Mrs. Clinton is referring to the current crop
of Republican presidential candidates. Their &quot;narrow agendas&quot;
include, among other things, introducing a flat tax, raising the
exemption level for children, turning power back to the states,
closing several major departments of the federal government, and
returning prayer to schools.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I have not yet seen a news story raising the question
of whether or not this book, published by Simon &amp; Schuster,
is really a soft contribution to the Clinton reelection campaign.
The book is little more than a lengthy propaganda tract recounting
the glorious government programs pushed through over the last
three years of the administration. When Mrs. Clinton writes of
the problem of poor nutrition for many children, she surely intends
no harm to the re-election effort when she offers that &quot;the
village [read: government] can help. The U.S. Department of Agriculture,
which oversees school lunch and breakfast programs, has started
Team Nutrition...&quot; She adds that &quot;the President's Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports is working hard to convince schools&quot;
about the wisdom of physical development. She then informs us
that, &quot;I can't understand the political opposition to programs
like midnight basketball and other recreational activities.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps I can help Mrs. Clinton understand, as one
member of the village to another. Many citizens who live near
community centers with gymnasiums do not like platoons of unemployed,
troubled youths walking and driving around their neighborhoods
after midnight. These citizens also wonder how these young men
manage getting up the next morning to look for a job after playing
basketball all night? They wonder why their federal tax dollars
go to fund these programs when they have to work hard to save
so they can make ends meet? Finally, they wonder if midnight basketball
is such a great thing, why couldn't their community fund it locally?
After all, local programs are always much more effective and efficient
than some federal program parachuted into the neighborhood from
Washington at about 25 cents worth of program for each dollar
of taxes. Besides, in Kenosha, Wisconsin they probably would want
midnight bowling. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It should come as no surprise, but the philosophy
of government espoused by Mrs. Clinton in her book is identical
to that of President Clinton in his recent State of the Union
address. His first of seven challenges that America faces &quot;is
to cherish our children and strengthen the American family.&quot;
Like Mrs. Clinton, the President sees a direct link between the
federal government and the love and care of all American children.
But the federal government is ill-suited to assume assume that
responsibility. That most intimate of duties resides in the family,
a father and a mother joined in marriage with children. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If a father and mother do not fulfill that role,
it is the children of that family that suffer the most and no
federal program can effectively step into the breach. Grandparents
and close relatives are by nature the next in line of responsibility.
When President Clinton challenges Congress to pass a &quot;bipartisan
welfare reform bill&quot; and &quot;do right by our children,&quot;
he puts the federal government in the position of surrogate parent
for children.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a true village, where life-long relations abound,
relatives are nearby, and people work and spend their leisure
time together, a couple would adopt an abandoned child. However,
America, a nation of 260 million people, is not a village and
the federal government is not a town meeting. When our nation
was founded more than 200 years ago, it was much smaller than
today. Yet it was unimaginable to our Founders to conceive that
the purpose of our newly established government was to &quot;support
families at work and at home, and to build communities that fulfill
their obligations to families&quot; as asserted by Mrs. Clinton.
Union, justice, domestic tranquility, the common defense, and
the blessings of liberty was their more limited intent. Perhaps
in Mrs. Clinton's village, the Founders were just another unenlightened
group of &quot;anti-government extremists.&quot;</FONT>

<TITLE>BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP:  DOES THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRE IT FOR CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL ALIENS

</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Edward J. Erler</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
The Federal Government currently grants automatic citizenship
to children of illegal aliens born in the United States. This
practice is frequently abused. In Los Angeles County Hospitals,
for example, nearly two-thirds of births are now to women who
have entered the U.S. illegally.
<P>
Congress is considering a law that would deny citizenship to American-born
children of illegal immigrants. Patrisia Gonzales and Roberto
Rodriguez published a frantic and intemperate attack on that proposal
in the <I>Dallas Morning News</I>, the<I> Houston Chronicle</I>,
and other newspapers. They called it &quot;xenophobic extremism&quot;
and suggested that it was somehow reminiscent of &quot;Nazism&quot;
to refuse citizenship to any person born on American soil.
<P>
Gonzales and Rodriguez write-with remarkable ignorance of the
historical record-that if Congress succeeds in its attempts to
deny birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens,
&quot;for the first time since slavery, children born in the United
States will be denied the right to citizenship.&quot; They mistakenly
assume that birthright citizenship is a right of all who happen
to be born within the geographical limits of the United States.
The fourteenth amendment states that &quot;all persons born in
the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
citizens.&quot; 
<P>
But as the framers of the amendment made clear, not all persons
in the United States are subject to its jurisdiction. Senator
Jacob Howard, the author of the citizenship clause, noted that
it &quot;will not, of course, include persons born in the United
States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families
of ambassadors or foreign ministers.&quot;
<P>
Is it reasonable to think that those who actively defy the laws
of the United States by illegal entry should have a constitutional
right to confer the boon of citizenship upon their children? It
is significant that the Supreme Court has never held that such
a right exists.
<P>
During the debate over passage of the fourteenth amendment, Indians
and blacks were the only substantial groups of non-citizens living
in America. The amendment conferred citizenship on blacks, who
were obviously not &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot; of
any other country. 
<P>
But it was widely agreed that the amendment would not confer citizenship
on Indians since they owed political allegiance to their tribes
and not to the United States. The Senate Judiciary Committee in
1870 reported that &quot;those who framed the fourteenth amendment
. . . understood that the Indian tribes were not made citizens,
but were excluded by the restricting phrase, 'and subject to the
jurisdiction,' and that such has been the universal understanding.&quot;
Indians were obviously born within the geographical limits of
the United States, and many were born outside of reservations.
Rodriguez and Gonzales ask us to believe that the fourteenth amendment
extends to the children of illegal aliens what it did not extend
to Native Americans!
<P>
In 1924 Congress extended the privilege of citizenship to all
Native Americans. The Supreme Court, however, has emphatically
ruled that becoming a citizen of the United States cannot be a
unilateral or self-selected act. As the Court rightly noted, the
jurisdiction requirement of the fourteenth amendment embodies
&quot;the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation
without its consent.&quot; In addition, once an individual consents
to subject himself to the jurisdiction of the United States, he
cannot be removed from that jurisdiction without his consent.
Thus the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment is based
on reciprocal consent-consent of the individual as well as that
of the nation.
<P>
As a result of hearings held in the House last December, key members
of Congress have rediscovered the fact that those &quot;subject
to the jurisdiction&quot; of the United States can be clarified
by legislation. Congress, through its power to enforce the fourteenth
amendment, can simply declare that the children of illegal aliens
are not within the jurisdiction of the United States and that
the citizenship of children follows that of their parents.
<P>
Congressional enactments specify the terms by which immigrants
are allowed into the country and the terms upon which citizenship
can be achieved. There can be reasonable disagreements about whether
immigration policies should be more or less generous in the numbers
admitted and the precise pre-conditions for citizenship. But who
can deny that it is a necessary attribute of a nation's sovereignty
to determine who are and are not citizens? 
<P>
Contrary to what Rodriguez and Gonzales would have us believe,
the denial of birth right citizenship to the children of illegal
aliens does not punish the children for the misdeeds of their
parents because the children do not have a &quot;right&quot; to
citizenship in the first place. Could it be that Rodriguez and
Gonzales have allowed their special interest ideology to dictate
historically inaccurate and unsound constitutional arguments?

<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
THE DEBATE OVER RACE AND gender-based quotas and preferences in
California law often assumes a clinical tone as lawyers, political
scientists, statisticians, and politicians present various sides
of the issue. Certainly all of these perspectives construct the
framework for rational discourse and provide a means by which
to weigh important concepts like fairness, equality before the
law, justice, and social welfare. But such a structure falls short
of offering a full understanding of the impact these race-based
preferences have on society at large. 
<P>
This debate, the unfortunate outgrowth of affirmative action policies,
cannot be reduced to mere statistics over who was excluded or
included because of these policies, or to narrow points of legal
interpretation. Far more accurately, the impact of quotas and
preferences is an indelible, often life-jarring experience in
the life of an aspiring, promising and innocent young person,
and it is their experience that must be explained for the issue
to be fully understood. 
<P>
The reason is simple. Almost never does the student come face
to face with the ostensibly well-meaning government bureaucrat,
responsible for enforcing affirmative action policies, who denied
his admission. Almost never does the aspiring fireman meet the
enforcement officer who decides that whites will be barred from
applying for new openings because of their race. And almost never
do we, as citizens, meet the people who are courageous enough
to stand up to the system.
<P>
The purpose of this paper is to explore a few of those lives,
and in a limited way, to understand the trauma, frustration, and
disappointment which have been deliberately, often systematically,
inflicted upon them by their own government. This is what the
debate over racial and gender programs is all about: not academic
discussions in lecture halls, but the sense of futility, injustice,
and frustration which is suffered often in silence by people whose
only offense is the color of their skin, and the policies which
are increasingly interrupting, derailing, scarring and sometimes
destroying the lives of innocent people. What do their experiences
tell about the true nature of these policies, the injury these
policies inflict, the tactics by which they are imposed, and the
damage which they do to the actual victims?
<P>
The victims of reverse discrimination studied and interviewed
here are involved in many areas of government including civil
service promotions, public contracting, university admissions
and college courses. There is no shortage of first-hand experience.
With nearly a fourth of public contracts set aside for special,
non-merit based preferences, with more than a third of university
admissions largely dependent upon the race of the applicants and
with promotions within agencies widely subject to racial quotas,
the only difficulty in focusing on individual instances is that
there are so many of them from which to choose. The following
cases offer an important insight into the tragic consequences
of affirmative action on the lives of everyday Californians.<BR>

<CENTER><I>The Story of Lydia McDonald, </I></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Amber Preshica, and Hayley Ulrich<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
By any realistic measure of opportunity, Lydia McDonald should
not have come so far. It was the fall of 1995 and Lydia, like
thousands of other high school seniors, carefully polished her
application to one of the most prestigious schools in America:
the University of California at Berkeley. 
<P>
It seems cruelly implausible that she should have even entertained
such a dream. The product of a broken home, she lived with her
disabled mother and brother in a one-bedroom apartment in Los
Angeles. The family's entire annual income for the last two years
was roughly $15,000, mainly from her mother's SSI check and the
few odd jobs Lydia and her brother could find. Lydia's childhood
was a jumble of cross-country moves, charity hand-outs from local
churches and food stamps.
<P>
When her parents divorced, Lydia's mother knew she had to go back
to school to get a job which would pay for the family's needs.
Lydia remembers, &quot;She would go to school all day and work
all night and get her homework done in-between. She worked in
different jobs: data entry; McDonald's for a while. She got her
credential in architectural drafting and after that she got a
job for $12 an hour and I thought, 'wow.' That's more money than
we had ever imagined. She just loved that job because people treated
her with respect. She wanted me to get into a college. She said,
'You have to come home and do your homework. She was very strict
about when it was time to do homework. She knew it would end up
for the best. She showed us by example that if she could do it,
we could.&quot; When Lydia was 16, a back injury disabled her
mother, leaving the family destitute again.
<P>
What kept Lydia going? &quot;I don't know. I was just always thinking,
if I worked hard, just did the best in my classes; if I just did
the best that I could that I'd end up doing something good.&quot;
<P>
Whatever it was that drove Lydia McDonald, by the autumn of 1995,
she had arrived at the very gates of Cal Berkeley. Her transcripts
documented the near impossible GPA of 4.5, carried far beyond
a perfect 4.0 by the volume of advanced placement courses she
had mastered. Her Academic Index Score, the combination of various
tests required for admission, was 7,180 out of a perfect 8,000.
Hardly the bookish type, Lydia was also an accomplished athlete,
having placed fifth in her age group in the grueling Los Angeles
Marathon that year. 
<P>
Enter Allan Favish. Favish ran a small one-man law practice in
the San Fernando Valley and had developed a keen interest in racial
discrimination in California law. He had earned a reputation for
confronting the University of California with its obviously discriminatory
policies.
<P>
&quot;If you get any law or medical school application,&quot;
he explained, &quot;there's language in there somewhere that 'in
accord with federal civil rights laws, the University of California
does not discriminate on the basis of race.' Well, it's just a
lie.&quot; 
<P>
In 1993, Favish set out to prove the lie. In October, Favish requested
the GPAs, test scores, and races of all applicants to the UCLA
School of Law, which is public information as long as students'
names are omitted. He received a curt reply that the information
did not exist. &quot;I sent another letter and said, 'You just
admitted this class, and obviously that information was available
then. Why is it not available now?' I got no reply.&quot; In late
1993, Favish filed suit against the University under the California
Public Records Act. The information that had not been available
to him with a polite letter suddenly appeared on his desk under
threat of a court order. 
<P>
It took Favish eight months to enter the data from 5,000 applicants
into his home computer. &quot;I found that if you were white or
Asian, you had a very low chance of getting accepted if you were
not an &quot;A&quot; student; an &quot;A&quot; student with at
least a 3.5 GPA and at least a 90th percentile LSAT score. However,
your chances were a lot better if you were a &quot;B&quot; or
&quot;C&quot; student if you were black or Hispanic.&quot;
<P>
Favish caused a stir when he published his findings in the Los
Angeles Daily News in late 1994, followed by a unique lawsuit
against the University of California claiming consumer fraud.
Favish alleged that the University had engaged in fraudulent consumer
advertising by promising students that the University did not
discriminate on the basis of race, when in practice, clearly it
did. &quot;We took data and I made charts and tables that would
show very vividly that people's chances for admission depended
on what race they were and I asked the court to order that the
charts be published in the application material so applicants
could see whether it was worth 40 bucks just to apply to the school,&quot;
Favish explains.
<P>
One day, Favish was visiting at a friend's house. The friend's
daughter, a high school teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School
District, knew Favish was involved in the affirmative action debate,
asked Favish if she could talk with him about a situation involving
racial preferences. She said, &quot;I have a very bright student
who applied to colleges and very, very much wanted to go to UC-Berkeley.
She just got a rejection letter mentioning race and was devastated.
Would you like to look into this and see what you can do?&quot;
<P>
Allan Favish called Lydia McDonald the next day. Lydia had been
so sure of her qualifications and so determined to get into UC-Berkeley
that she had only applied to a few schools. Strapped for cash,
Lydia could not afford to file many applications. Besides, Berkeley
was her dream. 
<P>
That dream had shattered in March, when she received a form letter
from Director of Admissions Bob Laird. The letter began by explaining
that the university had received 24,900 applications for 9,000
places, and &quot;I regret that we cannot offer you admission
for the fall semester, 1996.&quot; Lydia and the teachers who
were rooting for her were dumbfounded. It was inconceivable to
them that she would not have been welcomed at Cal Berkeley. More
than one third of all applicants had been accepted, but not this
extraordinary student who had overcome so much.
<P>
&quot;I went to school the next day and so many people I went
to school with had gotten in there and many of them weren't into
studying and doing their work,&quot; Lydia recalls. &quot;I just
cried.&quot;
<P>
She didn't tell her mother about the rejection. She kept it a
secret from her family while she waited to hear from the few other
schools to which she applied. 
<P>
Laird's letter gave a glimmer of insight into the reason for her
summary rejection. &quot;While giving preference to California
residents, we sought an academically strong freshman class which
includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic,
racial and socio-economic backgrounds, as well as one that represents
a broad array of talents and interests.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;When I first talked to her,&quot; says Favish, &quot;I explained
to her what I was doing with my fraud suit against the University
of California. She had actually read that boiler plate language
(regarding the University's non-discriminatory policy) in the
application. She had heard of affirmative action before, but it
never hit home as something that could affect her.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;She was really devastated,&quot; Favish recalls. &quot;Especially
after working so hard under very difficult socioeconomic conditions.
She was really crushed. Lydia's teacher said she was just a different
person after she got the rejection letter. The racial aspect to
the letter just totally shocked her.
<P>
&quot;I don't know why she didn't try to appeal the rejection.
She was just very sad. I said, 'Let me look into how an appeal
is filed. I will file it for you.'&quot;
<P>
Favish prepared a three-page protest to Laird, reiterating Lydia's
background, her struggle against adversity, and her stellar academic
and extracurricular record. He went on, &quot;Her rejection is
even more troubling given the professed concern by so many supporters
of race and sex preferences for the alleged plight of high school
females who are supposedly too intimidated to achieve their full
potential in math and science courses. In Lydia you have an applicant
who is female, socio-economically disadvantaged, excellent in
math and science and wants to be an engineer. I would have thought
that you would want to admit Lydia, if for no other reason than
to study her.&quot;
<P>
What Favish already knew, and stated quite bluntly in his protest,
is that there was no other &quot;reason for Lydia's rejection
other than the fact that she is not black, Chicano or Native American.&quot;
<P>
The University's first response was the same stone wall that so
many applicants encounter. Although Favish was acting pro bono
as Lydia's attorney, Laird simply dismissed his formal protest
as a &quot;third party inquiry.&quot; She could write directly,
Laird said, but he clearly implied it would do her no good. &quot;Although
we received over 500 decision appeals in our fall 1995 admissions
process, fewer than 30 were ultimately granted admission.&quot;
<P>
Amber Preshica had run into the same wall of silence at Cal Berkeley.
She had applied for admission to the same freshman class, with
a 4.5 GPA, and SAT scores almost identical to Lydia's. Amber had
been Senior Class President at her high school, and worked part
time jobs to save for her expected admission to Cal Berkeley.
The material she received promised that her test scores should
have summarily qualified her for the freshman class. She, too,
was baffled by her letter of rejection.
<P>
Amber simply wanted to know why she did not measure up. &quot;I
had (minority) friends who got in with lower GPAs.&quot; She wrote
letters. She filed an appeal. She even visited the campus. An
admissions counselor told her she should go to a two-year junior
college &quot;because it was easier to qualify.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;They never really told me why,&quot; Preshica lamented.
&quot;I kept asking, please answer why I was not accepted.&quot;
Her parents, and even a UC Regent, tried to get answers. &quot;Everybody
in the University we've talked to, they try not to talk to us
too long. They don't want to tell us.&quot;
<P>
Hayley Ulrich also applied for the same freshman class. She had
a GPA of 4.4 and SAT scores placing her in the 90th percentile
of California students. Like Preshica and McDonald, Ulrich had
a Hispanic friend who had been admitted to Cal Berkeley with only
average grades and test scores. Indeed, according to the University's
own statistics, about half the entering class had academic records
inferior to hers. Ulrich was valedictorian of her senior class
and competed on the varsity track team. She worked part time and
volunteered in a homeless-aid program. She received the same form
letter from Bob Laird. 
<P>
&quot;If some less-qualified students were admitted to UC-Berkeley
on the basis of their race and color...then my daughter's face
is the face of the entire affirmative action debate,&quot; Hayley's
father wrote to Governor Pete Wilson. Hayley applied instead to
West Point, and was immediately accepted.
<P>
Favish prepared a letter for Lydia McDonald to sign, formally
appealing her rejection and asking the precise reasons for it.
She asked specifically to know her Personal Characteristics and
Achievement Score, a number determined by a highly subjective
and secretive formula which the University assigns to applicants.
<P>
Faced with the imminent threat of a lawsuit, the University backed
down, but told Lydia that she would not be allowed to enter until
the spring semester, and could not enroll in any other four-year
institution in the meantime. This presented Lydia with an impossible
situation. After her rejection from Berkeley, she had half-heartedly
accepted admission to UC-Santa Cruz and had already made living
arrangements there. But there was more. The gutsy coed who had
overcome so much adversity in her lifetime had grown completely
disillusioned with the process. Cal Berkeley no longer shined
with the same luster and allure that had made it her best hope.
Lydia's dream had soured. When Lydia McDonald finally received
her letter of acceptance, she turned it down.
<P>
&quot;There were many reasons,&quot; Lydia reflects. &quot;Everybody
I knew who had gotten in were either white and rich or a minority.
I was white and poor. That left me nowhere. I doubt I would have
fit in. If that's the way they choose their students, just based
on what race they are or what culture they are, I didn't want
to go there. I lost all respect for what I thought was a good
school.
<P>
&quot;For me it didn't end at Berkeley. Even though I worked hard,
I'm still going to have a strong work ethic. Just because I don't
go to school with a big name doesn't mean I'm not going to learn
what I need to know.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Janine Jacinto<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Janine Jacinto simply wanted to help less fortunate people through
a career in social work. Despite the demands of raising four children,
she had found time to serve for many years on her church's Board
of Social Ministry. She worked actively in &quot;Habitat for Humanity,&quot;
the organization devoted to providing housing for poor families,
whose boosters include former President Jimmy Carter. But she
wanted to do more.
<P>
In 1989, Janine decided to go back to school. She enrolled in
community college classes at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton,
earning an Associate of Arts Degree in June 1991. That fall, she
entered the California State University at Sacramento. The burdens
of raising her children, driving nearly an hour each way to classes
from the little town of Lodi, and struggling to pay the bills
with part-time work as a tutor and teaching assistant, weighed
heavily on her. Yet, through all her travail, she maintained a
GPA of 3.89. She developed a keen interest in cultural anthropology.
She conducted extensive field work with underprivileged groups,
including Mexican-American farm workers in Galt and Southeast
Asian women in Stockton.
<P>
Janine's professors saw tremendous potential in her work, and
encouraged her to apply to the University's Graduate Program for
Social Work to begin studying for her masters degree. As she read
the University's prospectus, she thought it seemed as if the program
had been developed with her in mind. The application promised
that students would be chosen for their intellectual capacity,
personal maturity, motivation, previous academic work, background
experiences and potential for successful professional practice.
Her professors told her she was a natural. She spent hours perfecting
her application.
<P>
In June 1994, with her children looking on, Janine received her
Bachelor of Arts Degree, magna cum laude, in anthropology. A few
months before, she had been inducted into the Gold Key National
Honor Society. 
<P>
Even more prestigious, though, was her induction into the honor
society of Phi Kappa Phi. The night of the installation dinner
was one of the proudest moments in Janine Jacinto's life. University
President Don Gerth told the small group of honorees that they
were &quot;the cream of the crop,&quot; and the &quot;best the
University had to offer.&quot; He challenged them to go forth
and to become leaders in the community.
<P>
Just a few days after that memorable evening, with President Gerth's
proud challenge still ringing in her ears, Janine received the
long-awaited letter from the graduate school. The form letter,
from program Director Juan D. Hernandez, explained that &quot;The
faculty evaluated applicants on the basis of the personal statement,
depth and breadth of experience in social work, personal references
and academic qualifications. Applicants were rated on the above
factors, and those with the highest ratings have been offered
positions in the entering class.&quot; 
<P>
Janine, however, would not be one of them. Because of so many
qualified applicants, &quot;we cannot offer you a position...We
trust that you will have other opportunities to realize your career
goals in the field of human services.&quot;
<P>
Janine was crushed and confused. &quot;It was a tremendous blow
to my self-esteem. My initial reaction was, 'I'm not good enough.'
Then I began to think about some things I had been told, that
some of my professors said. One professor told me to 'Check the
Hispanic box. Your name sounds Hispanic.' But that wouldn't have
been true. Another professor told me, 'I'm glad you're going to
apply, but I want you to know that they're weighing ethnicity
heavily.' But I figured my own qualifications would compensate
for that.&quot; 
<P>
The next day, she waited until the end of her &quot;Poverty and
Homelessness&quot; class to speak with the professor who had been
so supportive of her application. The professor was incredulous.
&quot;Oh Janine,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm surprised. You're one
of the best students I've had.&quot; Janine had obviously fallen
short in some part of the admissions process, but the professor
said it would be difficult to pinpoint the precise reason. The
criteria used by the admissions committee to evaluate applicants
were &quot;extremely confidential,&quot; and known only to the
professors on the committee.
<P>
With no way of knowing why she had been rejected, Janine had no
hope of proceeding. The dream she had worked so hard to attain
had just crashed into a solid wall. How many other Janine Jacintos
have been forced at that point to abandon their plans is impossible
to speculate. An inconsolable sense of resignation would have
been the natural response.
<P>
The only reason we know of Janine Jacinto's case is because of
one of those extraordinary coincidences that happen perhaps once
in a lifetime. 
<P>
Another student who had been waiting to see the professor jumped
into the conversation. &quot;I know how they do the ratings.&quot;
<P>
&quot;How can you know?&quot; the professor asked dismissively.
&quot;I don't even know.&quot; 
<P>
The student was quite matter-of-fact as she rummaged through her
knapsack. &quot;Because I have the rating sheet.&quot;
<P>
The professor was appalled. &quot;How did you get hold of that?
That's highly confidential.&quot;
<P>
The student explained that as she had waited for an appointment
to see a faculty advisor earlier in the day, she had noticed a
photocopied rating sheet in a stack of admission material on a
table in the waiting area. Thinking it was an informational hand-out,
she had taken it. Now she realized what she had. In her knapsack
was the crumpled dream of Janine Jacinto. Janine intensely studied
the three pages of rating instructions. 
<P>
Each applicant was awarded points for various aspects of his or
her background and qualifications, with a perfect score being
38. Applicants were required to have a minimum GPA of 2.5, for
which they automatically received five points, leaving a discretionary
range of 33 points. The difference between the minimum GPA of
2.5 and a perfect GPA of 4.0 was three additional points. This,
obviously, wasn't the most important criterion. Although neither
the university admissions catalogue nor her letter of rejection
even hinted at it, the most important single quality the university
sought was not academic background, personal maturity, experience
or potential. Although the difference between the minimum and
maximum GPA was three points, the race of an applicant was worth
an automatic five points. Of the 33 discretionary points awarded
to applicants, all aspects of race and ethnicity accounted for
up to 13 points. Janine Jacinto had been born the wrong color.
<P>
Janine made another appointment to see Professor Lum, a faculty
advisor. She began the meeting by describing the irony and anguish
she felt when she received the letter of rejection, just days
after being inducted into Phi Kappa Phi. The advisor feigned sympathy
and puzzlement. &quot;I'd like to see my evaluation sheet,&quot;
she told him.
<P>
Prof. Lum frowned. &quot;No,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;That
is confidential.&quot; Instead, he asked her about her qualifications.
He asked her about her volunteer experience in social work. He
asked her about her language skills; did she speak a second language?
She replied that she not only spoke a second language fluently,
but that she tutored it. But it was the politically incorrect
language of Italian. That's worth extra points, he assured her.
&quot;No, I don't believe it is,&quot; she said. &quot;Of course
it is,&quot; soothed Prof. Lum.
<P>
Janine had finally heard one untruth too many. She informed Lum
that she had seen the rating instructions, and that it was her
race that was wrong. Janine was amazed at the look of shock which
suddenly crossed the advisor's face. &quot;That stopped him cold,&quot;
she remembered. &quot;That was the end of the questions about
my qualifications.&quot; Lum immediately directed her to the graduate
advisor or the school's director, Prof. Hernandez. &quot;I know
you'll be admitted to the program,&quot; he told her.
<P>
It was an ironic moment in Janine Jacinto's life. She had been
driven by a commitment to improve opportunity for the disadvantaged,
the underprivileged, those who had been victims of discrimination.
Now she was staring straight into the face of official discrimination,
with all its smarmy prevarication, rank hypocrisy and moral cowardice.
And she was the victim.
<P>
During the next several weeks, Janine pondered her options. The
demeanor of her &quot;Poverty and Home-lessness&quot; professor
changed. &quot;What are you going to do now, Janine?&quot; the
professor would repeatedly ask her. &quot;It's not like you to
make a lot of noise about something like this.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;I got the feeling she was being pressured to find out what
I was going to do,&quot; Janine said. Janine finally decided to
make another appointment, but not with the Department chair. One
spring day in 1994, Janine's sense of social conscience brought
her to a fledgling law firm in Sacramento, Diespenbrock and Costa,
which handled a growing caseload of civil litigation.
<P>
As her story unfolded, attorneys John Virga and Dan Costa knew
that Janine presented an opportunity to drive deep into the University's
darkest secret: systematic, deliberate and officially sanctioned
racial discrimination. Although she could certainly use the money,
Janine wasn't looking for the kind of multi-million dollar awards
which are routinely given to victims who suffer far less injustice
than had she. Janine wanted something far more important to a
woman with her sense of social duty: she wanted to stop the injustice.
<P>
Costa was excited as he thought of the coming trial. Subpoenaed
material and testimony would clearly reveal the nature of racial
discrimination within the University, its extent, and the way
it has been covered up. It would also help to discover other Janine
Jacintos whose dreams are killed every day by a process which
is hidden behind the sympathetic shrugs of faculty advisors and
the inertia of the bureaucracy.
<P>
Obviously the University sensed precisely the same outcome. Shortly
after the suit was filed, the University's legal counsel contacted
Janine's attorneys. The State of California was intensely interested
in settling the case immediately-and quietly. 
<P>
&quot;What does she want?&quot; the University's attorney asked
Costa at a preliminary hearing. &quot;Does she want into the program?
She's in,&quot; he said.
<P>
The answer was simple. For herself, she only wanted to be made
whole for the time she had lost and the expenses she had incurred.
But for others who followed, she wanted the University to stop
the sham. 
<P>
The only thing the University wanted was to keep the entire affair
quiet. They wanted no discussion of the case in the press, no
publicity, no stories like this one to tell of Jacinto's experience.
Oddly, the University's motto is &quot;Vox, Veritas, Vita&quot;-Voice,
Truth, Life - but officials were insistent that the truth Janine
Jacinto had discovered within the University would be given no
voice. She quickly responded that there would be no negotiation
on this point: what the University was doing was wrong, and it
would not be covered up.
<P>
On April 29, 1996, California State University officials paid
Jacinto her expenses and legal fees. That day, the University
also signed a settlement agreeing that the CSUS graduate program
for social work would never again consider applicants on any grounds
other than merit, and under no circumstance allow &quot;ethnicity&quot;
to be considered. 
<P>
On that day, one injustice, in one program, at one public university,
had been abolished because of a remarkable chain of events and
an equally remarkable mother of four whose ambition had been to
help others and whose only sin had been to have been born the
wrong color. How many such programs remain at other Departments
of CSUS, and at other institutions across California, is anyone's
guess.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Michael Cornelius </I></CENTER>
<P>
More than a century ago, a man named Plessy boarded a train in
New Orleans, announced he was a Negro, and boldly proceeded to
seat himself in the coach designated for white passengers. Upon
refusing to move to the &quot;colored coach,&quot; he was arrested.
<P>
The vestiges of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine laid
down in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 still pervade California in
1996. Three years ago, a group of construction firms put up the
best bid to build part of a new subway system in Los Angeles.
Like Plessy, they also were denied their place on the train because
of their race. 
<P>
Just as Mr. Plessy confronted the segregationist philosophy of
the Jim Crow South then, so now the public challenge to separatist
racial policies is continued by Michael Cornelius of San Diego
in his battle against the Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority.
<P>
As Vice President of Operations for Wagner Construction of San
Diego in 1993, Cornelius believed the hard work he put in on a
subcontract bid had ensured his company a portion of the largest
public-works project in the nation: the $5.8 billion subway project
underneath the city of Los Angeles.
<P>
Cornelius successfully bid to a general contractor, PCL Construction
Services, for a contract to build a subway station at Western
and Vermont Avenues. Its share of the $38 million project, about
$7 million, represented a potential windfall to Wagner and its
60 employees, who did about $10 million in business each year.
<P>
The close of bidding brought celebration to the Wagner offices.
PCL Construction's bid had beaten all others by more than $3 million.
Employees at Wagner were in a &quot;euphoric mode,&quot; as Cornelius
describes it. In anticipation of the final award, they began planning
for the great challenge that lay before them.
<P>
They would never have the opportunity to meet that challenge.
The first bad news for Cornelius and his colleagues came soon
after the celebration began. The general contractor with the second-lowest
bid had filed a protest, charging PCL Construction with failure
to meet the goals for &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises,&quot;
and demanding the company's disqualification. The Los Angeles
Metro Transit Authority required 29 percent of all construction
work to go to &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises&quot; (DBE's).
PCL Construction's bid included about 26.5 percent minority participation.
<P>
The MTA ruled in PCL's favor after a hearing. It found PCL indisputably
had the superior bid even though the minority participation was
technically below the goal. PCL Construction and Wagner now had
the issue settled. The award, they now believed, was finally theirs.
<P>
They were wrong. Unbeknownst to Cornelius or any of his colleagues
at the time, Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority had never before
accepted a bid that did not meet or surpass its &quot;goals&quot;,
and it did not intend to start. 
<P>
One month later, MTA bosses met behind closed doors and disqualified
PCL's bid, granting the contract instead to the bidder who had
filed the protest. MTA informed PCL that participation of minority-owned
businesses in their bid was unacceptably low. Nor, MTA continued,
had PCL and its subcontractors shown &quot;good faith&quot; in
working to meet those goals. 
<P>
Needless to say, the bid participants, white and minority alike,
were mystified as to how their recruitment efforts and their 26
percent level of minority participation constituted a lack of
good faith. Michael Cornelius, who had enlisted the help of minority
subcontractors for 35 percent of Wagner's subcontract without
the prodding of preferential regulations, wondered why the MTA
now seemed to enforce its &quot;goals&quot; as strict quotas.
<P>
PCL Construction brought legal action, charging MTA's preferential
policies were extreme-nearly three times the federal standard-and
discriminatory. However, the apparent discovery of an accounting
error soon after changed all of PCL's calculations. They determined
the bid of $38 million was too low to be profitable, and dropped
the case. 
<P>
It was obvious to those involved that political pressures had
more to do with PCL's decision than accounting errors. Wagner
Construction and the other subcontractors were also unwilling
to risk involvement in a high-profile case dealing with racial
politics. 
<P>
Cornelius, no longer with Wagner, was of a different mind. MTA
was enforcing racial quotas and that, he decided, was fundamentally
wrong. Now with little left to lose, Cornelius decided to fight
the burdensome and unfair system of racial quotas in the Los Angeles
Metro Transit Authority. 
<P>
Since he represented none of the companies directly affected by
the MTA's decision, the first challenge was to establish Cornelius'
standing in court. He could have claimed his lost commission,
but Cornelius sought no personal compensation by pursuing the
case. He had a larger purpose in mind. 
<P>
For years, Cornelius saw the tremendous waste of public money,
in the hundreds of millions of dollars in California alone, that
resulted when agencies refused to accept the lowest bid for public
contracts. He had seen the most qualified bid passed over time
and again for the second, third, and even fourth-lowest bid. In
the case of the L.A. subway, a boondoggle of a project already
$2 billion over budget and three years behind schedule, MTA's
insistence on continuing its preferential policies cost taxpayers
an additional $3 million to build the Western Avenue station.
<P>
To make matters much worse, the contractor who had successfully
protested Cornelius' bid was involved in the most spectacular
disaster of the entire project. In 1994, the ground underneath
the site of a Hollywood Boulevard station gave way. Portions of
the Hollywood Walk of Fame were swallowed by a sinkhole, and businesses
along the strip were forced to close. Given their predicament,
MTA's emphasis on hiring the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; rather
than the most qualified contractors seemed particularly inappropriate.
<P>
With the overwhelming evidence of his own experience, Cornelius
filed suit not only on his own behalf, but on behalf of all taxpayers.
He asserted that the use of quotas by government agencies violated
the public trust in preventing taxpayers, the financiers and beneficiaries
of these projects, from getting the best work available at the
lowest price. After spending $32,000 out of his own pocket on
legal fees, attorneys Robert Corry of the Pacific Legal Foundation
and Paul Mahoney agreed to take on MTA's high-priced lawyers pro
bono.
<P>
The trial appeared at first to be a monumental mismatch-a $6 billion
government agency against a solitary citizen. But in 1995, the
lower court found in favor of Cornelius and the taxpayers, ruling
MTA's system of quotas unconstitutional. The court cited U.S.
Supreme Court rulings that policies of group preference must be
designed to remedy a proven pattern of past discrimination. MTA
had no basis on which to justify its 29 percent quota.
<P>
Proceedings for MTA's appeal begin this fall. With that, Cornelius
notes an additional waste of taxpayer money: local agencies are
required to take advantage of every legal channel available when
the court rules against standing law. As rulings against quotas
and preferences in public contracting increase, so do the costs
to taxpayers for those appeals. 
<P>
Cornelius hopes his case takes another step towards alleviating
this unfair burden to the nation's hard-working taxpayers, but
there is still a considerable legal fight ahead. The Clinton Administration
is now weighing-in on the side of MTA, as are the City and County
of San Francisco. The continuing legal battle also means Cornelius
must continue to bear the ridicule of the local press. &quot;I'm
their proverbial 'angry white male,'&quot; Cornelius shrugs; &quot;I
don't consider myself an angry person.&quot; 
<P>
All told, preferential treatment policies amount to billions of
dollars in inefficiency and waste nationwide. But the greater
iniquity, which Michael Cornelius so selflessly overlooks in his
public quest, is that which he has suffered because of his race.
And that injustice can never be undone. <BR>

<CENTER><I>The Story of Fontana Steel<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Paul Ware grew up in the dusty little town of Fontana, California,
about 54 miles inland from Los Angeles. &quot;It was just a little
chicken town, population 6,000,&quot; his son, Don, remembers.
Paul and his wife, Dorothy, had taken over the small family farm
after the Second World War, raising chickens and selling a few
hundred boxes of produce each year. It was enough to get by, but
with a growing family of seven children, Paul and Dorothy knew
that the modest family farm would not be enough.
<P>
In 1946, Paul foresaw the coming of a post-war construction boom
in California. He lacked the start-up capital he needed for a
business, but he found he could make a little extra money by contracting
out labor on local steel projects. Little by little, his business
grew.
<P>
He worked 14-hour days and seven-day weeks to keep the farm running
and to build his backyard steel contracting business, helped sometimes
by friends he could hire on weekends. &quot;I remember the first
job I went out on,&quot; says his son Don, now the company president.
&quot;I was eight. Dad had a 1947 Chevy Woody that held nine people.
The guys would all show up at the house and drive all the way
to Tehachapi, about 140 miles, to the job.&quot; Everyone in the
family worked, and Dorothy's thriftiness became legendary, even
catching the attention of the Los Angeles Times in 1953.
<P>
The Ware family's sweat and sacrifice those years slowly amassed
the nest egg that Paul needed to buy steel directly, and become
a supplier himself. He bought a small yard in Fontana and devised
make-shift equipment to handle the steel. But when he tried to
place his first order, he was stopped dead. The steel mills' customers
didn't welcome the additional competition that the gritty upstart
promised, and Paul could not find anyone to sell him the steel
he needed to enter the market. &quot;He was just a little guy
getting too big for them,&quot; his son recalls.
<P>
Paul was getting desperate as payments on the idle yard mounted
and the prospect for expansion grew dimmer. But Paul Ware was
a fighter, and every time a door slammed in his face, he tried
another. Four hundred miles from Fontana, he knocked on the door
of Pacific State Steel of San Francisco. Within a few weeks, the
first delivery reached Paul Ware's backyard operation, which he
dubbed &quot;Fontana Steel.&quot;
<P>
In the years that followed, Fontana Steel grew into a thriving
enterprise that played a role in some of the biggest public works
projects in California's history: the California Water Project,
the Feather River Project, the Golden State Freeway, the Century
Freeway. At its zenith, Fontana Steel employed more than 500 employees.
<P>
Ware built his business on a solid reputation. Don Ware remembers,
&quot;He was one of these guys who always kept his word. He never
once reneged on making a payment. He was so sympathetic to the
small businesses that we bought things from, I saw him borrow
from the bank to pay his bills on time. He was never one to wait
till he got paid to take care of his commitments. He's 87 now,
and still comes to the office in the morning and if he finds a
bill that says 'SECOND REQUEST,' he circles it and writes something
like, 'How come?' on it and our accounts payable person gets called
on the carpet.&quot; 
<P>
Ware's workers are a mix of the surrounding communities, about
52 percent white and 48 percent from minority groups, mainly Hispanic
and African-American. &quot;This company's always felt that a
person's color is not important,&quot; Don says. &quot;If a person
can do the job, that's all that matters. We always looked at the
ability. If they had the ability, they had the job.&quot; 
<P>
The sense of family goes far beyond the management. &quot;We have
second generations working here. I know of a couple of guys who
worked here over 20 years. Their dads worked here and retired
from here.&quot; 
<P>
Don recounts times when Fontana workers got into minor scrapes
with the law. &quot;We got them job furloughs so they could keep
working. We picked them up in the morning and dropped them off
at night. They were family people; retired now. Guys who had wives
and kids. You know.&quot;
<P>
Today, Fontana steel is only a fraction of its former size. The
booming 500-employee company is now down to only 125 workers,
in large part because state law disqualified the Ware family from
bidding on public works contracts, which made up about 65 percent
of its business. It's not the fault of the company or the workers.
It's Paul Ware's fault. He is white.
<P>
In the 1980s the state of California enacted a series of laws
requiring that a fifth of all contracts be set aside for minority-
or women-owned companies. Despite the fact that half of Fontana's
employees are from minority groups, the fact that Paul is white
makes it impossible for the company to bid on Caltrans contracts
except as a supplier. The impact on Fontana Steel was devastating.
<P>
&quot;It started happening in the '80s,&quot; Don recalls. &quot;We
would bid jobs and the contractor taking our quotes would ask
us if we were an MBE (minority business enterprise) or a WBE (woman
business enterprise). When we said 'no,' they said, 'then we can't
use you.'&quot; 
<P>
Ten years ago, contractors across California sought out Fontana
Steel because of a rock-solid 50-year reputation for dependability,
reliability, and cost control. Now, a recent letter from Kasler
Corporation to Don Ware is commonplace:
<P>
&quot;We appreciate your quote for furnishing and installing the
rebar on the Chino Hills project...Although your quote was low,
we were unable to use it as we had to accept a higher price from
a certified minority in order to meet Caltrans' requirements.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The first time we were told that, we just couldn't hardly
believe it,&quot; Don says. &quot;We'd been in business and done
jobs for these contractors for years and suddenly we weren't going
to be eligible.&quot;
<P>
Fontana is now limited to being a material supplier on public
contracts; but that, too, has been fraught with peril for the
company. As minority firms with no previous business experience
suddenly flooded the vacuum, Fontana began selling steel to them.
&quot;Sixty percent of those guys went bust, owing us money,&quot;
Don recalls.
<P>
Although state laws require 23 percent of state contracts to be
set aside for minority, woman, or disabled veteran-owned businesses,
sub-contractors like Fontana have been shut out completely. Don
explains, &quot;Say you have a bridge [contract]. All they need
is to put a little dirt up there for a fill. The general contractor
does that. They do the dirt work and the concrete. They've always
done the concrete themselves, so where else can they get the minority
[business] except the rebar?&quot; Thus, a 23 percent set-aside
becomes a 100 percent quota for firms like Fontana.
<P>
The future of Fontana Steel is uncertain. &quot;We may end up
sooner or later becoming only a fabricator,&quot; Don worries.
&quot;If we closed out the installation part of our business,
it would leave at least another hundred people out of work.&quot;
<P>
Don grows solemn. &quot;I've done my best to take care of the
success of the company so that my sons could go on. My Dad has
given his whole life to the business. He had done without his
whole life and put all his money back in the company so that it
could survive. He's now an old man, and he's watching the company
get placed in a position where it cannot grow.&quot; <BR>

<CENTER><B>Starting Out 10 Points Down:</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Jack Bras<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Jack Bras has been an architect in Northern California for 32
years. In that time he has worked with cities, counties and state
agencies, building his relationships with clients and a reputation
for quality work. The competitive nature of his profession demanded
such. Still, it was his solid reputation that made Jack most proud,
and enabled his small firm to prosper.
<P>
J. Jack Bras and Associates performed most of its contract services
with public utilities in California, like Pacific Bell. Bras first
worked with Pacific Bell in 1969, carefully cultivating that partnership
for many years. It was well worth the effort, as PacBell consistently
rewarded Bras' skill and hard work with new contracts. After Bras
added AT&amp;T to his clientele, the two utilities accounted for
more than half of his annual commerce.
<P>
The firm was enjoying its peak years in the late 1980's when the
rug was pulled out from under it. The California legislature passed
new requirements for state agencies to implement &quot;affirmative
action goals.&quot; These regulations required agencies to create
racial goals and timetables, including a minimum 23 percent participation
rate for &quot;disadvantaged business enterprises&quot;-any business
under at least 51 percent ownership of people from preferred racial,
ethnic and gender groups. As for many other white-owned firms,
the end of non-discriminatory competitive bidding meant turmoil
for Bras and Associates. 
<P>
In 1988, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the
governing body of the public utilities, began implementing its
policies to meet those demands. CPUC issued General Order #156,
ordering each of the utilities to create its own goals and timetables
for hiring minorities. Though state law specifically expressed
that goals were neither &quot;a requirement nor a quota&quot;
but merely a &quot;target,&quot; the order empowered the Commission
to sanction utilities for failing to make &quot;acceptable progress
in the hiring of minority businesses.&quot;
<P>
Naturally, the threat of sanction had a chilling effect on the
utilities. The pressure to meet the &quot;goals&quot; and avoid
regulatory penalties forced Pacific Bell to create whole new contracting
procedures. These procedures included a form for &quot;prequalification
criteria&quot; sent out to contractors in February 1991.
<P>
PacBell normally evaluated its partners every three years, but
for the first time, Bras had to apply for an &quot;improved business
partnership&quot; with Pacific Bell. Though advertised as a way
to improve PacBell's competitiveness, the whole procedure struck
Bras as very unusual, since PacBell had always contracted with
many firms across the state. Nonetheless, he filled out the form
for &quot;prequalification criteria&quot; confident that he was
indeed qualified to continue the work he had performed for 22
years. 
<P>
Several months after the application process, rumors circulated
that Bras' company had not been chosen among those firms to enjoy
an &quot;improved business partnership&quot; with Pacific Bell.
A disconcerted Bras immediately fired off a letter to PacBell
executives for an explanation.
<P>
Bras received a response in June that indeed his firm would no
longer have a working relationship with Pacific Bell. Of 13 firms
from the San Francisco Bay Area, PacBell had chosen to do business
with just three. The results of the prequalification forms showed
Bras and Associates placed sixth out of the 13. PacBell admitted
that race and gender had been a factor, but would not have affected
his standing. They then assured him that &quot;your firm was very
competitive and was not eliminated due to any unsatisfactory performance.&quot;
<P>
Bras requested a personal meeting with his former partners for
further explanation. Behind closed doors, PacBell officials acknowledged
they used race and gender criteria in their decisions. PacBell
had been forced to limit its partnerships, and set aside the lion's
share of architectural contracts for minority businesses. 
<P>
Shocked by the news, Bras left that meeting with plenty of incentive
to challenge those policies. PacBell's procedure of awarding contracts
based on the contractor's race seemed to him grossly unfair, even
immoral. In 1992, Bras filed suit against Pacific Bell and the
Public Utilities Commission alleging discrimination on the basis
of race and gender. 
<P>
The evidence that came out during trial proceedings told the whole
story of the discrimination which Jack Bras and the other white
contractors suffered under the policy. Despite PacBell's earlier
contention that he was not eliminated due to his racial status,
Bras discovered he would have taken the third and final partnership
offered had race not been a consideration.
<P>
Specifically, Question #10 on the form asked, &quot;Are you currently
certified through the Cordoba Corporation Clearing House process
for Minority/Women Business Enterprise Status?&quot; The wrong
answer on this question proved very costly: Bras answered that
question in the negative and lost 10 points to his &quot;disadvantaged&quot;
competitors, the difference between placing sixth and third. 
<P>
These revelations encouraged Pacific Bell to settle its case with
Bras, but he continued the fight for an injunction against the
discriminatory policies employed by the Public Utilities Commission.
A lower court dealt Bras an early setback, but an appeals court
reversal in 1995 reestablishing Bras' legal standing sent CPUC
to the bargaining table. The case was finally settled in April
of 1996, when the CPUC agreed to remove any provision that &quot;authorizes
or permits a utility to utilize set-asides, preferences or grant
preferential treatment to&quot; businesses owned by women or minorities.
<P>
The efforts of Jack Bras were truly a significant victory for
equal rights and equal treatment for Californians. The settlement,
however, was some matter of sacrifice for Bras personally: during
his suit against Pacific Bell he lost his contract with AT&amp;T,
also resulting from CPUC racial policies. 
<P>
In an attempt to reinvigorate his enterprise, Bras found other
instruments of California government also excluded him because
of his color. He received an offer to bid from the Lawrence Livermore
Lab, a prestigious prize for any contractor. Unfortunately, when
the contract was finally placed up for bid, Bras found it was
limited to &quot;small disadvantaged firms only.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;If that's not plain discrimination, I don't know what is,&quot;
Jack contends.
<P>
Bras assuredly does know what discrimination is, especially of
the sort that descends from his own government. Its persistent
abuse, combined with forces of economic recession, withered his
enterprise to the breaking point. Bras was forced to lay off all
of his employees. 
<P>
Though the legal battle is over, Jack Bras' fight for fairness
continues. The Public Utilities Commission is still deciding how
to create a fair system of contracting, and he attends every PUC
meeting where his demands are being deliberated. The fight for
his business, however, is over. At 66, Jack admits it is time
to retire, but his disappointment is unmistakable.
<P>
As the only remaining employee, he is preparing to close up what
is left of J. Jack Bras and Associates. &quot;I've decided to
let things just taper off, but it's sad. It was a practice of
considerable value, that could have succeeded into the future,
and now we've lost the clientele we worked so hard to build up
over the years.&quot;<BR>

<CENTER><B>When White is Wrong: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Story of Peter Schembri </I></CENTER>
<P>
Peter Schembri's life began with uncertain odds of survival, much
less success. He was born in Malta to poor parents, his father
was a blacksmith who earned four pennies a day. After burying
five of their twelve children in their homeland, the Schembris
moved their family to the United States in 1952, where Peter grew
up in the impoverished Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood of San
Francisco. 
<P>
Life in San Francisco was not immediately easier, as the Schembris
soon lost another child. Each of the surviving children went to
work when he was old enough. As it was, the family could only
scrape together enough money to send Peter and two of his sisters
to private school. Despite their desperate circumstances, the
Schembris instilled in their children the philosophy that hard
work and a good education would eventually enable them to succeed.
<P>
Peter Schembri took those words to heart. After a tour of duty
in Vietnam, he came home to work with the troubled youth of San
Francisco. In four years of college, Schembri amassed an impressive
college record, with degrees in psychology, sociology, and criminology,
and a minor in counseling. After five years with the Juvenile
Probation Division in San Mateo, California, Schembri found his
true calling to public service. In 1978, he became a San Francisco
firefighter. 
<P>
Now with a family of his own to support, Schembri looked to advance
through the fire department's ranks. &quot;I believed I should
try to give my children a better chance than I had.&quot; He devoted
himself to years of extra work, taking college courses and educating
himself in his field. He took numerous advanced training courses,
served on 15 different safety committees within the fire department,
and earned a degree in fire science. When promotional opportunities
arose, Schembri would often work 15-hour days months in advance
to study. 
<P>
So determined was he for a promotion that Schembri tested for
three different positions in 1984, including a lieutenant's position.
Testing procedures used by most local government agencies rank
all applicants by scores, then hire from the list in successive
order. He scored well on all three tests, but two of those were
thrown out by a federal circuit court judge as &quot;discriminatory&quot;
when analysis of the results showed &quot;disadvantaged&quot;
groups generally scoring lower than their white-male colleagues.
<P>
Under court order, the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) replaced
the lieutenant's exam with one designed by an outside firm with
consultation from groups representing protected classes. However,
the results were the same. In response, the department was ordered
to hire strictly by racial quota. Using scores from the first
test, the first 33 white males were hired, then the top 50 applicants
from protected classes. Though Schembri had a chance for promotion
if the list had been open, he was not in the running when racial
classifications were applied. When it was all over, Schembri was
passed over for promotion by minority candidates scoring as many
as 200 places below him. 
<P>
When the local firefighters' union informed its members about
the decision, Schembri and others in the department felt betrayed.
The game was already over, and someone was now changing the rules.
All of Peter Schembri's commitment, hard work, and study went
out the window with the stroke of a judge's pen.
<P>
The disappointment might have been too much for some, but Peter
Schembri had known heartache before. Still, the SFFD's wanton
disregard for fairness devastated Peter and his family. In an
eloquent letter to the city attorney, Schembri's wife Mary wrote,
<P>
&quot;This decision has affected me as a wife and mother... My
husband studied for three years for these tests. He made over
four thousand flash cards and several manuals. I quizzed him for
an hour every night...Four months before the test (I) hosted nightly
study group meetings in my living room for 6 to 8 firefighters...
My daughter missed her father for three years. That time will
never come again...
<P>
&quot;My husband says that regardless of how hard he studies for
another exam, the outcome will be fruitless because promotions
will be given based only on gender and race, and the numbers are
stacked against him.&quot;
<P>
In 1994, Schembri applied for two more lieutenants' positions.
He placed eighth on one test, and with eight positions opening
over the course of two years, Schembri should have been the last
hired. Unfortunately, three firefighters with lower scores were
selected in front of him, leaving him the top candidate remaining
as the promotions list expired in 1996. All three were listed
in protected classes. 
<P>
On the other test Schembri was passed over in favor of a minority
firefighter who scored significantly lower. That was Peter's last
chance at lieutenant. A superior officer sympathized with Schembri's
plight, &quot;I'm sorry, but you're white at the wrong time.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I feel I've been robbed of the promise of equal opportunity,&quot;
Schembri remarks, &quot;I don't think I'll be trying for another
promotion any time soon.&quot; Resigned to defeat, Schembri has
now obtained his teaching credential and hopes to find work at
a community college for additional income. Schembri also spends
more of his time serving his community as a volunteer. He works
for a number of local causes, including his neighborhood association,
Meals on Wheels, and fundraising for a program to aid needy children
and their families.
<P>
But Peter Schembri is not the only victim of discrimination here.
Not only were his dreams dimmed by the discriminatory policies
of the San Francisco Fire Department, but also those of two poor
immigrant parents from Malta who gave everything of themselves
for their children, and asked only that they be given their fair
chance in the land of opportunity. 
<P>
Just a few months ago Peter finally summoned the courage to tell
his parents, now in their 80s, that he again did not receive the
promotion to lieutenant he has sought for so long. 
<P>
&quot;All those years my parents never took time off, never took
a vacation. They never bought anything for themselves, they were
dedicated to their children. I would like to be able to go to
them some day and say, 'I've worked hard and look at what I've
done. Thank you for the opportunities you've given me.' It really
hurts to go back and tell them what has happened.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>A House Divided: </B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Janice Camarena Story</I></CENTER>
<P>
Janice Camarena is an unlikely crusader. She left an unstable
home at the age of 15. Within a year she was pregnant with the
first of two children she would have with a drifter. As her classmates
were graduating from high school, Janice was alone in San Diego
with a baby, no diploma, no husband, no home, and no job. 
<P>
One day Janice encountered a high school friend named Jeff Camarena,
and her careworn life suddenly brightened. She and Jeff fell in
love and were soon married. Little Jessica was born in August
of 1988, and the struggling couple looked ambitiously and optimistically
to the future. 
<P>
Jeff had just landed a job in their hometown of Crestline, in
neighboring San Bernardino County. Two weeks after Jessica's birth,
he set out to look for a small home for his young family. He would
stay with his parents in Crestline, and return on Saturday to
help Janice pack their few belongings. 
<P>
Jeff, however, would never make it home. Climbing the hill to
his parent's house, a climb he made thousands of times before,
he died of heart failure from an undiscovered heart defect. A
passer-by discovered Jeff's body, laying half-way up the hilly
path that led to the back door. He was 19 years old.
<P>
Because Jeff had died from natural causes, the couple's accident
insurance was useless. Janice was now 18-years old, a widow, penniless,
and without a high school diploma. She also had a two-week old
baby and a two-year old toddler who were now depending solely
on her.
<P>
The next three years would have crushed most people. Janice supplemented
her meager social security checks with baby-sitting jobs. She
made a vulnerable target when the father of her first child returned
in 1990. He stayed just long enough to leave her with a third
child; she was four months pregnant when he walked out for the
second and last time. 
<P>
&quot;The bills were piling up and I knew I had to do something,&quot;
Janice remembered. She knew that the future of her three young
children would be bleak if she didn't take dramatic steps to pull
herself together and improve her prospects for employment. In
the months of despair that followed, a childhood dream of becoming
a nurse flickered back to life. As a child, Janice had succored
pill-bugs in a cardboard hospital, dreaming of the day when she
could become a nurse. But in the years since Jeff's death she
hadn't dared to think about it. Now, necessity intervened. 
<P>
Janice obtained her high school proficiency certificate and in
the spring of 1993 enrolled in an English course at San Bernardino
Valley Community College. She discovered she couldn't balance
her time commitments, and dropped the course before it began.
That summer, she finally took the plunge, taking a single class
in speech. It was the first class she had taken in eight years;
but the plucky high school drop-out received her first &quot;A.&quot;
The next semester, Janice enrolled in an algebra and psychology
class, somehow managing to juggle the schedules of her three children,
her classes, and the few odd jobs she was able to do, including
baby-sitting and working in an arcade.
<P>
&quot;Christmas was always a stressful time for our family,&quot;
Janice recalled, but the Christmas of 1993-the sixth since Jeff
had died-offered the family its first real glimmer of hope. Janice
aced both of her classes, and now had every reason to believe
that a career in nursing was more than just a child's pipe-dream.
The fire department helped with toys that year for Janice's three
little girls. &quot;But we were getting further behind on bills
and I needed to graduate as quickly as possible,&quot; Janice
said. &quot;And to qualify for grants, I needed to take at least
12 units that semester.&quot;
<P>
Taking 12 units of college courses, continuing her odd jobs and
conforming to her children's needs meant that Janice needed to
piece together an intricate puzzle of a schedule. There was one
break: the English 101 course required for her degree offered
34 different time slots, and one of those fit perfectly.
<P>
On January 19, 1994, Janice Camarena took her seat in the classroom
and began fidgeting with her pen. According to Janice, something
didn't feel right: she sensed a restlessness and even hostility
around her. She began to feel very uncomfortable.
<P>
Instructor Diana Anderson glared at her, and Janice knew something
was terribly wrong. &quot;This class is for African-American students
only,&quot; Anderson said coldly. &quot;You'll have to leave.&quot;
The restlessness in the classroom suddenly erupted into jeers
and derisive laughter. Janice packed her things and quickly left
the class. 
<P>
She was between tears and anger as she hurried to the administration
building, groping for the words she would need to convey her experience
to college officials. &quot;I was shocked about it and I thought,
this can't be happening. Did I just get kicked out of this class
because I was white?&quot;
<P>
College administrators were unsympathetic. They explained the
class was for disadvantaged students and that Janice had no right
to be there. She thought of the obstacles she had surmounted.
Janice later talked to one of the students in the program. &quot;She
was telling me how great the program was. Her mom and dad were
both doctors.&quot;
<P>
Janice barely held her composure until she left the building.
&quot;I was standing by a tree, and I was really crying,&quot;
she remembered. &quot;The speech teacher I had the first semester
walked by just then. He saw me crying and asked what was wrong
and I told him. He said he would check into the program from his
side. He called me later that evening and said that he didn't
agree with it, but there wasn't anything he could do.&quot; 
<P>
The class Janice had intruded upon was part of a preferential
curriculum called the &quot;Bridge&quot; Program, and offered
qualifying students an inside track to the prestigious University
of California. Students who met the program's qualifications received
their own personal counselor, a professional off-campus mentor,
special computer services, and a stream of invitations to private
seminars and receptions with academic and professional leaders.
<P>
The qualification to enter this world of privilege was quite uncomplicated.
One had to be born a certain color, and Janice Camarena failed
the entrance exam.
<P>
As Janice scrambled to find another English class, she learned
that the college also operated a similar program for Hispanic
students, called the Puente Project. This hit Janice harder than
anything she had yet learned about the new, racially segregated
college society. She thought about her own three children. Jeff's
grandparents had immigrated from Mexico, so Jessica would qualify
for the program. Ashley and Kayla would be unceremoniously thrown
out, just as Janice had been. These college officials would drive
a racial wedge between the three little girls of Janice Camarena's
family.
<P>
Janice did not have the resources to fight the system. She just
wanted to be a nurse so she could better take care of her kids.
She tried to shrug off the incident, but it kept haunting her.
<P>
The following semester, Janice rearranged her life to fit into
a time slot for a non-preferential English 101 course. She received
straight-&quot;As&quot; on her papers. The final class assignment
was to prepare a research paper on a subject of the student's
choice. Janice quickly outlined her project for the instructor:
racially discriminatory programs. The professor was hostile. &quot;I
can't suggest you write this,&quot; he snapped. Janice decided
to try anyway.
<P>
Janice threw herself into the project. She interviewed students
who had come through the &quot;Black Bridge&quot; and &quot;Puente&quot;
programs. She interviewed Diana Anderson, the instructor who ejected
her from the class. (When Janice told Anderson that her own children
would be separated by the racial requirements, Anderson laughed.)
Janice devoured the few articles about the &quot;Black Bridge&quot;
program she could find. She learned of the landmark civil rights
cases of the 20th century, and her readings led her to George
LaNoue, a civil rights professor at the University of Maryland
at Baltimore. He, in turn, led her to Robert Corry, a young litigator
at the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento.
<P>
For all of his legal experience and success, Corry was not much
older than Janice Camarena. While still a student at Stanford
Law School, he had mounted a successful First Amendment legal
challenge to the University's politically correct speech code.
Since joining the Pacific Legal Foundation in 1994, he had made
national news by filing a legal challenge against racially discriminatory
practices in the largest public works program in the country,
the Los Angeles Metrorail. 
<P>
&quot;She wanted to know about the history of racial discrimination,
and I cited Brown v. Board of Education and other anti-segregation
cases,&quot; Corry remembered. &quot;We kept on talking, and she
mentioned her own experience. I asked her about filing a lawsuit.
She was reluctant to do so. She was frankly afraid there could
be retaliation from the school if there was a suit, and money
was a problem,&quot; Corry said. &quot;I told her I totally understood
her concerns by relating my own experience at Stanford to her,
having sued my own law school. I think she could have received
substantial monetary damages, but she wasn't interested in that.&quot;
For both of them it was a matter of principle that discrimination
be fought.
<P>
A few weeks later, Janice called the college to get her final
grades. She was anxious about keeping up her straight A's, and
was shocked to learn she had received a &quot;C&quot; in the English
class. Every grade she had received in the class had been an &quot;A.&quot;
How could that be? She made an appointment with the professor,
who informed her that she had failed her final paper, bringing
her &quot;A&quot; average in the class to a &quot;C.&quot; She
asked to see his comments on the paper, and found he had not made
any. He explained that poor grammar in several passages justified
her &quot;F.&quot; Janice explained that the poor grammar was
in direct quotations from English professor Diana Anderson. She
tape-recorded the interview with Anderson and could back the quotes
word for word. The professor replied that he would not change
her grade.
<P>
In March 1995, Corry filed suit in U.S. District Court against
the San Bernardino Community College District, the California
Community Colleges, and the University of California on Camarena's
behalf. The lawsuit received substantial media attention on evening
radio and television broadcasts, and was front page news in the
local paper the next morning.
<P>
College officials reacted immediately and viciously. San Bernardino
Valley College President David Singer called a campus assembly
the next day to discuss the lawsuit with faculty and students.
Janice was surprised to hear that the campus administration was
giving her case such public notice. &quot;I was in an anthropology
class when one of my friends came running over to me and said,
'I've been looking everywhere for you,'&quot; Janice recalls.
&quot;They're having an assembly about you.' I said 'Let's go.'&quot;
<P>
Janice and her friend took seats in the front row. President Singer
mounted the stage, played a video tape of Corry's press conference
and denied that the incident had occurred. He then opened Janice's
confidential student records, and in front of faculty and students,
announced that she had dropped out of one English class and had
just received a &quot;C&quot; in another. Janice Camarena was
obviously a disgruntled failure trying to blame the college for
her own problems.
<P>
Corry was dumbfounded. &quot;It was obviously a very uncomfortable
experience for her,&quot; he related. &quot;To be singled out
and talked about that way by the chief administrator of your school
and ridiculed...nothing like that happened to me [at Stanford].
But it backfired.&quot;
<P>
To Singer's amazement, the vast majority of the campus assembly
did not turn against Janice. They supported her. By the next morning,
several hundred students had signed a petition on her behalf.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Paul Craig Roberts wrote of the lawsuit,
&quot;Unlike many plaintiffs who have turned civil rights litigation
into a multimillion-dollar racism racket for such slights as dilatory
service in restaurants, Janice Camarena wants no monetary damages
for the undisputed intentional racial discrimination committed
against her. She seeks the simple justice of an injunction eliminating
her school's racially segregated curriculum, and she is willing
to take her case to the Supreme Court to get it.&quot; 
<P>
The University of California General Counsel, a powerful law firm
hired by the California Community Colleges and the state Attorney
General all stood against the 25-year old widow and her 27-year
old lawyer. &quot;It was very difficult to obtain the documents
we needed,&quot; Corry said. &quot;At first, they put up road
blocks to turning over these documents, which are public records.
The whole point of discovery is to get at the truth and when a
lawyer puts up barriers to discovery they obscure the truth. I
think a lot of these programs are conducted outside the public
eye. If most people knew what was going on, these affirmative
action programs would not survive.&quot; 
<P>
When Corry threatened to file a motion to compel the college officials
to divulge their papers on the Bridge and Puente programs, their
resistance suddenly collapsed. Corry received a phone call. The
state of California wanted to settle.
<P>
A little over two years after she was thrown out of her classroom,
this remarkable single mother who just wanted to provide for her
three daughters, had forced the entire legal establishment of
the state of California to capitulate. 
<P>
In 1948, Topeka, Kansas officials turned a little girl away from
a classroom because of her race. The result was the landmark decision
that ended America's &quot;separate-but-equal&quot; public education
systems. Nearly a half century later, Janice Camarena forced the
106-campus California Community College system to renounce its
own segregated classes, and forbade it ever again to discourage
another student from entering a classroom based on that student's
race.
<P>
Lawyers in the field say that Camarena's is not an isolated case.
Whether this becomes the story of a single, transitory legal victory,
or the saga of a permanent constitutional prohibition upon all
racial discrimination in California, is a matter of intense debate
in the state today. Janice Camarena's experience, and the vision
she has for the world in which her three children will grow up,
is an important part of that debate. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
What do we conclude from these cases? Are they representative
of the wide body of experience with these programs? How do these
racial policies actually work in practice? How do they co-exist
with the strong societal consensus for equality? What harm ultimately
is done?<BR>
<P>
<B>Insights on Racial Discrimination</B>
<P>
No single story or selection of stories can faithfully represent
the experience of the broad population. Many of these stories
come to light only because of an extraordinary set of coincidences
or uncommon determination and courage on the part of victims.
Janice Camarena's story surfaced because a research paper for
an English class caught the attention of a top civil rights litigator.
Janine Jacinto would never have been sure racial discrimination
kept her out of California State University Sacramento's social
welfare program, except for a chance encounter with another student,
who, also by chance, had stumbled upon confidential instructions
for rating applicants. 
<P>
Contractors' stories are easier to obtain, since racial quotas
in contracting work are constantly at odds with older, merit-based
public contract laws that strictly require awards to the lowest
bidder. Those who administer these racial laws seem far more unabashed
in their pursuit. Nevertheless, for every contractor who chooses
to buck the system and incur ponderous legal expenses, how many
others meekly withdraw from the public contracts market, or close
their doors, or manipulate the system to meet quotas by sham arrangements
with minority fronts? One Bay-area contractor, denied WBE status
because her husband works for her company, told us of ordering
from her existing suppliers through minority-owned brokers who
merely add a mark-up passed on to taxpayers.
<P>
How many students face the embarrassment and trauma of rejection
with a simple shrug of the shoulders and the conclusion that &quot;I
just don't measure up?&quot; After her encounter with California
State University Sacramento officials, Janine Jacinto decided
to turn down admission to the graduate program for fear of retaliation.
As Janice Camarena discovered, those fears were well founded.
Her extensive essay on discriminatory practices at San Berardino
Valley Community College received a summary &quot;F,&quot; despite
an unbroken series of &quot;As&quot; on all her previous papers.
<P>
For every victim willing to tell his or her story, many others
shrink from the public eye, fearful of retaliation. The father
of one student whose case was particularly egregious pleaded with
us not to discuss the matter. &quot;My son has another year to
go [in school] and they can still get at him.&quot; A Los Angeles
city employee who filed a grievance action based on racial discrimination
in promotions said he was told &quot;'You've been labeled a trouble-maker'
and that I was basically stuck in my position for the rest of
my term (of employment).&quot;
<P>
Thus cases such as these offer just a glimpse of the public's
experience with these programs.<BR>
<P>
<B>Quotas in Theory and Practice<BR>
</B>
<P>
According to defenders of racial preferences, these policies are
not rigid quotas, but merely voluntary &quot;goals.&quot; Contractors
need only demonstrate &quot;good faith&quot; efforts to meet these
&quot;goals&quot; to qualify for public contracts. Students need
not despair; race is only one of many factors considered in university
admissions to ensure a &quot;diverse&quot; student body. 
<P>
The experience of Michael Cornelius, who lost to a much higher
bidder because he fell 2.5 percentage points below the MTA's &quot;goal&quot;
for minority participation, suggests a rigidity that is uncompromising.
So, too, does the experience of Hayley Ulrich, Amber Preshica
and Lydia McDonald, none of whom was among the 37 percent of all
applicants admitted to the University of California at Berkeley,
despite admissions scores which placed them in the top 10 percent
of high school seniors in the state, GPAs which far exceeded a
perfect 4.0, and extensive extracurricular achievements. The San
Francisco Fire Department denied promotion to Peter Schembri while
advancing candidates scoring 200 places below him, solely because
of his race.
<P>
We also learn that because of the way these quotas are often administered,
some groups face total exclusion from opportunity. For Don Ware
and Jack Bras, for example, it is more than just an unlevel playing
field; they have been locked out of the stadium. Although 23 percent
of state contracts are subject to set-asides, subcontractors like
Ware and Bras must absorb 100 percent of the burden to provide
mathematical balance with other sub-contractors who meet none
of the quota. (Abraham Lincoln once mused about the mystery of
a six foot man who drowned in a lake whose average depth was just
four feet.) Although quotas ostensibly apply to just 23 percent
of the state contracts, Bras and Ware have found themselves subject
to a 100 percent quota. These practices have pushed them completely
out of a market that they had earned a place in by offering reliable
service at competitive prices.
<P>
In Janice Camarena's case, the single criterion for entry to the
world of academic privilege through the &quot;Bridge&quot; and
&quot;Puente&quot; programs was the color of the student's skin.
<P>
Another theory is that these policies are carefully targeted to
assist disadvantaged individuals whose circumstances of birth
would otherwise deny them equal opportunity to compete. These
cases show us that the practice is altogether different, and that
racial quotas often victimize the very people they are supposed
to help. Nearly half of Don Ware's employees are African-American
or Hispanic. Yet because Fontana Steel's owner has white skin,
the jobs of all of the employees, regardless of race, are imperiled.
This is a particularly bitter experience for Ware and his employees:
they had struggled hard to earn a place in the market by offering
a better service at a lower cost than their competitors. What
they had earned by their hard work has now been denied them by
preference laws designed to &quot;help&quot; them.
<P>
These cases also teach us that these policies often heap greater
disadvantages on the disadvantaged and greater privileges upon
the privileged. How else does one explain the &quot;Bridge&quot;
Program? At 25, Janice Camarena had already suffered the injuries
of a broken home, widowhood, abandonment, single-parenthood and
poverty. Yet she was brusquely turned away from a class that admitted
a student whose mother and father were both doctors. In 1990,
the same California taxpayer-funded program in San Diego was criticized
for admitting the son of physicist Walter Massey, an Illinois
resident and vice president for research at the University of
Chicago. Meanwhile, the academically qualified children of Vietnamese
refugees who were legal residents (and taxpayers) of California,
were turned away.
<P>
<B>The Tactics of Exclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
These cases highlight several inherent contradictions between
the stated aims and actual results of officially- sanctioned racial
discrimination. The contradictions are further highlighted when
exposed to a fundamental and widely held belief in our society
that individuals ought to be judged on their own talents, merit
and performance, and not on the circumstances of their birth.
This consensus dates to the nation's founding, and has been a
constant theme through the most momentous epochs of the nation's
history, the American Civil War and the 20th Century Civil Rights
Movement.
<P>
These programs are practiced, perpetuated and promoted despite
the obvious internal contradiction with their stated purpose,
and the external contravention of established and fundamental
principles of equality. Such a formidable undertaking requires
powerful stratagems. These cases shed some light on the tactics
employed by the bureaucracy in order to maintain racially discriminatory
policies on such a vast scale.
<P>
One tactic common to many of these cases is official denial. College
officials assured Janine Jacinto that her race was an inconsequential
issue for admission, when in fact it was weighted more than four
times heavier than the maximum spread for GPA. Officials at San
Bernardino Valley Community College called a school assembly to
deny the existence of a program for which they had widely disseminated
promotional material. 
<P>
When Don Ware wrote to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and U.S.
Senator Barbara Boxer for relief, Brown replied that these laws
merely established &quot;participation goals.&quot; According
to Brown, &quot;They create no 'Affirmative Action Quotas' or
'Affirmative Action Statutes.'&quot; Boxer replied that such programs
&quot;may be voluntary.&quot;
<P>
A second, common tactic is silence. When Allan Favish requested
simple statistical information on UCLA's law school applicants,
he was told it did not exist. Only after he filed a lawsuit under
the California Public Records Act was the material finally provided.
When Janice Camarena's attorney entered into discovery, college
officials stone-walled until a court order was imminent. California
State University officials seeking to settle Janine Jacinto's
lawsuit out of court wanted above all an agreement that she would
never discuss the case. 
<P>
Silence is what stopped Amber Preshica at the gates of Cal Berkeley:
University officials would never give her a straight answer as
to why her application had been rejected in favor of less qualified
applicants. CSUS officials jealously guarded their admissions
formula for the graduate program in social welfare until an unlikely
chain of events exposed it. 
<P>
A third tactic used to perpetuate these programs is intimidation,
often quite viciously applied. San Bernardino Valley Community
College President David Singer called a student assembly, ridiculed
Janice Camarena in front of her friends and faculty, and revealed
her confidential student records after she challenged the &quot;Bridge&quot;
Program. Michael Cornelius endured withering ridicule when he
first challenged the contracting quotas of the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Transit Authority. UC-Berkeley Admissions Director Bob Laird tried
to discourage Lydia McDonald from appealing her rejection, telling
her attorney that nearly 95 percent of admission appeals failed.
<P>
A fourth tactic is to co-opt complaints when they appear to be
resolute. When Janine Jacinto revealed she had seen the CSUS rating
instructions, college officials immediately guaranteed her admission.
&quot;What does she want?&quot; the CSU attorney asked Jacinto's
lawyer at a preliminary hearing. &quot;Does she want into the
program? She's in.&quot; When Lydia McDonald obtained legal services
and litigation appeared imminent, UC-Berkeley officials suddenly
decided to admit her. When it was clear Janice Camarena's attorney
would obtain embarrassing material through discovery, the college
decided to cut its losses and settle out of court. <BR>
<P>
<B>What's the Harm?<BR>
</B>
<P>
Lawyers can argue the damage done to fundamental principles of
equality under law. Philosophers can ponder violence done to the
founding principles of a nation &quot;dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.&quot; Economists can assay the
impact of exclusionary policies in the marketplace. Sociologists
can fathom the implications of a nation divided along racial lines.
But in the final analysis, the harm done by racially discriminatory
policies cannot be understood in a macrocosm. 
<P>
There is a poignancy in these stories that cannot be glossed over
in clinical analysis if a true understanding is to be achieved.
The genuine impact of these policies can only be understood through
the tears of real people like Janice Camarena, Jack Bras, Lydia
McDonald, Janine Jacinto, Peter Schembri, Don Ware, and the countless
others like them. They are often Horatio Alger stories, ruined
by exclusionary racial discrimination that today is practiced
systematically by a government founded on the opposite principles
of equality, inclusion and fairness.
<P>
&quot;She really was not the same person after she got the letter,&quot;
Allan Favish was told by those who knew Lydia McDonald. 
<P>
It took all the courage that veteran fire fighter Peter Schembri
could summon to tell his elderly Maltese parents he had been passed
over again for promotion, despite every objective qualification.
&quot;I would like to be able to go to them some day and say,
'I've worked hard and look at what I've done. Thank you for the
opportunities you've given me.' It really hurts to go back and
tell them what has happened.&quot; 
<P>
When Don Ware reflects on the business his father started, he
talks about the responsibility he feels to preserve it for his
children and employees. &quot;I've done my best to take care of
the success of the company so that my sons could go on. My Dad
has given his whole life to the business. He had done without
his whole life and put all his money back in the company so that
it could survive. He's now an old man, and he's watching the company
get placed in a position where it cannot grow.&quot;
<P>
Jack Bras has simply closed the doors on a once thriving firm.
&quot;I've decided to let things just taper off, but it's sad.
It was a practice of considerable value, and now we've lost the
clientele we worked so hard to build up over the years.&quot;
<P>
What harm is done? One of the seminal writings of the 20th Century
Civil Rights Movement, by Langston Hughes, perhaps answers it
best with another question:
<P>
&quot;What happens to a dream deferred?
<P>
Does it dry up
<P>
Like a raisin in the sun?
<P>
Or does it fester like a sore-
<P>
And then run?
<P>
Does it stink like rotten meat?
<P>
Or crust and sugar over-
<P>
Like a syrupy sweet?
<P>
Maybe it just sags
<P>
Like a heavy load
<P>
Or does it explode?&quot;

<P>
<font size=-1><I>&quot;Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor
tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights,
all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer
of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no
account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights
as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;</I>

<P>
BACK IN THE COLD WAR, when the United States and the Soviet Union
divided the power of the world between them, Americans referred
to their country and its allies as the Free World. Supporters
of the Soviet Union did not buy this: freedom as they understood
it could only be attained through communism. Indeed, they looked
on Americans and other citizens of capitalist democracies as slaves.
<P>
A visiting Martian watching a Crossfire debate between a pro-American
and a pro-Soviet about freedom could only have become confused.
He would need to understand the debaters' near-opposite definitions
of freedom before he could even hope to make sense of the argument
or form a reasonable opinion of his own. 
<P>
So it is today with the debate over &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
This debate, which has plagued American politics for over three
decades, has become especially contentious in 1996 due to Proposition
209, which would amend the California constitution to prohibit
state-sponsored &quot;preferential treatment&quot; on the basis
of race, ethnicity or gender. [*The key provision of Proposition
209 states: &quot;The state shall not discriminate against, or
grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group, on the
basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the
operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.&quot;]
<P>
But as the affirmative action debate has grown in volume, it has
also grown increasingly muddled. There is a simple reason for
this: people on opposite sides use the same words, but mean different-indeed,
mutually exclusive-things by them. 
<P>
Below we will explain the different ways in which supporters and
opponents of Proposition 209 use four important terms: preferential
treatment, equal opportunity, affirmative action and civil rights.
In doing so, we will not present a comprehensive account of the
history of affirmative action. This has been accomplished elsewhere,
and we will draw upon that history as needed.<sup>1</sup> Rather, in focusing
on definitions, we aim at enabling ordinary citizens to interpret
the debate over Proposition 209 and make a clear-minded decision
on November 5. <BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Senator Hubert Humphrey, an old-fashioned liberal who spearheaded
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, defined &quot;discrimination&quot;
at the time as &quot;a distinction in treatment given to different
individuals because of their different race.&quot; This in a nutshell
is what supporters of Proposition 209 understand as &quot;preferential
treatment.&quot; 
<P>
Indeed, the authors of 209 purposefully wrote it to echo the 1964
Civil Rights Act, which outlawed &quot;preferential treatment
to any individual or group&quot; based on race. Likewise the antecedent
of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, ratified in 1868, guaranteed &quot;equal protection
of the laws&quot; to every individual American. 
<P>
According to this traditional understanding, there are two essential
components of non-preferential treatment: color-blind law and
legal treatment of citizens as individuals. To the extent that
the law recognizes race or ethnicity, or to the extent that the
law recognizes citizens as members of groups rather than individuals,
the result is preferential treatment.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
The &quot;Media Action Kit&quot; of Educators for Justice, a modern-liberal
group opposing Proposition 209, calls 209 an attempt to &quot;take
away a hard-won anti-discrimination program.&quot; This newer
understanding of discrimination arose in the early 1960s, when
a prominent civil rights group, the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE), endorsed the idea of legally favoring blacks as a way
to remedy past discrimination. 
<P>
Other civil rights groups at the time, such as the National Urban
League, stuck to the traditional view that was enshrined in the
1964 Civil Rights Act. But by the 1970s, CORE's idea had become
universally embraced by the liberal establishment. And the idea
had grown in two important respects: (1) Policies favoring blacks
could be justified in three interrelated ways: they could be remedial
as described above; they could aim at achieving &quot;proportionality,&quot;
whereby the racial breakdown in society is mirrored in the workplace
or classroom; or they could aim at achieving cultural or intellectual
&quot;diversity.&quot; And (2) these policies were extended to
other designated minorities and to women. 
<P>
To put this newer understanding of &quot;discrimination&quot;
or &quot;preferential treatment&quot; in a nutshell: race- or
gender-based policies are only preferential if they are unjustified.
In other words, what Humphrey in 1964 and the authors of Proposition
209 in 1996 call discriminatory or preferential-&quot;a distinction
in treatment given to different individuals because of their different
race&quot;-is in fact not preferential as long as it is practiced
on behalf of the right people. 
<P>
This newer view of non-preferential treatment has essential components
that are opposite those of the traditional view: color-consciousness
replaces color-blindness, and people are treated not as individuals
under the law, but according to their race, ethnicity and gender.
<BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice</B>
<P>
The latest major court case involving preferential treatment was
decided in March 1996. The particulars are as follows: Four years
ago a woman named Cheryl Hopwood was rejected by the University
of Texas Law School, despite a high grade point average and impressive
scores on her Law School Admission Tests. As it turned out, Hopwood's
qualifications exceeded those of 24 of 25 black applicants and
47 of 50 Hispanic applicants who were admitted over her. At the
root of this was an admissions policy that had one set of standards
for white, Asian, and other applicants, and a different and lower
set of standards for blacks and Hispanics. 
<P>
Hopwood filed suit in a case known as Cheryl Hopwood v. State
of Texas. She argued that the law school's admissions policy amounted
to race-based preferential treatment that violated Title VI of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act. (Title VI prohibited racial discrimination
in colleges and universities receiving federal money.) 
<P>
In response, the university argued that its policy was not preferential,
but was rather aimed at achieving &quot;diversity.&quot; Here
is a good practical example of the divergent understandings of
preferential treatment: Hopwood believed such treatment had occurred,
because she had been treated as a member of a racial group rather
than as an individual, and her color alone had been the reason
for her rejection. For the University of Texas, on the other hand,
although it had admitted students based solely on their race,
this was not preferential treatment because it was justified by
a desired goal.
<P>
The University of Texas's admissions policy was ruled to be illegal
by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision that
was widely reported to have sent &quot;shock waves&quot; through
the academic world. Why shock waves? Because the decision included
a blanket statement that state colleges and universities &quot;may
not use race as a factor&quot; in admissions. 
<P>
Those who support Proposition 209 heralded the Hopwood decision,
considering it a knockout punch to preferential treatment. Opponents
of Proposition 209 took a fallback position: They admitted that
the University of Texas was wrong to have an admissions policy
where race was in many cases the sole decisive criterion. But
citing the 1978 Supreme Court decision in Regents of the University
of California v. Bakke, they argued that race can and will remain
in effect as one of various admissions criteria. 
<P>
We will look at a more common example of race-based admissions-more
subtle than the Texas policy, but race-based nonetheless-in the
section on &quot;Affirmative Action&quot; below. For now we simply
note that what opponents of Proposition 209 consider non-preferential
(because justified) race-based policies are widely practiced in
American colleges and universities. Indeed, in 1994 the Journal
of Blacks in Higher Education reported that in universities nationwide,
the &quot;near universal&quot; pattern is white acceptance rates
running at less than half of black acceptance rates; the difference
is even greater at liberal arts colleges.<sup>2 </sup><BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
A major bone of contention between the supporters and opponents
of Proposition 209 concerns whether the policies it would prohibit
amount to &quot;preferential treatment.&quot; At the heart of
this argument are very different understandings of the term.
<P>
By &quot;preferential treatment,&quot; the pro-209 side means
policies that take race into account and thereby give preference
to any one individual over any other individual on the basis of
race. They agree with the famous dissent of Justice John Paul
Harlan in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson. The Supreme Court
majority had upheld legally-sanctioned segregated seating on Louisiana
passenger trains. Harlan disagreed, writing: &quot;Our Constitution
is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among
citizens.&quot; 
<P>
In the context of the Hopwood case or of admissions policies in
general, supporters of Proposition 209 believe the way to prevent
preferential treatment is to delete any mention of race from applications
and ensure that each applicant is judged on the basis of merit.
<P>
The anti-209 side, on the other hand, believes that &quot;preferential
treatment&quot; results from a failure of government to use race
to achieve social goals-for instance, to achieve the same racial
proportions in classrooms as in society at large. Agreeing with
Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote in the Bakke decision that &quot;to
get beyond racism, we must first take account of race,&quot; opponents
of Proposition 209 hold that deleting race from admissions applications
would itself amount to preferential treatment.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
In a speech at the Wisconsin State Fair in 1859, Abraham Lincoln
championed the system of &quot;free labor,&quot; which today we
call &quot;free enterprise.&quot; Under this system, men are not
born into classes in which they remain throughout their lives.
<P>
Rather, said Lincoln, all men are free to rise as high as their
interests and talents will take them: &quot;The prudent, penniless
beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus
with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his
own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner
to help him. This...is free labor-the just and generous, and prosperous
system, which opens the way for all-gives hope to all, and energy,
and progress, and improvement of condition to all.&quot; 
<P>
This is obviously not to say that all are born under the same
circumstances, or with the same interests and talents. Nor is
it to say that bad fortune may not knock some down temporarily.
To the latter, Lincoln advised: &quot;Let them adopt the maxim,
'Better luck next time,' and then, by renewed exertion, make that
better luck for themselves.&quot; 
<P>
The following year, of course, Lincoln was elected president,
and went on to oversee the Civil War and the abolition of slavery.
His better known speeches on the evils of slavery, and his conduct
of the war, were at one with his understanding of free enterprise:
slavery was an extreme version of the class system of the old
world, which was based on the undemocratic principle that government
should impose artificial helps and barriers to maintain a predetermined
order in society.
<P>
Lincoln's doctrine of the free enterprise system encapsulates
the understanding of equal opportunity which animates Proposition
209. It has two essential components: Each individual should be
free to advance without any artificial barriers set before him.
And no one is guaranteed an outcome.
<P>
The Fourteenth Amendment, passed after the Civil War to extend
the &quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; to all Americans,
embodied this traditional understanding. But in practice, throughout
the country and especially in the South, many legal inequities
remained to hamper the opportunity of blacks. The 1964 Civil Rights
Act was intended to put teeth in the guarantees of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Supporters of Proposition 209 understand their initiative
to be a return to those guarantees.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
One of the arguments placed on the ballot by opponents of Proposition
209 says that its &quot;real purpose is to eliminate...equal opportunity
programs for qualified women and minorities.&quot; This newer
understanding of equal opportunity found one of its earliest expressions
in a speech by President Lyndon Johnson at Howard University in
1965: &quot;You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled
by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line
of a race and then say, 'You are free to compete with all the
others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely
fair.... [I]t is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity....
We seek not just equality as a right and a theory but equality
as a fact and equality as a result.&quot; 
<P>
There is still a distinction in this passage between opportunity
and result. Johnson was proposing that it is not enough for government
to ensure the former-that it must attend to the latter as well.
But to grasp what opponents of Proposition 209 mean today by &quot;equal
opportunity,&quot; we must see that they no longer distinguish
opportunity from result. 
<P>
In a 1979 Supreme Court case which we will discuss below, Justice
William Brennan dismissed the argument that the 1964 Civil Rights
Act prohibited race-based job promotions. This argument, Brennan
wrote, reflects a &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of the law.
In other words, what opponents of Proposition 209 mean by &quot;equal
opportunity&quot; is figurative: in effect, they use &quot;opportunity&quot;
as a metaphor for result. 
<P>
The essential components of this understanding are opposite to
those of the traditional view: First, equal opportunity is measured
by results. So to ensure it, government must predetermine and
act to bring about a certain set of results. Second, in order
to acheive these results, government must erect artificial aids
for some individuals and artificial barriers for others. As Colin
Powell wrote in his autobiography, My American Journey, &quot;Discrimination
'for' one group means, inevitably, discrimination 'against' another....&quot;<sup>3</sup>
<P>
We should also note that since President Johnson's speech in 1965,
the number of groups considered to need a leg up in the name of
equal opportunity has expanded. Various other minority groups-including
new immigrants-as well as women, have joined blacks in the ranks
of those seen to need special government help. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings In Practice</B>
<P>
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination
on the basis of &quot;race, color, religion, sex, and national
origin&quot; in the area of employment, engendered the greatest
controversy at the time. How could discrimination in hiring and
promotions be enforced without setting racial quotas? Senator
Humphrey responded that if the Act sanctioned quotas, he would
&quot;start eating the pages one after the other....&quot; &quot;Nothing
contained in [Title VII],&quot; Humphrey continued, &quot;shall
be interpreted to require any employer to grant preferential treatment
to any individual or to any group because of race...on account
of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number
or percentage of persons employed...in comparison with the available
work force.&quot;<sup>4</sup> 
<P>
Employment and promotions would be open to all, regardless of
race. But as far as obtaining jobs or promotions, government would
impose no artificial aids or barriers. This was in accordance
with the traditional understanding of free enterprise and equal
opportunity. 
<P>
As Title VII came to be administered and interpreted in the courts,
however, the newer understanding of equal opportunity came to
dominate. Consider a 1979 Supreme Court decision, United Steelworkers
of America v. Weber. The case arose when Brian Weber, a white
employee of Kaiser Aluminum, was bumped from a career-enhancing
training program. Assignment to this program was based on employee
seniority. But Kaiser maintained separate seniority lists for
white and black workers, and Weber was passed over by two junior
black employees. He argued in court that this policy violated
his rights under Title VII. But as cited above, Justice Brennan
dismissed Weber's take on Title VII as &quot;literal,&quot; and
the court upheld Kaiser's race-based policy as a means to a race-proportional
result.
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 209 support the literal understanding
of equal opportunity rejected in the Weber case. Opponents of
209 support the result-oriented, race-based employment policies
upheld in Weber. And indeed, while the history of Title VII over
the last 30 years is complex, with subtle shifts regarding what
test should be used to justify race-based employment policies,
such policies remain legal and widespread. 
<P>
For instance, when a 1988 report showed Hispanics were proportionally
under-represented by roughly 9 percent on the Los Angeles County
work force-while blacks were over-represented by about 17 percent-preferences
were tilted to the advantage of the former. Groups representing
blacks objected mightily, and Hispanics went to court to protect
their &quot;equal opportunity&quot; turf.<sup>5</sup><BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
For both sides of the Proposition 209 debate, preventing preferential
treatment or discrimination is the means to the end of &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot; But as they differ on the meaning of &quot;discrimination,&quot;
as seen in the previous section, so they differ on &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;
<P>
To use President Johnson's footrace analogy, supporters of 209
believe that government may help prepare people to run the race-for
instance, by providing universal education, as well as a &quot;safety
net&quot; for those who need help to get to the starting line.
But when it comes to the order of finish, government must remain
neutral. Certainly it should not aid or hamper individuals based
on their skin color.
<P>
The anti-209 side, on the other hand, measures equal opportunity
at the finish line. If the order of finish is not what the government
desires-for instance, if the racial breakdown of employees in
a given workplace differs from the breakdown in society at large-then
government must take a hand in &quot;fixing&quot; the race. If
it does not, it is derelict in its duty.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION?<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Even among supporters of Proposition 209, there seems to be a
semantic difference over the meaning of &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
To some, it refers only to programs employing preferential or
discriminatory treatment as traditionally defined: programs that
treat individuals differently on the basis of their different
race, ethnicity or gender. This has been the prevalent conservative
understanding for some years. Thus, for instance, the title of
constitutional law scholar Terry Eastland's recent book, Ending
Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice.
<P>
But to many other supporters of 209-including the campaign's leadership-&quot;affirmative
action&quot; has a broader meaning, encompassing also some non-discriminatory
programs. Commonly called &quot;outreach programs,&quot; these
aim to expand opportunity. For instance, to ensure that all high
school seniors have a fair shake at getting into the University
of California, the state might fund college-prep tutoring in schools
where SAT scores are historically below average, or an oversight
program to ensure that UC applicants are widely recruited. 
<P>
Thus Ward Connerly, a black businessman and University of California
trustee who chairs the pro-209 campaign, has labeled &quot;the
claim that Proposition 209 will eliminate all affirmative action&quot;
as &quot;preposterous.&quot;
<P>
Semantics aside, however, supporters of 209 agree on what the
initiative would allow and prohibit. Outreach programs would clearly
be allowed, as long as they are open to people of all races and
genders. As Connerly recently wrote, referring to an actual incident
of exclusion: &quot;No longer would people like Janice Camarena,
a white, widowed mother of three, be thrown out of outreach classes
because her color or racial background does not fit the template
of the institution.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Opponents of Proposition 209 took California Attorney General
Dan Lungren to court in August, objecting to his official summary
of the initiative, which will appear on the November ballot. Lungren
summarized 209 as a &quot;prohibition against discrimination or
preferential treatment.&quot; Pat Ewing, head of the anti-209
campaign, called this an attempt to &quot;intentionally mislead
the public,&quot; arguing that the summary should state simply
that the initiative prohibits &quot;affirmative action.&quot;
<P>
A County Superior Court Judge agreed with Ewing. This decision
was overturned, though, by a state appeals panel, which described
the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; as &quot;amorphous.&quot;
<P>
We have seen that it is somewhat amorphous, even among supporters
of 209. But leaving that aside, opponents of 209 are united in
insisting that the initiative would prohibit all affirmative action.
This indicates that they agree with the narrower view of affirmative
action in the pro-209 camp: &quot;affirmative action&quot; describes
precisely those programs which do treat people differently on
the basis of their different race, ethnicity or gender. The difference,
as we have seen in previous sections, is that 209 opponents do
not consider such treatment discriminatory, as long as it is practiced
on behalf of the right people. As Justice Blackmun wrote in defense
of affirmative action in the 1978 Bakke case, &quot;in order to
treat some people equally, we must treat them differently.&quot;
<P>
Related to this, the ballot arguments opposing 209 insist that
it would spell the end of &quot;outreach programs.&quot; As we
have seen, however, this could only be true insofar as access
to such programs is restricted by race, ethnicity or gender. And
indeed, opponents of 209 seem to understand &quot;outreach&quot;
to require such restrictions.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice<sup>6</sup></B> 
<P>
The following headline appeared last spring in the Los Angeles
Times: &quot;Probe Finds No Bias in Berkeley Admissions: Policies
do not discriminate against whites or cause lower academic quality.&quot;
It referred to a seven-year investigation of the admissions policy
at the University of California at Berkeley by the U.S. Department
of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR). A Berkeley sociologist
who had a hand in designing this policy called the OCR's report
&quot;an historical vindication of one of the stronger and most
scrutinized affirmative action programs in the country.&quot;
<P>
But the report only concluded that Berkeley didn't &quot;maintain
illegal [racial or ethnic] quotas&quot;-implying that legal quotas
were maintained. In effect, OCR vindicated Berkeley's policy under
the terms of Bakke, which held that race could not be the sole
criterion in admissions, but could be one of several criteria.
<P>
The facts are these: Berkeley's admissions policy was designed
to achieve the goal of &quot;proportionality&quot;-that is, to
admit freshman classes containing the same ethnic percentages
as exist among California's high school graduating class. In order
to do so, it had to set different standards for applicants of
different ethnic groups, because in reality, ethnic groups do
not qualify proportionately. 
<P>
For instance, in 1993-one of the years examined in the OCR report-Asians
made up 15 percent of the graduating class, but 32 percent of
the applicants to Berkeley who met UC's eligibility requirements;
Hispanics, on the other hand, made up 29 percent of the graduating
class, but only 11 percent of eligible applicants. 
<P>
Berkeley, then, could only hope to approximate proportionality
by using different standards for different applicants according
to race. This was legal-again under Bakke-because it was incorporated
into a complex matrix system in which other factors also played
a role. But clearly race is in many cases one of the most important
factors-and in some cases the single most important factor -in
gaining (or being denied) admission to Berkeley.<BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Education-the bureaucracy in charge of
enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibiting racial
discrimination in colleges and universities-endorsed Berkeley's
race-based admissions policy, on the grounds that schools can
&quot;take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions
which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular
race, color, or national origin.&quot; Opponents of Proposition
209 applauded. 
<P>
For 209 supporters, on the other hand, Berkeley's policy exhibits
exactly the kind of discrimination the initiative is written to
prohibit. 
<P>
The sides agree that the program amounts to affirmative action,
disagreeing only on its propriety, based on their divergent understandings
of &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
as described in preceding sections.
<P>
As for race- and gender-neutral &quot;outreach programs&quot;-programs
to increase opportunity for the disadvantaged-they would remain
legal under Proposition 209. Many 209 supporters count these also
as affirmative action programs. Thus the ballot description of
209 by the non-partisan Legislative Analyst's Office explains
that it would mean &quot;the elimination of most [which is to
say, not all] affirmative action programs...run by the state or
local government in the areas of public employment, contracting,
and education.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>WHAT ARE CIVIL RIGHTS? <BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The Pro-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
The understanding of &quot;civil rights&quot; held by supporters
of Proposition 209 harks back to the second &quot;self-evident
truth&quot; in the Declaration of Independence: human beings are
&quot;endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;
These rights adhere equally to all individuals, based on their
common human nature-hence the term &quot;natural rights.&quot;
They include the rights to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; as well as property rights, speech rights,
and rights of conscience or religious freedom. 
<P>
The Declaration's third &quot;self-evident truth,&quot; then,
is that &quot;to secure these rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed.&quot; The purpose of government is to protect the individual
rights-now civil rights-of its citizens.
<P>
The pro-209 campaign hearkens also to the understanding of Martin
Luther King, Jr. and the pre-1965 Civil Rights Movement. In gaining
a majority in Congress and in the nation at large to support the
1964 Civil Rights Act, King and other civil rights leaders appealed
to the natural rights principles of the Declaration, asking the
nation to live up to its founding ideals. For instance, in his
most famous speech, delivered at the Lincoln Memorial on August
23, 1963, King announced, &quot;I have a dream that one day this
nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed:
'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal.'&quot;
<P>
Civil rights in this traditional sense have three essential components:
they adhere to individuals, they exist prior to and separate from
government, and they ensure equal opportunity rather than equal
results. That is, each individual has rights equal to those of
every other individual, regardless of race; civil rights are neither
the product of government, nor can they be taken away by government
(hence &quot;inalienable&quot;); and the Declaration promises
a right to pursue happiness or success, not a right to happiness
or success itself.<BR>
<P>
<B>The Anti-209 Understanding</B>
<P>
Almost immediately upon the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
which was in line with the traditional understanding of civil
rights, a new goal was announced: the goal, in President Johnson's
words, of &quot;equality as a fact and equality as a result.&quot;
Along with this new goal, civil rights were redefined. Rather
than being rightful claims to one's own possessions, rights in
this new view are claims to the possessions of others. This can
be seen in the character of the new rights which have been posited
in recent decades; for example, rights to publicly-subsidized
housing, education, medical care, food stamps, and day care. And
with this redefinition of rights, the role of government was changed
fundamentally: rather than protecting equal rights, government
became the redistribution center for money, jobs, promotions,
college admissions, etc., all in pursuit of equal results.
<P>
The newer understanding of rights-held by opponents of Proposition
209-hearkens less to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and
early '60s, than to the Progressive Movement of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries. 
<P>
Philosopher John Dewey articulated the view of the individual
which underlies this understanding: &quot;Social arrangements,
laws, institutions...are means of creating individuals.... Individuality
in a social and moral sense is something to be wrought out.&quot;
That is, individuals are born first and foremost, not with rights,
but with needs, and are dependent on government to fulfill them.
<P>
And again, this demands a large and intrusive government. Woodrow
Wilson-a progressive political theorist prior to becoming president-was
openly critical of the parts of the Constitution, based on the
Declaration's natural rights doctrine, which limited the government's
power to regulate private or economic life. Much of the history
of American government in this century is the history of overcoming
those limitations.
<P>
The three essential components of the newer view of civil rights
are opposite those of the founding or traditional view. First,
instead of adhering to individuals, civil rights are assigned
according to group affiliation. Second, rights are assigned: they
are not seen as existing prior to and separate from government,
but rather as government grants. And third, rights are understood
to guarantee results rather than opportunity. 
<P>
One of the clearest indications of the revolutionary character
of the new understanding of rights came in a 1987 Supreme Court
case called Johnson v. Transportation Agency-an affirmative action
case in which a man sued a government agency for awarding a job
to an admittedly less-qualified woman. Justice William Brennan,
writing for the majority, asked &quot;whether the [gender-based
affirmative action program] unnecessarily trammeled the rights
of male employees&quot;; his answer was no. 
<P>
In other words, the newly-defined right of the less-qualified
woman to a job necessitated the trammeling of the traditionally-defined
right of the man to equal legal treatment. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Different Understandings in Practice</B>
<P>
In 1961, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, prohibiting
discrimination in the employment practices of government contractors.
Those enforcing this order required contractors to submit racial
breakdowns of their work forces, in order to ensure integration.
This was in accordance with previous executive orders by Presidents
Roosevelt and Truman, as well as with the traditional understanding
of civil rights. 
<P>
Four years later, however, President Johnson issued Executive
Order 11246, setting up the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
(OFCC) in the Labor Department to oversee government contractors.
OFCC immediately began requiring what amounted to racial quotas.
Bidders submitted &quot;manning tables&quot; guaranteeing the
proportions of racial minorities they would hire if their bid
was accepted. These tables became quite controversial and were
discontinued, but the general practice of requiring contractors
to hire by race continued in various forms and remains in place
today.
<P>
The state of California has 45 separate laws requiring race- and
gender-based preferences in the contracting of goods and services.
Since 1988, for instance, competition for 20 percent of state-funded
contracts have been limited, in effect, to &quot;minority business
enterprises&quot; and &quot;women business enterprises.&quot;
Much of the commentary on this has addressed the enormous cost
to taxpayers. (For instance, preference requirements in state
construction contracts have been estimated to cost California
taxpayers $43 million per year.) But more basically, these requirements
raise the issue of whether affirmative action violates or promotes
civil rights.<sup>7</sup> <BR>
<P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
There are two diverse understandings of &quot;civil rights&quot;
involved in the debate over Proposition 209. Behind them are conflicting
ideas of justice. The traditional understanding was reflected
in the Supreme Court majority decision in Hirabayashi v. United
States in 1943: &quot;Distinctions between citizens solely because
of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people
whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.&quot;
By &quot;doctrine of equality,&quot; the court meant the doctrine
that individuals have equal rights by nature. 
<P>
Under this doctrine, conditions of individuals in society will
vary greatly, because they are born with different talents and
interests-not to mention luck. Also under this doctrine, government
is charged with protecting individual rights and ensuring equal
opportunity-including maintenance of a safety net-but otherwise
gives free rein to the citizens' talents and interests.
<P>
The newer understanding of civil rights-the one that leads Educators
for Justice, an anti-Proposition 209 group, to call 209 &quot;the
civil wrongs initiative&quot;-grows out of a different understanding
of equality. This is not an equality of rights, but an equality
of results. Setting equality of results as a goal, it becomes
necessary to regulate rights or opportunity. The granting of special
rights to some, while restricting the rights of others, becomes
the task of government. This in turn requires expansive bureaucratic
government, rather than limited government: as the bureaucrat
in charge of OFCC candidly admitted with regard to affirmative
action in 1967, it justifies &quot;anything that you have to do
to get results.&quot;<sup>8</sup><BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Those on opposite sides of the Proposition 209 debate are not
above calling each other liars. But our assumption in this &quot;Citizen's
Guide&quot; has been that neither side is untruthful. Rather they
are using the same terms for near-opposite things. We have outlined
their different understandings of four terms: preferential treatment
or discrimination, equal opportunity, affirmative action and civil
rights. And we have looked at the practical effects of their differences
in three areas: college and university admissions, job hiring
and promotions, and public contracting. 
<P>
Having done so, we hope that when supporters of 209 say, &quot;We
are for equal opportunity and against preferential treatment,&quot;
and opponents respond, &quot;No, we are for equal opportunity,
and you are for discrimination&quot;-or when opponents charge
that 209 prohibits outreach programs, and supporters reply that
non-preferential affirmative action will remain legal-citizens
who have read this guide will be able to cope. 
<P>
In brief, the key to the confusion surrounding the 209 debate-as
discussed most directly in our section on &quot;civil rights&quot;-is
that a new view of justice arose relatively recently in America
which is opposed to the founding or traditional view. Many important
terms-including &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;rights&quot;-were
redefined to support this new view. So far, neither the founding
view or the newer view of justice has completely won out, so dual
(and dueling) sets of definitions remain current. Voters in California
this November will begin a decision-to be completed by voters
in subsequent elections nationwide-as to which set will finally
be relegated to the &quot;dustbin of history.&quot;<BR>

<P>
IN THE LATE SPRING NOT SO VERY LONG AGO, Yang-pat Au a 17-year-old
from San Jose, California received a thin letter in the mail that
every high school senior dreads. It was a rejection from his college
of choice, the University of California at Berkeley. That someone
with Au's record-first in his class, straight As, 98th percentile
SAT scores, Junior Achievement, two varsity letters, a seat on
the Student Council, and numerous awards and scholarships-should
be rejected suggests that Berkeley's admissions standards must
be very high indeed.
<P>
And so they are. But high standards alone do not explain Au's
rejection, because many hundreds of such students with less impressive
credentials were admitted that same year.<SUP>1</SUP> 
<P>
Every year hundreds of students are admitted to every University
of California undergraduate campus and professional school, whose
qualifications fall well short of those of many other hundreds
of students who are not so lucky. Academic credentials are not
the only, or even most important, standard of admission.
<P>
Similarly puzzling things happen outside the academic world. Take,
for instance, the experience of Randy Perch. Perch, who owns a
construction firm in Colorado Springs, submitted the low bid on
a project to build the guardrails for a federal highway. But he
was not awarded the contract. 
<P>
Why not? Because unlike most clients of contractors, the U.S.
Department of Transportation does not consider a competitive bid
to be the prime consideration for awarding jobs.
<P>
Or consider Danny O'Connor. A member of the Memphis Police department
since 1975, O'Connor put his name in for promotion to sergeant
in 1988. Out of over 200 aspirants, only the top 75 would be promoted
that year. O'Connor's rank, based on his combined score from a
written exam, an interview, seniority and career performance,
was 56, yet he was not promoted. 
<P>
Why not? Because the department does not rely solely on a candidate's
performance ranking to decide who gets promotes and who does not.
<P>
What happened in all of these cases? Au, Perch and O'Connor are
were victims-just three of countless others-of a policy known
as &quot;Affirmative Action,&quot; a euphemism bold even by the
loose standards of public relations firms and politicians. 
<P>
Affirmative action is, or is supposed to be, a systematic effort
by governments and private organizations to help &quot;historically
underrepresented groups&quot; participate more fully in mainstream
society-especially in employment and education. The phrase &quot;historically
under-represented groups&quot; is a code for racial and ethnic
groups favored by affirmative action's proponents and administrators.
And it has come to include women, who though not originally part
of the affirmative action scheme, have over the years become,
as a group, one of its chief beneficiaries.
<P>
If the above definition seems vague, that is because it is, and
deliberately so. It is what the advocates of affirmative action
say when asked what exactly, or even approximately, the policy
they so cherish is. But it tells us nothing of how affirmative
action actually works, because its workings are embarrassingly
inconsistent with principles that the proponents of the policy
claim to believe in-like equality before the law and the importance
of character, and not skin-color or gender, as the decisive measure
of a human being.
<P>
How does affirmative action really work? When you or I or anyone
seeks some opportunity from the government, or an employer, or
a university-such as a job, a promotion, admission to an academic
program, a contract, you name it-we will be evaluated, as a matter
of official policy, not as individuals according to our personal
qualifications or merits, but as members of certain racial, ethnic
or gender groups. Members of preferred groups receive preferential
treatment.
<P>
It didn't start out this way. Affirmative action began life during
the height of the Civil Rights Movement as an executive order
that directed federal agencies to make an active effort to seek
out minorities for positions in the government. Mostly, this consisted
of more diverse and far-reaching advertising of federal jobs and
more active recruiting tactics. 
<P>
The thinking behind it was that despite the success of the Civil
Rights Movement in finally securing equal rights for all citizens,
citizens who had been denied their rights for generations were
in no position to participate fully in society. And there can
be little doubt that this was indeed true. But unfortunately these
well-meaning-and perfectly constitutional-forms of affirmative
action did not last long. They quickly gave way to the system
we have today, the one that has given us the cases of Yang-pat
Au, Randy Perch, Danny O'Connor and countless others.
<P>
That system separates applicants or candidates into racial or
gender categories before evaluating for college admission, a job,
a promotion, or awarding a contract. This is how Yang-pat Au,
and many others like him, were treated by the University of California's
admissions policy. Although his credentials placed him far above
a majority of those admitted to Berkeley that year, his file was
not evaluated according to a campus-wide standard of admission,
because there is no such thing.
<P>
Put simply, the University separates its applicants into nine
categories, five of which are based solely on race. The standards
of admission for applicants in those five categories are much
lower than those for the non-racial categories.<SUP>2</SUP> And
they have to be if the University is to meet its goal of enrolling
a minimum number of students from each favored racial group. 
<P>
Since Asian high school students like Au tend to outperform other
groups of students, were the admissions policy merit-based (read:
fair) Asians would make up a higher percentage of the unversity's
undergraduate population, while members of other races, particularly
blacks and Hispanics, would see their numbers fall well below
administrative &quot;diversity&quot; targets.
<P>
These targets-&quot;goals&quot; or &quot;benchmarks,&quot; as
they are called-are particularly obnoxious and thus carefully
disguised and misrepresented. There is a better word for them,
a more accurate word, but one that makes affirmative action's
defenders cringe: quotas.
<P>
For that is what they are. When a university openly proclaims,
as the University of California does, that its enrollment must
mirror the ethnic breakdown of the state or region from which
it draws applicants, that is, quite simply, a quota system. The
population of California is about eight percent black. That means
that no matter what, a minimum of eight percent of UC's enrollment
must be black. If there are not enough black applicants whose
academic records are competitive enough to assure their group
enrollment at a rate of eight percent of the student body, then
some remedy must be found. 
<P>
That remedy, it turns out, is to lower admissions standards, but
only for members of the groups that are not naturally filling
their quota. Can anyone imagine selecting the members of a professional
sports team, a symphony orchestra or a hospital surgical staff
in this manner?
<P>
And it's not just the University of California. Cheryl Hopwood,
who applied to the University of Texas Law School in 1992, confident
that her credentials were up to the school's standards. When she
was rejected, her first reaction was surprise coupled with resignation.
&quot;The only thing I could think of,&quot; she said, &quot;was
that the class the school admitted must have been very, very good.&quot;
<P>
In fact, however, that year's group of applicants was not substantially
better than those of years before. Just as in the case of Yang-pat
Au, many applicants with credentials far lower than hers were
admitted.<SUP>3</SUP>
<P>
The University of Texas Law School, like almost every law or professional
school in the country, attempts to enroll a minimum number of
students from certain prefered groups; in particular, school policy
mandates that 15 percent of the Law School class must be black
and Mexican American. 
<P>
Since enough members of those groups don't meet this quota through
open competition with applicants at large, standards must be-and
are-lowered to ensure that the 15 percent target is met. Simple
common sense tells us that when you have a finite number of any
commodity-in this case seats in an entering class-and you reserve,
or &quot;set aside,&quot; a portion of it for a favored group,
then people not lucky enough to be in that group are bound to
be squeezed out on no other basis than their group membership.
<P>
And so Cheryl Hopwood, who was not one of the lucky ones, was
denied admission to law school while 84 applicants with lower
grades and test scores, but who were members of the prefered groups,
were admitted.
<P>
It is important to understand the significance of dividing people
into groups for such purposes. It is nothing less that the denial
of the central principle upon which America was founded, and from
which all of our laws and institutions radiate, or used to radiate.
That is the principle of equality, the equality of each individual
citizen before the law. 
<P>
The Declaration of Independence states that &quot;all men are
created equal,&quot; but the proponents of quotas would rewrite
that famous phrase to say rather that all groups are created equal.
So when their material conditions vary, it is seen as a result
of racism or policy or both and as such must be remedied by policies
directed at the raising up of such afflicted groups, through the
granting of special, extra rights. It even gets to the point where
already successful or wealthy members of such groups get these
same &quot;extra rights.&quot;
<P>
But in truth it is only individual human beings that are equal,
and only in one, very specific sense: they are all equally human
beings, with equal human dignity and the equal rights to be governed
only with their consent, and to &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.&quot; 
<P>
These rights are not guaranteed to groups, because they do not-and
cannot-belong to groups. But they do belong to individuals, regardless
of race, religion or anything else, and it is the first business
of government to secure them. The most famous word ever used to
describe this understanding of government is &quot;colorblind.&quot;
It was coined by Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan in
his ringing dissent from the shameful 1897 Plessy decision, in
which the court upheld constitutionality of racial segregation.
<P>
Clearly, Yang-pat Au and Cheryl Hopwood were not treated according
to the principle of colorblindedness. Affirmative action policies
explicitly repudiate this principle as outmoded or even pernicious.
And the people who administer the policies will go to great lengths
to demonstrate their contempt for it. 
<P>
The examples can get bizarre. James Henry, owner of a Columbus,
Ohio, painting company used to do quite a lot of business with
the Ohio State University. Not anymore. His first indication that
things were changing was in 1983, when he was told that he could
not bid on a coming contract, because it was being reserved for
bidding by minority firms only. 
<P>
By 1989, Henry was shut out altogether from bidding on University
jobs, because the school had decided that to meet a general 15
percent set aside on all contracting, it would have to impose
a 100 percent set aside for painting contracts.<SUP>4</SUP>
<P>
This is indeed color-consciousness raised to new and offensive
levels. But there are even more bizarre cases. And it is true
even of such policies that do not require outright quotas, but
that nevertheless make legal distinctions along racial group lines.
We may call such policies preferences. They differ from quotas
only in degree and not in kind; both types of policy are based
on the same denial of colorblind justice. Most examples of merely
preferential policies have to do with hiring, and especially promotion,
or contracting. It is most prevalent in government agencies, particularly
police and fire departments.
<P>
Danny O'Connor learned this firsthand. He was not promoted because
his department decided, in the name of affirmative action, to
arbitrarily place a black candidate into every third spot on the
list. Seven of the original 75 top candidates were black, but
26 blacks were promoted, at least 19 of whom had a lower ranking
than O'Connor. 
<P>
And as for Randy Perch, the U.S. Department of Transportation
very vigilantly enforces a law that requires a certain portion
of federal contracting dollars be &quot;set aside&quot; (the government's
language) for minority- and women-owned firms. So the job for
which Perch submitted the low bid went to a firm that submitted
a higher bid but was owned by a member of a government-prefered
group.<SUP>5</SUP>
<P>
But perhaps the most outrageous example of preferential treatment
based solely on race is the case of Sharon Taxman, formerly a
typing teacher at Piscataway High School in New Jersey. Facing
a decline in enrollment in &quot;business education&quot; classes,
the school board decided to lay off one teacher. It came down
to two teachers, Taxman and Debra Williams, both of whom had been
hired at the same time and whose performance records were similar.
Taxman was laid off. 
<P>
Why her and not Williams? Bad luck? Perhaps, if you can ascribe
the result of a specific policy to chance: Taxman is white and
Williams is black, and the school board figured that, in the interest
of affirmative action, it would be more socially responsible to
retain the black teacher and let go of the white. 
<P>
This decision captures the essence of what affirmative action
is all about. In dismissing an employee solely on the basis of
race, the board followed, to the letter, the contemporary denial
of individual rights and equality in favor of the idea of group
rights. Goodbye, color-blindedness.
<P>
But perhaps that is too hasty. To be sure, the status of colorblindedness
in the contemporary justice system is degraded indeed, but recent
court decisions, some of them centering on the very cases described
in this paper, show rays of hope. Also, more and more people are
beginning to understand how patenly unfair quotas and prefences
are to individuals and how harmful they are to the rule of law.
<P>
This is in no small part due to the prevalence of cases just like
those outlined above, and to the increasing public scrutiny such
cases are getting. We should hope that they continue to be exposed,
lest our nation never return to the one understanding of rights
that not only promises but also can actually deliver, liberty
and justice for all.
<P>
And there is reason to think that we will. It has been said that
Americans have &quot;a passion for fairness,&quot; and that precisely
this passion made the victories of the Civil Rights Movement possible.
This is certainly true. But now that passion is being twisted
and abused. The government treats its citizens unequally, and
in the name of fairness, no less. It should not be able to do
this. The fact that it does shows that it no longer respects its
own first principles and founding premises. 
<P>
And if governement does not, there is nothing to stop it from
treating people in any respect it wishes, and a people so treated,
or even in principle subject to such treatment, are not free.
<P>
The fate of free government depends on Americans' &quot;passion
for fairness&quot; reasserting itself in the name of equality
properly understood, which means bringing about an end to quotas
and preferences and all the related double-talk. <BR>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;At the heart . . . of the Equal Protection
Clause lies the principle that the Government must treat citizens
as individuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic or religious
groups. It is for this reason that we must subject all racial
classifications to the strictest of scrutiny....&quot;</FONT></I>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>- Justice Clarence Thomas<BR>

<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 represented the completion of a long
process to fulfill the promise of &quot;equal protection of the
laws&quot; that had been embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment
(1868). The Civil Rights Act was comprehensive: Title II prohibited
discrimination in public accommodations; Title VI outlawed discrimination
in universities and colleges receiving federal funds; and Title
VII ended discrimination in employment. Its commands were simple:
it was illegal to discriminate against &quot;any individual&quot;
on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national
origin. The principle that animated the Act was &quot;equal opportunity,&quot;
the idea that individual merit rather than the caste of race or
ethnicity should be the standard of distributive justice in the
nation's laws. No more powerful expression of a commitment to
equal opportunity can be found in the annals of modern legislation
anywhere in the world.
<P>
Between 1868 and 1964 considerable progress had been made in driving
race and ethnicity from the Constitution and laws. This progress
proceeded under the banner that the Constitution was color-blind
and that the laws of the nation were not entitled to inquire into
the race or ethnicity of individuals who were subject to the laws.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the culmination of a long campaign
to banish race, color, ethnicity, religion and sex from the law.
Its purpose was noble and its reach was extensive. The focus was
on the rights of individuals; its promise was the equal protection
of equal rights. With the passage of the Act, the civil rights
movement &quot;celebrated the formal achievement of its historic
objectives: a legal regime from which racial classifications had
been largely expunged, and under which the most salient forms
of private discrimination (in public accommodations and employment)
were finally prohibited.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUP>
Indeed, it can be fairly said that &quot;[l]iberals believed in
1964 that the Constitution imposed a rule of color blindness on
government; and a color-blind standard, for most civil rights
advocates, was the obvious choice to govern those areas of private
conduct addressed by the new legislation.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The congressional debate over the Civil Rights Act was the longest
in our history. Many opponents expressed the fear that Title VII
of the Act would eventually be interpreted to require racial quota
hiring to maintain racial balance. Its proponents vehemently denied
this charge. Senator Hubert Humphrey, the floor leader in the
Senate, stated that, 
<P>
[t]he truth is that this title forbids discrimination against
anyone on account of race. This is the simple and complete truth
about Title VII. Contrary to the allegations of some opponents
of this title, there is nothing in it that will give any power
to the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission or to any court
to require hiring, firing, or promotion of employees in order
to meet a racial &quot;quota&quot; or to achieve a certain racial
balance. That bugaboo has been brought up a dozen times; but it
is nonexistent. In fact, the very opposite is true. Title VII
prohibits discrimination. In effect, it says that race, religion
and national origin are not to be used as the basis for hiring
and firing. Title VII is designed to encourage hiring on the basis
of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
And in the peroration of his speech, Senator Humphrey sought once
again to assure the opponents of the Act that their fears of racial
quotas and preferences were misplaced: &quot;It is claimed that
the bill would require racial quotas for all hiring, when in fact
it provided that race shall not be a basis for making personnel
decisions.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>4</FONT></SUP> 
<P>
Senator Joseph S. Clark, floor manager for Title VII, was even
more explicit when he remarked that, 
<P>
it has been asserted that Title VII would impose a requirement
for 'racial balance.&quot;.... On the contrary, any deliberate
attempt to maintain a given balance would almost certainly run
afoul of Title VII because it would involve a failure or refusal
to hire some individual because of his race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin. What Title VII seeks to accomplish, what
the civil rights bill seeks to accomplish is equal treatment for
all.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>5<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
But once the Civil Rights Act was given over to the bureaucrats
in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to write the rules
and regulations for its enforcement, racial proportionality became
the test for &quot;non-discrimination.&quot; And, by and large,
the federal courts were complicit in approving the use of racial
quotas. Thus, an Act that was designed to prohibit racial discrimination
in a wide range of activities was transformed into one that required
racial discrimination. Equal opportunity became racial preference.
<P>
Affirmative action has a similar history. It began innocently
enough-indeed with justifiable altruism. At its inception affirmative
action was designed to ensure non-discrimination in the awarding
of government contracts. Affirmative action in this original sense
sought to enlarge the pool of applicants to ensure equal access.
In the sense that affirmative action is understood to mean casting
a wider net for applicants, it is arguably in the service of equal
opportunity. But the argument of this study is that affirmative
action in the hands of bureaucrats has come to focus on results
rather than opportunity, which has led directly to racial goals
and quotas. In other words, if the putative argument is that an
affirmative action program merely enlarges the pool of applicants,
the inevitable question that arises is &quot;how do we know when
the pool is large enough?&quot; If the results are not racially
proportional the inference is inevitable: the pool is still not
large enough. Only racially or ethnically proportional results
are evidence that &quot;genuine&quot; equal opportunity has been
achieved. Even the original affirmative action order, Executive
Order 11246, which speaks only of equal rights and of non-discrimination,
was immediately interpreted to require quotas. 
<P>
When President Clinton said that he wanted to &quot;mend&quot;
affirmative action rather than &quot;end&quot; it he was searching
for a non-existent middle ground. The Civil Rights Act of 1964
focused on individual rights; affirmative action programs, because
they aim at race proportional results, focus on racial class rights
and ignore the rights of individuals. There is no mending to be
done without rejecting this perversion of the American Creed.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>RACIAL PREFERENCES AND </B>
<P>
<B>&quot;THE AMERICAN CREED&quot;<BR>
</B>
<P>
NOTHING IN THE LAST 50 YEARS has harmed racial relations nor done
more to undermine the principle of equal protection of the laws
than racial preferences and racial quotas. Paul M. Sniderman,
a political scientist at Stanford University and Thomas Piazza,
a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley, have
documented that &quot;the new race-conscious agenda&quot; represented
by affirmative action programs &quot;has provoked broad outrage
and resentment.&quot; 
<P>
Racial preferences are so intensely disliked that they have led
some whites to dislike blacks--an ironic example of a policy
meant to put the divide of race behind us in fact further widening
it.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>6</FONT></SUP> Sniderman and Piazza
demonstrate, however, that racial animus is not the principal
cause of the anger and resentment. Rather, they have discovered
in their exhaustive analysis of racial attitudes that racial class
preferences offend the &quot;set of convictions about fairness
and fair play that make up the American Creed.&quot; And, as Sniderman
and Piazza rightly note, the principles of &quot;liberty and equality&quot;
form the basis of the Creed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>7</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Although unacknowledged by Sniderman and Piazza, the core principles
of &quot;liberty and equality&quot; derive from the founding principles
of the nation. The authors of the Declaration of Independence
enunciated the principles that would animate the new nation. For
our purposes here, it is important to note that the Declaration's
principle that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; means that
individuals are possessed of the natural rights to &quot;life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; These rights exist
by nature--they are not created by government. 
<P>
Indeed, legitimate government is derived from the &quot;consent
of the governed&quot; and instituted with the sole purpose of
protecting natural rights. Government, therefore, must be limited;
it exists only to secure the conditions that allow for the exercise
of rights. 
<P>
Thus government's function is to secure the equal protection of
equal rights by laws that operate equally on all citizens. And
the necessary foundation of the rule of law is &quot;equal protection
of the laws,&quot; a concept embodied in the principles of the
founding and articulated in the Fourteenth Amendment. No class
or caste barriers to the exercise of rights can be tolerated;
there must be equal opportunity for individuals regardless of
their race, ethnicity or religion. 
<P>
But the principle of equal opportunity does not guarantee equality
of results; indeed, the principle of equal opportunity looks forward
to inequality of results, but an inequality of results that is
not based on artificial class or caste status. Rather, the principle
of equal opportunity allows the full development of the natural
talents and abilities of individuals. The practical import of
the nation's founding principles is to enshrine equal opportunity
in the exercise of rights as the basic principle of &quot;fairness
and fair play.&quot; This principle is, of course, undermined
by a system that apportions rewards, not on the basis of individual
merit, but on the basis of race and ethnicity.
<P>
Preferential programs are premised on the notion that rights belong
to racial and ethnic groups, that an individual's rights are conditioned
by the racial or ethnic class that he inhabits. This notion comes
very close to establishing a caste system based on race and ethnicity
that is wholly alien to the principles of the American regime.
It has more in common with a system based on racial apartheid
than it does with a liberal democracy dedicated to the protection
of individual rights through the rule of law. 
<P>
As Sniderman and Piazza note, &quot;[w]hat gives the race-conscious
agenda its distinctive character, what makes the agenda open to
challenge morally, is that the principle of preferential treatment
runs against the Creed.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></SUP>
<P>
According to Sniderman and Piazza, the tremendous gains of the
civil rights movement were due to the fact that it sought equal
treatment for blacks and whites. This was &quot;consistent with
the American Creed.&quot; But on the &quot;heels of its greatest
successes, the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and [the Voting Rights
Act of] 1965, the voices of separatism began to drown out those
of integration.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT></SUP> 
<P>
Once the civil rights movement abandoned the American Creed, transforming
itself from a movement advocating and securing equal rights for
all individuals to one advocating racial preferences and quotas,
it lost much of the support that it had enjoyed in the opinion
of the majority. Opposition to racial quotas is not driven by
racial animus; rather it is driven by a desire to preserve the
principles that animate the American Creed--those principles
that protect the equal rights of every individual. Sniderman and
Piazza conclude from their comprehensive survey of racial attitudes
that &quot;[a]ffirmative action--defined to mean preferential
treatment--has become the chief item on the race-conscious
agenda. It produces resentment and disaffection not because it
assists blacks--substantial numbers of whites are prepared
to support a range of policies to see blacks better off--but
because it is judged to be unfair.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>10</FONT></SUP>
But &quot;[i]t is . . . simply wrong,&quot; Sniderman and Piazza
caution, &quot;to suppose that the primary factor driving the
contemporary arguments over the politics of race is white racism.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>11
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
<B>THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION<BR>
</B>
<P>
PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO RACIAL PREFERENCES and quotas has been constant
since the inception of affirmative action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>12</FONT></SUP>
A recent poll commissioned by the Washington Post, the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University, found that a
vast majority of whites (86 percent), and substantial majorities
among blacks (68 percent), Hispanics (78 percent) and Asians (74
percent) believe that &quot;hiring, promotion and college admissions
should be based strictly on merit and qualifications other than
race or ethnicity.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>13</FONT></SUP> Similarly,
numerous Gallup polls conducted between 1977 and 1990 consistently
showed that more than 80 percent of the nation's population reject
racial quotas and preferences &quot;to make up for past discrimination.&quot;
One analyst concludes that &quot;it is clear that, over a period
of 40 years, the widespread acceptance of segregation and racial
discrimination among white Americans has given way to massive
support for the general principles of integration and equal treatment.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>14</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Insofar as affirmative action is understood as mandating racial
preferences, racial quotas and racial set-asides, public opinion
overwhelming opposes it. Rather, there seems to be an overwhelming
attachment to the principle of merit understood in terms of equal
opportunity. In California, surveys published by the Los Angeles
Times in March and May, 1995 showed that whites (71 percent),
Asians (54 percent) and Latinos (52 percent), as well as a substantial
number of blacks (45 percent) support the California Civil Rights
Initiative, a November, 1996 ballot initiative that will end state-sponsored
racial preferences and racial quotas. What is more, the May, 1995
poll found a substantial majority of women favoring the initiative.

<P>
IT WAS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT affirmative action could have served
the principle of non-discrimination without the use of racial
quotas. Had affirmative action merely meant that the government
would act to insure that only the most qualified individuals were
being hired, promoted, given contracts and admitted to universities,
the law would have remained colorblind. This could have been accomplished
through a system of rigorous audits and reviews. All qualified
minorities would have been confident that in hiring and admissions
decisions only the most qualified were selected. 
<P>
Even this would have required that individuals be regarded in
a completely color-blind manner and not viewed through the lens
of racial proportionality. Had affirmative action maintained this
high ground of principle, no constitutional objections could have
been lodged against it. But what is commonly known as affirmative
action today has nothing of this optimism, having lapsed into
a kind of cynical racial spoils system.
<P>
According to supporters of this system, the test of non-discrimination
is &quot;population parity.&quot; If blacks make up 15 percent
of the population, then they should make up 15 percent of each
university class; this is the only way to insure that discrimination
has not been a factor in the admissions process. When &quot;population
parity&quot; has not occurred, there should be &quot;remedial
action&quot; consisting of relaxed admissions standards or other
non-competitive devices to insure &quot;parity.&quot; In other
words, affirmative action is inseparable from the notion of racial
quotas whenever it assumes that lack of &quot;population parity&quot;
is proof of racial discrimination. The notion of &quot;population
parity&quot; sets the quota. And those who try to distinguish
between goals and quotas are simply obfuscating the issue. Goals
are quotas-no amount of artful dodging can obscure this fact.
<P>
It was more than 30 years ago that the proponents of racial preferences
and quotas assured a skeptical world that they would only be a
temporary measure designed to ensure genuine equality of opportunity.
Today, however, affirmative action is unabashedly looked upon
by their supporters as a means of securing racial class entitlements.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>16</FONT></SUP>
In the palmy days when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed,
everyone seemed optimistic that the final vestiges of race consciousness
had been removed from the laws of the nation. Indeed, many saw
the Act as a legislative endorsement of Justice Harlan's dissent
in the infamous Plessy case, the case that upheld the constitutionality
of the justly decried &quot;separate but equal doctrine.&quot;
In his dissent, Justice Harlan had remarked that,
<P>
Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates
classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens
are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most
powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of
his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed
by the supreme law of the land are involved. It is, therefore
to be regretted that this high tribunal, the final expositor of
the fundamental law of the land, has reached the conclusion that
it is competent for a State to regulate the enjoyment by citizens
of their civil rights solely upon the basis of race.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>17
<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Harlan's dissent had provided a kind of moral standard that steadily
worked toward the eventual demise of the &quot;separate but equal
doctrine.&quot; Indeed, the idea of a color-blind constitution
was the source of tremendous progress in subsequent years; while
that progress might have moved by fits and starts and at too slow
a pace, no one can doubt that between 1896 and the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 the Constitution had indeed become color-blind. But
as more than one observer has pointed out, racial quotas and preferences
are precisely the kind of &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine
that was condemned by Harlan's dissenting opinion.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>18</FONT></SUP>
Justice Harry Blackmun, in his separate opinion in Regents of
the University of California v. Bakke, stated the connection between
affirmative action and Plessy's &quot;separate but equal doctrine&quot;
as clearly as it possibly could have been stated:
<P>
I suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an affirmative-action
program in a racially neutral way and have it successful. To ask
that this be so is to demand the impossible. In order to get beyond
racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other
way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat
them differently. We cannot-we dare not-let the Equal Protection
Clause perpetuate racial supremacy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>19<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Blackmun could have used the word &quot;separately&quot; in place
of &quot;differently&quot; without changing the meaning of the
sentence in any respect. In order to treat people equally, they
must be treated separately (&quot;differently&quot;): this is
the explicit meaning of the racial quotas and preferences that
form the core of results-oriented affirmative action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>20</FONT></SUP>
It is a new kind of segregation; this time, however, its supporters
believe that the genie of race can be released once again from
its bottle as a force for good. At almost the eleventh hour--indeed
almost contemporaneously with the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act--the civil rights movement abandoned the principles that
had served it so well. It was believed that new principles would
better serve the cause of human liberty and serve that cause more
quickly. But those new principles turned out to be nothing more
than the revival of the old system of &quot;separate but equal&quot;
and race segregation. 
<P>
The racial genie, after having finally been confined by powerful
constitutional restraints, was released once again. To say that
this was a dangerous move is a vast understatement. In the past,
the racial genie had always been a force for evil--there is
no reason to believe that it has miraculously changed its ways.
In fact, as Sniderman and Piazza have pointed out, there is much
evidence to suppose that the genie of race is the same one that
the nation struggled to put back in its bottle--it has not
changed its nature nor its evil ways. But today, its work is made
easier by the apologists of the new &quot;separate but equal&quot;
doctrine, because they portray the new racism--and the supposedly
new genie--as the best that liberal and enlightened opinion
can produce.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>DOES RACE MATTER?<BR>
</B>
<P>
IT HAS BEEN ARGUED BY SUPPORTERS of racial preferences that race
has always been a factor in the calculus of American politics
and American life and that it is naive or dishonest to believe
that the Constitution and the laws can be administered in a color-blind
manner. &quot;Race matters,&quot; we are told, and American society
will never get beyond racism. It is better to be straightforward
about the necessity of racial class consciousness and understand
it for what it is--racial classification to promote racial
class interests.
<P>
This view, of course, has never been a part of the political calculus
in America. Slavery, racial segregation, and racial discrimination
were always considered as a violation of America's deepest held
principles. Martin Luther King's dream that someday his children
would be &quot;judged on the content of their character and not
on the color of their skin&quot; was made possible by those principles
which ultimately derive from the fact that &quot;all men are created
equal.&quot; Abraham Lincoln, whose statesmanship also helped
make King's dream possible, called this principle of natural human
equality &quot;the father of all moral principle in us.&quot;
Lincoln insisted that the Declaration of Independence contained
&quot;the standard maxims of a free society.&quot; In 1857, he
said:
<P>
I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include
all men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all
respects. They did not mean to say all were equal in color, size,
intellect, moral developments, or social capacity. They defined
with tolerable distinctness, in what respects they did consider
all men created equal--equal in &quot;certain inalienable
rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;
This they said, and this they meant. 
<P>
They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were
then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were
about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact they had no
power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the
right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances
should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free
society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all;
constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though
never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby
constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting
the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.
<BR>
<P>
It was surely in this spirit that the nation adopted the Declaration
of Independence as the principled foundation of its political
life. And it was in this spirit that the nation fought a bloody
civil war over the morality and policy of slavery; ratified the
Thirteenth Amendment to abolish slavery; ratified the Fourteenth
Amendment to extend equal protection of the laws to all citizens;
passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Voting Rights Act of
1965; and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Those who argue that &quot;race
matters&quot;--that race provides the only principle of distributive
justice--simply reject the principles of the Founders, Abraham
Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr.<BR>

<P>
<B>FROM EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO EQUALITY OF RESULT<BR>
</B>
<P>
IN 1954, BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION outlawed segregation in public
schools; later cases did the same for other public facilities.
Some have argued that Brown was the vindication of Harlan's Plessy
dissent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>21</FONT></SUP> In a similar vein, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 was said to have been based on the reasoning
of Brown and its progeny. In short, the Civil Rights Act represented
the national recognition of the principle of a color-blind constitution
and color-blind laws. The Act prohibited discrimination against
any individual in employment or in public accommodations on the
basis of race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex or national origin.
It had provisions to extend its reach to private companies with
more than 25 employees and to any educational institution that
received federal funds.
<P>
The important point, however, is that the plain language of the
Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination against individuals,
not racial or ethnic classes. In focusing upon the rights of individuals,
the Civil Rights Act was a perfect expression of the Fourteenth
Amendment's attempt to disallow racial considerations as the basis
for determining the rights of individuals. As the Supreme Court
once noted, the &quot;rights created by the...Fourteenth Amendment
are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established
are personal rights.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>22</FONT></SUP> Indeed,
the Civil Rights Act contained provisions disallowing the use
of racial preferences or quotas of any kind. The language could
not possibly be more explicit:
<P>
It shall be unlawful employment practice for any employer...to
discriminate against any individual because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex or national origin....Nothing contained
in this title shall be interpreted to require any employer to
grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group
because of race...on account of an imbalance which may exist with
respect to the total number or percentage of persons employed...
in comparison with the available work force.<BR>
<P>
But the ink of President Lyndon Johnson's signature had barely
dried when the movement to use racial quotas and preferences in
the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act began. Indeed, the goal
was to transform a law which prohibited discrimination against
individuals into one that required discrimination. The supposed
rationale was to use race as a means of &quot;getting beyond race,&quot;
to hasten the end of discrimination by engaging in acceptable
forms of discrimination now understood as racial class remedies
for past racial class injuries. Johnson gave the first call to
release the genie of race from the confines that had been created
by the Civil Rights Act. Speaking before an audience at Howard
University on June 4, 1965 Johnson said:
<P>
Freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of centuries
by saying now you're free to go where you want and do as you desire
and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a person who
for years has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him
up to the starting line of a race and then say, you're free to
compete with the others, and justly believe that you have been
completely fair.
<P>
Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All
our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.
<P>
This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for
civil rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek
not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as
a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a
result....
<P>
To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not
enough.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>23<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The sweep of this pronouncement was breathtaking: &quot;Freedom
is not enough.&quot; Freedom--equal opportunity--is not
enough because it may not produce &quot;equality as a result.&quot;
Restrictions on the freedom of some, therefore, will be the condition
for the advancement of others--those who came to be known
in legal jargon as belonging to &quot;specially protected classes&quot;
or &quot;preferred classes.&quot; Indeed, &quot;coercive remedies&quot;
were to become the favorite instrument of the vast bureaucracy
that was created to administer racial quotas and preferences.
Eventually, the courts, the Congress and both Democratic and Republican
Presidents became complicit in this enterprise to restructure
society based on racial class principles.
<P>
Equality of result and &quot;population parity&quot; are the concepts
that drive racial preferences and quotas. These concepts assume
that, absent discrimination, the races will freely arrange themselves
in the various aspects of political and private life in exact
racial proportionality to their numbers in society at large. When
this does not happen, the cause is presumed to be racial discrimination.
<P>
But, of course, when people are free they will never sort themselves
out in exact racial proportionality in their choice of jobs and
university attendance. Since the presumption is that lack of proportionality
is always caused by racial discrimination, the only way discrimination
can be overcome is to curtail the freedom of the decision makers.
Coercive remedies, whether imposed by administrative bureaucracies
or courts, have the purpose of forcing racial quotas upon society
at large. For the minions of the administrative state, racial
proportionality is the only proof of non-discrimination.
<P>
This policy, rather than seeking out actual discrimination and
working to redress it, instead presumes discrimination on the
part of everyone and fashions remedies based on this presumption.
This situation presents the alarming possibility of a nation that
may one day consider all civil rights to be nothing more than
racial class entitlements. 
<P>
But any nation with the slightest regard for the lessons of history
would never self-consciously allow itself to regard the rights
of individuals as nothing more than the by-product of racial class
interests. Despite assurances by proponents that the ultimate
purpose of racial preferences is to get beyond racial classifications,
it is clear that no system that requires racial classifications
for its operation can result in a decline in racialist thinking--indeed,
racial consciousness is exacerbated by racial preferences and
quotas because it promotes the dangerous idea that an individual's
interest is determined by his race. Those who advocate policies
based on racial consciousness simply have not thought out the
consequences, believing, no doubt, that a means can never become
the end itself. But that is exactly what has happened in the case
of affirmative action.
<P>
In its early years, the use of racial quotas and preferences was
based merely upon an executive order that required &quot;affirmative
action&quot; in the awarding of federal contracts. Actually, the
executive orders had begun as early as the Franklin Roosevelt
administration as a device to insure non-discrimination in the
awarding of federal contracts. Under the Johnson and Nixon administrations,
they became the vehicle for requiring racial discrimination in
the awarding of federal contracts. 
<P>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance in the Labor Department,
created in 1965 to oversee Johnson's Executive Order 11246, developed
into a huge bureaucracy to administer affirmative action--affirmative
action that was now understood to require the use of race to enforce
the belief that &quot;freedom is not enough.&quot; 
<P>
As historian Herman Belz has noted, in the hands of the administrators
at OFCC &quot;[a]ffirmative action in contract compliance was
directed at collective social and institutional discrimination,
rather than individual discriminatory acts . . . Implicitly resting
on the theory of disparate impact discrimination, the executive
order program constituted a simpler and more direct form of government
coercion than Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] enforcement
because it was not concerned with the legal question of the meaning
of unlawful discrimination.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>24</FONT></SUP>
OFCC operations were greatly expanded in the Nixon administration,
where affirmative action developed into &quot;a politically motivated
policy of racial preference.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>25</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had been charged with
writing the rules and regulations to enforce the prohibitions
against employment discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. Not surprisingly, the EEOC took a race-based remedial
approach to the problem of employment discrimination. 
<P>
Belz says that the EEOC was &quot;more ideologically militant&quot;
than OFCC, and that &quot;despite the very limited nature of its
authority&quot; it &quot;revised the basic principles of employment
discrimination law and began the transformation of equality of
opportunity into equality of result.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>26</FONT></SUP>
The courts also accepted the EEOC's reinterpretation of the Civil
Rights Act to require racial proportionality--called &quot;disparate
impact&quot;--as a test of non-discrimination. The courts
developed the view that the Civil Rights Act was only designed
to protect members of &quot;discrete and insular&quot; minorities
who could not successfully press their racial class interests
through the majoritarian political process. 
<P>
Congress was disinclined to challenge OFCC and EEOC policies that
were explicitly designed to promote racial class quotas and preferences.
To do so would risk the ire of politically powerful special interest
groups devoted to the promotion of racial interests. Eventually
the Congress joined the racial class approach to distributive
justice when it passed the Minority Business Enterprise provisions
of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE SUPREME COURT AND </B>
<P>
<B>RACIAL PREFERENCES<BR>
</B>
<P>
THE MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISE provisions mandated a 10 percent
set-aside for minority businesses in local public works projects.
The set-asides applied to blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Indians,
and Aleuts. Challenges to the constitutionality of the program
came before the Supreme Court in 1980 in Fullilove v. Klutznick.
Writing for a plurality of the Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger,
a Nixon appointee, wrote:
<P>
It is not a constitutional defect in this program that it may
disappoint the expectations of nonminority firms. When effectuating
a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of
prior discrimination, such &quot;a sharing of the burden&quot;
by innocent parties is not impermissible. The actual &quot;burden&quot;
shouldered by nonminority firms is relatively light.... Moreover,
although we may assume that the complaining parties are innocent
of any discriminatory conduct, it was within congressional power
to act on the assumption that in the past some nonminority businesses
may have reaped competitive benefit over the years from the virtual
exclusion of minority firms from these contracting opportunities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>27</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Incredibly, Burger maintained that injury to &quot;innocent parties&quot;
is permissible when the injury is &quot;relatively light.&quot;
In more heady and perhaps less cynical days, the Supreme Court
always maintained that &quot;[t]he degree of the discrimination
is irrelevant.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>28</FONT></SUP> In other
words, the Court once believed that any violation of constitutional
rights, however slight or &quot;bearable,&quot; offended the Constitution.
Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how there can be &quot;slight&quot;
violations of constitutional rights. 
<P>
Although it may be true that the burden imposed by the MBE provisions
are in some sense &quot;bearable,&quot; it still militates against
the principle of equal protection of the laws--that rights
belong to individuals and not to racial classes. In constitutional
government, principle is everything, for it is precisely adherence
to principle that distinguishes constitutional government from
other kinds of government, and any violation of those principles--however
&quot;slight&quot; or &quot;bearable&quot;--should provoke
alarm among citizens.
<P>
Fullilove provoked a bitter dissent from Justice Stewart, who
wrote that &quot;in the exercise of its powers, Congress must
obey the Constitution....The statute, on its face and in effect...bars
the members of [a] class solely on the basis of their race or
ethnic background. This is precisely the kind of law that the
guarantee of equal protection forbids.&quot; Stewart ended his
dissent with the remark that &quot;[t]here are those who think
that we need a new Constitution, and their views may someday prevail.
But under the Constitution we have, one practice in which government
may never engage is the practice of racism-not even 'temporarily'
and not even as an 'experiment.'&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>29</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In the years after Fullilove, a badly divided Court exhibited
considerable confusion in racial set-aside cases, particularly
with respect to the question of whether rights adhere to individuals
or racial and ethnic groups. In City of Richmond v. Croson (1989),
the Court declared a minority set-aside program to be in violation
of the Equal Protection Clause. The city of Richmond, which has
a 50 percent black population, passed an ordinance that required
non-minority-owned prime contractors who were awarded city construction
contracts to set aside <SUP><FONT SIZE=2>30</FONT></SUP> percent
of the dollar amount of the contract for one or more minority-owned
business enterprises.
<P>
The city alleged no prior discrimination in the award of contracts,
but justified its action as a means of ameliorating society-wide
discriminatory practices. Writing for the Court, Justice O'Connor
concluded that, &quot;[t]o accept Richmond's claim that past societal
discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences
would be to open the door to competing claims for 'remedial relief'
for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal
citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity
and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences
based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs...We think
such a result would be contrary to both the letter and spirit
of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality.&quot;30
<P>
Indeed, it is manifestly clear that there is simply no principled
way to resolve such competing racial and ethnic class claims in
a manner consistent with the rule of law. Justice Kennedy accurately
expressed the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment when
he remarked in his concurring opinion that &quot;the moral imperative
of racial neutrality is the driving force of the Equal Protection
Clause.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>31</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C. (1990), decided scarcely a
year after Croson, raised the issue of racial quotas and racial
preferences in the starkest possible light. (Incidentally, this
was the last major opinion written by Justice William Brennan,
the most liberal member of the Court.) At issue in Metro was the
Federal Communications Commission's policy of giving racial and
ethnic group preferences in the issuance of broadcast licenses.
The purported goal of this policy was not to compensate for past
racial and ethnic discrimination, but simply to foster &quot;broadcast
diversity.&quot; 
<P>
Brennan indicated that the Court would accord extraordinary deference
to the Congress: &quot;It is of overriding significance in these
cases that the FCC's minority ownership programs have been specifically
approved--indeed mandated--by Congress.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>32</FONT></SUP>
A majority of the Court decided to make a radical break with precedent
in holding that the appropriate test for &quot;racial classifications&quot;
was not &quot;strict scrutiny,&quot; but the less demanding &quot;important
governmental interests test.&quot; As Justice Brennan remarked,
<P>
[w]e hold that benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress--even
if those measures are not &quot;remedial&quot; in the sense of
being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal
discrimination-- are constitutionally permissible to the extent
that they serve important governmental objectives within the power
of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those
objectives.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>33<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The novelty of the decision in Metro is breathtaking. Racial classifications
will no longer automatically trigger the most searching judicial
examination if they are purported to benefit members of preferred
racial and ethnic groups. What is more, there is no necessity
of justifying the classifications in terms of providing remedies
for victims of discrimination; nor was there any necessity of
demonstrating that preferential policies to encourage minority
ownership would in fact lead to programming &quot;diversity.&quot;
It is enough, Brennan wrote, that &quot;both Congress and the
FCC maintain simply that expanded minority ownership of broadcast
outlets will, in the aggregate, result in broadcast diversity.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>34</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Assuming, arguendo, that &quot;broadcast diversity&quot; serves
important governmental interests, there seems to be some doubt
even in Brennan's mind that the means chosen by the FCC to promote
&quot;diversity&quot; are substantially related to that interest.
&quot;While we are under no illusion,&quot; Brennan admitted,
&quot;that members of a particular minority group share some cohesive,
collective viewpoint, we believe it a legitimate inference for
Congress and the Commission to draw that as more minorities gain
ownership and policymaking roles in the media, varying perspectives
will be more fairly represented on the airwaves.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>35</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Assuming that members of racial or ethnic groups share the same
opinions and viewpoints would, of course, partake of the kind
of &quot;impermissible stereotyping&quot; that the Court had previously
ruled was disallowed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. But as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her dissenting
opinion, when the FCC wanted to undertake a study to determine
whether the nexus between minority ownership and broadcast diversity
existed to any significant degree, &quot;Congress barred the FCC's
attempt to initiate that examination&quot; through its control
over &quot;appropriations measures.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>36</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Without a clear demonstration of the nexus, however, the race-conscious
policy cannot be said to serve an important government interest.
The racial classifications in the FCC policy were thus merely
based on assumptions and inferences. One does not have to be well
steeped in the lessons of history to see the danger of using racial
classifications in such an open and exploitive manner.
<P>
Brennan concluded his majority opinion in Metro by repeating the
arguments in Fullilove that the racial policies involved in the
FCC programs do not &quot;impose impermissible burdens on nonminorities.&quot;
Of course, &quot;innocent persons may be called upon&quot; to
bear the burden of eradicating the present effects of past discrimination,
a discrimination in which they played no role. This is all acceptable
within the universe of the new &quot;separate but equal&quot;
doctrine because policies such as those of the FCC do &quot;not
impose an undue burden on non-minorities.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>37</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In practice, however, the FCC policy of allowing &quot;minority-led
investor groups&quot; to bid on licenses had led, not indeed to
broadcast diversity, but to buying and selling of licenses at
extraordinary profits for investors from preferred racial and
ethnic groups. Many wealthy minorities have reaped tidy profits
from this policy, including Julius Erving, O.J. Simpson and Colin
Powell. 
<P>
Following revelations that the FCC policy would lead to obscene
profits and tax breaks for a former general counsel to the FCC
who was heading a &quot;minority led investor group,&quot; Congress,
in February, 1995, passed a bill--signed with the greatest
reluctance by President Clinton--repealing the FCC program.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>38</FONT></SUP>
Although the Republican-led Congress has recently given up its
attempt to pass legislation sponsored by Senator Bob Dole and
Representative Charles Canady to repeal all federal programs--more
than 160!--involving racial preferences, the repeal of the
FCC program could well signal the beginning of a long term project
to eliminate all racial preferences and set-asides from the law.
Both justice and policy demand such a result.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>THE BEGINNING OF THE END </B>
<P>
<B>OF RACIAL PREFERENCES<BR>
</B>
<P>
IN 1995, IT APPEARED THAT THE JUDICIAL TIDE was beginning to turn
against the kind of reckless use of racial classifications that
the Metro Court approved. The Supreme Court has, in recent cases,
squarely faced the issue of whether rights belong to racial and
ethnic groups or to individuals, and it has emphatically decided
in favor of the latter. 
<P>
The Supreme Court, after much confusion and not a little sleight
of hand, has finally decided to honor the original intent of the
Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pena (1995) was the first case. At issue was a Department
of Transportation racial and ethnic set-aside program that provided
financial incentives to general contractors to give sub-contracts
to minorities. Adarand had lost a bid to a minority controlled
subcontractor even though he had submitted the lowest bid for
the project. Minority controlled construction firms have to be
certified by the Small Business Administration as either &quot;socially
disadvantaged&quot; or &quot;economically disadvantaged.&quot;
<P>
SBA regulations, however, presume that members of designated minority
groups--black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian,
Native American and &quot;members of other groups designated from
time to time by SBA&quot;--are &quot;entitled to a race-based
presumption of social and economic disadvantage.&quot; In practice,
many of the minority-controlled construction firms are headed
by wealthy minorities who play the game of racial and ethnic preferences
with consummate skill. Justice O'Connor, writing for a majority
of the Court in Adarand, overruled the Metro Broadcasting decision,
insofar as Metro had established relaxed standards for allowing
the government to classify on the basis of race. The principal
defect of the majority opinion in Metro, according to O'Connor,
was that it failed to recognize
<P>
the basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution protect persons, not groups. It follows from
that principle that all governmental action based on race--a
group classification long recognized as &quot;in most circumstances
irrelevant and therefore prohibited&quot;--should be subjected
to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right
to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. These
ideas have long been central to this Court's understanding of
equal protection, and holding &quot;benign&quot; state and federal
racial classifications to different standards does not square
with them. &quot;[A] free people whose institutions are founded
upon the doctrine of equality&quot;. . . should tolerate no retreat
from the principle that government may treat people differently
because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>39</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
Thus Justice O'Connor reaffirms the principle that was well-known
to both the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and the drafters
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: what offends the Constitution
is classification and segregation by race, and the level of judicial
scrutiny should not be determined by whose racial class interests
are served. 
<P>
Justice Thomas made precisely this point when he remarked in his
concurring opinion that, &quot;I believe that there is a 'moral
[and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate
a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race
in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government
cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect
us as equal before the law.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>40</FONT></SUP>
<P>
In Miller v. Johnson, a redistricting case decided the same term,
the Court came to a similar conclusion: all individuals, regardless
of race, have a constitutional right, stemming from the Equal
Protection Clause, to be free from government actions which segregate
on the basis of race or ethnicity.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>41</FONT></SUP>
<P>
The Adarand and Miller decisions may be the beginning of the dismantling
of the new &quot;seperate but equal&quot; regime. Although not
entirely unambiguous and unequivocal, these decisions give the
country some hope that it may one day look forward to the end
of an egregiously mistaken doctrine that the Constitution allows
so-called &quot;benign&quot; discrimination. 
<P>
The idea that government can engage in &quot;benign discrimination&quot;
to benefit members of &quot;discrete and insular minorities&quot;
has dominated equal protection jurisprudence for a generation.
Courts simply assumed that legislation intended to benefit, rather
than harm, preferred races or ethnic groups provided no grounds
for complaint by injured individuals in the majority racial group.
After all, we were assured, the majority cannot injure itself
as a class. If it can be determined that legislative intent was
remedial in a racial context, then individual members of the majority
cannot claim injury because it is a kind of self-imposed injury,
or at least not an injury suffered at the hands of another racial
class. For those individuals within the majority racial class
who are injured by the operation of &quot;benign discrimination,&quot;
their injury is surely &quot;bearable&quot; or &quot;only slight.&quot;
<P>
This analysis assumes that all members of &quot;discrete and insular&quot;
minorities have suffered racial class injuries and that all members
of the &quot;monolithic&quot; white majority have perpetrated
racial class injuries. As Justice Marshall remarked in his separate
opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, &quot;It
is unnecessary in 20th-century America to have individual Negroes
demonstrate that they have been victims of racial discrimination;
the racism of our society has been so pervasive that none, regardless
of wealth or position, has managed to escape its impact.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>42</FONT></SUP>
<P>
But this class analysis necessarily ignores individuals and the
rights that are intrinsic to individual, rather than class, autonomy.
Class analysis paints with a broad brush that necessarily covers
over the differing situations of the individuals who make up the
class.
<P>
The intrusion of class analysis into equal protection jurisprudence
is a dangerous proposition, one that is clearly at odds with the
principles of the American regime--principles that are ultimately
derived from the proposition that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;
Class considerations explicitly deny this equality because they
necessarily abstract from the individual and ascribe to him class
characteristics that are different--and necessarily unequal--from
those of individuals inhabiting other classes. If there were no
inequalities implicit in class distinctions, such distinctions
would simply be superfluous. In the class analysis of rights,
it is not necessary to show individual injury because in a presumed
racist society all members of so-called &quot;discrete and insular
minorities&quot; are said to have been injured as a class and
all members of the majority are said to have perpetrated racial
class injuries. But, of course, this is a very thin fiction. Black
or Hispanic immigrants who recently arrived in the United States
do not suffer the &quot;present effects of past discrimination,&quot;
any more than the sons or daughters of a wealthy blacks or Hispanics
who have attended elite preparatory schools. To say that these
people--merely because of their membership in a class--must
be deemed to have been injured by the operation of a &quot;monolithic
white majority&quot; is to pile fiction upon fiction. Preferential
admissions programs for the children of wealthy minorities that
are based on the presumption that the children of poor white families
have reaped the benefits of prior discrimination transforms the
rule of law into a farcical comedy. 
<P>
Whenever the government engages in &quot;benign discrimination&quot;
to benefit preferred races or ethnic classes, it imposes injuries
on individuals who are not members of those preferred classes.
It does not alleviate--or excuse--the injury to say that
it is &quot;bearable&quot; or &quot;relatively slight.&quot; Any
injury that must be borne because of membership in a racial or
ethnic class must be forbidden by any reasonable interpretation
of the Equal Protection Clause.
<P>
Justice Powell in his Bakke opinion pointed out the defect of
the class-based analysis of equal protection rights: &quot;There
is a measure of inequity in forcing innocent persons...to bear
the burdens of redressing grievances not of their own making.&quot;
Indeed, using class considerations as a means of fashioning equitable
remedies for such injuries as &quot;historic&quot; discrimination
or &quot;the present effects of past discrimination&quot; will
inevitably destroy the possibility of a jurisprudence based on
constitutional principles. It is only by viewing the Equal Protection
Clause as the guarantor of individual rights, Powell argued, that
the Constitution can ultimately be applied in a non-arbitrary
manner.
<P>
If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection
against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background
because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather
than the individual only because of his membership in a particular
group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.
Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular
classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance .
. .but the standard of justification will remain constant. 
<P>
This is as it should be, since those political judgments are the
product of rough compromise struck by contending groups within
the democratic process. When they touch upon an individual's race
or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination
that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely
tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The Constitution
guarantees that right to every person regardless of his background.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>43</FONT></SUP>
<BR>
<P>
As Powell pointed out, an adherence to a conception of equal protection
that disallows class considerations is the only one possible that
is consistent with the dictates of principled constitutional government.
Anything else simply makes protection of constitutional rights
&quot;vary with the ebb and flow of political forces.&quot;<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>44</FONT></SUP>
<P>
Whenever government acts to distribute scarce resources such as
admission to state universities, preference in awarding of contracts,
awarding of financial incentives, or tax incentives, its principle
of distribution must be reasonable. In apportioning places in
the university, for example, it cannot assign those places in
an arbitrary manner; there must be a rational relationship between
the kinds of persons admitted and the end or purpose of the university.
<P>
It is true that no one has a right to attend the university, but
every individual has a right to be treated equally with respect
to the criteria for admission. The proponents of racial preferences
in California argue that current affirmative action admissions
programs do not admit any minority members to the university system
who are not qualified. It is a well known fact, however, that
the SAT scores of minority admittees at the University of California
are on average nearly 200 points lower than non-minority admittees.
This, of course, is a significant difference in light of the fact
that there is virtual unanimity among experts that SAT scores
are an accurate predictor of success. 
<P>
If the minimum standard of competence is set low enough, then,
of course, everyone is qualified. But the relevant point is that
the most qualified are not admitted under a system of racial preferences.
What could be more irrational and arbitrary in determining admission
to a university? What equal protection of the laws demands is
that individuals have a right to be free from arbitrary and capricious
governmental action. Certainly decisions based on the accidental
characteristic of race and ethnicity are inherently arbitrary.
<P>
A recent Federal court of appeals case has found the racial and
ethnic preferential admission program employed at the University
of Texas Law School to be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's
Equal Protection Clause. The University had employed a segregated
system of evaluation, putting black and Hispanic candidates in
separate pools in which they competed only with members within
their own racial or ethnic pool. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,
relying on the Adarand decision, noted that:
<P>
Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the
use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts,
rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity
fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities
as a group, rather than as individuals.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>45<BR>
</FONT></SUP>
<P>
And in a stinging critique of the separate but equal admissions
process employed by the University of Texas Law School, the court
concluded that &quot;an inference is raised that the program was
the result of racial social engineering rather than a desire to
implement a remedy.&quot;<SUP>46</SUP> In July, 1996, the Supreme
Court refused to grant certiorari to review the decision. This
has sparked much speculation as to the Supreme Court's motive
for the refusal. It requires only four members of the Supreme
Court to grant the petition for review. 
<P>
Surely the four dissenters in the Adarand case who wholeheartedly
support racial goals and preferences would want to try to overturn
the lower court's decision. But it is possible that they believed
that this was the wrong case to review given the current make-up
of the Supreme Court. Another strong decision striking down the
use of racial and ethnic quotas would make it more difficult to
restore them in the future. Perhaps the four Adarand dissenters
hope that a second Clinton administration will have the opportunity
to appoint pro-preference, pro-quota justices to the Court-thus
the delaying tactics.<BR>

<P>
<B>THE FUTURE OF RACIAL </B>
<P>
<B>PREFERENCES IN CALIFORNIA<BR>
</B>
<P>
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER among the States in restoring equal
protection rights to all its citizens. The Regents of the University
of California last year took the bold step of outlawing racial
preferences in admissions and hiring. The firestorm of protest
that was occasioned by this decision indicates the degree to which
entrenched interests have become attached to the regime of racial
preferences and quotas. Governor Pete Wilson also took a courageous
step in rescinding all executive orders that mandated quota hiring,
racial set-asides in contracting, and other race-based programs.
Most importantly, however, the people of the State of California
will, for the first time, be asked to vote on the issue of racial
preferences in a November, 1996 constitutional amendment initiative,
the California Civil Rights Initiative. CCRI attempts to do one
simple thing: restore to the California Constitution the understanding
of equal protection rights that animated the passage of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. That act made it unlawful to discriminate
against any individual on the basis of race, color, ethnicity,
religion, sex or national origin. CCRI follows the trend already
taken by United States Supreme Court and supported overwhelmingly
by public opinion. Since California is such a trend-setting State,
the fate of CCRI in November may well determine the future of
equal protection rights in the nation as a whole. 
<P>
Those principles that animated the passage of the Civil Rights
Act are the principles that animated the American regime from
its very inception--in a very real sense, the Civil Rights
Act was a culmination of those principles. CCRI may well determine
whether those principles are to be perpetuated or whether the
country will continue to embrace the regime of racial quotas and
preferences that stands in opposition to the principle that &quot;all
men are created equal.&quot;<BR>

<SUP>16</SUP> An interesting debate has arisen recently in regard
to the uses of racial and ethnic categories by the Census Bureau.
One very hopeful sign for the future of race relations in this
country is the fact that the number of interracial and interethnic
marriages has been steadily increasing. This, of course, provokes
the question of how the children of mixed-race marriages are to
be categorized. Are children who are half black and half white
to be counted as black or white? Proponents of racial class entitlements
do not want to allow the Census Bureau to create &quot;mixed-race&quot;
categories because racial classes--and hence the racial demands
based on those classes--will be &quot;diluted.&quot; A recent
article in the New York Times (July 5, 1996) indicated that the
creation of multiracial categories was opposed by the National
Urban League, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza and the
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. As reported by Linda
Mathews, the objection of these groups &quot;is that the availability
of a multiracial category would reduce the number of Americans
claiming to belong to long-recognized racial minority groups,
dilute the electoral power of these groups and make it more difficult
to enforce the nation's civil rights laws. Dozens of federal programs
. . . depend on racial data from the census.&quot;

<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in<BR> California Government Contracting</B></FONT></P>

<B>Introduction</B><P>

Government contracting is big business.  Federal, state, and local governments award contracts to businesses for everything from constructing buildings to purchasing paper clips.  The government says that a certain percentage of those contracts must go to businesses owned by minorites and women.  But when governments award contracts on the basis of arbitrary distinctions such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred.  Sometimes they are direct costs of preferential programs.  More often, they are indirect costs, caused by the arbitrary exclusion of bidders.  It is the purpose of this paper to examine the financial costs associated with these preferential policies as they specifically impact California government. <P>  

The estimates in this paper are very conservative for several reasons.  First, there are a number of bureaucracies and businesses (e.g., publicly-regulated private utilities) for which information on administrative costs is not readily available, and no attempt is made here to estimate these figures.  Second, qualitative and opportunity costs are incalculable, and no attempt is made to offer estimates in either of these categories. Third, the paper is confined solely to California state government expenditures, and does not account for similar costs incurred through cities, counties and special districts, or through expenditures affected by federal preference programs.  Nor does it discuss the private sector costs due to federal regulation of business practices.  The estimates are for Fiscal Year 1993-94, the most recent year for which complete numbers are available.
<P>

<B>Racial and Gender Preferences in California Government</B><P>

Racial and gender considerations now permeate virtually every aspect of California government, including the awarding of state contracts, the hiring and promotion of state employees, the admission of students to the state's universities, and the funds appropriated for school children.  Just for state acquisition of goods and services, there are at least 45 specific laws for race or gender based preferences, including provisions in the Education, Government, Public Contract, Public Utilities, Streets and Highways, Unemployment Insurance, and Vehicle codes.<P>

For example, under the provisions of Government Code sections 19790-19799, adopted in 1977, all state agencies are required to "overcome any underutilization of minorities and women in their respective organizations," and are required to employ affirmative action officers and to submit annual reports toward compliance with these mandates.<P>

In 1988, the Legislature adopted and Governor Deukmejian signed the most far-reaching legislation affecting the awarding of state contracts (Chapter 61/1988).  In a paradoxical construction, the Legislature first declared that "The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition," and that "Only through full and free competition can free markets, reasonable and just prices, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured."  As if to mock its premise, the act then proceeded to declare in essence that competition for 23 percent of the dollar amount of all state funded contracts should be limited to three arbitrary classes: 15 percent to "minority business enterprises" (MBE's), 5 percent to "women business enterprises" (WBE's), and 3 percent to "disabled veteran business enterprises" (DVBE's).  Although these standards are described as "goals," the act specifically disqualifies from bidding any business which has not gone to extraordinary lengths to attain the requisite race and gender participation percentages, regardless of cost.<SUP>1 </SUP>  Parallel provisions govern regulated utilities administered through the California Public Utilities Commission.  Even state bond counsels are subject to racial and gender preferences.<P>Nowhere are race and gender-based preferences as widespread as they are in the field of education.  For example, the Education Code (sections 87100-87107) requires college districts to hire faculty and staff that "reflect proportionately the adult population of the state," and establishes a "Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund" which in FY 1995-96 spent $2.745 million.<SUP>2 </SUP>  Extraordinary racial and gender based "outreach" programs are pursued by the universities, including separate "racial lists" for admission of college students.<SUP>3 </SUP><P>  Finally, one of the most expensive items in the state's race-based policies is the voluntary desegregation program, in which 45 school districts currently participate.  Although this is not a preference program <I>per se</I>, clearly it is entirely race-based in its application and is neither required by any court order nor justified by any finding of past patterns of racial discrimination.  According to the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), the program would be prohibited by the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would forbid the use of race and gender in the application of the law, and therefore is included within the scope of this paper.<P>

Overlaying all state requirements and programs is a similar web of federal requirements, affecting about 160 federal programs and nationally consuming an estimated $20 billion in direct costs and $96 billion in indirect costs from private and public sectors.<SUP>4 </SUP><P>
<B>The Costs of Race and Gender Preferences</B><P>
The costs of affirmative action can be divided into six general categories: 1) costs to government for administration, enforcement and implementation of race and gender preferences; 2) costs to government from above-market prices caused by reduced competition; 3) costs to government and private sectors for contract delays caused by challenges based on affirmative action requirements; 4) costs to government and private sectors for repairs and replacement due to reduced competition; 5) costs to government and private sectors for compliance with race and gender based requirements; 6) opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. <P>


<B>1. Direct Costs to Government for Administration and Enforcement</B><P>

In order to comply with the myriad of requirements for affirmative action, "a bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been established in virtually every department of California's state government."<SUP>5 </SUP>  The direct costs to the government for administration and enforcement of these regulations is considerable.<P>

In response to a recent inquiry from Governor Pete Wilson to his cabinet secretaries, state agencies estimated their administrative costs for MBE/WBE programs to be $12.763 million for FY 1993-94.<SUP>6 </SUP>  It should be noted that this survey included only those departments under the direct supervision of the governor's office, and did not include the entire education system, which alone accounts for more than half of the state's budget.  Furthermore, there is reason to believe the numbers have been very conservatively estimated.  For example, the State and Consumer Services Agency (SCS) reported to the governor administrative costs of just $2.008 million, yet just one office within SCS, which administers both small business set-asides and racial and gender preferences (the Office of Small and Minority Businesses, within the Department of General Services), spent $2.209 million that year.<SUP>7 </SUP>  Although the entire cost to the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency is estimated at $6.263 million for FY 1993-94, the Department of Transportation alone reported $6.884 million in affirmative action costs the following year.<SUP>8 </SUP><P>The "Faculty and Staff Diversity Fund" of the Community Colleges spent $2.924 million in FY 1993-94 for faculty and staff recruitment.  All race-based programs in the UC and California State University (CSU) systems were $47,174,000 in 1994/95, according to the LAO.<SUP>9 </SUP>  These figures may also be understated.  According to a study by John Attarian, an economist cited in <I>Forbes</I> magazine in 1993, 2.5 percent of the entire general budget of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor is devoted to recruitment and retention of "protected classes."<SUP>10 </SUP>  Applied to the UC, CSU and California Community Colleges, this would amount to $274 million out of the combined $10 billion spent annually in these systems. <P>In 1993-94, California public schools spent $82 million on voluntary desegregation programs,<SUP>11 </SUP> and according to the LAO, public schools and community colleges spend an additional $10 million annually on categorical programs based on race, sex, ethnicity or national origin.<SUP>12 </SUP><P>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) spends $2.8 million annually to administer Public Utilities Code sections 8281-8286.<SUP>13 </SUP> Although this is not an exhaustive list, it is clear from immediately available state documents that the direct governmental costs of these programs amount to at least $155 million annually for the state of California:<P>

<B>2. Costs to Government Due to Above Market Prices</B><P>

State law requires all agencies awarding state-funded contracts to report the amount of those contracts to the Office of Small and Minority Business of the Department of General Services, and to report the amount which was awarded to minority business enterprises (MBE) and women business enterprises (WBE).  Of $2.9 billion in contracts reported in FY 1993-94, $463.171 million was awarded to MBE/WBE contractors, including $279.882 million to minority businesses (9.4 percent) and $183.289 million to women businesses (6.2 percent).  An additional $36.671 million (1.2 percent) was awarded to disabled veterans business enterprise (DVBE) businesses.<SUP>14 </SUP><P>  

A 1979 report for the National Construction Industry Council (NCIC) noted:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any law that assigns a portion of a market to a particular group, in essence, legalizes monopoly.  Setting aside 10 percent of a construction market for minority firms creates a monopoly for minorities.  It is a well-established law of economics that monopoly power leads to higher prices.<SUP>15 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Quoting from a General Accounting Office report of January 16, 1979, the NCIC observed that "The price quotes of minority firms averaged about 9 percent higher than normal prices."  If this formula is applied to California contracts under the MBE/WBE set-asides, it would account for $41.7 million in inflated contract costs.<SUP>16 </SUP><P> 

This figure is consistent with the experience of the Department of General Services (DGS).  According to figures provided by the Procurement Division of DGS, the difference "between the bid that met all other technical and administrative requirements (however, did not meet the M/WBE requirements) and the bid that met all requirements (including the M/WBE requirements)" amounted to $9.725 million in 1994.<SUP>17 </SUP>  The Procurement Division is responsible for about 20 percent of all state business.  Thus, the annual cost cited by DGS would amount to $48.625 million if the experience was consistent with the 80 percent of state contracting not awarded through DGS.<P>

The figures obtained from applying the NCIC findings to state construction work and from applying the DGS experience to all state contracts are also remarkably consistent with a study of costs prepared by the Construction Industry Research Board (CIRB) in June 1986.  This study was based on a survey of 472 prime contractors, majority subcontractors and MBE/WBE firms which responded to a total of 2,133 questionnaires, representing $1.95 billion of the $4.3 billion in public works construction in California in 1985.  Based upon the information compiled in this survey, the CIRB estimated $43 million in inflated costs due to special preference programs.  The sampling of inflated costs ranged up to 165 percent.<SUP>18 </SUP><P>

An example cited by DGS illustrates the lengths to which these provisions must be taken:<P> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>A solicitation for rolling ball pens was issued by the State without the M/WBE participation requirements.  In response to a request by a local supplier, the State amended the solicitation to include M/WBE requirements.  As in the past, numerous bids were received.  However, the eight lowest bids were all rejected.  Although all bidders had met the technical specifications (in fact, all bidders offered the same pen), the eight lowest bidders had not met M/WBE requirements.  Award was made to the ninth bidder, and cost the taxpayers about $50,000 more on a $200,000 contract.<SUP>19 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>  

It should be noted that all three of these surveys tend to underestimate the increased prices inherent in preference programs, because they all survey only the cost differential among bids which were actually made.  An important consideration which is far more difficult to quantify is the effect that preferences have on discouraging additional bids, which may be considerably lower than those submitted.  According to the CIRB study:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Nearly 61 percent of prime contractors reported that they avoided bidding an average of 6.8 contracts in 1985 because of SPP (special preference program) requirements.  If those contracts had been bid, the number of bids received by government agencies would have been 12.9 percent higher. Additionally, nearly 46 percent of majority subcontractors reported that they avoided bidding SPP work an average of 26.4 times each in the prior year.  And nearly half of all majority subcontractors also reported that over the past three years they reduced the amount of public works construction that they choose to bid.  Nearly 43 percent, who have reduced their public works bidding, say that the reduction is substantial.  And 88 percent state they are doing more private work than they did before SPP.<SUP>20 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE> 


<B>3. The Cost of Delays</B><P>

Another component of the cost of the state's racial and gender preferences involves the MBE/WBE induced delays in awarding contracts.  An example cited by the DGS illustrates the problem:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>On the second rebid of a difficult and complex solicitation for aircraft, the state received three responsive bids.  The low bidder was selected for award. The highest cost bidder protested the award, claiming that neither of the lower bidders had made a good faith effort to meet M/W/DVBE goals.  Ultimately, the protest was denied.  However, by that time, the lowest bidder could no longer honor their price.  The State was finally able to award the contract to the second lowest bidder.<SUP>21 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

The CIRB study reported that 78 percent of the respondents to its survey "reported delays in contract awards for projects that have SPP percentage goals.  Those delays averaged 4.6 weeks."<SUP>22 </SUP>  Applying this figure to all MBE/WBE contacts would produce an average delay of 3.6 weeks for the $463 million of MBE/WBE contracts in 1993-94.  Based on 6 percent annual interest, the cost of these delays would be about $1.9 million.<P>	

DGS notes that before the adoption of the MBE/WBE requirements, "departments typically gave suppliers a two to four week period" for submitting bids.  The adoption of the MBE/WBE requirements more than doubled the period for bid preparation to between six and eight weeks.<SUP>23 </SUP>  This factor is by far more significant.  A four week delay over the preparation of all contracts would produce annual costs of $13.7 million.<P>


<B>4. Qualitative Costs</B><P>

A fourth cost component of racial and gender preferences is difficult to quantify: the cost of qualitative differences in the execution of state contracts due to the arbitrary exclusion of qualified bidders.<P>

In some cases, there would be no qualitative difference.  For example, in the case of the $200,000 pen acquisition, the pens were the same, only the cost was different.  Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith cited a 1994 letter from a constituent.  Says Goldsmith:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We have seen the creation of so-called pass through companies, i.e., a minority- or woman-owned firm that advertises as being a supplier for various items but doesn't actually stock the items.  Shelly Holland, owner of the Holland Company, a general engineering firm, writes: "We purchase steel from PDM Steel, but must offer the opportunity to bid to any MBE/WBE supplier.  In doing so, these firms will get a price from PDM Steel, add a percentage to the price, then give us the quote.  If we accept the price from PDM Steel, then we are not giving enough work to [MBEs/WBEs].  If we accept the inflated price from the MBEs/WBEs we may no longer be competitive."<SUP>24 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

According to the CIRB study, MBE/WBE subcontractors failed to perform in 11.5 percent of the contracts reported, compared to 1.8 percent of non-MBE/WBE subcontractors, a failure rate 6.4 times greater.  "When subcontractors fail to perform the work subcontracted for, the prime contractor may incur significant costs to complete the work.  One example of this was offered by a prime contractor who employs eight workers and who stated that his firm lost $30,000 to $40,000 in each of two prior years because '...MBE's went bankrupt, or we had to complete their jobs.'"<SUP>25 </SUP><P>


<B>5. Indirect Costs for Businesses</B><P>

The law is quite specific on the actions which a business must undertake in order to qualify to bid on state contracts.  First, the business must make contact with the "awarding department to identify minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises."  According to testimony to the Little Hoover Commission, this is more difficult than it sounds.  The Department of General Services noted, "Different agencies have different requirements and do make different interpretations...it would be unrealistic to expect that the same answer would be given to identical callers in identical circumstances in every instance."<SUP>26 </SUP><P>  

Second, the business must make contact "with other state and federal agencies, and with local minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprise organizations to identify minority, women, and disabled veteran business enterprises."  All of these actions must be documented.  Third, the business must publish advertising "in trade papers and papers focusing on minority, women, and disabled, veteran business enterprises."  These costs are, of course, entirely shouldered by the business, and passed on as higher prices.  Fourth, invitations to bid must be submitted to these preferred contractors, and, fifth, subcontracting must be done even when the contractor can perform the same services more cheaply in-house.<P>

For example, Pacific Gas and Electric reported that it spent $2.2 million in 1991 to comply with California Public Utilities Commission MBE/WBE requirements.<SUP>27 </SUP>  According to the Little Hoover Commission:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is difficult to pin down the added private industry costs.  If one vendor's estimate of $1,000 were used and three bidders were presumed to compete on each of 80,000 state procurements, the cost would be $240 million.  But MBE/WBE/ DVBE requirements are not included on all contracts, and a substantial number of contracts have only a single bidder while others have far more than three.<SUP>28 </SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

In 1986, CIRB estimated total costs to business for construction contracts to be $13.1 million.  Its estimate was based on average bidding costs 13.1 percent higher on MBE/WBE construction contracts with total billing amounting to 0.8 percent of the contract cost, and an average of 5.7 bidders per contract.<SUP>29 </SUP>  CIRB estimates this accounts for about ten percent of all contracts.  If the experience were consistent across all state contracts, this would amount to $130 million in compliance costs for firms doing business with the state.<P>


<B>6. Opportunity Costs</B><P>

Finally, there is an incalculable opportunity cost to society which we cannot begin to fathom in the confines of this paper, but simply must note in passing.  For example, racially discriminatory admissions practices within the University of California have been extensively documented.<SUP>30 </SUP>  When a more qualified applicant is arbitrarily denied admission to a university in favor of a less qualified one, how much economic damage is done to society?  Arbitrary preferences in all fields clearly inhibit the application of resources for their highest and best potential use.  It is impossible to begin to quantify this effect, but it conceivably dwarfs the other costs of preferential policies discussed in this paper.<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

The costs to support the race and gender preferences in current law are impossible to fully assess, and it should be stressed that figures presented in this paper offer only a partial glimpse.  However, combining the estimates which have been made by the Department of General Services, the Legislative Analyst's Office, the Little Hoover Commission, industry studies and the Administration, it is clear that these programs easily exceed $343 million annually in administrative costs to government, compliance costs to business, and inflated prices paid by taxpayers because of the constriction of competition for the provision of governmental goods and services. Specifically, the state spends at least $156 million on direct costs for these programs, between $42 million and $49 million for inflated prices in contracting, $15 million in project delays, and anywhere from $130 million to possibly as much at $240 million in compliance costs to businesses.<P>

<P ALIGN=center><B>By Michael Lynch*</B></P>


<B>Background</B><P>

The last year has been tumultuous for the University of California.  In July 1995, after a nearly year-long review and much public debate, the University of California Board of Regents adopted a resolution designed to end race as a factor in admissions, hiring, and contracting decisions.  The Regents' intention is clear: administrators are to design and implement a completely colorblind admission process for the entering class of Fall 1997.<SUP>1</SUP>  To the casual observer, this appears to be no major task.  Simply removing the ethnic-check boxes from admission applications--a section which, according to wording on the application itself, is for "statistical purposes only"--would go a long way to ensuring a colorblind admission process.  If the schools still wanted to know their racial and ethnic composition, they could avail themselves of modern statistical sampling techniques to determine the ethnic and racial composition <I>after</I> the admission decisions had been made. <P>

This reform, however, is too simple, too honest, and too effective for the system's administrators, all of whom opposed the Regents' decision.  Footdragging and controversy quickly ensued.  Newly-appointed UC President Richard Atkinson maintained that the Regents' decision didn't affect the entering class of Fall 1997, but rather the entering class of Fall 1998. After much handwringing and a reassertion of authority by the Regents, a compromise was struck.  Race supposedly will not be a factor in admission to UC by Spring 1998, well after the Regents' original date but earlier than Atkinson's initial interpretation of the policy.  At the same time this controversy was bubbling, a group of activist professors asserted that the Regents' decision upset the proper balance of power in the university system and that the faculty were united in opposition to the ban on preferences.  Major state news outlets reported both of these stories, rarely questioning their veracity.  But a scientific poll of the UC faculty, conducted by the independent Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, found the faculty split on, if not in favor of, the Regents' policy.<SUP>2</SUP>  As for the usurpation of the faculty's power, setting policy is the purview of the Regents, the UC's governing board.  After all, when the University of California is sued for discrimination, the suit names the Regents, not professors. <P>

As the dust settles, school administrators have until Spring 1998 to come up with an admission system that neither grants privileges nor discriminates on the basis of race and ethnicity.<SUP>3</SUP>  If the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), which would amend the state constitution to prohibit race-based preferences in the public sector, passes in November 1996, the UC will not only be prohibited from discriminating by the Regents but also by the state constitution. <P>

The current climate, then, has Californians paying close attention to a recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision, <I>Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas</I>, in which the court ruled that race could not be a factor in admissions,<SUP>4</SUP> and to the findings of a report by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the University of California at Berkeley's (UCB) admission process.  On the one hand, the <I>Hopwood</I> decision is a legal affirmation of the Regents' decision.  On the other, the OCR's  report asserts that the existing admission policy at UCB in 1993, a close version of which is still used, did not lower academic standards or discriminate against whites or Asians. This confusion raises the question: What is really going on and what lies ahead for the University of California? <P>


<B>Conflicting Decisions or Differing Premises?</B><P>

On March 18, 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rocked the country's higher educational establishment.  In its <I>Hopwood</I> decision, the court ruled that the University of Texas law school was guilty of discrimination for maintaining different admission standards for applicants of different races and ethnicities.  More important, the court called into question the justification for such discrimination set forth in the famous decision in <I>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</I> (438 U.S. 1978), which has been the governing doctrine of race-based preferences in admission to higher education since 1978.  Justice Powell's opinion in <I>Bakke</I>, in which the court struck down explicit set-asides for minority students at the University of California at Davis Medical School, allowed for schools to use race as a factor in admissions in order for schools to ensure ideological and intellectual diversity as long as it was just one of many factors considered. <P>

Although the <I>Hopwood</I> decision has been decried by proponents of racial preferences as "profoundly radical in its contempt for the precedent set by the historic <I>Bakke</I> decision,"<SUP>5</SUP> it is far more evolutionary than revolutionary.  In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <I>Adarand Constructors v. Pena</I><SUP>6</SUP> that programs that take race into account must pass the "strict scrutiny" test.  Justice O'Connor, writing for the majority, emphasized that the Constitution protects "persons, not groups" and that government classification based on race is a "group classification."<SUP>7</SUP>  Quoting from the 1943 <I>Hirabayashi</I><SUP>8</SUP> decision four times, "Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality," O'Connor emphasized that all racial classifications by government must be scrutinized to ensure that personal rights, which the Constitution does protect, are not violated.<SUP>9</SUP>  In addition to <I>Adarand</I>, a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit invalidated a scholarship program reserved only for African Americans at the University of Maryland.<SUP>10</SUP>  Far from revolutionary, the <I>Hopwood</I> decision fits squarely in the vein of these two recent decisions. <P>

In <I>Hopwood</I>, the court ruled: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Justice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on this issue.  While he announced the judgment, no other Justice joined in that part of the opinion discussing the diversity rationale.  In Bakke, the word "diversity" is mentioned nowhere except in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion.<SUP>11</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Stating that recent Supreme Court opinions "show that the diversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny," the Court went on to declare that "within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection."<SUP>12</SUP>  Two out of the three judges ruled that race can never be used as a factor in admissions because race is not a reliable proxy for either intellectual or ideological diversity.  In this ruling, the court laid bare a festering problem in Justice Powell's opinion.  Although Powell declared that race could be used to ensure ideological and intellectual diversity, he never explained why race was, in and of itself, a useful proxy for these types of diversity.<SUP>13</SUP>  Powell's opinion seems to embrace the very thinking on race--that certain traits can be ascribed to individuals based on their group membership--that the original civil rights movement sought to dispel.  After all, the argument that individuals should be judged based "on the content of their character," is not a plea for racial categorization.<SUP>14</SUP><P>

Three days following the <I>Hopwood</I> decision, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights released the suspiciously well-timed findings of its seven-year investigation into the admission practices at UC Berkeley (UCB).  Just as the University was preparing to send out acceptance and rejection letters to anxious applicants, the OCR reported in a fifteen page letter that "1) UCB does not maintain illegal quotas for Black, Hispanic, and Filipino applicants to the freshman class in the College of L&S [Letters and Sciences], and 2) neither the University of California (UC) system nor UCB illegally discriminates against minority students by segregating them away from other UC campuses to UCB."<SUP>15</SUP><P>

If California's education establishment was driven to cold sweats by the <I>Hopwood</I> decision, they were ecstatic about the long-awaited OCR decision.  <I>The Los Angeles Times'</I> front page headline declared, "Probe Finds No Bias in Berkeley Admissions: Policies do not discriminate against whites or cause lower academic quality, U.S. agency says."  UC Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel, a chief architect of the school's admission system, told <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> that the OCR's finding was "an historical vindication of one of the strongest and most scrutinized affirmative action programs in the country."<SUP>16</SUP>  This investigation's findings were also declared to be "a striking counterpoint to a federal appeals court ruling Tuesday in a Texas case [<I>Hopwood</I>], knocking down the use of affirmative action in a state college or university."<SUP>17</SUP><P>

The OCR's findings were not, however, a rebuke to the <I>Hopwood</I> decision.  Two points must be made clear.  First, the <I>Hopwood</I> case was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and thus is not binding on California's universities, which are governed by the Ninth Circuit.  Second, the OCR's findings in no way contradict the <I>Hopwood</I> decision because the report is premised on Justice Lewis Powell's <I>Bakke</I> opinion, which the <I>Hopwood</I> decision rejects.  If the OCR had investigated under the <I>Hopwood</I> standard, it would have been forced to find the University guilty of discrimination. <P>

Californians should thus not conclude from the media reports on the OCR's investigation that race is not a critically important factor in undergraduate admission to UCB.  Nor should they conclude that members of all ethnicities are held to the same undergraduate admission standards.  The OCR's own Letter of Finding (LOF)<SUP>18</SUP> debunks this notion.  What the OCR did find is that "the undergraduate admissions process, in place for students admitted in 1993, is lawful under Title VI."<SUP>19</SUP><P>

Although the OCR took nearly seven years to reach its decision and, according to <I>The Los Angeles Times</I>, based its decision "on reams of documents provided by university officials,"<SUP>20</SUP> the LOF contains surprisingly little data.  The author has put in a federal Freedom of Information Act request with the OCR for the data on which it based its decision, and has also put in a California Public Records Act request at UCB for further admission data.  When these data become available, a fuller analysis of the admission system and its consequences will follow.  This analysis is based on the information contained in the OCR's LOF, the original complaint that prompted the investigation, and other information, cited when used, already in the public domain. <P>


<B>The University of California's Dilemma</B><P>

The University of California has a problem.  Its mission, as outlined in the University of California's Master Plan, is to educate those students performing academically in the top 12.5 percent of California's graduating high school class.  It has also been charged with ensuring diversity by two Assembly Concurrent Resolutions (ACR 151 in 1974 and ACR 83 in 1984).<SUP>21</SUP>  In 1988, the UC Regents further adopted a policy on undergraduate admissions which stated, in part, that beyond its more narrow mission, the university "seeks to enroll, on each of its campuses, a student body that, beyond meeting the University's eligibility requirements, demonstrates high academic achievement or exceptional personal talent, and that encompasses the broad diversity of cultural, racial, geographic, and socio-economic background characteristic of California."<SUP>22</SUP>  Administrators interpreted this policy to mean that entering classes should approximately reflect the ethnic proportions of the graduating high school class.<SUP>23</SUP><P>

As reported in an earlier study,<SUP>24</SUP> all of UC's affirmative action headaches stem from the same source: high school graduates from various ethnic groups do not qualify for the system in equal proportions.  The University's primary mandate is to provide an education for the top 12.5 percent, or one in eight, of California's graduating high-school seniors.  This means that any ethnic group whose members qualify for UC at a rate of less than 12.5 percent will be underrepresented in the system as a whole if standards are not lowered for that group.  Likewise, any ethnic group whose members qualify for UC at a rate exceeding 12.5 percent will be over-represented3/4unless members of that group are discriminated <I>against</I> in the admission process or a great number choose, for some reason, not to attend the University of California. <P>

Table I shows the ethnic breakdown of 1990, 1993 and 1994 high school graduates and the UC eligibility rates for 1990, the last year for which published data are available.  There are huge disparities in eligibility rates across ethnic groups.  While four in 10 Asian graduates from California's high schools were UC eligible, this proportion was one in five for whites, and less than one in ten for African Americans and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino). <P>

As illustrated in Figures I through IV, these varying rates produce a qualified applicant pool with an ethnic composition that differs radically from that of the graduating high-school seniors.  While Asians constituted only 14 percent of the graduating high-school seniors in 1990, they accounted for 30 percent of those eligible for the University of California.  Whites accounted for 55 percent of high school graduates and 59 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  African Americans and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino), however, while constituting approximately 7 and 23 percent of the high school graduates respectively, accounted for only 3 and 8 percent of those eligible for the University of California.<P>

<IMG SRC="gsp5212a.jpg" ALIGN=left ALT="Figures I and II" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=441 WIDTH=385>
By 1993, the year for which the OCR investigated, things had not changed much.  As illustrated in Figures II and IV, Asians, which constituted just 15 percent of California's high school graduates accounted for 32 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  Whites were 48 percent of high school graduates and 54 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  Hispanics (Chicano/Latino), while 29 percent of high school graduates made up only 11 percent of the UC eligibility pool.  The respective percentages for African Americans were 7 percent and 3 percent.  It must be noted that these figures only provide an approximation because the eligibility rates are calculated based on 1990 data, the last year for which they are available.  Also, the pool doesn't include American Indians due to a small sample size which precluded a statistically significant result.<P>


What is true for the system as a whole is also true for each institution.  The most competitive schools, UCB and UCLA, can approximate proportionality for targeted minorities who, like Asians and whites, prefer these schools over other UC campuses.  But they can only do so by applying different academic standards to applicants based on their race. <P>

This has the twin effects of producing radically varying GPA and SAT averages in the entering class among the different ethnic groups<SUP>25</SUP> and concentrating targeted minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Chicanos and Latinos) at UCLA and UCB.  Indeed, the original complaint that prompted the OCR investigation noted that in 1988 UCB and UCLA "accounted for 35 percent of all students in the UC system, but they also enroll a much larger 51 percent of minorities."<SUP>26</SUP><P>

<IMG SRC="gsp5234a.jpg" ALIGN=left ALT="Figures III and IIII" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=365 WIDTH=361>

By 1994 these disparities had lessened, but nevertheless remained.  Thirty-six percent of all undergraduates but 43 percent of targeted minorities enrolled in the UC system attended these two schools in that same year.  By contrast, 33 percent of all UC undergraduates admitted in 1994 attended these two schools, but only 21 percent of white students.<SUP>27</SUP>  As illustrated in Figures IV and V, the only group significantly underrepresented in UCB 1993 admissions in comparison to the potentially eligible applicant pool is whites, who account for 54 percent of the eligibility pool but only 32 percent of the students accepted.  Similarly, the only two groups underrepresented in UCB 1993 acceptances in comparison to the California graduating high school seniors (Figures II & V) are whites and Hispanics (Chicano/Latino).  While Hispanic under-representation is due to this group's low eligibility rate, this explanation is not available for whites. <P>




As discussed in detail in an earlier paper,<SUP>28</SUP> California taxpayers generously support a comprehensive system of higher education.  From the broad base of the open enrollment community colleges to the California State University system to the top tier of the University of California system, no Californian is denied a highly subsidized education.  Although advocates of racial preferences in admission would have the public believe that if UCB and UCLA did not admit a high proportion of minority applicants these applicants would be denied an education, this is false. <P>

<B>The Complaint that Started it All</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"There is wide agreement that if whites have higher admission rates and lower test scores than Asians, it is evidence of discrimination against Asians.  But if this applies to black students relative to white students, it is called affirmative action, even though it is exactly the same procedure."</I>
					<P ALIGN=right>--Arthur Hu, <I>Original Complaint</I><SUP>29</SUP></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

In 1989, Arthur Hu, a software programmer in Seattle, columnist for <I>Asian Week</I>, and inveterate data collector, filed an official complaint with the U.S. Department of Education charging discrimination against Asians in admissions to Harvard University.  He claimed also that UCB and UCLA maintained quotas and differential admissions standards at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles which discriminate not only against Asians, but against all racial groups."<SUP>30</SUP><P> 

In brief, Hu's complaint accused the UC system, primarily through UCLA and UCB, of maintaining quotas for minority group admissions based on representation among the state's high-school graduates. In the wake of the ACR No. 83 in 1984, which the UC interpreted to mean that it must strive for racial proportionality, the number of minority admits increased dramatically while that of whites fell, especially at the more competitive schools.  Hu based his complaint on this evidence.  Hu wrote: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>UC claims that it uses goals, but not quotas to admit minorities according to state proportions.  In 1988, UC has actually admitted all minorities in equal to, or even greater than graduate proportions.  Since this is caused by affirmative action, and is not based on qualifications, but on numerical goals, this policy is a fourth illegal quota in fact, if not in name.<SUP>31</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Hu pointed out that by concentrating minority students at UCB and UCLA, the UC system "discriminates against whites and Asians who apply to these campuses."<SUP>32</SUP>  He claimed that the policy "also discriminates against minorities in other campuses such as UC Santa Cruz because it makes them [the campuses] primarily white and Asian."<SUP>33</SUP>  This is a direct consequence of the high acceptance rates at UCB and UCLA.  An attendant claim by Hu was that the UC was "mismatching abilities by putting the weakest students in the toughest schools" and thereby reducing these groups respective graduation rates by admitting African American and Filipino students with considerably lower grades and SAT scores than other students. <P>


<B>Enter the Feds: The OCR's Findings</B><P>

The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is charged with ensuring that colleges and universities that take federal money do not discriminate.  It carries out this mission primarily by enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  It determined, in this investigation, that the relevant implementing regulations reside at 34 C.F.R. &#167 &#167 100.3(a), (b)(1)(v), and (b)(6)(ii).  The first section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states "that no person in the United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies."<SUP>34</SUP>  The second section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states, "a recipient [of federal money] may not directly or through contractual arrangements on the ground of race, color, or national origin treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program."<SUP>35</SUP>  Complicating, if not contradicting, these first two seeming prohibitions against classification and differential treatment based on race, the third section, as paraphrased in the LOF, states, "that even in the absence of a prior finding that a recipient has discriminated in the past, a recipient, in administering a program, may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin."<SUP>36</SUP><P>

These were the standards against which the legality of UCB's admission policy was judged. The first two prohibit treating people differently depending on their race and ethnicity while the third states that a university "may take affirmative action."  If these sections are to be internally consistent, then racial preferences, such as those we shall see are used by UCB, cannot be considered "affirmative action." That is, affirmative action programs are proscribed from using racial preferences.  They can, however, concentrate on recruitment.  The OCR didn't interpret these regulations in this manner.  For the OCR, even though its report didn't explicitly recognize this fact, there is a contradiction between the first two prohibitions against discriminating based on race and the third which states, in OCR's interpretation, that preferences can be granted on the basis of race.  In this light, the OCR sacrifices the first two standards on the altar of the third.

In a letter dated March 1, 1996, nearly seven years after the original complaint was filed, the OCR released it findings.  Among other things mentioned, the OCR found "The program employed not quotas or set-asides, and all students, regardless of race or national origin, competed with all other students."<SUP>37</SUP>  Furthermore, any problem associated with not being admitted to UCB was mitigated by the fact that applicants were free to apply again, were offered admission at a later date, or, if UC eligible, guaranteed a spot at a less competitive UC school. The LOF found: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any impact of the affirmative action component on students who were not admitted to UCB was substantially diminished by the fact that all UC-eligible students must be admitted by the System to one of the UC campuses, and many students achieved admission to UCB subsequent to an initial denial of admission.<SUP>38</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

To arrive at its conclusion of non-discrimination, the OCR's investigation focused on the 1993 admissions process.  In 1992, UCB switched to a matrix admission process that it states was "quite different" from the old system.  We shall examine the matrix process, but it should be noted that the OCR did not release a Letter of Finding directly related to Hu's charges, which were obviously filed under an older admission process.  In a similarly misleading vein, if the OCR investigated and found a discriminatory process but UCB was willing to alter its policies to mitigate this discrimination, the OCR wouldn't necessarily disclose that it had deemed the former policy discriminatory.<SUP>39</SUP>  As a result, one should be suspicious of the OCR's complete neglect of UCB's admissions policies prior to 1993, which were, after all, the policies that prompted the complaint.  As Arthur Hu recently wrote in <I>Asian Week</I>, it is as if the police investigated "O.J. Simpson by checking on whether he killed anybody in the next year."<SUP>40</SUP>  Even so, there is plenty in the 1993 matrix standards to make one wonder how the OCR concluded that UCB does not "on the ground of race, color, or national origin treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfied any admission, enrollment, . . . requirement."<SUP>41</SUP><P>

<B>Brief Overview of Admissions Policy</B><P>

In 1993, UC policy mandated that no less than 40 percent and no more than 60 percent of the first year entering class be selected on academic criteria alone, which include required course-work, GPA, and SAT scores.<SUP>42</SUP>  The remaining students were to be selected on the basis of supplemental factors.  According to the OCR, these factors included: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>1) special talents, interests or experiences beyond the academic criteria that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, achievement, and service in a particular field such as civic life or the arts; 2) special circumstances adversely affecting applicant's life experiences, including personal difficulties, low family income, refugee status, or veteran status; and 3) ethnic identity, gender, and location or residence.<SUP>43</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Notice that, as is nearly almost always the case when supplemental, non-academic factors are delineated, race and ethnicity are placed at the end of the list.  As we shall soon see, this is a deliberate inversion of the order of importance. <P>

In addition to those who meet the UC Eligibility criteria, the UC maintains the right to admit up to 6 percent of the entering class by "exception."  According to the LOF, "This policy is designed for the purpose of admitting students who have not met the eligibility requirements who are either athletes, have special talents, are disadvantaged (i.e. from minority and/or low income or low education backgrounds), have demonstrated exceptional ability in certain areas, or have shown marked improvement in academic performance."<SUP>44</SUP>  Notice that middle class and wealthy minorities can be considered disadvantaged simply on the basis of their ethnicity and race. <P>

Through this admissions process, UCB seeks to ensure diversity in its incoming class.  In 1988, the Academic Senate and the Admissions and Enrollment (A&E) Committee adopted the recommendations from a report entitled "Freshman Admissions at Berkeley: A Policy for the 1990s and Beyond" which is known as the Karabel report, after the aforementioned sociologist Jerome Karabel.  The Karabel report recommended flexible targets for admissions based on the following characteristics (notice the order): "low socio-economic status (SES), athletic ability, age, disability, re-entry students, students from rural and non-traditional high schools, and ethnicity and underrepresented minority status."<SUP>45</SUP>  These targets were soon adopted.  Here's how these goals manifested themselves in the admission process. <P>

<B>1993 Matrix</B><BR>
Below is the 1993 admissions matrix for UC Berkeley. <P>

<P><IMG SRC="/gsp/gsp526a.jpg" ALT="Figure VI" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=272 WIDTH=593></P>

The Social Diversity Score (SDS) categories are as follows: <B>SDS A:</B> 1)  California residents who are American Indian, African American or Chicano AND low socio-economic status (SES)<SUP>46</SUP> or disabled; 2) California residents who are low SES and disabled; 3) California residents who are re-entry applicants (over 24 years of age). <B>SDS B:</B> 1) California residents who are American Indian, African American or Chicano; 2) California residents who are Latino and SES or disabled. <B>SDS C:</B> 1) California residents who are Latino; 2) Non-resident American Indian, African American or Chicano applicants.<SUP>47</SUP> <B>SDS D:</B> Very low SES.<SUP>48</SUP> <B>SDS E:</B> Rural and Other High School <B>SDS F:</B> Non-resident Latinos;<SUP>49</SUP> 2) Other Low SES. <B>SDS G:</B> California Residents <B>SDS H:</B> Domestic Non-residents. <B>SDS I:</B> Foreign Applicants. <P>

Under this matrix, an applicant is placed in a box depending on two variables: 1) an Academic Index Score (AIS) and 2) his or her social diversity category.  The AIS is determined by multiplying an applicant's GPA, capped at 4.0, by 1,000, and adding to this the combined total of the SAT scores and three required Achievement Test scores.<SUP>50</SUP> The socio-economic categories, which are on the vertical axis, are determined by an applicant's birth.  The LOF states that the AIS scores for the first box are 7160 to 8000 (8000 is a perfect score), but didn't disclose the other cut-off scores. The Social Diversity Scores, which are under the matrix, are quoted directly from the LOF<SUP>51</SUP><P>

In 1993, applicants placed in this matrix were admitted in the following manner.  All those in AIS 1, regardless of SDS, were admitted.  This accounted for roughly 50 percent of the acceptances.  This groups satisfies the requirement that 40 percent to 60 percent of the students be admitted on academic qualifications alone. <P>

A second group comprising SDS A through SDS F and AIS cells 2 through 5 were also automatically admitted.  Those admitted in this group, in which race and ethnicity play a major role, accounted for 17 percent of the total acceptances.  Explaining these acceptances, for which race was an important factor, the "OCR determined that while race/ethnicity was one factor in defining this group, placement in this group was not based exclusively on race or ethnicity."<SUP>52</SUP><P>

A third group in cell SDS G and AIS 2 was also automatically accepted, accounting for 9 percent of total acceptances.  Another 21 percent of the acceptances came from cells SDS A through SDS F and AIS 3 through AIS 7.  These acceptances were granted after each file was reviewed and the essays read by two review teams.  The Karabel diversity goals were taken into consideration in accepting this group.<SUP>53</SUP>  In addition, three percent of total acceptances were granted on the basis of "special admission."  The LOF didn't disclose the racial composition of this or any other admission group. <P>

There are many things about this process that indicate that while race may be a factor among many, it is the most important factor.  While all applicants are put through the same process, they are not all judged by the same standards while in that process.  First, note that to be simply a California taxpayer who is white or Asian is to be in the seventh-lowest SDS ranking, above only out-of-state whites and Asians and non-minority foreign applicants.  In fact, any African American, Chicano, or Latino from anywhere in the United States will be automatically admitted with lower academic qualifications.  For example, non-resident American Indians, African Americans or Chicano applicants, regardless of whether they are wealthy, middle class or poor, were automatically admitted in two AIS categories (C2-C4) in which non-poor whites were automatically rejected, without even having their file reviewed.  Out-of-state minorities, regardless of socioeconomic status, were also automatically admitted in one AIS category (C4) in which "Very Low SES"<SUP>54</SUP> in-state whites and Asians merely get their application read.  It is surely strange for a state university which draws more than $8,000 from the General Fund per student<SUP>55</SUP> to grant a privilege to wealthy out-of-state applicants over poor and middle class California taxpayers solely on the basis of race. <P>

Take a close look at SDS A and SDS B.  Why are they separate categories?  Automatic admissions for both categories extends to AIS 5 and applicants in both categories have their applications closely examined in as low an AIS category as 7.  There is no difference between these two categories except, perhaps, their public relations utility.  If these two categories were properly combined (as in practice they are simply one category for the purpose of the matrix), it would be obvious that all California residents who are American Indians, African Americans, and Chicanos are automatically granted admission--again, regardless of socioeconomic status--without even a review of their file, at radically lower academic standards than whites and Asians.  The proper SDS A category would then read, "1 ) California residents who are American Indian, African American, or Chicano; 2) California residents who are Latino and SES or disabled; 3) California residents who are low SES and disabled; and California residents who are re-entry applicants (over 24 years of age.)  SDS B would disappear and each other category would simply move up the matrix while retaining the same structure.  This would dispel the carefully crafted notion that in order to be considered in highest disadvantaged status, American Indians, African Americans, and Chicanos must not only be California residents, but must also be poor or disabled. <P>

This would also complicate the OCR's statement, in support of its finding of non-discrimination that "the criteria for placement on the matrix grid were not based exclusively on race or ethnicity nor was race or ethnicity the exclusive criterion for any group in the selection process."<SUP>56</SUP>  While this statement would still be true, since a second factor, California residency, is still needed, it would be apparent that all minorities are afforded great preferences in admissions.  Two factors place applicants in the most privileged group: race and residency status.  But as we have seen, even residency status is not necessary for applicants of favored groups to receive preferences over poor California residents who belong to the wrong ethnic and racial group. <P>

Two other points.  First, notice that based on the matrix, a computer automatically admitted in 1993 nearly three in four admittees.  For all the talk of personal reviews of files, only one in four addmittees was admitted after having his file reviewed.  Unless an applicant is somehow considered disadvantaged, the chance of him even having his file read appears remote.  For a white or Asian student who excels in the supposed subjective criteria--"special talents, interests or experiences beyond the academic criteria that demonstrate unusual promise for leadership, achievement, and service in a particular field such as civic life or the arts"--it is not clear how the University avails itself of this information.  Non-poor whites and Asians are automatically rejected if not in AIS 1 or 2.  Thus, their chances of being accepted based on non-academic qualifications appear remote.  This failure to review the files of non-minority applicants helps explain the recently exposed "back-door admissions policy" for the wealthy and well connected.  It appears that a non-minority applicant who was a class president, volunteered at a homeless shelter, spent her spring break in Mexico building houses for poor peasants, and was fluent in three languages but was just shy of the GPA and SAT score needed for the first two AIS categories, would be automatically rejected without a file review.  It is reasonable for parents to wonder why some of their childrens' peers with both lower academic credentials and fewer extra-curricular activities were granted admission and to inquire through whatever channels available.  In many cases, such a review would not be a further review, but rather the first review--a review, one might add, that each minority applicant is entitled to simply on the basis of his race.  While this helps explains the backdoor policy, it does not condone it.  After all, such a policy does little to help the majority of taxpaying Californians who are bereft of connections but support UCB with their taxes nevertheless. <P>

Second, without hard data on the academic parameters for the various categories, (automatic admission on AIS alone, automatic admission on AIS and SDS, admission based on extensive review of file, and special admissions), the exact magnitude of the differing standards cannot be evaluated.  Similarly, although the two-step intensive review process as described in the LOF seems race and ethnic neutral, there are points in this selection process in which race bias could play a significant role.  Until hard data on the composition of the pool and the composition of the acceptances from this pool are provided from the OCR, the reader should not conclude that race and ethnicity do not play a major role in an applicant's chances for admission in this category.  As always, the devil is in the details.  In this case, the details are the data, which have yet to be released by the OCR. <P>


<B>OCR's Incredible Conclusion</B><P>

After review of the process and still undisclosed data, the OCR concluded that UCB does not discriminate based on race.<SUP>57</SUP>  It stopped short, however, of saying that all applicants were judged by the same standards regardless of race, which would, of course, be untrue. <P>

This is the central issue in which most Californians are interested.  The OCR concluded that "the process ensured that no applicant was considered or excluded from consideration for selection solely on the basis of race or national origin."  This simply means that UCB put all of the applicants on the same grid before it gave enormous preferences depending on racial and ethnic classification.  The OCR dismissed Hu's complaint that by concentrating minorities at two schools it was denying diversity to other schools by pointing out that it is the individual schools and applicants who make the decisions. <P>

Hu's complaint of "academic mismatching" causing low graduation rates for targeted minorities admitted by lower standards was also dismissed by the OCR, which stated "UCB provided additional data which showed the current six-year graduation rates for African American students at UCB is 62 percent compared to a national average [for African American students] of 37 percent."<SUP>58</SUP>  This, of course, neglected the fact that the proper base for comparison is not against an amorphous national average, over which the University has no control, but against the ethnic groups it holds to higher admission standards.  The six year graduation rates for the entering class of 1988 showed very different rates depending on race, with Whites and Asians graduating at rates over 80 percent and Chicano/Latinos, American Indians, and African Americans, who we have seen are admitted by lower standards, all in the neighborhood of 60 percent.<SUP>59</SUP>  UCB's six-year graduation rate, independent of race, for all regularly admitted students in Fall 1987 was 81 percent.  For those admitted by exception, the graduation rate was 48 percent.<SUP>60</SUP>  In fact, the differing graduation rates for different groups probably do not reflect racism or differences in academic abilities inherent in race, but simply the different standards at which students are admitted.  This hypothesis, which asserts that if Asians were admitted to UCB with the same academic qualifications as other targeted minorities, they would fail to graduate at similar rates, can only be tested with further data.  At any rate, the OCR didn't investigate this issue in its LOF. <P>

Finally the OCR determined that UCB's racially determined admission matrix "did not impose an undue burden on non-beneficiaries."  It came to this conclusion because "by state law, all UC-eligible students must receive admission to a UC campus."  It continued, "Thus, no student would experience exclusion from the opportunity to receive a University of California education."<SUP>61</SUP>  This "UC Riverside is just as good as UCB" logic should apply to targeted minorities as well.  As it stands, though, UC eligible targeted minorities seem to have a presumptive right to attend the system's most prestigious schools to ensure that these schools exhibit the right color scheme.  At the same time, it is acceptable for the system's other schools to be filled with Asians and whites.  It is never explained why UC Santa Cruz equals UCB for whites and Asians, but not for preferred minorities.  Or why, for example, deferred admission to UCB is considered the equivalent of a direct admission for California's taxpayers who are white and Asian, when this same standard apparently isn't applied to targeted minorities, some of whom are no doubt wealthy and from out-of-state. <P>

<B>Conclusion</B><P>

The OCR's finding of non-discrimination was welcomed by proponents of racial preferences in university admissions as both a counterpoint to the <I>Hopwood</I> decision and conclusive proof that UCB's admission process does not discriminate based on race.  In reality, it was neither.  The <I>Hopwood</I> criteria, if applied to UCB, would no doubt find the school's admission process unconstitutional.  It was the OCR, an administrative bureaucracy of the federal government's Department of Education, which declared under its interpretation of both Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Justice Powell's opinion in the Supreme Court's 1978 <I>Bakke</I> decision, that UCB's admission process was "lawful."  Indeed, as shown above, this means neither that the process was race neutral nor that race did not play a major role in an applicant's chances for admission.  It merely meant that, <I>in the interpretation of the OCR</I>, race was only one factor.  Just how large a factor race is, as determined by the objective results the process produces, cannot be determined until the OCR discloses the data it used to form its conclusion.  Until that time, California residents can be assured that race-based admissions are alive and well at UCB. <P>

<SUP>14</SUP>	This leap in logic, that race equals ideological diversity, has led university administrators to strain their muscles patting themselves on the back for their success in ensuring diversity at the same time America's universities have become, ideologically speaking, some of the most homogeneous institutions in society under the scourge of political correctness.  The problem is that neither Powell, nor anyone else, has ever properly defined diversity or its relationship to certain "preferred" races and ethnicities.  That this is the case, one only need consider the fact that a Hispanic or African American who may never have left the 90210 zip code in his life is automatically considered "diverse" at the University of California while neither a person fleeing impending communism in Hong Kong nor a Russian Jew are seen as contributing to diversity.  Diversity has always been and continues to remain an ill-defined, amorphous concept. <BR>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>

Over the past year, California's public policy makers have expressed increasing optimism over the health of California's economy, the solvency of her finances, and the prospects for continued expansion.  Certainly there is cause for such optimism.  Tax reductions and workers compensation reform have begun to repair the damage done by the record-breaking tax increases of 1991; the job losses of the recession have been regained, personal income is rising, state revenues are building, the state's deficit spending is easing, and a volume of pro-growth measures have been proposed by the Wilson administration, including a 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income taxes. <P> 

A broad range of policy initiatives are now being predicated on these projections, including $5 billion of new general obligation bonds approved by voters on March 26, and the proposed 1996-97 state budget.  These initiatives are based not only upon ebullient optimism over the state's economic prospects, but also upon the conventional wisdom that the state government's services have deteriorated over the past decade because spending limitations and tax reductions have constricted revenues.  The ultimate conclusion is that California's brightening fiscal condition enables higher spending, while her need for infrastructure improvement demands it. <P>

Two cautionary notes should be sounded in discussions of the state's economy.  First, California's economy, though greatly improved from the early 90's, still shows several weaknesses which ought to be considered by policy makers.  Second, California's fiscal condition, though meliorating, is still precarious.  Furthermore, California's past experience challenges the assumption that her infrastructure crisis is due to inadequate revenues.  The optimism exuded by the state's policy makers should be tempered by the fact that Californians' behavior is contrary to what one would expect in an economy which is rapidly improving.  Real estate prices are again falling, retail sales are still sluggish, and the net outmigration which accompanied the 1990-94 recession is continuing, as suggested by outbound, one-way household relocations reported by major van lines and rental truck companies. <P>

The budget deficits which reached historic proportions in the early 1990's, and which have caused California's bond ratings to plunge, are still a serious threat to the state's long-term[B1] solvency.  Book keeping gimmicks have distorted the true picture of the state's finances, and both short-term and long-term debt is dramatic.  General Obligation bonded indebtedness has doubled between 1990 and 1994, while lease-purchase debt has tripled in the same period.  The percentage of general fund spending required to service this debt doubled between 1990 and 1994, and tripled between 1990 and 1996. <P>

Finally, although significant policy changes have been adopted in the form of both tax reductions and workers compensation reform, the tax, regulatory and litigatory policies of the state are generally unchanged from the conditions which undermined the state's economic condition in the early 1990's.  Although defense cutbacks are generally cited as the predominant factor in the state's deterioration, other states whose economies were much more dependent on defense spending performed significantly better than did California. <P>

Whether the deterioration of state services is due to revenue constraints is also questionable.  Inflation-adjusted per capita general fund spending is 65 percent more than it was in 1966, while infrastructure has declined conspicuously.  This suggests that California's inability to finance needed services and infrastructure is not revenue-based, but rather expenditure-based, and should be addressed through policies to change the way existing revenues are being spent.   Three broad policy options are offered to address the expenditure-based obstacles to service delivery and infrastructure expansion, and three policy options are offered to restore fiscal discipline to the state's appropriation and budgeting process. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTIONARY NOTES ON THE ECONOMY</FONT></B><P>

In 1991, the largest single tax increase in American history was imposed on California's economy--$8.3 billion of new taxes and fees,  or about $1,081 annually from the income of an average family of four.<SUP>1</SUP>  This fueled a nine percent increase in spending in one year, from $51.4 billion to $56.3 billion, including an eight percent increase in general fund expenditures, from $40.3 billion to $43.3 billion.<SUP>2</SUP> <P>

This tax package included a 20 percent increase in the retail sales tax.  In the following quarter, retail sales plunged faster than they had at any time in the prior 30 years.  When the sales tax was applied to bunker fuels, sales at California ports dropped precipitously, and the tax was repealed the following year because it was not generating revenue.  The economic impact was so great that projected general fund revenues fell short by $5.9 billion. <P>

Since then, a revisionism has taken shape which argues that the recession was caused by forces beyond Sacramento's control, and that the economic implosion following the tax increases was merely coincidental.  It is said that California's economic recession was the result of the national recession magnified by disproportionate cuts in defense-related industries and an over-built real estate market. <P>

This revisionism ignores several important facts. <P>

The first is that California, which does not even rank in the top ten states in the percentage of defense-related spending, performed significantly worse than states which did. As economist Arthur Laffer noted: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Defense prime contracts in California peaked in FY 1984 at $30.1 billion and declined steadily to $20.1 billion in FY 1989.  Throughout these years the California economy was more healthy than the rest of the nation.  From 1986 through 1989 the unemployment rate in California was less than the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices in California were appreciating relative to the rest of the nation. <P>

1991 was the first clear decline in the California economy relative to the U.S. economy.  Defense prime contracts to California, however, actually increased over the 1990-91 period from $20.1 billion to $21.2 billion.  The drop in prime contracts awarded to California companies does not correspond well to the drop in the state's economy.  Prime contracts declined in real terms 28 percent from FY 1984 to FY 1989, while the state's economy was doing well.  The decline in prime contracts from FY 1989 to FY 1992, the years of poor economic performance, was 8 percent.<SUP>3</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Laffer's analysis of state dependency on percentage of defense prime contracts per percentage of personal income ranked California 11th in the nation between 1990 and 1992.  Yet all but one of the states more reliant on defense spending saw greater growth in per capita personal income than California, including Arizona, Mississippi, Colorado, Alaska, and Missouri.<SUP>4</SUP><P>  

The second fact ignored by this strain of revisionism is that many California companies with major defense contracts where choosing to fulfill those contracts out of California.  For example, in 1993, Hughes Aircraft announced its decision to transfer 1,900 engineering jobs from Canoga Park to Tucson, culminating in the loss of  7,000 jobs with the closure of satellite complexes in other parts of southern California.  Hughes executives said that they had run out of patience with California's anti-business climate and when the opportunity to move came, they took it.  The entire cost of the move was expected to be recouped in three years from the savings of doing business in Arizona-estimated in the tens of millions of dollars.  Said Hughes CEO C. Michael Armstrong: "California is no longer a competitive place to do business."  The company's division chairman said company representatives had appealed to the state for regulatory relief, but to no avail.<SUP>5</SUP><P>

A third fact ignored by this revisionism is that California's net domestic migration over the last five years has been decidedly outbound.  The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 1995 that 1.5 million more Americans moved out of California than moved in during the first five years of the decade.  The state's population increase is entirely a combination of foreign immigration (much of it illegal), and high birth rates. <P>

The conventional wisdom continues that with the most painful of the defense cuts behind us and with real estate prices bottoming out, California is through the worst and is now poised for explosive economic growth based on the strength of its small businesses, its motion picture and high tech industries and returning aerospace contracts, notably McDonnell-Douglas's C-17. <P>

Actually, there is better news than this.  <I>More than three fourths of the tax increases enacted in 1991 have been repealed, have expired, or have been offset by regulatory relief</I>.<P>  

In 1992, voters ordered the repeal of sales taxes on candy and snack foods and legislators repealed the bunker and jet fuel sales tax, for combined relief of over $500 million.  On December 31, 1995, the upper income tax brackets automatically reverted from their 1991 levels of 11 percent and 10 percent to a maximum of 9.3 percent, for a savings to taxpayers of $1.3 billion.  Business tax credits for new equipment purchases, and targeted business tax cuts were adopted in 1993, providing an additional savings of $600 million.  De facto abolition of the unitary method of corporate tax assessments has provided additional tax relief.  These tax reductions alone have offset more than one-fourth of the 1991 tax increases.  Even more significant were the workers compensation regulation reforms adopted in 1993, which have resulted in cost reductions to California business of as much as $4 billion annually. <P>

It may not be mere coincidence that California's economy performed well below national figures in the aftermath of the 1989, 1990, and 1991 tax increases, nor that it began to recover following the salubrious tax and regulatory reductions which have been adopted in the last three years.  The lessons drawn from these experiences are important in discussing the Administration's proposed 15 percent across-the-board tax cuts in 1996. <P>

The new economic forecasts from Sacramento reflect robust optimism.  The Department of Finance bases its revenue assumptions on a 5.7 percent rate of growth in personal income in 1996 to 5.9 percent in 1997.<SUP>6</SUP>  The Controller is even more bullish, at 5.9 percent income growth for FY 1995.<SUP>7</SUP>  Not to be outdone, the Legislative Analyst predicts that state revenues will exceed the D.O.F. forecast by $1 billion. <P>

Such optimism was reflected in state spending plans, and in the Governor's January State of the State Address, when he announced to legislators that "The U-Hauls have reversed course" and are coming back to California. <P>

Not according to U-Haul.  From January 1 to November 15, U-Haul moved 4 percent more families out of California than into the state, the worst numbers since 1992. <P>

In its January 1996 report of one-way moving orders, Allied Van Lines painted a similar picture.  Allied reported that in 1995, California had the third highest percentage of outbound one-way moves in the country, behind New York and North Dakota.  Sixty-one percent of Allied's household relocations were outbound from California; only 39 percent were inbound.  Although this was a slight improvement over the previous year when the state ranked second behind New York with 64 percent outbound moves, it falls short of the reversal of the state's disturbing outmigration pattern. <P>

Clearly, if families are flocking back to California, they are doing so without the services of van lines or rental trucks. <P>

Real estate prices also are showing continued erosion.  The median home sales price reported by the California Association of Realtors in February 1996 was $170,920, the lowest monthly price since the recession began and the 6th straight month of decline. <P>

California families are buying more than they did during the recession, although anecdotal information on California retail sales suggests a disappointing Christmas season.  The growth in first quarter taxable transactions cooled in California between 1994 and 1995 showing a modest decline from 4.3 percent growth to 3.3 percent, but improved dramatically in the second quarter from 3.7 percent to 7.0 percent.  Third quarter growth has also improved from 4.8 percent to 5.6 percent.  These numbers are not quite as encouraging when broken down by merchandise type.  Goods with the most elastic demand are consistently underperforming general retail sales, indicating that households are avoiding frills.  Growth in recreational vehicle purchases, gifts and novelties, and sporting goods, for example, has consistently lagged behind.<SUP>8</SUP><P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CAUTIONARY NOTES ON CALIFORNIA'S FISCAL CONDITION</FONT></B><P>

The second cautionary note is that while the state government's fiscal condition is also improving, it is still far from sound.  The Department of Finance begins its current budget summary by boasting: "For the fifth consecutive year, the Governor's Budget continues the fiscal discipline necessary for California to live within its means, where spending from the State's General fund is being held below the amount of General Fund revenues."<SUP>9</SUP>   In support, the D.O.F. offers the following figures: <P>

Although it can be argued that fiscal discipline has been better than it was in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 fiscal years, the state's progress back from the brink of bankruptcy has been slower than the D.O.F. numbers first imply.  These numbers are distorted by their treatment of loans and transfers, off budget "loans" to schools, and deferred pension obligations, to name but three bookkeeping anomalies. <P>


<B>1. Adjustments for Transfers and Loans</B><P>

During each of the budget years 1990-91 to 1994-95, the state has engaged in billions of dollars of short-term borrowing.  The "balanced" numbers reported by the Department of Finance are attained, in part, by including loans and transfers of funds within the state budget, which distorts the actual balance of revenues and expenditures.  A more accurate picture of the state's general fund condition can be found in the D.O.F.'s reports of actual revenues and expenditures, undistorted by loans and transfers: <P>

<B>2. Off-Budget Loans to Schools</B><P>	

The "Off-Budget" loans are loans only in a fictional sense.  Proposition 98 established a minimum level of school funding, based in part on a percentage of state revenues.  The problem in appropriating funds under Proposition 98 is that the appropriations must be made at the beginning of the fiscal year, and the precise condition of the general fund is not known until the end.  This imprecision is compounded by inflated revenue projections the Department has until recently made at the beginning of the fiscal year.  The result is that the Proposition 98 appropriations at the outset of the fiscal year are usually higher than the condition of the general fund would require.  In 1992-93 and again in 1993-94, the legislature attempted to recapture this overappropriation by retroactively reducing school appropriations. <P>

Of course, the funds had already been expended during the past year by the schools, and those districts were in no condition to retroactively cut budgets which had already been spent.  Thus, the fictional "Off-Budget" loan was created.  The district budgets were retroactively cut on paper, and the difference was then "loaned back" to them from future entitlements.  The funds which had been fictionally cut were then spent a second time.  $1.5 billion was moved off budget in this manner in FY 1992/93 and an additional $700 million in 1993-94: <P>

This practice was ruled unconstitutional by the courts in 1994, but not until off budget loans added $2.2 billion to the state's red ink.  In CTA v. Gould, the court has ruled that the state is constitutionally required to add $4 billion to annual school appropriations as a result of this device. <P>


<B>3. Deferral of Pension Obligations</B><P>

Another device used by state budget writers during this period was a decision simply not to make the scheduled half-billion dollar pension payment to the Public Employees Retirement Fund for FY 1993-94.  Legislation was adopted as part of the trailer bills to the budget that year which accomplished this feat by pushing back the payment dates by one year.  The problem with this practice is that the state cannot simply "skip" a year of pensions to retirees.  Thus, the state has incurred $480 million of obligations which, though not actually expended, are obligated to be expended in the future.  This adjustment runs up additional red ink: <P>

This discussion is not exhaustive of all the various devices which have been employed in the state budget process during the first half of the decade.  Absent from this discussion, for example, is the use of fee increases to offset general fund expenditures, which gives the illusion of a decrease in general fund spending but which in effect is merely an increase in revenues.  Spiraling university fees and suspension of the renters' tax credit are among the most egregious examples of this.  Also unmentioned is the transfer of local property tax revenues to meet the state's obligations, which also gives the illusion of general fund cuts where none are actually made.  But once the major accounting anomalies are factored into the budget numbers, it is clear that the state has been in a condition of chronic deficit finance, from which it is only now emerging.  This condition has been responsible for the record levels of short-term borrowing which the state has had to employ. <P>


<B>4. Growing State Debt</B><P>

In order to meet the actual operating deficits in the general fund, the state has resorted to record amounts of short-term borrowing to meet the very real gap between expenditures and revenues. <P>

State borrowing can be divided into two broad categories: short term debt, which is incurred to bridge the gap between ongoing spending and revenues, and long term debt, which is used mainly to finance capital outlay.  Short term debt can be further divided into internal and external borrowing. <P>

Although the state's expenditures are fairly uniform throughout the year, state revenues fluctuate dramatically.  Because much of the revenue is received in the last half of the year, the state often experiences a negative cash-flow in the first months of the year.  This temporary cash gap can be addressed either through internal borrowing from special funds, or through entry into the capital market.  With a genuinely balanced budget, these temporary loans are retired at the end of the fiscal year. <P>

However, this benign cash management practice has been used increasingly to borrow funds without voter approval to plug the general fund's operating deficits. It is precisely this form of non-voter approved borrowing that Article XVI of the state constitution specifically prohibits beyond an aggregate of $300,000. <P>

In a real sense, the short-term borrowing by the state provides a rough gauge of the operating deficit in the state's general fund.  The debt at the end of each fiscal year has been substantial: <P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

A secondary concern is the long term debt, which is generally used to finance capital outlay.  Although this debt is not a function of the state's general fund deficits, its repayment increases pressure on the general fund (and many special funds as well). <P>

There are three kinds of long term bonds.  The first is voter-approved general obligation bonds, repaid over a period of 20 to 30 years from the state general fund.  The second is revenue bonds, which are repaid from revenues generated from the projects financed with those bonds.  A water district or a toll-bridge are examples of this kind of instrument.  Revenue bonds are not approved by voters, since they are guaranteed and redeemed not by general taxes, but by fees paid by the users of the facilities. <P>

The third kind of long term debt instrument is the so-called "Lease Purchase" bond.  Beginning in the mid 1980's, the state bypassed voters and began financing billions of dollars of capital construction through the use of these bonds based on the fiction that the lease purchase arrangement made these a form of revenue bonds, financed not from the general fund, but from the enterprise, primarily, prisons.  Since prisoners are not renting out rooms, the question arises, what is the stream of revenue the prisons are generating?  The answer is the annual prison budget which comes directly out of the state general fund.  Once again, the debt trend is dramatic: <P>

California's budget problem is that actual expenditures have significantly outpaced revenues over the past five years, with the accumulated gap filled with unprecedented levels of government borrowing.  This borrowing not only increases the obligations which future budgets must address, but the growing interest costs of short and long term debt are placing additional upward pressure on expenditures. <P>

For the first time in at least six years, the Department of Finance revenue projections for the current fiscal year are actually tracking significantly ahead of their initial projections.  Through February, 1996, $1.3 billion more has been collected than projected.  This is a dramatic change from the previous five years, when the D.O.F. consistently overestimated revenues: <P>

After general fund spending growth of 5.4 percent from FY 1994-95 to 1995-96, the Governor's budget anticipates a reduction in the growth rate to 2.3 percent for 1996-97.  The reduction in expenditure growth is due in part to major policy initiatives in health and welfare spending.  Revenue is projected to grow 1.3 percent after the first phase of a 15 percent across the board reduction in personal and corporate income taxes. <P>

These levels are based on projected rates of personal income growth of 5.7 percent in 1996-97 and 5.9 percent in 1997-98.  Taxable sales are estimated to grow 5.4 percent in 1996-97 and 4.9 percent in 1997-98, up substantially from the 3.3 percent gains posted in actual sales between the first quarters of 1994 and 1995. <P>

Surprisingly, the most controversial aspect of the proposed state budget is the Governor's intention to reduce personal and corporate income taxes by 15 percent over the next three years.  California's recent experience with tax increases and tax cuts suggests a strong correlation between economic performance and tax reductions.  The state's slowly improving economic condition and the concomitant growth in tax revenues is clearly consistent with what free-market economists have promised.  This, however, has not been enough to silence critics. <P>

Two additional observations, then, ought to be made. <P>

First, the debate over reducing the state income tax in California by 15 percent takes place at a time when Arizona Governor Fife Symington is pushing for the abolition of the Arizona state income tax.  Nevada has no income tax; Oregon has no sales tax; while California ranks 11th in per capita income taxes and 11th in per capita sales taxes among all states.<SUP>10</SUP>  Indeed, California's top marginal personal income tax rate of 9.3 percent is the highest in the nation. <P>

Second, the revenue effect of the first year of phased-in personal income tax reductions is almost entirely offset by the effective tax increase proposed in the budget through the abolition of the renter's tax credit.  The renter's tax credit was suspended in 1993, has since remained in abeyance, and is due to be restored automatically this year delivering a half-billion tax cut to California renters.  The proposed budget would abolish the credit, effectively increasing renters' income tax obligations beyond current law.  Although income tax collections would be decreased by $572 million in the first year of the proposed tax cut,<SUP>11</SUP> these revenues are offset by a $520 million in income taxes paid by renters, which would otherwise automatically be repealed.<SUP>12</SUP>  <I>Thus, the net revenue effect of the combined package is virtually neutral in the first year of operation</I>.  Static losses of revenue do not occur until January of 1998, by which time the dynamic economic impact of the cuts can be expected to boost revenues. <P>


<B>2. Notes on Expenditure Assumptions</B><P>

$2.6 billion of expenditure reductions in health and welfare are based on changes in, or waivers of, federal law.  Similar assumptions were made in last year's budget, which are now causing approximately $1.5 million in daily expenditure overruns. <P>

Last year, we warned: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social welfare spending, but there's a hitch.  The cuts can't take effect until waivers are granted from the federal government, or federal laws are changed. <P>

Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  That's a very likely scenario, considering the state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made in 1994.   The same imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit which California's taxpayers now owe.<SUP>13</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

It should be noted that these developments have indeed occurred, although the expenditure overruns are more than compensated by unanticipated increases in revenues.  Caution should be exercised in making similar assumptions of federal action in expenditure reductions which account for six percent of the state's general fund spending proposal for 1996. <P>



<B><FONT SIZE=+1>A (FOND) RETROSPECTIVE ON THE (PAT) BROWN ADMINISTRATION</B></FONT><P>

During the administration of Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown from 1959 to 1967, California government provided a cornucopia of services.  During this period, California embarked upon a historic expansion of her highway and university systems.  The state water project was constructed to provide for the needs of a growing and thirsty population.   A college education was guaranteed free to every Californian who wanted one. <P> 

Surprisingly, California's golden age of government was financed with less than two-thirds of the funds that the state is now consuming, after adjusting for both inflation and population growth.  In FY 1965-1966, the last full year of the Brown Administration, the state spent $1,070 per person (in 1995 inflation-adjusted dollars).  Today, it spends $1,775 per capita, <I>an absolute increase of more than 65 percent beyond the combined growth of population and inflation</I>.<P>

Neither the aftermath of Proposition 13, which shifted some local financing to Sacramento, nor the <I>Serrano</I> decision, which required the state to equalize education expenditures, excuse or explain such a run-up.  Total per capita inflation-adjusted spending is 31 percent more than 1972-73, the first year after <I>Serrano</I>.  It is almost exactly the same as it was in 1978-79, the first full year after Proposition 13 (adjusting for the 1992 and 1993 property tax shifts). <P>

As the population nearly doubled from 18 million to 33 million, simple economies of scale should have significantly reduced the per capita cost of providing a host of state services.  Ironically, per capita costs have increased while the quality of those basic services has declined dramatically. <P>

Why is it that a state with one of the highest marginal tax rates in the country, a state which is spending 65 percent more per person after inflation than it did in 1966, is so utterly unable to provide basic services to its people? <P>

<UL>
<LI>The cost of the University of California in this year's budget is more than $40,000 per student, not including extra-curricular expenditures.  Just three years ago, it was less than $36,000.  
 
<LI>The average cost of locking up a single prisoner in the state's prisons is $24,000.  Three years ago, it was $21,000.  Since 1980, prison costs have grown at twice the rate as prison population.
 
<LI>California taxpayers pay a flagman on a state-contracted road job $25.12 per hour in wages and benefits in most parts of the state to hold a stop-and-go sign.

<LI>Taxpayers support every classroom of 30 students in this state with nearly $168,000 of public resources, or $5,600 per pupil.  According to a recent study by the Rand Corporation, half this money never reaches the classroom.
</UL>

This experience suggests that California's failure stems not from how much revenue it is receiving, but rather how that revenue is spent.  If a golden age of California government is to return, it will come not because of increased revenues, but because of fundamental changes in the way policy makers spend those resources.  In order to make those changes, two fundamental reforms are essential.  First, the proclivities of policy makers to avoid painful policy reforms by spending more money must be disciplined.  Second, the perverse incentives under which the state's bureaucracies function must be reversed. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS</B></FONT><P>

California's fiscal affairs are a shambles in part because the constraints which the constitution placed on uncontrolled increases in spending have been eroded over the past decade.  Had these constitutional safeguards remained intact, even the most profligate class of policy makers could have done little harm.  If fiscal discipline is to be restored, constitutional provisions which were originally intended to require a balanced budget, prohibit borrowing without voter approval, and limit the growth of state spending must be restored to their original condition. <P>

First, California's constitution has always required that the budget sent to the legislature each January must be balanced, and for generations it naturally followed that the same requirement applies to the final product.  This constitutional requirement for a balanced budget has been circumvented through two devices. <P>

As discussed above, inflated revenue projections have often given the illusion of balance while annual expenditures clearly exceeded revenues.  But by 1993, even the polite pretense of a balanced budget was dropped, and the 1993 and 1994 budgets have included programmed "roll-overs" of debt from one year to the next.  Thus, budgets which would have been clearly unconstitutional if introduced in January are legally adopted in June, transforming California's balanced budget requirement from a revered practice to a quaint myth. <P>

A second vital mechanism which disciplined the state's expenditures had been Article XVI of the state constitution, which prohibits the state from borrowing more than $300,000 without a vote of the people.  A variety of court rulings and the ever-expanding interpretation of these rulings by budget writers has completely undermined this protection. <P>

During the depression of the 1930's, the state issued IOUs to meet temporary cash shortages, which the courts ruled was merely an emergency response to unanticipated events and therefore not a deliberate circumvention of the constitution.  Short term notes within the fiscal year were further sanctioned as a means to smooth out the monthly fluctuations in state revenues. <P>

This precedent has been used in recent years to justify financing a substantial portion of the state's operating deficit with billions of dollars in notes of less than one year.  During the budget deliberations of 1994, the Attorney General opined that court rulings which allowed the state to issue temporary IOU's for a few weeks between fiscal years to cover unexpected shortfalls now empowered the Legislature to enter into a multi-year $4 billion debt--tying the hands of legislators not yet elected. <P>

To add a final blow to Article XVI, the state introduced the fiction of lease-purchase bonds, which are discussed above. <P>

A third element in the taxpayer's triad of defense was a constitutional provision of more recent origin. In 1979, voters approved Proposition 4, better known as the Gann Spending Limit, which placed a flexible restraint on the total amount of funds the government could spend without voter approval.  The limit was hardly draconian (it expanded with population and inflation), and from 1979 to 1990 allowed state general fund spending to increase from $12.6 billion to $31.2 billion in current dollars. <P>

In 1988 and 1990, Propositions 98 and 111 changed the formula for calculating Gann, sending the spending limit into the upper stratosphere of government finance, where it still orbits unobtrusively today.  For example, Proposition 111, which the Legislature titled a "Transportation Improvement and Spending Limitation Act," increased the spending ceiling by $53.3 billion over a decade for purposes unrelated to transportation. <P>

The requirements that policy makers balance the budget, that they seek voter permission for borrowing and that they obtain public approval for expenditures above a certain limit, which operated effectively throughout the 1980's, have been knocked down one by one.  But in addition, perverse provisions have been adopted to encourage fiscal folly. <P>

The strangest provision virtually guarantees a future of deficit finance.  To his credit, Governor George Deukmejian insisted on a three percent prudent reserve for economic uncertainties, providing the budget with a cushion to accommodate unexpected revenue shortfalls or cost overruns. It was this reserve that protected California against deficits in the mid-1980's, and won the state a triple-A bond rating. <P>

Ironically, just when a reserve was most needed to cushion the erratic revenue and expenditure projections of the Department of Finance, the state's stewards eliminated the reserve, translating every miscalculation into red ink. <P>

To make matters worse, the 1991 budget included a statute which guarantees that a budget reserve will never be restored.  As part of the $8.1 billion tax and fee package that year, a quarter cent sales tax hike was instituted with a perverse trigger.  The $750 million annual tax is set to expire automatically when a three percent budget reserve is restored.  In effect, this measure provides budget writers with a $750 million disincentive ever to restore a prudent reserve, guaranteeing that every future calamity or shortfall will ratchet the state progressively deeper into debt. <P>

To restore fiscal discipline to the budget making process, it is an essential prerequisite that a true balanced budget provision be enacted into the state constitution; that a three percent reserve requirement govern all future budgets, and that the full intent of Article XVI be restored to prohibit non-voter approved borrowing.  If these provisions sound extreme, it is a measure of how dramatically the state's fiscal management has changed. These are precisely the constraints under which the state budget operated until the late 1980's, when California maintained a triple-A bond rating even while general fund expenditures more than doubled. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RESTORING FISCAL DISCIPLINE TO THE BUREAUCRACY</B></FONT><P>

In addition to restoring fiscal discipline to the budget process, three dramatic alterations must be made to the bureaucracy itself.   First, brisk, healthy competition must be restored for the provision of governmental goods and services.  Second, superfluous or superannuated bureaucracies must be eliminated.  Third, the civil service system must be placed under the discipline of a free market. <P>

In their <I>History of Civilization</I>, Will and Ariel Durant ask the question, "What makes Ford a good car?"  Their answer, "Chevrolet." <P>

No human enterprise could be reasonably expected to perform optimally if the best and brightest producers were paid the same as the dullest and laziest sluggards.  Incentives matter: excellence must be rewarded if the sacrifices required to attain it are to be endured.  Over time, few people could be expected to continue to strive, to innovate, or to improve if guaranteed the same number of customers, an unbroken chain of pay increases, and a constantly expanding budget.  Yet this is precisely the way we manage the institutions responsible for educating our children, protecting our families and supporting our communities. <P>

Over the past twenty years, insurmountable obstacles have been deliberately erected to prevent California's government from doing what every family and business in the state does routinely: shop around for the best service at the lowest price. <P>

A constitutional amendment repealing anti-competitive provisions in current law would prompt an explosion in privatizing, offering California's beleaguered taxpayers a veritable cornucopia of better services at lower costs--a concept universal in the market but unknown in the government.  More importantly, it would introduce competitive incentives for bureaucrats to contain costs, to innovate, to improve efficiency, and even to be nice to their customers. <P>

Secondly, California government is riddled with overlapping bureaucracies and duplicative jurisdictions, both within the state government and among local, state and federal levels.  In 1992, the Commission on California Competitiveness warned: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Overlapping jurisdictions occur not only at all levels of government--state, regional and local--but within single-purpose agencies as well.  The result is a labyrinth of policies and regulations which, instead of fostering a thriving business community, confound and stymie small and large business alike.</BLOCKQUOTE> 

In addition, a wide range of state agencies simply provide no vital services at all.  In fact, when California's drought was officially declared at an end during the floods of 1993, instead of disbanding the superfluous "Drought Information Center," the bureaucracy was re-named the "Water Conservation Center" and will presumably continue through the next biblical flood. <P>

The obstacle to eliminating such agencies is that each has an established constituency, with a huge financial incentive to lobby for its expansion.  Congress faced this resistance when reformers tried to close out-dated military bases.  The result was the "Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission," an independent panel responsible for drafting a base closure list insulated from parochial congressional concerns.  The list of unnecessary bases cannot be amended by congress or the president, but must be accepted or rejected in total.  This mechanism protects members of congress from special interest pressures while proceeding with the long overdue closure of obsolete facilities.  A "Bureaucracy Closure Commission" could insulate legislators and the governor from the same pressures while taking the historic action of actually eliminating unnecessary state agencies. <P>
	
Third, the state's civil service system must be overhauled, as has been repeatedly advocated by officials as diverse as the governor and the legislative analyst.  California state employees are potentially just as productive and efficient and innovative and courteous as their private sector counterparts.  However, they are denied the incentives, inducements and rewards for excellence which are provided in every other field of human endeavor outside of government.  The state's civil service system fails to encourage the best and the brightest to rise to the top, and it provides a range of perverse financial and procedural incentives that destroy the impetus toward excellence which act on private sector workers in a competitive environment. <P>

Civil service examinations, which were originally intended to identify and promote proficiency, are now weighted with so many non-merit considerations (such as whether the applicant is a veteran or an incumbent state employee), that non-favored applicants with much higher performance are arbitrarily excluded.  The state's de facto racial and gender quotas further skew what was originally conceived as a system built exclusively on merit.  Ninety nine percent of eligible state employees received the maximum allowable "merit salary" increase last year, making a mockery of rewarding excellence over mediocrity.  Complicated personnel procedures make disciplinary action against state employees prohibitively expensive.   Incestuous promotions within agencies freeze out superior applicants and seniority protections reward longevity above all other considerations. <P>

The provisions in current law which capriciously confer unearned advantages in civil service examinations to veterans, state employees and other privileged classes ought to be removed.  The preference of seniority over merit ought to be discontinued.  The Public Employment Relations Board should be abolished, disciplinary proceedings should be streamlined, and dismissal standards conformed to those already well practiced in the private sector.  Outcome-based criteria for evaluating and rewarding job performance should be re-introduced. <P>

The reason that common-sense reforms are often ignored brings us to the second malfunction of the civil service: the enormous influence of public employee unions over the selection of management.  Public employee unions have significant advantages which are not shared by private sector unions, including the collection of union dues and political contributions at public expense, the ability to directly influence the selection of management  through the election process, and the ability to hold the public hostage in prolonged strikes. <P>  

If this unfair influence is to be contained, California's long-standing prohibition against public employee strikes, which was struck down by the Rose Bird Supreme Court, must be restored.  Public funds should not be used to assist the exaction of political contributions and union dues from state employees.  A state Hatch Act, modeled after the federal law which until recently maintained the political neutrality of federal bureaucrats, must be enacted to restrict the extent to which state public employees may make political demands on state elected officials. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CONCLUSION</B></FONT><P>

	Californians live in a state which has been blessed by the most equitable climate in the North American continent.  Geographically, it is poised on the Pacific rim, in a position to dominate trade in the next century.  It has the most bountiful resources of any of the contiguous states.  And yet for five years, it has suffered a continuing exodus of domestic population.  An unprecedented number of California's sons and daughters have found a better place to live and work and raise their families in the middle of the Nevada or Arizona deserts than they found in California.  This exodus has not been the result of acts of God, but rather of government.  Given the right policies, there is every reason to expect California to resume the prosperity, optimism and growth which has characterized her history as recently as the Pat Brown administration, when inflation-adjusted per capita spending was 38 percent less than it is today. <P>

California's recent experience affirms the wisdom of additional phased in tax cuts and suggests that the disastrous impact of the 1991 tax increases is being slowly repaired through the gradual repeal, expiration or offset of taxpayers' overall tax and regulatory burdens. <P>

Caution must still be exercised in planning the state's fiscal affairs, however, in the absence of significant changes in expenditure policy.  California's crumbling infrastructure, her failed public schools, her ubiquitous and overbearing regulators, her chronic budget deficits, her expanding bureaucracies, are all lessons unheeded from ancient Rome to modern Russia.  California's institutions are reaching the terminal phase of bureaucratic evolution, when they begin to fail to provide the most basic of services even while they consume ever increasing portions of the society's productivity. <P>

The brisk competition of a market place, the clear-headed elimination of unnecessary programs and agencies, and the restoration of merit as the guiding force of governmental administration are essential antidotes to the California's chronic fiscal anemia. <P>

A return to California's golden age requires a return to the fiscal discipline and the wholesome incentives which guided past generations. Ultimately, this is a question of political willpower.  It will happen on the day that the political will of the voters to demand reform exceeds the political will of the bureaucracy to resist it. <P>

<ALIGN=right>March 8, 1996</FONT></P>


<P ALIGN=center><FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Rocky Road to Electricity Deregulation</FONT></B><P>

In the last 15 years deregulation of major industries has led, in most cases, to better service and lower costs--witness the airline and telephone industries.  Likewise in the case of electricity, economists are happy to report that costs--and rates--will be going down.  The reason?  Good old-fashioned American competition.<P> 

Currently California consumers buy their electricity from individual power companies that have monopolies in their local markets, courtesy of the government, which both regulates them and sets their rates through the Public Utilities Commission.  Now, because of a 1992 federal law we are entering a new era in which power companies from all over the country will be able to compete to sell consumers electricity in much the same way people now buy phone service.  Although this new and better system promises lower costs and better service, there is a growing and heated debate here in California over the transition from monopoly to full blown free-market competition. <P>

The transition will not be easy.  The difficulties demonstrate the inefficiencies of the system of regulated monopolies that is common in our country.  This system has many of the same inequities of pure socialized production.  It carries negatives for customers and for the economy at large.  In the case of electricity, the problem has two parts.  The first is that rates have been set by a government body, and the ratepayers have no choice but to pay the rate that is set.  Power companies build into their rates all kinds of costs that would not be there in the face of competition. For many companies, competition could mean massive downsizing--loss of jobs and benefits on a large scale. <P>

The second problem is the potential, often realized, for an oversupply of electrical production.  The laws that set up the electricity monopoly here in California compel the power companies to provide electricity to any customer who seeks it.  Because electricity cannot be stored, it must be produced on demand.  This means that facilities must be able to meet all demands that are put on it.  This requires a significant investment in facilities and coordination.  To compound this challenge the Public Utilities Commission, in the interest of using renewable resources, mandated that power companies purchase electricity from co-generation plants--industrial facilities who create electricity using a by-product such as steam--at a cost significantly higher than their existing power plants.  In effect they are mandated not to be as efficient as they know they can be. <P>

Compare this to a company subjected to normal competition.  Like the power companies, they must predict how much their customers will demand.  To meet demand, they must make investments--in advance--in machines, materials and labor.  If they produce too much, they will have goods on hand that they cannot sell.  If they produce too little, they will miss opportunities to sell at a profit, opportunities likely to be seized by their competitors. <P>

The market rewards competitors that anticipate customers demands accurately.  In other words, companies make money if they make the correct advance decisions about what consumers will want and in what quantities they will want it.  Power companies are relieved of this pressure.  Moreover, the very laws that tell them to make sure they do not underestimate consumer demand encourage them to build power plants that are very expensive to operate and that are not necessary to meet market demand.  For example, several nuclear reactors in both Northern and Southern California cannot compete with the latest modern plants using non-nuclear technology.  We now know that they should not have been built.  Would a private company have made such a mistake?  Sometimes they do, but when they do, they suffer the consequences.  That makes them more careful. <P>  

To worsen an already bad situation, the government has intervened even more directly in the capital decisions of the regulated monopolies.  The windmills that stand in vast flocks in the low desert of Southern California and East Bay valleys in the North were built under the pressure of regulatory requirements, not market demand.  They are not an efficient way to produce electricity, but they please people who have an ideological commitment to the environment--or an investment in windmills.  The extra cost imposed on the electricity ratepayers is a hidden tax. <P>
  
Who should pay to get out of this situation?  It is true that the power companies have enjoyed a cozy situation for many years.  One argument is they--meaning their shareholders and possibly also their bondholders--should now pay the cost for the power plants that are not needed.  These power plants constitute what is called a "stranded investment," meaning that the investment has been made, but there may be no revenue stream to pay the investors back.  Why not leave the investors, the shareholders and bondholders of the regulated monopolies, high and dry? <P>

The answer against this route is that the public made commitments, which amount to a contract, in two different ways.  Through their political institutions the people passed laws that require the regulated monopolies to meet customer demand, and to meet all of it.  And they have required that power be produced in certain ways, whether the power companies liked it or not.  It would be one-sided to ask the shareholders of the regulated monopolies to bear the full cost.  These investment decisions were mandated by public authorities, so the public should bear the cost along with shareholders. <P>

The issue of principle raised by this point is profound.  An old tradition in America says that contracts are sacred, and they must be kept by all parties, even when one of those parties is the people acting through the government.  That tradition stems directly from the principles stated in the founding documents of our nation. <P>
  
We need then to accomplish two things.  The first is to put a stop to government sponsored monopoly in any function that can be performed by an ordinary business in a competitive environment.  In particular we must subject the electricity industry to the full rigor of competition.  This will impose upon that industry profound change, and likely some of its leading companies will lose their competitive advantage.  Some may even disappear. That is how markets work.  They are not kind to the inefficient or the slow. <P>  

As we make the transition, we must pay scrupulous attention to the commitments we have made and the costs we have imposed on others. This means, in practical terms, that the "stranded investments" of the electricity companies must be recaptured by them, and at the expense of the ratepayers over some reasonable period of time.  Especially is this true in cases-such as the windmills out in the desert-where the power companies had no control over these costs.  Electricity prices will fall more slowly because of this.  Let it be a lesson to us to keep the government out of such matters wherever possible. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>INTRODUCTION</B></FONT><P>

American parents, politicians, and business leaders are concerned about the quality of American education.  Everyone agrees that the system is broken.  And although there are dozens of ideas for reforming the schools, no idea is more widely accepted than the need for higher standards.  Other reform ideas--such as voucher programs, charter schools, or increasing per pupil expenditures--have vociferous advocates but lack the widespread support needed to change public education on a systemic basis. <P>

Almost all Americans agree that the schools do not set their sights high enough.  Raising standards is considered one of the best ways to improve the schools and students without radical restructuring.  It is thus useful to look at recent reform efforts which have focused on standards.  By doing so, we can evaluate the potential of current efforts and better understand what is at stake.  The essential question that must be addressed is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is more fundamental overhaul needed?  No state offers a better example of both the promise and pitfalls of standards reform than California. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Honig Years</B></FONT><P>  

California in the early 1980s was widely regarded as a trailblazer on the path to education reform.  It had a massive publicity campaign detailing the ideas to be implemented.  It had a highly regarded leader in Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, first elected in 1982.  It had one of the nation's largest teachers' unions and a state school system attentive to the latest ideas of reform. <P>

Honig ran and was first elected on a "back to basics" platform, which the public saw as the needed corrective after the explosive growth of school spending under Wilson Riles.  During the first years of his watch, schools refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, and it paid off.  From 1983 to 1987, elementary school pupils showed slow but steady improvement on the California Assessment Program (CAP) exam, though the increases were not consistent across the board and students continued to score well below the national average on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) and the Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT).  In all, however, there was reason for guarded optimism. <P>

What happened?  Like the Greek tragedies studied in the early days of American education, the mighty Golden State's small successes soon gave way to a punishing hubris.  State education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and began to put more emphasis on ideas popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists.  So from a primary focus on tried-and-true methods of basic education, the system lurched toward a more radical agenda.  There were numerous reasons for the change. <P>

Honig and the State Department of Education decided in 1987 that California's standards were not being applied "equitably."  Some students, mostly in middle to upper middle class areas, were performing better than students in poorer areas.  In such areas, active parents began to challenge school districts to deliver on the new basics education and the result was a system where students in some districts saw accelerated learning.  But in areas where parents were less involved and districts less challenged, scores continued to slide. <P>

Honig and others also became concerned that higher standards and greater discipline would frustrate and hurt the self esteem of many students.  He claimed that kindergartners were being pushed too hard to learn how to read, write, add, and subtract.  Instead of learning to read, Honig said, children ages four, five, and six should be spending their days listening to stories, acting out plays, counting with beans, growing plants in the windows and building with blocks. <P>

Thus in 1987, the four years of California's modest attempts at reform ended and a new, more ambitious endeavor was launched.  New frameworks began to focus on "higher-order thinking skills," so-called "learning to learn" skills, and other abstract education theories.  Skills-based learning was pushed aside for a performance, or "outcome-based" curriculum. <P>

Hailed at the time as cutting edge and widely endorsed by business leaders, the new state standards led to a swift reversal in the gains of the previous four years.  From 1988 to 1994, statewide SAT scores stagnated.  Some districts did worse than others.  From 1990 to 1994, for example, the Los Angeles Unified School District's verbal average fell 13 points, and its math average declined by 16 points.  To take one year, the district's average in 1992 was 789--more than 100 points below the national average of 899 and the statewide average of 900.  That was down from 797 in 1991; 806 in 1990; and 817 in 1989.  On the verbal portion of the test, Los Angeles students averaged 357 points-down from 361 in 1991; 366 in 1990; and 372 in 1989.  On the math portion, students averaged 432 points--down from 436 in 1991; 440 in 1990; and 445 in 1989. <P>

These numbers were not lost on the business world that would be hiring the next generation of Golden State graduates.  According to a 1992 survey by the Council on California Competitiveness, 63 percent of California employers said recent high school graduates applying for entry level jobs "lack a satisfactory education." <P>

By spring 1995, after eight years of experimenting with these progressive education techniques, California's education officials could no longer make excuses for students' poor performance.  Tests at both the national and state levels indicated a tragic debacle.  In March, the results of the defunct California Learning Assessment System test showed that a majority of the state's fourth, eighth, and tenth graders were below acceptable levels in reading, writing and math.  When the National Assessment of Education Progress reported a month later that California's fourth graders tied for last with 
Louisiana in reading proficiency, it was clear that the reforms of the last decade had failed. Newly elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin called the results "depressing" and pointed out what many California parents had known, or at least suspected, for a long time: "Our students are not learning to read well enough."<SUP>1</SUP><P>

The fact that she had presided over these years of failed experimentation from post as chairman of the Assembly Education Committee makes her admission all the more dramatic.  "We are not here to make excuses," Eastin said.  "The bottom line is something is wrong.  The kids' basic skills are not what they should be."<SUP>2</SUP>  It was a stunning admission that shocked the national education establishment.  It came from a woman who had either written or supported much of the legislation that compelled the schools to turn their back on skills instruction in the first place. <P>

The state went on red alert--again.  In the wake of the bad news, Eastin formed the California Reading Task Force, a 24 member panel of education experts, teachers, parents, and community members, to assess the present methods of reading instruction and suggest improvements. <P>

The task force issued its recommendations in September.  Entitled, "Every Child A Reader," the task force's report was in large measure a repudiation of the state's eight year experiment with "Whole Language," one of the major reforms implemented as part of the revised 1987 frameworks.  Considered one of the most dynamic ideas in education, whole language teaches reading by teaching students to identify words by sight, rather than sounding out words using the traditional phonics method. <P>

Though the task force did not recommend abolishing whole language entirely, its report made important concessions to traditionalists.  Among other things, "Every Child A Reader" called for a "balanced approach" in reading instruction, combining the "literature based" technique of whole language with skills development and tried-and-true, intensive systematic phonics. <P>

Even Bill Honig, the fallen champion of school reform, admitted to the news media that maybe he had pushed too far--that maybe the state shouldn't have eliminated skills instruction after all.<SUP>3</SUP><P>

The revelations from CLAS and NAEP are only the latest numbers indicating that California's students are wallowing in the education mire, if not sinking.  They are even more significant in light of what was already known when the Golden State began to reform itself.  Twelve years earlier, the National Commission on Excellence in Education's landmark report, "A Nation At Risk," identified a "rising tide of mediocrity" in the schools and launched a series of reforms supposed to put public education right back on track.  There was no longer any question that the establishment didn't know that something was wrong. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rediscovering Standards, Again</B></FONT><P>

In the wake of these revelations, new ideas took shape.  "Standards" became the battle cry of the eighties, as education officials, legislators, administrators, and teachers labored over how to make kids learn better.  Conservative political reformers' call to raise expectations and accountability was heard.  The education establishment agreed.  For the first time in nearly 40 years there was a consensus about what needed to be done.  Standards, however, have proved to be more problematic than once believed.  The movement to raise standards gave rise to a fundamental conflict of visions that has split efforts to reform the education system.  The questions became whose standards and how to implement them.  Even the methods needed to measure them differed radically. <P>

While almost everyone agrees on the end--that students should graduate from school having, among other things, mastered certain basic skills--there is fierce disagreement about the means.  Much of the debate centers on "content" versus "performance" standards.  Content standards refer to the skills and knowledge to be taught, while performance standards focus on the depth of mastery, often through essays, science experiments, mathematical evidence, or a combination of these activities, in each skill area. <P>

Performance standards have garnered the most recent national attention, mainly due to their association with Outcome Based Education (OBE) curriculum and testing.  The problem with OBE is that nobody fails.  Getting the correct answer, students are told, is not nearly so important as how they solve the problem.  And so the push for standards was ultimately hijacked in the mid 1980s by the abandonment of basic skills in favor of immeasurable, obscure "skills" such as "critical thinking" and "problem solving." Performance either remained static, with occasional upticks, or declined. <P>

A 1993 federally-funded study showed U.S. high school students spend an average of only three hours every school day on core academic subjects.  Classwork in English, math, science, history, geography, foreign languages, civics, and fine arts lags by 50 percent behind that of competitor nations.  Total academic hours in a four year period in the U.S. is 1,460, compared to 3,268 in Germany and 3,170 in Japan.<SUP>4</SUP><P>

Thus, the last fifteen years have been a story of failed reform.  After all the "back to basics" rhetoric, the revised curriculum, the new assessments, and  higher expenditures, California schools were in worse shape than ever.  Understanding why these efforts failed will help us map a more intelligent course to achieve the goal of higher standards and improved education for all students. <P>

Thirty years ago, California's schools weren't that bad.  There was no state-mandated curriculum or graduation requirements a generation ago, and yet California's students were at or near the top of their game.  Priorities began to shift in the 1960s, as progressive ideas in education gained new currency in the education department and teachers' colleges and began filtering into schools and enshrined in law.  The 1970s saw a downward slide in standardized test scores.  From 1970 to 1980, California's average SAT score fell 58 points, from 957 to 899.  The average verbal score fell from 464 to 425, and the average math score falling from 493 to 474.<SUP>5</SUP><P>

In 1982, the only requirement to graduate from high school in the state was two years of physical education.<SUP>6</SUP>  School districts had their own graduation requirements, but nearly half were non-academic courses, a lingering and persistent symptom of the "life education" model popular in the 1950s.  Also, schools regularly assigned their students into tracks, depending on their grades and how well they performed on standardized tests.  Former U.S.  Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch explains that tracking tended to shortchange students, especially those students who were neither exemplary nor in need of remedial help: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"A Stanford University study released in 1984 found that high school students were assigned to four different tracks.  About 10 percent were in an honors track, about 35 percent were in the college preparatory track, 10-15 percent were in a remedial track, and nearly 45 percent were in the general track.  The general track students had the weakest, most incoherent curriculum, with the most non-academic electives.  A sample transcript of a general track student included courses in typing, cultural awareness, homemaking, beginning restaurant management, food for singles, exploring childhood, and clothing."<SUP>7</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=right>-State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig, April 1986</P>

In 1983, Californians looked upon their schools and despaired.  That year, "A Nation At Risk" sent shockwaves through the American education establishment.  California's education officials faced climbing dropout and illiteracy rates, and plummeting standardized test scores.  When Bill Honig took office in January 1983, the average combined SAT score was 895.  (By comparison, the national average that year was 893.<SUP>8</SUP>)<P>

A self-described former progressive turned traditionalist, Honig campaigned throughout the 1980s on the need for schools to "get back to basics."  His message was the same wherever he went:  Kids need more homework, better-trained teachers, more challenging textbooks, stricter discipline, and a traditional education firmly rooted in the basics.  Math, science, history, and literature were not just for the college-bound.<SUP>9</SUP>  He criticized the non-academic courses which dominated the various curriculums offered in over 1,000 school districts across the state, and vowed to do away with tracking.  He won the 1982 election with 56 percent of the vote. <P>

Upon his election, Honig immediately set out to centralize the curriculums.  Students would no longer be able to graduate from high school with courses in home economics and food.  In 1983, Honig pushed (and the legislature passed) SB 813, the California Education Reform Act, an $800 million reform package that set strict graduation requirements, and created a state-mandated curriculum that included English, history, math, science, fine arts, foreign language, health, and physical education.<SUP>10</SUP>  Honig retooled the CAP test, setting the average score at 250 and challenging all schools to meet or exceed that number. <P>

Honig took a strong stand on textbooks, arguing that most had been watered down over the last decade.  With 11 percent of the total U.S. student population, California is the largest textbook buyer in the nation (with Texas a close second).  When California wants a change, the textbook publishers listen.  In 1985, the state rejected most junior high school science books up for consideration.  In 1986, it rejected all of the math books.<SUP>11</SUP>  And in 1988, the state threatened to do the same with about half of the reading, spelling, and English texts unless publishers revised them to place greater emphasis on writing and making stories more interesting. <P>

Honig also began issuing annual report cards to chart the progress of reform.  In June 1986, Honig's state report card found that after three years of the reform effort, only 47 percent of the state's 739 high schools were able to raise the reading and math scores on the CAP test high enough to meet the goals set in 1983.  CAP averages rose less than one percent overall, and when compared with similar tests, California students ranked 41st percentile nationally in reading, 48th percentile in math.<SUP>12</SUP>  Nationally, they have remained at or near the bottom ever since. <P>

But Honig assured the public that reform was right on track.  After three years, he could boast that for the first time since 1979, California's sixth grade students showed as much progress in the basic skills as third graders.  The 1985-86 scores for third, sixth and eighth graders showed improvement in all subject areas but eighth grade history.  Both third and sixth graders raised their average scores by 17 points.  "There is momentum, there is direction, there is a common vision," Honig said.<SUP>13</SUP><P>

Also, SAT scores went up 11 points from 1982-83 to 1986-87, when California's average combined score was 906.  The national average for 1986-87 was also 906.  (California's 12th graders tended to score better on the math portion of the test--482 compared to 476 nationally--and lower on the verbal portion--424 compared to 430 nationally.)  That year, 46.4 percent of California's high school seniors took the college entrance exam.<SUP>14</SUP>

There was good reason then to believe that the reforms were working.  As columnist Peter Schrag wrote after Honig released his data, <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The report recognizes the progress that's been made under the state's school reform law of 1983 and the increased funding of the past three years.  But it also documents how far California--now mediocre at best by most national standards--still has to go, and how much more difficult the problems of California education are likely to become in the next few years.  Student performance on academic test scores--assuming they're indicative--shows similarly mixed numbers.  Scores of elementary school students are up from their lows of the 1970s.  They started to rise before the reform law was passed, both in California and nationally, and before George Deukmejian and Bill Honig were elected, while high school scores, both on California's own tests and on such measures as the SAT are still lagging.  In 1984-85, for example, 12th graders scored considerably higher in mathematics on the CAP test than they had five years earlier, but slightly lower in reading."<SUP>15</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=right>-California State Language Arts Frameworks</P>

At Superintendent Honig's behest, the course of reform shifted in 1987.  New curriculum "frameworks" were introduced that departed radically from the "back to basics" approach he advocated over the previous four years.  Four factors contributed to the change. <P>

First, higher standards were a victim of their own success.  Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) surveyed 17 unidentified high schools across the state and found that all exceeded the standards imposed by SB 813.  As the basics appeared to improve, however, schools began tinkering with other areas of instruction which had nothing whatsoever to do with reading, writing, or math.  "We found people talking about an even more complex and deeper curriculum: thinking skills, learning-to-learn skills, problem-solving skills," said USC education professor Allan Odden, a member of the PACE research team.<SUP>16</SUP>  But as priorities changed, so did the definition of "basic skills."  Simply teaching verb conjugation and multiplication was not enough.  Schools had to teach kids how to think. <P>

Second, even though reform was working, the improvements were not evident across the board.  Honig and other educationists began to worry that reform was not progressing as well in certain areas, particularly inner cities.  Honig estimated that a little more than a quarter of the state's 1,780 middle and high schools had made real progress with the 1983 reforms.  About 40 percent had made some progress, but "there's another 25 percent where nothing has happened."<SUP>17</SUP>  Lingering problems, Honig and other education analysts throughout the state reasoned, had to do foremost with inequities in funding and changing demographics. <P>

Also, Honig was concerned that younger children were being overwhelmed by performance goals too early.  Advocating they be read to instead, he urged schools to hold off teaching kindergarten students to read.  He feared that too much attention on academics early on would alienate and possibly drive away students later and cited a study indicating that future drop-outs could be identified as early as third grade. <P>

Finally, an increasingly performance-based curriculum generated the need for performance-based assessment.  The trouble was, nobody could agree on what exactly "performance-based" meant.  As priorities changed to favor "learning-to-learn" skills and the like, assessment systems had to change as well. <P>

So, skills instruction was out, and outcome-based instruction was in.  Though differing in subject, each new curriculum framework was built around four central ideas: <P>

<UL>
<LI>An emphasis on thinking, application, and problem solving;
 
<LI>High expectations for all students, instead of the tracking that had been prevalent;
 
<LI>A focus on the body of knowledge and the ways of knowing in each discipline, enabling every student to build a foundation for future learning;
 
<LI>A shift from coverage of minute details to emphasis on understanding the major ideas in each field.<SUP>18</SUP>
</UL>

An instructional shift from minutia to the bigger picture sounded like a good idea at the time, but before long it was clear that the change in focus robbed students of the very foundation for learning that the frameworks were supposed to provide.  As priorities changed, non-academic subject matter began to leak back into the curriculum.  Thus, the definition of "skills" was expanded to include "critical thinking," "life skills," "conflict resolution," and a whole gaggle of special interest-mandated studies which came at the expense of the true basics. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Language Arts</B></FONT><P>

Under the new frameworks, California stopped teaching English and began teaching "language arts." The new language arts framework all but abandoned basic skills instruction.  Elementary grammar, punctuation, spelling, and vocabulary went by the boards: no more drills, no more workbooks, no more vocabulary tests. <P>

But the most radical change was the way in which reading was taught.  For more than thirty years, with the exception of a short period in the early seventies, California students learned to read using the "Look-Say" method, best known for the "Dick and Jane" series of readers.  Look-Say was the among the first in a long line of progressive education reforms designed to make learning more interesting.  The theory behind it was that kids could learn to read better by identifying words with pictures--See Dick, see Dick run, see Dick run to the Tree, and so forth.  Look-Say largely replaced phonics, which teaches kids to read by sounding out words through drill and repetition.  Educationists dismissed phonics as too boring.  But research has indicated time and again that intensive systematic phonics is the most effective method of reading instruction, boring or not.  California retained some aspects of phonetic instruction in the Look-Say curriculum. <P>

The new language arts framework jettisoned Dick and Jane--along with what little phonetic instruction that remained-for the "literature-based" approach known as "whole language."  Like its predecessor Look-Say, whole language teaches students to identify whole words rather than sound them out.  The technique is based on the belief that if kids can learn to speak by being exposed to spoken words, then they can become literate by being exposed to literature. <P>

But whole language is more than just a method of teaching kids to read.  It's a philosophy of learning.  As one proponent described it, whole language is "child-centered, experiential, reflective, authentic, holistic, social, collaborative, democratic, cognitive, developmental, constructivist, and challenging."<SUP>19</SUP>  Phonics, whole language enthusiasts say, is "generally boring and lead[s] to a dislike of reading," "misrepresent[s] what reading is," "detract[s] from time that would be better spent in reading aloud together," and "lead[s] to unrealistic expectations for children."<SUP>20</SUP>  Eighty-seven percent of reading teachers embraced whole language, according to a survey, and fewer than one in ten employed phonics.<SUP>21</SUP><P>

Honig and the state education department made it clear that there was not enough attention to writing under the old frameworks, largely because writing wasn't tested.  As with reading, the whole language approach to writing is based on the faith that students will learn to write by immersion in writing.  This method has some rather disturbing byproducts.  One byproduct of whole language is "invented spelling," which is the educationist's euphemism for uncorrected misspelling.  The idea is to shift "from a focus on error to a focus on creation" and to encourage students to become "natural writers." Just as reading is supposed to come naturally, through exposure to literature, "learning to spell should ultimately be as natural, unconscious, effortless, and pleasant as learning to speak."<SUP>22</SUP><P>

Even though Honig has since switched his position on whole language, he still finds merit in invented spelling.  In fact, he believes the method can even be used effectively in phonics instruction: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"'Invented' or 'temporary' spelling is a technique that allows students to approximate the letters and patterns of letters which represent a given sound and so permits the construction of more advanced writing connected to student interests.  It is a helpful technique to encourage students to write and pays off in increased writing volume and more elaborate stories, which in turn encourage children to think about what they are writing more than traditional techniques."<SUP>23</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

Couched in such technical terms, invented spelling almost sounds reasonable.  Here it is in practice, as employed by a six-year old student in San Francisco: "If i wd hf mg ics I wd save the bses and one I sav the bes then I wi g thm way the end."  Translation: "If I would have magic beans, I would save the beans.  And when I save the beans, then I will give them away.  The End."  The child was writing a book report about "Jack and the Beanstalk" for his first grade class.  His teacher, Michelle Chabra, told the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I> that he was permitted, even encouraged, to write that way because it will help him become a writer in "the truest sense."  "The issue is confidence," she said.<SUP>24</SUP><P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Education As Therapy: The Self Esteem Task Force</B></FONT><P>

Building confidence was and remains a crucial element of California's curriculum.  By reinforcing the self-esteem of students, the theory goes, all other things would fall into place; students would be more interested in learning, thereby improving their performance.  California, always on the forefront of education change, reacted to this new thinking with its <I>modus operandi</I>--it formed a task force.<P>

The California Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem first convened in 1988.  Three years and $735,000 later, the task force concluded that a positive sense of self was the cure for what ails many students, especially in the crime-ridden inner cities.<P>

A good self-conception, the task force reported, "inoculates us against the lures of crime, violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, child abuse, chronic welfare dependency, and educational failure."<SUP>25</SUP><P>

This thinking about feelings profoundly affected the course of California education.  While the public called for higher standards, standards within the education universe were corrupted by the new psychological imperative that failure was not an option because of its alienating effect on students.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Mathematics</B></FONT><P>

California introduced its new mathematics frameworks in 1985.  They would become a model for the national math standards introduced four years later.  Similar to the language-arts model, the new curriculum was designed to teach math in a "new, dynamic way," again by moving away from basics and refocusing on "problem-solving skills."<P>

For example, writes Charles Sykes, "a typical eighth grade student might be asked to 'Write a set of directions for a younger student, explaining how to add 2/3 and 1/3.  Then use a picture and write an explanation as to why you add fractions the way you do.'  The idea was to encourage children to think and communicate mathematically, a skill that was encouraged by having students write in journals and creating mathematical artwork."<SUP>26</SUP> Flash cards and multiplication tables were out.  For the first time, students were permitted to use calculators.<P>

And teachers stopped teaching.  A teachers' guide for one fourth grade math text admonished instructors to step back and let students lead discussions.  "Your job is . . . not to judge the rightness or wrongness of each student's answer.  Let those determinations come from the class. . . .  Avoid showing any verbal or nonverbal signs of approval and ask, 'Does everybody agree?'"<SUP>27</SUP><P>

According to Wayne Bishop, professor of mathematics at California State University, Los Angeles and a member of the State Superintendent's Math Task Force, this "new, new math" departed too far from the rudiments of math in favor of this "dynamic" approach.  "There has been far too much support for curricula and instructional techniques that are perceived as being in harmony with the California Framework . . . and the NCTM [National Council of Teachers of Mathematics] Standards, given that there is almost no statistical data that has been confirmed as valid and reliable in support.  In fact, considerable contrary data, such as the Oklahoma City study or the Japanese avoidance of calculator use in elementary school, is simply ignored because the results do not agree with the philosophical underpinnings of the current [math] reform movement."<SUP>28</SUP><P>

On the whole, impact of the frameworks has been mixed.  Younger students have clearly fared worse than older students who had a chance to learn basic skills under the pre-1987 frameworks.  The 1991 NAEP found that California's students ranked in the bottom third of participating states in mathematics.  And, Sykes notes, "only one in 12 eighth graders was capable of working the problem" asking them to explain how to add two fractions.<SUP>29</SUP><P>

In 1992, NAEP reported similarly bad news in reading: their report found California's eighth graders tied for last with their classmates in Louisiana--a result that was repeated two years later, which made big news in the spring of 1995.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CLAS Dismissed</B></FONT><P>

California's own assessments were a mixed bag.  In 1990, the education department reported that CAP scores in reading and writing dropped for the third consecutive year for third graders, who were the first group exposed to the new language-arts frameworks.  Sixth grade scores also fell.  Math scores for those grades did improve, however, and eighth grade scores improved slightly across the board.<SUP>30</SUP>  Yet from 1986 to 1991, the average eighth grade reading score increased 14 points to 257; math scores increased 18 points to 271; history/social science scores increased 17 points to 260; and science scores increased 19 points to 269.<P>

Overall, the CAP scores were a mess.  They were difficult to gauge due to wide disparities among the grades, and on the decline among younger students.  The modest gains of 1986-87 were overshadowed by the beginning of the new decade, as more reports were released showing students' performance was slipping.  So in 1991, education leaders decided that the old test was not authentic.<P>

"Authentic" (or "performance-based") assessment is the kissing cousin of outcome-based education and a typical phrase educators use in conjunction with standards.  According to conventional wisdom, multiple choice tests do not give an accurate portrait of what a student can and cannot do in a particular subject.  Authentic assessment purports to do away with the pitfalls of the old multiple choice tests by making students demonstrate what they know.  The technique "directly measures actual performance in a subject area," according to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing.  "Standardized multiple choice tests, on the other hand, measure test-taking skills directly and everything else either indirectly or not at all."  There is some truth to this, although many education experts still maintain that multiple choice tests can be "authentic" if the questions are detailed enough, and require students to perform several complex tasks.<SUP>31</SUP>  Like OBE, "performance-based" assessment was decorated in conservative garb and sold as a way to hold schools and teachers accountable.<P>

Specific authentic assessment techniques include: "written products, solutions to problems, experiments, exhibitions, performances, portfolios of work and teacher observations, checklists and inventories, and cooperative group projects.  These assessments may evaluate regular classroom activity or take the form of tests or special projects."<SUP>32</SUP><P>

A new, performance-based test--the California Learning Assessment System, or CLAS--was developed in cooperation with Governor Wilson, Honig, and State Senator Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara).  According to Honig, the goal was to develop techniques to teach students to analyze, evaluate, understand and explain what they were learning.  The new test, he said, would test "what students know, not how well they can guess."  Wilson wanted numbers: "individual student scores so parents can track how their children stack up, and so teachers can be evaluated by how well their charges do."<SUP>33</SUP>  The State Legislature in 1991 passed a bill sponsored by State Senator Gary Hart authorizing the creation of the new tests.  CLAS was first administered in Fall 1992.<P>

What eventually happened with the CLAS test is fairly well known, although the finer details may have been lost in the media circus that surrounded it.  The 1994 controversy surrounding the CLAS test was, at bottom, a challenge to the legitimacy of outcome or performance-based assessment.  What had originally been an attempt by conservative reformers to turn the focus in education from the historical measurement of inputs (i.e., spending, class time, etc.), to an objective measure of accountability (e.g., can the student find the square root of 81 or diagram a sentence?) was contorted by the educationists into a mainly political and social agenda.<P>

CLAS, described as "manifestly unworthy" by no less than the State Auditor General, was an "outcomes-based" debacle of the highest order.  Students were graded 85 percent on what they expressed, and 15 percent on how they expressed it.  And it was anything but standardized.  In 1994, there were about 97 versions of the test in circulation.  Much of CLAS spurned traditional literature in favor of contemporary, politically-correct writing.<P>

The press heralded CLAS as a way of making students really show what they know.  Writing in the <I>Sacramento Bee</I> shortly before Governor Wilson signed the CLAS legislation in 1991, Peter Schrag gushed:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"[CLAS] would ask them to solve real problems, giving elementary school students, for example, some simple equipment--a battery, a couple of wires, a light bulb--and ask them to create a circuit that lights the bulb, then draw a diagram to show what they did.  It would demand more writing.  It would ask them to construct models.  It would require oral solutions to certain problems.  And it would lead to the creation of a 'portfolio' on each student that includes art and science projects and essays, as well as more conventional work on which each student would be evaluated."<SUP>34</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

CLAS found support early on from the California Business Roundtable and other business groups as an ideal way of measuring those oft-mentioned "critical thinking" and "higher-order" skills.  The Roundtable, unable to ignore the siren song of performance-based testing, did not back off its support of the "cleanup" legislation, even after being advised in mid-1994 that the CLAS test did not grade for punctuation, grammar, and spelling.  Nor did the union-backed legislators (including then-Assemblyman Delaine Eastin) on the education policy committees blink during hour after hour of testimony by parents, educators, and legislators questioning the details of the test.  They simply circled their wagons and voted to reauthorize the test, which was eventually vetoed by the Governor.<P>

Just what was wrong with the CLAS test?  It evaluated students more on their feeling than their analysis of a subject.  It permitted students to take certain sections of the test in groups.  It didn't require students to write complete sentences, much less complete paragraphs.  In some cases, students could draw pictures instead of write their answers.  In short, it furthered the state's policy of eschewing basic skills for so-called "problem solving" skills.  Some portions of the test bore little relationship to the subjects they were supposed to be testing, or were used to push particular agendas.  For example, a fourth grade science question asked: "When trash leaves your home, where do you think it goes?"<SUP>35</SUP>

The literature portion of the test provoked the most controversy.  It was there that the state, asking students questions relating to their personal beliefs about religion, politics, and family, stepped over the line.  Examples abound:<P>

<UL>
<LI>A fourth grade literature question presented a short biography of Civil Rights-era icon Rosa Parks and asked students to "discuss your thoughts," draw posters, and explain how the story related to their lives.<SUP>36</SUP>
 
<LI>A prototype fourth grade literature section included a story about discrimination against Chinese immigrant laborers in California during the 19th century.  Students were again asked to write their thoughts and feelings about the story, and to discuss their own experiences with discrimination.  Another question asked what kind of problems teenagers have with their parents.<SUP>37</SUP> That particular question was fiercely denounced by parents and some civil libertarians as invasive and psychological in nature, and therefore in violation of state laws prohibiting schools from administering psychological tests without permission.
 
<LI>Tenth graders were asked to read an excerpt from "Roselily," a short story by <I>Color Purple</I> author Alice Walker about a black unmarried mother who is about to wed a Muslim man.  Parents objected to a number of passages, including: ". . . She cannot always be a bride and a virgin, wearing robes and veil.  Even now her body itches to be free of satin and voile. . . .  She wonders what it will be like.  Not to have to go to a job.  Not to work in a sewing plant.  Her place will be in the home, he has said, repeatedly, promising her rest she has prayed for.  But now she wonders.  When she has rested, what will she do?  They will make babies--she thinks practically about her fine brown body, his strong black one.  They will be inevitable.  Her hands will be full.  Full of what?  Babies.  She is not comforted."  At one point, the groom declares that Christians believe in "the wrong God."  Parents criticized the story and the accompanying questions because they "emphasized emotion, not intellect."  Some parents and education critics said the story was anti-Christian and anti-clergy.  In response to the public outcry, the education department removed the passage from the 1994 test.<SUP>38</SUP>
 
<LI>One of the more controversial passages students were asked to analyze appeared in a story entitled, "Just Lather, That's All" on the tenth grade test.  The narrator of the story is a barber with homicidal thoughts.  "I could cut this throat just so--zip, zip.  I wouldn't give him the time to resist, and since he has his eyes closed he wouldn't see the glistening blade or my glistening eyes.  But I'm trembling like a real murderer.  Out of his neck a gush of blood would spout onto the sheet, on the chair, on my hands, on the floor."<SUP>39</SUP>
</UL>

For all the trendiness, the group work, the sketch drawing, the stream of consciousness writing, the pseudo-psychoanalysis--in short, the distinct lack of objective standards--students still performed poorly on the CLAS test in 1994.  Statewide, 70 percent of students tested below proficiency in reading; 60 percent were below proficiency in writing; and 80 percent were below proficiency in math.  Tenth graders fared among the worst:  86 percent of high school sophomores tested below proficiency in math.<P>

The two-year experiment cost California taxpayers $28 million.  Governor Wilson vetoed continued funding for CLAS in September 1994.<P>

Barely mentioned was the quiet release in June 1995 of the final set of scores for two pilot exams in history and science given to the state's fifth graders in May 1994.  The results demonstrated that students were not just poor readers and mathematicians, but substandard in science and ignorant of U.S. and California history, too.  Only 34 percent of fifth graders scored three or better (out of a possible six) on the CLAS history test, and 37 percent scored three or higher on the science test.<SUP>40</SUP><P>

<P ALIGN=right>-Maureen DiMarco,<BR>
<ALIGN=right>California Secretary of Child Development and Education, September 1991</P>

Academic standards remain, for now, in the hands of the state school superintendent, the legislature, and gubernatorial appointees.  State officials cannot shake their belief that the best answers to the problems plaguing California's schools come from the top.  But if the last decade of experimenting with state-mandated standards have proven anything, it is that top-down mandates and one-size-fits-all standards rarely work. Invariably, standards become debased by politics or infected with educationist cant. And results, in the form of standardized tests, have been mixed at best. In big city school districts like Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, they've been downright disastrous.<P>

Nineteen ninty-five may one day be seen as a watershed year for the standards movement.  It was the year that state officials began to doubt the effectiveness of the state standards project, and began talking at least about making amends.  The question remains whether the public policy that follows will be consistent with the rhetoric.<P>

State education officials have been more critical of the drift away from skills instruction, indicating a possible turn of the tide.  "It's a terrible thing to do to children," Wilson education advisor Maureen DiMarco said last year of the new "new math."  "This should be common sense.  Every time we throw out the fundamental skills we get into trouble."<SUP>41</SUP><P>

"Where we went wrong," former school superintendent Bill Honig confessed to the <I>San Francisco Chronicle</I>, "is that we weren't strong enough on the basic skills.  We thought teachers would continue teaching the skills, but they didn't."<SUP>42</SUP><P>

And in the wake of the double blow from CLAS and NAEP, Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin asked, "do we have the courage to face these results honestly and do something?"<SUP>43</SUP>  But Eastin continues to tour schools across the state touting the virtues of state-mandated standards as "something we've never tried before."<P>

Since the death of CLAS, the state Department of Education has been scrambling to find a suitable replacement.  A new standardized testing bill (AB 265) passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Wilson in October.  The new law basically creates two tests.  Students in grades two through ten will take basic skills tests that will assess their ability to read, write, and perform basic mathematical calculations.  Unlike the old CLAS test, the new skills test will grade students individually so parents can have some idea how their children are progressing.<P>

In addition, fourth, fifth, eighth, and tenth graders will take a statewide exam that includes more in-depth questions that assess basic skills as well as students' ability to apply those skills in reading, writing, math, science and history--presumably what the CLAS test was supposed to do.<P>

Legislators attempted to address many of the objections to the CLAS test in the new legislation.  On the new exam, questions that probe into a student's personal beliefs or practices in sex, family life, morality or religion are strictly prohibited.  Legislators also included an opt-out clause, so parents may choose whether or not their children take the test.<SUP>44</SUP><P>

The problem with the new law is that, like CLAS, it establishes a statewide assessment but fails to create standards prior to the development of the tests. Unless there is supplemental legislation which clearly removes the cart from in front of the horse, the adage "testing drives curriculum" will continue to dominate schools in the state.<P>

Similarly, the state will continue to reform its curriculum frameworks, but the impact will not be seen most likely for several years until new teachers are trained and new textbooks are issued that reflect the changes.  The California Reading Task Force's report called for sweeping changes, particularly a more "balanced" approach to reading instruction that gives intensive systematic phonics its due.  The task force also recommended ongoing assessment of students' reading skills, early intervention programs, more books for school libraries, limiting class sizes, new training, and new books.  That raises serious questions about how this can be done and where the state will find the money to pay for it all.<P>

But there also appears to be resistance within elements of the bureaucracy itself.  A week after the task force issued its findings, the English Language Arts and English as a Second Language Textbook Adoption Committee held its "Invitation to Submit" meeting, at which it was made clear that until the legislature says otherwise, the task force's recommendations were just that.  "The Reading Task Force has no impact on the evaluation of adoption," said committee member Glen Thomas.  "The [old] K-8 Instructional Resources Evaluation Form is what publishers need to be concerned with." Another committee member, Dennis Parker, was more blunt: "Balance does not mean 50-50."<P>

National standards will continue to overshadow California.  The prospect of  California having to comply with top-down standards set at the federal level is very real as long as the state receives Goals 2000 grants.  Although U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley insists that the program contains "zero regulations," there are a number of thinly-disguised federal mandates.  In addition to mandating "voluntary" standards, the law imposes onerous spending requirements, issues federal "skills" certificates, and ultimately shifts the educational agenda from the states to the federal government.<P>

Goals 2000 will drive national standards, not only because of its mandates regarding curriculum and assessments but also because of the revolving door that exists between various elements of government bureaucracy and vested interest groups, as well as individual education "experts."  Even the <I>de facto</I> standards in textbooks and standard assessments seem preferable to allowing the long arm of contemporary government such an "up close and personal" entry into the lives of youth.<P>

School-To-Work is among the latest Goals 2000-related federal programs to usurp state autonomy and again divert the standards question away from academics and on to more vocational skills.  Congress debated and passed the School-To-Work Opportunity Act in conjunction with Goals 2000 in 1994. The law was reauthorized in 1995. Designed ostensibly to create an internationally competitive workforce, federal School-To-Work legislation creates a National Skills Standards Board to evaluate and certify the skills of potential employees.  School-To-Work enjoys widespread support among business leaders, who spend millions each year retraining poorly educated graduates. But two objections emerge: first, students who do not receive skills certificates, for whatever reason (including non-participation in the program) will be put at a competitive disadvantage; and second, the reemphasize on work skills could represent a return to the non-academic standards which dominated the curriculum in the early 1980s, when students graduated high school with courses in shop, home economics, and food.<P>

Also, California is one of 17 states involved in the New Standards Project which has continued to forge ahead in spite of the intense criticism surrounding the development of national standards.  In drafting content and performance standards, the project reviews the national standards as they emerge from federally and privately financed panels as well as those being developed in partner states.  The State Legislature budgeted $500,000 in membership dues for California's continued participation in the project.  It is not clear how, or if, this effort will mesh with the work of the new 21-member state Standards Commission, whose members are to be appointed by the Governor and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, under AB 265. The State Senate is at work on follow-up legislation, SB 430, which will clarify who will appoint the commission, and how the commission will operate. The new legislation also includes an amendment requiring any new assessment system be based explicitly on the standards that come out of the commission. <P>

<P ALIGN=right>-Public Agenda Foundation, 1995</P>

Knowing the penchant of education officials to hijack valid concepts and reshape them into self-serving mandates and regulations, initiating reform aimed at higher academic standards is like walking the razor's edge.  Even so, it is a journey that must be attempted.<P>

Americans across the political spectrum strongly and consistently support higher standards, even when they know the possible negative consequences for students' "self-esteem."  A recent report by the liberal Public Agenda Foundation, "Assignment Incomplete: The Unfinished Business of School Reform," indicates that testing, withholding diplomas, toughening grading, and establishing clear guidelines for what students should learn were viewed as positive actions among the general public.<SUP>45</SUP><P>

To succeed, the journey must achieve greater participation by local communities and parents.  California's schools cannot afford to continue along their present course of state-mandated standards, steeped in non-academic subject matter and untried educationist theories about critical thinking and self esteem.<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>RECOMMENDATIONS</B></FONT><P>

<B>For Parents:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>Inquire whether schools and districts have a "basics first" philosophy.  Don't just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Demand academic excellence. 
 
<LI>Determine whether schools implement a systematic phonics approach to reading. Obtain the State Reading Taskforce's report, <I>Every Child A Reader</I>, available 
from State Superintendent Delaine Eastin's office. Bill Honig's criticism of whole language and his conversion to the merits of skills instruction is detailed in <I>How Should We Teach Our Children To Read? The Role of Skills in a Comprehensive Reading Program: A Balanced Approach </I>(Far West Laboratory for Education Research and Development, San Francisco).  Though Honig tries to please everyone, he offers a devastating critique of the "two myths of whole language," and demonstrates why phonics is essential to a good reading curriculum.  The Virginia-based National Right to Read Foundation is a clearinghouse of information on phonics and whole language.<SUP>46</SUP>
 
<LI>Monitor homework and/or classroom assignments, particularly essays, for an academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus.
 
<LI>Consider home use of E. D. Hirsch, Jr.'s <I>Core Knowledge Series: What Your First-Sixth Grader Needs to Know</I>, published by Core Publications, Inc.  The content builds on prior foundations of information through a grade by grade sequence of specific guidelines in history, geography, mathematics, science, language arts, and the fine arts. Also excellent are William J. Bennett's <I>The Book of Virtues</I> and <I>The Moral Compass</I>, both published by Simon and Schuster.
</UL>

<B>For Districts:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>Review current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence, and measurability. Get back to basics by writing new standards which eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. 
 
<LI>Re-examine collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions which may interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 
 
<LI>Require principals and curriculum planners to read the book, <I>World Class Schools: New Standards for Education</I>, by Donald M. Chalker and Richard M. Haynes, based on 10 international school systems.
 
<LI>Read and apply former Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch's book, <I>National Standards in American Education: A Citizen's Guide</I> (Brookings Institution, 1995). This is a good primer on the standards movement and the importance of skills.  The American Federation of Teachers recently published "Making Standards Matter: A 50 State Report on Efforts to Raise Academic Standards," which argues that high standards offer an opportunity for the public schools to turn themselves around and regain public confidence.  Also, see the recently released report, "What Secondary Students are Expected to Know: Gateway Exam Taken by Average-Achieving Students in France, Germany, and Scotland."  The U.S. Department of Education published in the 1980s an acclaimed series of pamphlets entitled <I>What Works</I>, focusing on all elements of curriculum and schooling. Though the series is long out of print, it may still be found through ERIC.
</UL>

<B>For California's State Government:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>A new statewide assessment model is a <I>fait accompli</I>. In the past, assessment drove curriculum and quality suffered. With that in mind, the Legislature should eliminate the current curriculum frameworks and mandate the development of a basic statewide model for standards prior to the development of the new assessment system, which will not be completed until at least 1998.
 
<LI>The Legislature should enact legislation adding 30 public members to the Governor's Standards Commission to ensure a cross section of community and parental participation in the development of standards.  Specified appointments from both houses should be required to guarantee extensive parental representation on the Commission.
 
<LI>The Governor and the Legislature should work to streamline the textbook adoption process and place greater authority with districts as much as is possible within the constitutional restrictions of the textbook adoption program.
 
<LI>The California State University should be supported in its attempt to eliminate remedial courses within its system.  The sending districts should be required to pay for remediation of its high school graduates.
 
<LI>The Legislature should pass legislation eliminating teacher tenure and revamping teacher education in the state's universities.  Prospective elementary school teachers need to be trained in intensive systematic phonics instruction.  Recent surveys indicate the general public supports these reforms, as well as merit pay.
</UL>

<B>For the Federal Government:</B><P>

<UL>
<LI>The quality of American education is not dependent on the existence of a federal bureaucracy. Congress should pass H.R. 1883, which eliminates the Department of Education and returns authority for education to parents, teachers, communities, and states in the form of block grants. Programs are transferred to other departments under this proposal, called the "Back to Basics Education Reform Act."  
 
<LI>Congress should avoid the proposed combining of the departments of Education and Labor. Instead, we should consolidate job training programs into one or more block grants and place them under the jurisdiction of the Labor Department.
 
<LI>Congress should repeal provisions of the Improve America's Schools Act requiring states to send plans for state standards and curriculum to the federal government.  Furthermore, it should preserve local and state authority over expenditures by repealing the "opportunity to learn" standards in Goals 2000/IASA which potentially subject states to judicial rulings.
</UL>

The experience of California shows that only with these reforms can real education standards, higher expectations for students, and accountability for teachers be realized.  To go beyond the mantra of standards, it is vital to have parents, teachers, and, yes, politicians involved in this effort.  But educating students for the 21st century requires these measures sooner rather than later.<P>

<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
Few topics in recent years have inflamed parents and grassroots
education activists as the Clinton administration's Goals 2000:
Educate America Act, passed in 1994.  Although the law's supporters
contend that Goals 2000 is merely a helpful attempt to increase
academic standards in K-12 education, the authors of this study
find that in any common sensical reading of the law, power is
transferred from state and local education authorities to the
federal bureaucracy in Washington.
<P>
The law makes mandatory a wide variety of federal dictates, controls
education's purse strings, requires national standards, issues
federal &quot;skill certificates,&quot; imposes new regulations,
and manipulates state and local assessments.  In so doing, Goals
2000 radically alters the education decisionmaking landscape by
centralizing policymaking at the federal level, leaving the states
and localities to carry out Washington's dictates.
<P>
The major findings of this study include:
<UL>
<LI>Drafters of the Goals 2000 law use the command &quot;will&quot;
over forty times in describing what the federal government expects
states and local districts to do to accomplish the Act's eight
national goals.  The more permissive &quot;should&quot; is used
only three times.
</UL>


<P>
*This paper is co-published with The Pacific Research Institute
for Public Policy, San Francisco, California.
<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 creates a wide variety of bureaucracies (e.g.,
the National Goals Panel, regional education laboratories, federal
education research institutes, etc.) which are endowed with wide
&quot;advocacy&quot; powers in order to get states and localities
to implement the national goals and objectives contained in the
Act.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Once a state accepts federal Goals 2000 money, it must implement
the national goals and objectives of Goals 2000.  According to
the Act, any state that applies for Goals 2000 funding must devise
a state improvement plan that incorporates &quot;strategies for
meeting the National Education Goals.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Through its control of the purse, the federal government will
increase its influence over school curricula.  Washington explicitly
recommends that states include &quot;gender equitable and multicultural
materials&quot; in its improvement strategies.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 tells states how to cut their education pie and
in some cases even dictates the size of the pie (the level of
spending) and mandates what social services schools are to provide
on campus.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 creates a National Skills Standards Board that
will endorse a broad spectrum of skills standards to be considered
by business and employers when hiring.  The related School-to-Work
law strongly encourages states to issue &quot;skill certificates&quot;
to students who supposedly have met the skills standards promulgated
by the National Skills Standards Board.  Schools and students
who refuse to participate in the skill-certificate program will
be at a disadvantage in the job market.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Even though compliance with Goals 2000 is &quot;voluntary&quot;
for states, the law holds disadvantaged children hostage to its
dictates.  Goals 2000 requires states that receive federal money
under the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA) to align
state assessments, curriculum, and professional teacher development
programs with the standards contained in the Goals 2000 law. 
California is slated to receive more than $1 billion in IASA money
in 1995-96; two-thirds of this money goes to &quot;compensatory
education.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 may impose radical and untried ideas on most of
the nation, but its objectives are already mirrored in California's
subject frameworks and its statewide assessment (both the defunct
CLAS test and the proposed new assessment).  In other words, California
has &quot;been there, done that.&quot;  Since student performance
in California has continued to fall under these frameworks, we
can expect no improvement if California decides to participate
in Goals 2000.
</UL>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;We seek to support and encourage; we do not dictate or
determine local or </I>
<P>
<I>state policy.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Richard Riley</I>
<P>
<I>U.S. Secretary of Education</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;In the future, because of Goals 2000 and its tight linkage
to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. . . federal regulation
may extend much more directly into what is taught, how it is taught,
the conditions in which it is taught, and how </I>
<P>
<I>it is tested.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>Diane Ravitch</I>
<P>
<I>former Assistant Secretary of Education</I>
<P>
In 1989, the nation's governors met with President Bush and issued
a list of six education goals that they wanted America to achieve
by the year 2000.  Then-governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton was
a big proponent of this goal-setting process, which combined national
leadership with state innovation and flexibility.  There were
no federal dollars involved, and no new federal bureaucracy was
created to administer it.  It was a state-centered program pledged
to broad national goals, with the key role of policy development
left to the governors of the fifty states.
<P>
But once Clinton moved from the statehouse to the White House,
he abandoned this state-centered program.  Instead of a <I>national
</I>program of statehouse leadership, it became a <I>federal government
</I>initiative-a distinction that has been lost or forgotten by
many of the governors who had joined the Bush initiative.  The
original six goals were expanded to eight by Clinton and his new
Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, and the eight goals were
tied to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, which channels billions of dollars to local school districts.
<P>
Why has Goals 2000 become controversial?  After all, what could
be wrong with wanting American students to be number one in the
world in math and science?  Or wanting every American adult to
be literate?  Or wanting to increase parental involvement?
<P>
The answer, of course, is that there is nothing wrong with desiring
these and some of the other laudable goals contained in the Goals
2000 law.  However, as with many worthwhile objectives, the means
to the ends are just as important as the ends themselves.  And
in the case of Goals 2000, the means contained in the law's more
than 150 pages of fine print should give great pause to anyone
who takes seriously the notion of state and local control of education.
<P>
This paper, a joint publication of the Pacific Research Institute
and the Claremont Institute, examines the fine print in Goals
2000 and focuses on how this law will affect California's public
education system-and by inference, the public school systems in
other states.  Although the law has been seen by many as helpful
at best and innocuous at worst, the authors of this study find
that Goals 2000 threatens to dominate and control its subject
area and concentrate decision-making power in a few unelected
officials in Washington.  For this reason, it is fair to call
it &quot;devolution in retreat,&quot; a step backward to greater
centralization of authority, not forward to more state and local
responsibility.  As such, it is a piece of warmed-over 1970s legislation,
not a progressive step into the 21st Century.
<P>
<B>MECHANISMS OF FEDERAL CONTROL</B>
<P>
Congress and the Clinton administration were well aware of the
suspicion that had grown in many quarters regarding Goals 2000's
potential for federal usurpation of educational decision-making
authority.  The Goals 2000 law, therefore, specifically cites
past laws enacted by Congress that reserves responsibility for
education to the states and local school systems.  Section 319
of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (hereafter &quot;the Act&quot;)
notes:
<P>
Public Law 96-88 specified that the establishment of the Department
of Education shall not increase the authority of the Federal Government
over education or diminish the responsibility for education which
is reserved to the States and local school systems and other instrumentalities
of the States<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
This statement is more than a little disingenuous, however, since
everyone knows that the vast array of federal programs that funnel
federal tax dollars to the states all come with strings and conditions
that increase Washington's control over what goes on at local
levels.  For example, many public schools in low-income areas
must ensure that their actions conform to Washington's requirements
if they are to receive the millions of federal dollars earmarked
for disadvantaged children.
<P>
Still, the Act maintains that:
<P>
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize an officer
or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control
a State, local educational agency, or school's curriculum, program
of instruction, or allocation of State or local resources or mandate
a State or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur
any costs not paid for under this Act.
<P>
Viewed in isolation, this provision seems to preclude the type
of federal intrusion that has become all too familiar over the
last thirty years.  Unfortunately, the Act is laden with terminology,
programs and incentives that clearly contradict this supposed
respect for the autonomy of states and local jurisdictions.
<P>
In Title I, which lays out the eight national education goals
and the thirty-five objectives listed under the goals, there is
a troubling pattern of word usage that indicates a greater willingness
by the federal government to impose its will than it would have
the public believe.<FONT SIZE=2>  Although the Clinton administration
emphasizes the voluntary nature of the goals, the Act uses the
command &quot;will&quot; at least forty-five times in describing
what the federal government expects states, localities, and individuals
to do to accomplish the various goals.</FONT>
<P>
Thus, one finds dictates such as:
<P>
All children <B>will have</B> access to high-quality and developmentally
appropriate preschool programs. . . .
<P>
Parents<B> will have</B> access to the training and support parents
need.
<P>
Children<B> will receive</B> the nutrition, physical activity,
experiences, and health care needed to arrive at school with healthy
minds and bodies. . . .
<P>
All students <B>will be</B> knowledgeable about the diverse cultural
heritage of this Nation. . . .
<P>
All teachers <B>will have</B> access to preservice teacher education
and continuing professional development activities. . . .
<P>
States and school districts <B>will create</B> integrated strategies
to attract, recruit, prepare, retrain, and support the continued
professional development of teachers, administrators, and other
educators. . . .
<P>
Schools, in implementing comprehensive parent involvement programs,
<B>will offer</B> more adult literacy, parent training and life-long
learning opportunities. . . .
<P>
Every local educational agency <B>will develop</B> a sequential,
comprehensive kindergarten through twelfth grade drug and alcohol
prevention education 
<P>
program. . .<FONT SIZE=2> .  (Emphases added.)</FONT>
<P>
What are the meanings of phrases such as &quot;will have access
to,&quot; &quot;will offer,&quot; &quot;will develop,&quot; and
&quot;will create&quot;?  Do they not mean that states and local
school districts have an obligation to create a plethora of new
programs to fulfill the imperatives of the Act?
<P>
It is obvious that the use of the command &quot;will&quot; was
deliberate.  In Title I, the permissive word &quot;should&quot;
is used as well, but only three times.  Thus, for example:
<P>
Community-based teams <B>should be</B> <B>organized</B> to provide
students and teachers with needed support.
<P>
Every school<B> should work</B> to eliminate sexual harassment.
 (Emphases added.)
<P>
Why the difference?  One expert on legal drafting observes that
the word &quot;will&quot; not only expresses a future contingency,
but also, &quot;when the relationship is a delicate one, expresses
both parties' obligations.&quot;.<FONT SIZE=2>  Under such a definition
of &quot;will,&quot; the states could find themselves forced to
implement the goals' many objectives (especially if, as will be
discussed later, the states decide to accept the federal funding
attached to the Act).</FONT>
<P>
A principal problem that arises from such usage is judicial interpretation
in future court cases.  Recent judicial history is replete with
examples of courts making critical changes in public policy through
loose interpretations of the words in laws.  The word &quot;will&quot;
is not permissive; it is a mandate to do a specific thing, and
federal courts will likely interpret it that way.
<P>
<B>New Bureaucracies</B>
<P>
Another concern is the various federal entities that are created
under the Act.  For instance, the National Education Goals Panel
is empowered to report progress that the states and the nation
are making toward achieving the goals of the Act.  Among the Goals
Panel's duties is to &quot;identify actions that should be taken
by Federal, State, and local governments to enhance progress toward
achieving the National Education Goals and to provide all students
with a fair opportunity to learn.&quot;  Although states and local
jurisdictions may decide to ignore the identified actions, as
we discuss in the following section on the federal &quot;purse,&quot;
resisting federal &quot;advice&quot; will not be as easy as it
may seem.
<P>
The Goals Panel is also charged with an advocacy mission:
<P>
The Goals panel shall help build a nationwide, bipartisan consensus
for the reforms necessary to achieve the National Education Goals<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Statements by Colorado Governor Roy Romer, an active supporter
of Goals 2000, demonstrate what type of advocacy one can expect
from the Goals Panel and its bureaucratic subgroups.  According
to Romer, Goals 2000 is in trouble because &quot;parents and voters
oppose the scheme.&quot;  In view of this skepticism on the part
of the public, Romer is encouraging the Goals Panel's subgroups
to work with business executives and state legislators who have
been resistant to Goals 2000.  In other words, if local leaders
aren't showing the proper enthusiasm, they must be educated and
propagandized until they come around.  The federal goals will
drive local reforms, not the other way around.
<P>
The Act also creates Resource and Technical Planning Groups on
School Readiness.  A primary duty of these Groups is to &quot;create
clear guidelines regarding the nature, functions, and uses of
early childhood assessments, including assessment formats that
are appropriate for use in culturally and linguistically diverse
communities, based on model elements of school readiness.&quot;<FONT SIZE=2>
 What is the force of these guidelines?  Will the federal government
determine the validity of assessments in areas such as bilingualism?
 Even though the Planning Groups are supposed to operate in an
advisory capacity, in California their guidelines could have a
disproportionate impact on the state's assessment programs.  The
assessment debate in California continues to rage after last year's
California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) debacle, leaving
an open field for federal influence. </FONT>
<P>
A major body created by the Act, the National Education Standards
and Improvement Council (NESIC), which is charged with overseeing
the creation of the voluntary national content and student performance
standards, is currently the target of defunding moves in Congress.
 Although still not officially dead, the NESIC will not be a factor
for some time, if at all (at present, no nominations have been
put forward for any Council member positions).  It should be remembered,
however, that the NESIC's possible demise does not eliminate the
national standards themselves, or the fact that states receiving
federal funds will have to meet those standards.
<P>
The Act also creates a number of federal research institutes.
 The problem with these institutes is that the mission outlined
for them in the Act contains provisions that would turn them into
advocacy organizations.  For example, the National Institute on
Student Achievement, Curriculum and Assessment (NISACA)<B> </B>is
charged with, among other things, identifying:
<P>
(viii) the impact and effectiveness of Federal, State, and local
efforts to provide gender-fair educational opportunities to elementary
and secondary students;
<P>
(ix) programs, policies, and approaches which promote gender equity
in elementary and secondary education.
<P>
Given this charter, what would the Institute have to say about
recent efforts by African-American parents to create single-sex
schools, which have been shown to improve the achievement and
discipline of children, especially male children, in that community?
 It is hard to imagine that such innovations would be able to
receive a fair hearing and analysis.
<P>
Another group of bureaucracies created by the Act, which have
so far received little attention, are the &quot;regional educational
laboratories.&quot;  Under Section 941(h) of the Act, the United
States would be divided up into regions each having a regional
educational laboratory.  States participating in Goals 2000 must
give their consent to the formation of these laboratories through
their chief state school officials and their state boards of education.
 The mission of the labs is to promote reform efforts.  The labs
are supposed to be, among other things, a resource for schools
within the region.
<P>
Although the regional labs may prove to be innocuous, they are
simply another layer of bureaucracy that have the potential to
impose their will on local schools.  The regional labs will be
governed by an unelected, appointed board made up of various state
officials and special interest representatives.  Among its main
duties, the board:
<P>
Directs the regional educational laboratory to carry out the laboratory's
duties in a manner as will make progress toward achieving the
National Education Goals and reforming schools and education systems.
<P>
Like the Goals Panel and the research institutes, the board and
the labs are given an advocacy mission.
<P>
Potentially more damaging to local control of schools is the labs'
stated duty to:
<P>
Facilitate school restructuring at the individual school level,
including technical assistance for adapting model demonstration
grant programs to each school<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
This duty is much more interventionist than simply supplying educational
research to state and local school agencies.  Furthermore, &quot;restructuring&quot;
has become a buzz word in many education circles for changing
school curricula and school governance and for promoting the controversial
principles of outcome-based education.  The fact that unelected
bureaucratic entities such as the regional educational labs have,
as a primary duty, the facilitation of this controversial concept
at the school site level is an open invitation to unwanted federally-sponsored
meddling into local decision-making. 
<P>
<B>Federal Requirements Come with the Money</B>
<P>
Perhaps the most pernicious instrument of federal control of state
and local education policy is the additional federal funding that
is made available by the Goals 2000 Act.  Under Title III of the
Act, $400 million was authorized for fiscal year 1994-95 for the
purpose of allowing the federal government to make allotments
to the states.  In order for states to receive this funding they
must, unsurprisingly, meet a number of requirements contained
in the Act.
<P>
What are those requirements?  According to Section 306 of the
Act, &quot;any State educational agency that wishes to receive
an allotment under [Title III] after its first year of participation
shall develop and implement a State improvement plan for the improvement
of elementary and secondary education in the State.<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;
 In turn, the required state improvement plan must itself meet
an important requirement:</FONT>
<P>
Each State educational agency, with broad-based classroom teacher
input, shall establish and include in its State improvement plan
strategies for meeting the National Education Goals by improving
teaching and learning and students' mastery of basic and advanced
skills. . <FONT SIZE=2>. .</FONT>
<P>
In order for the states to get the Goals 2000 money, they must
adhere to the goals, objectives and standards laid out by the
Act.  The minute any state decides to accept any part of the Goals
2000 largesse, the supposedly &quot;voluntary&quot; goals become
mandatory.
<P>
But this is not all.  The Act not only requires that states abide
by its goals, it also lists the strategies that they must follow
in order to meet the goals.  Alarmingly, these required strategies
open the door to radical policy-meddling by federal officials.
 For example, a state strategy must include:
<P>
A process for aligning State or local curricula, instructional
materials, and State assessments with the State content standards
and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
The trouble is that under Goals 2000, state content and student
performance standards are heavily influenced by the federal government.
 (This influence is explained in detail below.)  The federal government
will therefore have a heavy influence on the curricula, books
and tests of local schools.
<P>
What kinds of books and materials does the federal government
wish to promote?  Again, the Act explicitly recommends that state
strategies include:
<P>
A process for developing, selecting, or recommending instructional
materials, including gender equitable and multicultural materials,
and technology to support and assist local educational agencies
and schools to provide all students the opportunity to meet State
content standards and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Gender-equity and multiculturalist textbooks and materials have
caused extreme controversy and division among parents and state
and local school officials.  Many of these works are infused with
anti-male and anti-Western biases, and often rely more on polemics
than on objective scholarship.  Yet this is the type of instructional
material that Washington singles out for inclusion in state strategies.
<P>
Further, the Act seeks to affect the exact ways in which states
divide their education budget pie.  The Act recommends that strategies
include:
<P>
Assessing the effectiveness and equity of the school finance program
of the State to identify disparities in the resources available
to each local educational agency and school in such State and
how such disparities affect the ability of the State educational
agency and local educational agencies to develop and implement
plans under [Title III<FONT SIZE=2>].</FONT>
<P>
In view of provisions such as this, the Act's pretense of not
directing how a state or locality allocates its resources is no
more than empty rhetoric.
<P>
A good example of the gap between a good goal and bad means can
be found in the Act's standards regarding parental and community
involvement.  On the positive side, the Act requires that:
<P>
Each State improvement plan shall describe strategies for how
the State educational agency will involve parents and other community
representatives in planning, designing, and implementing the State
improvement plan. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
The strategy described by the Act as a way to achieve parental
and community involvement raises very serious questions.  The
Act envisions a strategy which will result in:
<P>
Increasing the access of all students to social services, health
care, nutrition, related services, and child care services, and
locating such services in schools, cooperating service agencies,
community-based centers, or other convenient sites designed to
provide &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for parents and students<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
To what social services must the state and local jurisdictions
provide &quot;access&quot; to?  What types of health care services?
 Perhaps those &quot;reproductive services&quot; advocated by
former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders?  And what types of child
care services?  And how appropriate is it to locate these services
on school campuses?  Is this not another example of schools taking
on new roles that divert it from its primary mission-to teach?
<P>
<B>Carrots and Sticks: Federal Approval of State Plans and Strategies</B>
<P>
Although Goals 2000 advocates in California downplay the mandatory
nature of the state improvement plans and the strategies required
to implement them, there is no getting around the fact that under
Section 307 of the Act, it is the federal Secretary of Education
who has approval power over a state's application for funding
under the Act.  More important, after the first year of funding,
the Secretary will approve further funding only if he has approved
the state improvement plan and has determined &quot;that the State
has made substantial progress in developing its State improvement
plan and will implement such plan not later than the end of the
second year of participation.&quot;
<P>
This process raises important questions, such as:
<UL>
<LI>Does the state's improvement plan and accompanying strategies
include gender equitable and multicultural textbooks?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Does it include an &quot;equitable&quot; distribution (at
least in Washington's eyes) of state education budget dollars?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Are large numbers of social services, including perhaps even
reproductive services, available to the state's children?
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Has the state included in its plan and strategies ways to
implement the thirty-five objectives listed under the eight national
goals?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The answers to such questions could determine whether the federal
Secretary decides to bestow a Goals 2000 grant on a state.  In
other words, the federal Secretary has significant discretionary
power to accept or reject a state's application based on the state's
adherence to Washington's policies.  Given that states have historically
accepted federal dictates that translate to more dollars in their
budgets, there will be powerful and irresistible pressure on states
to conform to federal education policies.
<P>
It is not just the Secretary's power to approve a state's improvement
plan that gives his agency carrot-and-stick leverage.  According
to Section 317 of the Act, the Secretary of Education can award
technology grants to states that, as part of their state improvement
plans, include:
<P>
[A] systemic statewide plan to increase the use of state-of-the-art
technologies that enhance elementary and secondary student learning
and staff development in support of the National Education Goals
and State content standards and State student performance standards<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Again, behind the promise of money is the requirement that the
federal goals be promoted.  It is also instructive to note that
the Act dictates how the states allocate the funds they receive
under its auspices.  After the first year of funding, at least
ninety percent of a state's allotment must be used either to fund
the state improvement plan at the local level or &quot;to improve
educator preservice programs and for professional development
activities that are consistent with the State improvement plan<FONT SIZE=2>.&quot;
 The remaining ten percent or less can be used for state activities
such as promoting public magnet and charter schools; supporting
contracting with private management organizations to reform schools;
and supporting violence-reduction programs in schools.  In essence,
teachers are given access to the vast majority of the Act's funds,
but supporters of cutting-edge reforms such as charter schools
and private contracting have access to only a tiny fraction of
these funds.</FONT>
<P>
Even supporters of Goals 2000 admit that there are potential control
problems if states decide to take the Act's funding.  California's
state Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO), which supports California's
participation in the Act, nevertheless warns that &quot;Taking
advantage of the federal framework is not risk-free. . . .&quot;
 The LAO realizes that the voluntary nature of the Act is more
illusion than reality:
<P>
The state would always be able to opt out of Goals 2000 if it
appeared federal policy making was interfering with state or local
authority.  (Of course, California would also have to relinquish
the federal funds provided under Goals 2000, which would not be
easy.)
<P>
The amount of money California has received under the Act has
been modest thus far.  In 1994-1995, California was allocated
$10 million.  For 1995-1996, however, California is to receive
$42 million.  After that, the amount increases even more dramatically.
 How easy will it be for the state to withdraw after local districts
become dependent on this money?  And remember, only the state
has this option; California's 1,002 districts will have no such
option.
<P>
<B>GOALS 2000 AND THE FEDERAL SCHOOL-TO-WORK LAW</B>
<P>
Usurping local decision-making power is just one troubling aspect
of the Goals 2000 Act.  Equally disturbing is the Act's intrusion
into the private labor market.  Under the Act, a<B> </B>National
Skill Standards Board is established, the purpose of which is:
<P>
. . . to serve as a catalyst in stimulating the development and
adoption of a voluntary national system of skill standards and
of assessment and certification of attainment of skill standards.
<P>
Why the need for &quot;skill standards&quot;?  According to the
Act, the standards, assessment, and certification are to be used:
<P>
(A) by the Nation, to ensure the development of a high skills,
high quality, high performance workforce, including the most skilled
front-line workforce in the world;
<P>
(B) by industries, as a vehicle for informing training providers
and prospective employees of skills necessary for employment;
<P>
(C) by employers, to assist in evaluating the skill levels of
prospective employees and to assist in the training of current
employees;
<P>
(D) by labor organizations, to enhance the employment security
of workers by providing portable credentials and skills;
<P>
(E) by workers, to
<P>
(i) obtain certifications of their skills to protect against dislocation;
<P>
(ii) pursue career advancement; and
<P>
(iii) enhance their ability to reenter the workforce;
<P>
(F) by students and entry level workers, to determine the skill
levels and competencies needed to be obtained in order to compete
effectively for high wage jobs;
<P>
(G) by training providers and educators, to determine appropriate
training services to offer<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
In other words, <I>everybody </I>should be using these skill standards.
<P>
As with the Act's national goals, skill standards may, at first,
seem like a good idea, especially in view of employer complaints
about the quality of new workers coming out of the public schools.
 Unfortunately, the envisioned skill standards, like the national
goals, are a Pandora's box of federal entanglement in local education
and the private sector job market.
<P>
The National Skills Standards Board will, after conferring with
representatives of business, labor, education, and various other
organizations, adopt skill standards for a broad spectrum of private
industries (the Act refers to &quot;broad clusters of major occupations&quot;).
 These standards must take into account, among other things, standards
used in other countries, requirements of work organizations, and,
perhaps most importantly, &quot;content and performance standards&quot;
certified by the National Education Goals Panel.  Thus, the education
standards created by the National Education Goals Panel will be
incorporated into the national skills standards that Washington
wants employers to use.  It is apparent that the Clinton administration
wants the business community to pressure local schools to use
the education standards contained in the Act so that students
will be able (supposedly) to meet the new skill standards.
<P>
Goals 2000 supporters will undoubtedly point out that, like other
provisions in the Act, the skills standards will be voluntary.
 However, like these other &quot;voluntary&quot; provisions, closer
scrutiny shows that there is less &quot;voluntaryness&quot; here
than meets the eye.
<P>
To judge fully just how &quot;voluntary&quot; the skills standards
are, it is necessary to look at the federal School-To-Work Opportunities
Act of 1994 (referred to below as STW), which is a companion law
to the Goals 2000 Act.  According to its stated purpose, STW establishes:
<P>
. . . a national framework within which all States can create
statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems that-
<P>
(A) are part of comprehensive education reform;
<P>
(B) are integrated with the systems developed under Goals 2000:
Educate America Act and the National Skill Standards Act of 1994;
and
<P>
(C) offer opportunities for all students to participate in a performance-based
education training program. . .<FONT SIZE=2> .</FONT>
<P>
In addition, STW explicitly states that another of its purposes
is:
<P>
. . . to further the National Education Goals set forth in Title
I of the Goals 2000:
<P>
 Educate America Act.
<P>
STW, therefore, exists in large part simply to further the reach
of Goals 2000.
<P>
One of the principal tools used by STW to ensure that the ideology
of Goals 2000 becomes part of both school and workplace is the
creation of a &quot;skill certificate.&quot;  According to STW,
a skills certificate is:
<P>
. . . a portable, industry-recognized credential issued by a School-to-Work
Opportunities program under an approved State plan, that certifies
that a student has mastered skills at levels that are at least
as challenging as skill standards endorsed by the National Skill
Standards Board established under the National Skill Standards
Act of 1994, except that until such skill standards are developed,
the term &quot;skill certificate&quot; means a credential issued
under a process described in the approved State plan.
<P>
Why is this skill certificate so critical?  If the government
is handing out skill certificates to select students, then these
students will, at least initially, have an advantage 
<P>
over those students who do not have a certificate when it comes
to getting a job or perhaps getting into college.  The problem
then becomes two-fold.  First, those states and local jurisdictions
that want to resist participation in Goals 2000 will feel pressure
to reverse their position because students from states and localities
participating in Goals 2000/ STW will be receiving skill certificates
which will, as a consequence, place the students from non-participating
jurisdictions at an initial competitive disadvantage.  Second,
those students without a certificate will not just be those youngsters
who have failed to study hard and perform, but will also include
many students who attend private schools and home schools that
oppose participation in Goals 2000/STW because of fear of government
control.
<P>
If states, localities and private schools decide to participate
in the offering of skill certificates, the inevitable result will
be teaching to the certificate:  curricula will be shaped to improve
the chances of students to obtain these certificates.  This is
important since, as has been noted, the skills certificates issued
under any state plan must meet the skill levels and standards
endorsed by the National Skills Standards Board.  It will be this
federal Board, therefore, that will set the broad criteria for
getting a skill certificate, not the states or localities.  This
power will give the federal government strong influence over what
is being taught in the classroom. 
<P>
Further, STW also increases federal power by requiring that a
state or local School-to-Work Opportunities program that awards
skill certificates include:
<P>
. . . a program of study designed to meet the same academic content
standards the State has established for all students, including,
where applicable, standards established under the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Thus, all those supposedly voluntary standards contained in the
Goals 2000 Act suddenly become mandatory if a state or local jurisdiction
wants to award skill certificates under STW.  Federal education
priorities, not local ones, will, therefore, become dominant.
<P>
As with the Goals 2000 Act, the federal government also increases
its education policy-making power through the disbursement of
federal dollars.  Under STW, states can apply for grants to develop
a School-to-Work Opportunities system.  Not surprisingly, there
is a big condition that must be met if states are to get their
federal money:
<P>
The Secretaries [of Education and Labor] may approve an application
submitted by a State under section 203 only if the State demonstrates
in such application that the activities proposed to be undertaken
by the State to develop a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities
system are consistent with the State improvement plan for the
State, if any, under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Furthermore, in the grant application the state's School-to-Work
Opportunities plan must:
<P>
. . . describe how the State will adopt, develop, or assist local
partnerships to adopt or develop model curricula and innovative
instructional methodologies, to be used in the secondary, and
where possible, the elementary grades, that integrate academic
and vocational learning and promote career awareness, and that
are consistent with academic and skill standards established pursuant
to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the National Skill
Standards Act of 1994.
<P>
Also, a state's grant application must:
<P>
. . . describe the process of the State for assessing the skills
and knowledge required in career majors, and the process for awarding
skill certificates that is, to the extent feasible, consistent
with the skills standards certification system endorsed under
the National Skill Standards Act of 1994<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
In other words, unless a state can demonstrate that its School-to-Work
Opportunities plan is following the national goals and standards
contained in the Goals 2000 Act, and that its skills certification
system is following the skills standards laid down by the Goals
2000 Act's National Skill Standards Board, a state will not be
able to receive its grant.  In view of these requirements, STW's
Section 604, which purports to prohibit STW from imposing federal
mandates, direction, and control, becomes just so much ineffectual
boilerplate.  The reality is that states will be forced to bend
to the federal will because that is what the federal funding strings
require.
<P>
Is this too harsh an assessment of what faces California and other
states?  The evidence to date, unfortunately, indicates that this
assessment is all too accurate.  In June 1994, Governor Wilson
created a School-to-Career Task Force.  A preliminary report of
that task force endorsed the skill certificate concept (the task
force proposed &quot;certificates of mastery&quot;).
<P>
In addition, this year several school-to-work bills were introduced
in the State Legislature.  One bill, AB 1835 by Assemblywoman
Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), would have created &quot;certificates
of mastery&quot; that would have been coordinated and integrated
with the Goals 2000 Act and STW.  These certificates would be
awarded based on &quot;performance-based&quot; assessments of
pupils.  It should be pointed out that performance-based assessments
are not synonymous with <I>skill-based</I> assessments.  In today's
testing and assessment environment, they often involve putting
emphasis on what a child feels rather than what the child knows
about the subject.  It was this deficiency that led to the cancellation
of the CLAS test last year.
<P>
Although none of the school-to-work legislation passed, bills
such as AB 1835 give Californians an insight into what could lie
ahead in their education future under STW.  It seems odd that
California, which is one of the leaders in the charter school
movementa movement based on empowering parents, teachers, and
principals at the school sitecould also be on the verge of taking
a bite out of the STW apple and transferring key powers to federal
bureaucrats in Washington.  Indeed, it is chilling to read that
under STW:
<P>
. . . the Secretaries [of Education and Labor] shall jointly provide
for, and shall exercise final authority over, the administration
of this Act, and shall have final authority to jointly issue whatever
procedures, guidelines, and regulations, in accordance with section
553 of Title V, United States Code, the Secretaries consider necessary
and appropriate to administer and enforce the provisions of this
Act<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Is this not an opening for greatly expanded federal regulation
of education?  A common sensical reading of Goals 2000 and STW
would make it hard not to feel uncomfortable when answering this
question. 
<P>
<B>HOLDING CHILDREN HOSTAGE:</B>
<P>
<B>THE IMPROVING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ACT (IASA)</B>
<P>
In addition to School-to-Work schemes, another federal program
is guided by Goals 2000 and involves vastly greater sums of federal
dollars-the<B> </B>Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (IASA).
 The IASA reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act (ESEA), and allocated approximately $12 billion to thirty-two
separate federal funding programs.  In 1994-1995, California received
$900 million in ESEA money, and will receive more than $1 billion
in 1995-1996.  More than two-thirds of this money goes to &quot;compensatory
education,&quot; i.e., money for services to disadvantaged children.
 
<P>
In a critical analysis titled, &quot;Goals 2000 and a Reauthorized
ESEA: National Standards and Accompanying Controversies,&quot;
authors Michael W. Kirst and James W. Guthrie note that Goals
2000 will alter the Chapter One element from its long-standing
regulatory and fiscal role to a &quot;powerfully administrative
instrument for fundamentally changing America's public schools.&quot;
  Goals 2000 in effect achieves a marriage between the financial
clout of the reauthorized ESEA/IASA-nearly $1 billion in California-and
the administrative authority of a planning process aimed at comprehensive
goals for all schools.
<P>
It should come as no surprise that in order to receive its ESEA/IASA
money, California must use the Goals 2000 standards.  In summarizing
the state responsibilities under ESEA/IASA, the LAO notes:
<P>
Title 1Compensatory Education
<P>
*  Develop content and performance standards and assessments to
evaluate school performance in mathematics and reading.  States
are required to use the standards and assessments developed under
Goals 2000 if they are participating in that act.
<P>
Title 2Professional Development
<P>
*  Develop a plan to provide teachers and administrators the skills
to help students meet Goals 2000 performance standards. . . .
<P>
* Align teacher training and licensing with Goals 2000 curriculum
and performance standards.
<P>
Local education agencies, according to the LAO, must also adhere
to the Goals 2000 agenda:
<P>
Title 2Professional Development
<P>
* Apply to the state for Title 2 grants.  Local applications must
be focused on the training needed to meet Goals 2000 standards.
. . .
<P>
Title 6Innovative Education Strategies
<P>
* Develop a plan for the use of funds that helps the district
meet the Goals 2000 standards. . . <FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
Further, under ESEA/ IASA Title V, which is designed to promote
equity of magnet school assistance, priority funding is given
to magnet schools that propose to implement approaches that are
consistent with Title III of the Goals 2000 Act (recall that this
was the part of the Act dealing with state and local improvement
plans).
<P>
In testimony before Congress, former Secretaries of Education
William Bennett and Lamar Alexander observed that the legislation
reauthorizing ESEA &quot;mandates the kinds of federally-approved
'standards' that Goals 2000 said would be voluntary.&quot;  However,
said the two former Secretaries, &quot;Only with those approved
'content' and 'student performance' standards in place can a state
or community get its federal aid.&quot;  Finally, Bennett and
Alexander warn:
<P>
[The IASA/ESEA] bill takes a giant step toward reviving the legitimacy-and
federal supervision-of criteria that judge schools by their spending
levels, pupil-teacher ratios, and suchlike, instead of their effectiveness.
 And since Goals 2000 authorized the Education Department to develop
national &quot;opportunity to learn&quot; standards, we can expect
that these will soon exist-and be used.
<P>
Bennett's and Alexander's fears are more than justified.  The
Legislative Analyst Office, for example, recommends that:
<P>
Local ESEA plans should be required to address the standards set
out in the state's Goals 2000 plan<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT>
<P>
If the state follows such recommendations, federal control of
state and local education will have been accomplished by the states
and localities themselves.  As Diane Ravitch, former Assistant
Secretary of Education in the Bush administration and a highly
respected education writer, observed:
<P>
What bears watching in Goals 2000 is the precedent it establishes
for federal legislation that influences the kinds of textbooks,
teaching materials, teacher training methods, and research findings
that must be used in every school to receive federal funds.  For
many years, the federal government exercised great restraint by
respecting state and local control of education.  In the future,
because of Goals 2000 and its tight linkage to the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act . . . federal regulation may extend
much more directly into what is taught, how it is taught, the
conditions in which it is taught, and how it is tested.
<P>
<B>GOALS 2000 AND CALIFORNIA'S DECLINING STANDARDS</B>
<P>
Given that Goals 2000 and its related laws will increase federal
control over education decision-making, it is fair to ask what
effect the Act will have on education standards in California.
 Most Americans would agree that any standard adopted by policymakers
should 
<P>
be clearly measurable and based on academics.  Ravitch says that
&quot;A standard is both a goal (what should be done) and a measure
of progress toward that goal (how well it was done).&quot;
<P>
The Act gives us a clue to the type of standards it will endorse
when it says that one of its purposes is &quot;to improve learning
and teaching by providing a national framework for education reform.&quot;
 Those involved in recent debates on tests and standards will
recognize the term &quot;frameworks.&quot;  It is the buzz word
for California's troubled experiment with outcome-based education.
 As one California report noted:
<P>
Outcome-based education, or whatever it is called by the various
school districts, is not yet specifically defined at the state
level, though the frameworks suggest learning outcomes.  Each
district will be required to conform to standards of achievement
based on an implied understanding of what reform documents actually
mean.
<P>
Goals 2000, therefore, will have a great impact on how the state
and local districts understand what standards they should adhere
to.
<P>
The existing California Subject Matter Frameworks are designed
to be a guide for what is taught in California schools.  However,
methods promoted in the Mathematics and English/Language Arts
Frameworks have resulted in the de-emphasis of basic math skills
and phonics.  As a result of growing pressure from the public,
valid criticisms are surfacing. The following is a brief discussion
of the current state of &quot;frameworks,&quot; standards, and
basic skills in California.
<P>
<B>California Math Standards</B>
<P>
Under California's current &quot;Math Frameworks,&quot; the emphasis
is on problem solving rather than on basic skills or rote memorization
(e.g., multiplication tables).  Critics charge, however, that
without a good working knowledge of basic skills, it is hard to
expect students to come up with academically rigorous responses
to word problems.  In a recent critique of the California Math
Framework, Dr. Wayne Bishop, who teaches mathematics at California
State University at Los Angeles, finds that there is little commitment
to teaching deepening levels of mathematical competence and sophistication
as students progress through the curriculum:
<P>
There are to be no assumptions of, let alone mandates of, minimal
computational 
<P>
and conceptual competence at progressively higher grade levels.
 Since there is no 
<P>
data to support the contention that this current practice is aiding
students at either end of the performance spectrum, and massive
evidence is that it is hindering progress of students overall,
this philosophy must be critically challenged instead of embraced.
<P>
Indeed, with the development of the California Learning Assessment
System assessment test (which downplays the importance of correct
computational answers in favor of answers based on feelings and
sincerity), the state, according to Dr. Bishop, has taken steps
to eliminate heretofore well-understood statewide assessment.
<P>
<B>Reading Skills in California</B>
<P>
At a time when even teachers union publications are admitting
that phonics is the superior English reading instructional technique,
many schools in California are still de-emphasizing phonics. 
 Through its English/Language Arts Frameworks, California has
been a leader in adopting the &quot;whole language&quot; approach
to reading which calls for teachers to spend more time reading
stories to children than on specific skills such as spelling,
the sounds of letters or syllables.
<P>
Other states have caught on where California has not.  In Ohio,
a law was passed which requires the teaching of systematic, intensive
phonics in the primary grades.  Teachers are now receiving phonics
in-service programs.  The National Right To Read Foundation indicates
that there are currently nine states working on phonics legislation:
Texas, Michigan, Ohio, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Missouri,
New York, and Illinois.
<P>
<B>Goals 2000 and the CLAS Fiasco: The Untold Story</B>
<P>
What is the connection between these state Math and English frameworks
and the Goals 2000 debate over measuring standards?  The answer
to that question lies with the California Learning Assessment
System (CLAS), the assessment test that was developed by the State
Department of Education.  The link is that the CLAS test was designed
to measure the effectiveness of education reforms envisioned under
Goals 2000 programs.  Indeed, since CLAS is &quot;performance-based&quot;
(i.e., it attempts to measure a child's thought processes rather
than simply totaling up right and wrong answers), <I>it is exactly
the type of test envisioned and preferred by Goals 2000 and its
supporters.  </I>
<P>
News media reports on the 1994 CLAS scores showed students unable
to read critically or apply math to real-world problems, but virtually
no mention was given to the fact that the English portion of the
CLAS exam did not test for incorrect spelling or incorrect grammar,
or that the Math portion did not emphasize basic skills.  The
unwritten story, therefore, is that even the low scores reported
on the CLAS exam were still artificially high.
<P>
How can California's parents and policymakers judge the effectiveness
of the new state frameworks if the state's measuring tool bases
its scoring on <I>non-academic</I> benchmarks?  Thus, although
Superintendent Eastin has assigned task forces to examine the
state Frameworks, it is disturbing to note the all-out support
Ms. Eastin has given for a performance-based successor to the
now defunct CLAS test.  The ultimate problem of testing based
on non-academic benchmarks is that even if scores rise, the public
has no assurance that this is the result of improved student learning
of academic subject matter.
<P>
<B>A Case Study: How One California School District Uses Goals
2000 Funding</B>
<P>
How will districts use Goals 2000 money?  The linkage between
Goals 2000 and the IASA permits the philosophy behind Goals 2000
to permeate the more than thirty programs authorized under IASA.
 Poway Unified School District in San Diego County provides a
revealing example.  The district plans to use Goals 2000 money
for elementary school counselors to assist in meeting the supposed
emotional and social needs of district children.
<P>
As part of these counseling services, Poway has issued so-called
&quot;wellness&quot; manuals.  These manuals, used without parents'
knowledge or permission, contain questions and techniques to get
children to reveal private feelings about their family.  Questions
and techniques include &quot;Do you feel that no one at home loves
you and cares about you?  Yes or No?&quot; and &quot;As bonding
and trust evolve, the [counseling] group becomes a safe place
where youngsters talk openly about their lives, sometimes sharing
secrets they've never talked about before.&quot;
<P>
Poway will also use Goals 2000 money to promote an array of &quot;core
values&quot;: all students learning; parents as partners; competent
and caring staff; staff participation in decision-making; safe,
orderly, and attractive environment; and effective management
of resources.  All these goals may sound worthwhile, but notice
that the focus is not on academics.  The interaction of the Goals
2000 triad (Goals 2000, IASA, and STW) will mean a significant
expansion in these &quot;soft&quot; areas of school management
and school environment, with no assurance as to improved student
performance or a higher quality of classroom instruction.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</B>
<P>
California should just say &quot;no&quot; to Goals 2000 and School-to-Work
dollars. 
<UL>
<LI>Although the funding amounts are not huge at present, there
is a clear expansion of federal control underway.  At a time when
there is a national consensus that decisionmaking power should
be returned to the state and local level, Goals 2000 is a throwback
to the discredited &quot;Washington-knows-best&quot; solutions
of the Great Society. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>California does not need to look to Washington for ways to
improve education.  Charter schools, privatization, radical decentralization
of school finance, streamlining of categorical programs, alternative
teacher certification, tenure reform, and other innovations can
radically turn around education in our state without any need
for approval from a federal bureaucrat.  Goals 2000 is a muddy
detour on the road to reform, a detour California can't afford
to take.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Goals 2000 will discourage and hinder the development of rigorous
standards for California's public schools.  At a time when parents
and others at the grassroots are demanding that students be made
to demonstrate what objective knowledge they possess, Goals 2000
will do nothing to satisfy these demands-and in fact, will impede
real reform.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Rigorous academic standards will only be established  by involving
the public in a broad-based deliberation on the subject, thereby
building a genuine and informed consensus.  Goals 2000 obfuscates
and delays that public debate by purveying the myth that new federal
goals, standards, and strategies are meeting these needs.  That
is demonstrably not the case.  Goals 2000 is, in reality, a gigantic
hoax played on the public by the education bureaucrats and the
teachers unions, both in Washington and Sacramento.  Given what
is at stake, the rescue of our failing schools, politicians who
contribute to this hoax should face ridicule for the misuse of
taxpayers funds.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Rejecting Goals 2000 funding is only a starting point.  Local
control must be given more than lip service, and education standards
must mean more than testing for &quot;self-esteem.&quot;  Financial
incentives and disguised mandates from the federal level to use
any particular type of learning strategy or curriculum program
should be rejected.
</UL>

<P>
For too long local schools have opted to rely on supposed &quot;experts&quot;
in state and federal bureaucracies to dictate standards and curricula.
 Goals 2000 merely encourages this dependency, which carries over
to other areas, such as textbook adoptions.  This process relies
heavily on State Department of Education staff, who are generally
more committed to the latest curriculum fads than to rigorous
academic standards. 
<P>
What is lost in this fevered quest for federal dollars is local
control in any meaningful sense.  Local school boards do not understand
and therefore cannot influence this process; they become mere
observers and cheerleaders for the local superintendent and his
team.  Federal dollars and state bureaucrats drive both curriculum
choices and budget decisions in this system.  The current system
is bad enough without adding another federally approved state
plan to the mix.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Appendix: The National Education Goals of Goals
2000</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
It is widely recognized that California's academic standards are
deficient and that the basic skills of the state's students are
at a woeful level.  The paramount question for Goals 2000 is,
therefore, will Goals 2000 improve learning or will the attempt
to achieve the national goals, not all of which are academic,
further dilute academics in the average school day?  An examination
of the National Educational Goals gives thoughtful citizens cause
for concern.  Presented below are the eight goals and a brief
commentary on each.
<P>
<B>1. SCHOOL READINESS</B>
<P>
&quot;<I>By the year 2000, all children in America will start
school ready to learn.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> This goal opens the door for government intrusion
into family life under the guise of assuring that all children
are ready to learn.  In an attempt to cure the ills of a few children
who may not be well cared for, all families, good and bad, are
subject to the government playing nanny.  The entire social service
agenda of the Clinton administration can be imposed on schools
through this goal.  A National Education Goals Panel Report states:
&quot;Readiness to learn necessarily begins long before school,
even before birth itself, and we conclude that 'school readiness'
relates to the child's health, to the home environment, and to
preschool education.&quot;  The federal government will be in
a position to determine what is and what is not an appropriate
home environment through the implementation of Goal #1.
<P>
<B>2. SCHOOL COMPLETION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, the high school graduation rate will
increase to at least ninety percent.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B>  Creates an incentive for schools to lower the
requirements for graduation in order to boost the percentage rates
of students who are graduating.  Does not contain an incentive
to hold students to rigorous academic standards, but rather gives
incentive to teach down to the lowest common denominator.  Students
are not allowed to choose from a wide array of curriculum and
program options;  therefore, this goal could homogenize all students
and discourage healthy diversity.
<P>
<B>3. STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND CITIZENSHIP</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, all students will leave grades 4, 8,
and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging subject
matter including English, mathematics, science, foreign languages,
civics and government, economics, arts, history and geography,
and every school in America will ensure that all students learn
to use their minds well so they may be prepared for responsible
citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our
nation's modern economy.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B>  In response to this goal of &quot;responsible
citizenship,&quot; many schools are beginning to mandate community
service as a graduation requirement.  This is problematic because
of the vagueness of what qualifies as community service.  Is it
really a good use of students' valuable school time to coerce
them into community service programs when many are graduating
from high schools without basic reading, writing, and computational
skills?  Is it hypocritical to teach volunteerism by mandating
it?
<P>
<B>4.  TEACHER EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, the nation's teaching force will have
access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional
skills and the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills
needed to instruct and prepare all American students for the next
century.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> This is one of the goals added to the original
six by the Clinton administration.  Throughout the Goals 2000
Act, teacher education and training is a recurrent theme.  This
is not surprising since the National Education Association and
other teacher unions view increased funding for teacher training
as one of their top objectives and President Clinton has received
key support from the teachers unions.  Unfortunately, the underlying
premise of this goal is wrong.  The unions feel that the only
thing that is needed to turn bad teachers into good ones is a
little more training.  Yet the real reason for poor teacher performance
is union-imposed collective bargaining agreements that protect
incompetent teachers.  Teacher advancement and pay scales are
based on seniority rather than merit. 
<P>
This goal does not address the serious problem of barriers to
non-traditional teachers, whereby many highly skilled individuals
such as engineers, chemists and others with professional degrees
are not allowed to teach in a public school classroom simply because
they lack an irrelevant teaching certificate.  As written, this
goal serves only the interests of the teacher unions, and it obstructs
efforts to open the teaching profession to retirees and others
who have much to offer our children.
<P>
<B>5.  MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, United States students will be first
in the world in mathematics and science achievement.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> In view of the current Mathematics Framework
and the increasing numbers of students enrolled in remedial math
at the university level, it is difficult to see how this goal
will be reached without an increased focus on academics in California.
 Further, Californians should take little comfort in this year's
publicized bump upward in SAT scores.  A key reason why SAT math
scores rose is because students were allowed, for the first time,
to take calculators into the exam.
<P>
<B>6.  ADULT LITERACY AND LIFELONG LEARNING</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete
in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> Given that an estimated twenty-seven million
adults are &quot;functionally illiterate,&quot; is the Clinton
administration advocating an entirely new public schooling system
for those adults who did not learn to read in 12 years of public
education?  If so, how much would this cost?  Is it logical to
entrust this task to the public school system, which often graduates
eighteen year-olds without even eighth-grade reading skills? 

<P>
<B>7.  SAFE, DISCIPLINED, AND ALCOHOL AND DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every school in the United States will
be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of firearms
and alcohol and will offer a disciplined environment conducive
to learning.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> It is difficult to see the Clinton administration
making much headway on this goal.  Lackadaisical enforcement efforts,
poor leadership, and outright endorsement of drug use (e.g., the
pronouncements of former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders) have
characterized the Clinton administration's poor record on curbing
illegal drug use.  It is no wonder that drug use in California
(as in many other states) has risen in the years following the
Reagan administration's concerted anti-drug campaigns.  According
to one recent report, &quot;Since 1989, drug use among seventh,
ninth, and eleventh graders in California has revealed a disturbing
trend of increased use.&quot; 
<P>
Controlling juvenile violence will be just as difficult.  Although
a recent study showed that juvenile crime rises by seventeen percent
for every ten percent increase in the number of children living
in single-parent homes, the Clinton administration has done little
to address the problem of rising illegitimate births or to break
the connection between illegitimacy and high welfare payments
(both of which contribute to juvenile crime).  The reality is
that violent juvenile crime will increase dramatically because
of demographic trends.  From 1983 to 1992, juvenile arrests for
violent crime (homicide, forcible rape, robbery, assault and kidnapping)
increased from 12,321 to 21,549, a 74.8 percent increase.  Between
1995 and the year 2004, California's 11 to 17-year-old population
will increase thirty-three percent, growing from approximately
three million to nearly four million.  Even if the arrest rate
stays the same, the state Legislative Analyst's Office says that
the number of juvenile arrests for violent crimes will rise by
62 percent over 1993's total.
<P>
<B>8.  PARENTAL PARTICIPATION</B>
<P>
<I>&quot;By the year 2000, every school will promote partnerships
that will increase parental involvement and participation in promoting
the social, emotional and academic growth of children.&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Analysis:</B> Parent participation often translates into parenting
skills classes and mandatory compliance with government programs.
 All schools that receive funds under this Act are required to
have a plan to achieve Goal #8:
<P>
Section 2 (8).  The purpose of this Act is to provide a framework
for meeting the National Education Goals established by Title
I of this Act by . . . assisting every elementary and secondary
school that receives funds under this Act to actively involve
parents and families in supporting the academic work of their
children at home and in providing parents with skills to advocate
for their children at school.
<P>
Under Title IV of the Act, states and non-profit agencies can
apply for federal grants to fund parent information centers. 
Groups applying for grants must include as part of their grant
application an assurance that part of the funds they receive will
be directed to &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; (PAT) programs
and are required to use the Missouri program as a model.
<P>
The &quot;certified parent educators&quot; are trained to identify
certain &quot;risk factors&quot; that exist in the child's home.
 Risk factors documented under PAT programs include &quot;inability
of parent to relate to or connect with child, overindulgence,
undue spoiling on part of parent, low functioning parent (due
to limited ability or illness), low weight gain, poor appetite,
frequent illness, other.&quot; (Missouri Department of Elementary
and Secondary Education, PAT National Center)  Thus, the laudable
goal of involving parents becomes in practice a device for government
agencies to intrude into the personal lives of individuals.  Parents
have the greatest interest in the quality of education that their
children receive.
<P>
The practical effect of Goals 2000 will be to undercut parental
rights and derail parental empowerment.  When  schools become
counseling centers for parents, parents become just one more client
group of an expanding social service bureaucracy.

<h1>The Endangered Species Act Reconsidered</h1>

<h3>How Congress Can Restore Balance and Common Sense 
    to the Protection of Endangered Species</h3>

</CENTER>

<hr>

<h4>Introduction</h4>


Republicans in the new Congress have assumed responsibility for
directing the nation's legislative agenda for the first time in
nearly half a century.  Among the most important issues they must
consider in 1995 is the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due for
reauthorization this year.
<P>
Reauthorization of the ESA is certain to engender fierce debate
in Congress.  The ESA needs to be changed in fundamental ways,
not only in its actual workings and administration by a zealous
bureaucracy, but also in its design and purpose.  The public needs
to understand what is at stake in this debate, and both Congress
and state lawmakers need to be alert to the land mines awaiting
the implementation of attempted reforms.
<P>
The emerging debate on the ESA may well be more intense than those
over the Balanced Budget Amendment or welfare reform.  This is
because it will force Congress and the nation to choose between
individual liberty and big government.  For the first time since
the beginnings of the environmental movement in the 1970s, a major
environmental policy will be evaluated on the basis of the actual
results of its enforcement, and not the self-congratulatory rhetoric
of the bureaucrats who administer it.  For the first time since
its passage in 1973, the ESA will be debated as a matter of <I>public
policy</I>, not a matter of state religion.  In their deliberations,
the people's representatives will have to weigh the possibility-indeed,
the considerable evidence-that the ESA has done more harm than
good to the environment.  For all these reasons, the ESA debate
will stand as a watershed event in the history of environmental
legislation.
<P>
<B>The Political Species Act</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act has been described as one of the most
far-reaching laws ever passed, yet most Americans are only vaguely
aware of its profoundly radical character.  Unlike most laws,
which attempt to balance competing interests in an effort to achieve
equitable results, the ESA is virtually absolute in its favoritism
toward what its authors perceived to be &quot;environmental&quot;
interests.  Under the ESA, an &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;threatened&quot;
species is <I>always </I>favored over the competing interests
of men.
<P>
Like all special interest legislation, the ESA is unevenly applied.
 Few exceptions to the ESA are allowed, but with enough political
clout the law can be circumvented.  For example, when a little
fish called the snail darter held up the Tennessee Valley Authority's
giant Tellico dam project in Tennessee, Senator Howard Baker led
the charge in Congress to create special legislation to exempt
the project from the Act.  Other <I>ad hoc</I> exemptions followed,
including limited exceptions for agricultural pests and the so-called
&quot;God Squad&quot; cabinet level exemption, whereby a committee
of cabinet heads may override the law and thereby pass judgment
on the fate of a threatened or endangered species.
<P>
Sometimes this special interest favoritism goes too far and the
courts intervene.  In the case of the controversy of the Northern
Spotted Owl, for example, a federal court ruled that Congressional
antics to overrule a lower court's findings were unconstitutional.
 But in general, political exceptions to the ESA have little or
no relevance to ecology, and frequently go unchallenged.  This
arbitrariness is but one reason that the ESA is inimical to the
principle of the rule of law.  To be fair and just, a law must
be certain, and the ESA's application in particular cases is as
far from certain as the bald eagle is from extinction.
<P>
<B>&quot;Shoot, Shovel, and Shut Up&quot;:  Advanced Weed Abatement
and Other Perverse Incentives Of The Endangered Species Act</B>
<P>
That the ESA contains perverse incentives toward the destruction
of species is a fact that even environmental groups cannot deny.
 Because the ESA imposes the full burden of its costs on property
owners, property owners have a strong incentive to ensure that
there are no endangered species or habitat on their land.  Ever
since Richard P. Christy shot and killed a protected grizzly bear
that was marauding his livestock, landowners have sought to minimize
or eliminate any endangered species or endangered species habitat
from their property.  Examples are legion, from destruction of
habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker in the South to the careful
weed abatement practiced nearly everywhere else.  Such measures
are known in the West, and increasingly across the country, as
the code of &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up.&quot;  The court
that heard Christy's case ruled that under the ESA, he had no
right to protect his property from destruction by the bear.  But
most Americans, despite their sentimentality and charity toward
wildlife, put themselves ahead of all other species, endangered
or otherwise.
<P>
The law is equally unkind to those who might extend their charity
to help endangered species.  The United States Fish and Wildlife
Service is empowered to determine what constitutes &quot;harassment&quot;
of an endangered or threatened species.  All too often, productive
use of a private conservator's land is deemed &quot;harassment&quot;
and thus is prohibited.  It is therefore not surprising that private
efforts to create habitat for the red cockaded woodpecker, the
northern grayling (a fish), and the bald eagle have been abandoned.
<P>
But Congress can and must learn from the remarkable private efforts-undertaken
before the enactment of the ESA-to restore the populations of
the wood duck, the bluebird, and the falcon, as well as dozens
of other endangered and threatened species.  The private sector
has proven its ability to protect truly endangered species, and
can do so again, but only if the current perverse incentives of
the ESA are removed.
<P>
<B>The Secret Process of Endangered Species Listings</B>
<P>
Central to the application of the ESA is the &quot;listing&quot;
of threatened and endangered species.  Such species are listed
through a complex political process that is completely outside
the arena of public debate and without the benefit of traditional
scientific analysis or peer review.  One U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service biologist determines whether or not a species is listed.
 Imagine our government permitting one physician to decree a serious
public health hazard!  Yet when it comes to endangered species
we are bound by the opinion of a single federal civil servant.
<P>
The failure of this system is illustrated by the listing as an
endangered species of the so-called Alabama Sturgeon.  That fish
is indistinguishable from other sturgeon that inhabit waters elsewhere,
and yet it was listed as endangered despite over-whelming scientific
evidence to the contrary.  U.S. Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL)
argued persuasively against the listing to no avail.  The story
of the Alabama Sturgeon is similar to that of the kangaroo rat,
another plentiful species listed as endangered because many distinct
populations in the West are smaller than the government thinks
they ought to be.
<P>
Saving every distinct population without regard to the real impact
on human beings is wrongheaded and impractical.  That it is wrong
is best illustrated by the unnecessary destruction of private
property caused by a wildfire fueled by uncleared brushbrush that
the government had declared kangaroo rat habitat.  Saving every
distinct population under the ESA is impractical in that huge
expenditures are made to protect creatures that are endangered
not due to human action but to the harshness of nature.  Moreover,
many species whose range lies primarily outside the geographical
United States are protected even though they are plentiful in
their chief habitats.  At the same time, funding for other, truly
endangered species goes wanting.  Despite self-congratulatory
rhetoric from federal agencies, there is no hard evidence that
a single species has been saved from extinction by application
of the ESA.
<P>
The dismal record of the ESA as a species-saving measure is well
documented.  Under the ESA several species have certainly become
extinct, and the government itself claims to have saved only one
species from extinction.  Like other command-and-control environmental
laws, the ESA fails to enhance the environment.  For the reasons
stated above, habitat is destroyed rather than enhanced, and truly
endangered species are further endangered by those who consider
them a blight on their land.  There is also a high probability
that many of the 853 species listed as endangered and the 3900
candidate species are not, in fact, endangered.  Many have been
listed for purely political purposes to serve the ends of special
interests or to enhance the reputation of the biologist who recommends
the listing.
<P>
Given public awareness of the absurd consequences of the listing
process, one might imagine that the federal bureaucracy would
at least try to improve it.  However, Senator Shelby has accurately
described the &quot;avalanche of proposed rules and the continuing
expansion of the law's scope beyond the preservation of species
in peril from immediate development.&quot;  Do Americans need
more bureaucratic experts making these decisions without regard
to their efficacy or the consequences to the citizenry?  The public,
not just pressure groups, should have a role in the listing process,
and all scientific evidence with regard to listing under the ESA
should be subjected to an academic's peer review process.
<P>
<B>The Real Costs of &quot;No Cost&quot; Federal Land-Use Controls</B>
<P>
The real impact of the ESA is that it amounts to a &quot;no cost&quot;
federal land-use law.  That is, it severely limits the use of
private lands and yet costs its advocates almost nothing to invoke.
 Many commentators have remarked that the ESA is but one of many
arrows in the quiver available to opponents of land development
and public projects.  In fact, a legal challenge to land development
can be made by any interested party seeking to invoke the ESA.
 If an invocation is successful and development is blocked, the
landowner must shoulder the cost of attorney's fees.  Since most
environmental groups have large budgets with which to pay their
lawyers and private landowners typically have little with which
to fight back with, it is nearly always a winning proposition
for a special interest group to try to invoke the ESA.  Even failed
challenges may result in an eventual victory.  Designation of
a species as &quot;threatened&quot; instead of &quot;endangered&quot;
has nearly the same effect-the private land-use or public project
may not proceed.  The ESA is actually more valuable to special
interest groups that want to block land development than that
it is to genuine environmentalists concerned with saving species.
<P>
Because the Fish and Wildlife Service is not constrained by cost
in its efforts to implement the law, application of the ESA is
said by its proponents to be &quot;free,&quot; but the actual
costs of the law are staggering.  From increased costs of raw
materials and financial hardship to landowners to the loss of
productivity of lands and tax losses to local government, the
true costs of the ESA certainly run into the billions of dollars
annually.  The notion that the ESA is &quot;free&quot; assumes
that it costs government little or nothing to enforce.  This view
fails to take into account the loss of liberty to the productive
sector of our economy.
<P>
<B>Environmentalism As a Religion</B>
<P>
One may wonder, given the poor record of the ESA, how such a law
can be supported.  To understand support for the ESA, one must
look to the law's origins.  During the 1960s there was growing
concern that human activity, particularly industrialization and
public works, was rapidly destroying many species that were vital
to the earth's ecosystems.  Lacking scientific agreement and scientific
support on the subject, many of those concerned with the issue
turned to an anti-Western philosophical argument to support a
new environmental policy.
<P>
The primary academic bulwark for this new philosophy of ecology
was the work of University of California at Los Angeles history
professor Lynn White.  White's thesis is that our Judeo-Christian
heritage, and Christianity in particular, is the root cause of
environmental pollution and destruction of the earth's ecosystems.
 White proposed a new ethic, essentially based on Eastern pantheism,
that was readily adopted by environmentalists.
<P>
Environmentalist pantheism asserts that all species are equal
and that mankind is the principal threat to the environment. 
To extreme environmentalists, mankind is a virus on the earth.
 Environmentalism grew in popularity as the American media was
announcing the &quot;death of God.&quot;  Hence it filled a spiritual
need for many Americans, especially among those most susceptible
to influence by the media and the academic elites.  When codified
into the ESA, a new religious order was created, officially sanctioned
by the government of the United States. Earth Day is its religious
holiday, dutifully celebrated by the faithful.
<P>
The ESA (1973) was enacted and the Environmental Protection Agency
(1971) established at the height of environmentalist enthusiasm.
But it is the wholesale, root-and-branch attack on our Western
heritage, not the goal of protecting endangered species, that
now alarms most Americans.  As an abstract idea, environmentalism
and reverence for the natural world had and still has broad appeal.
 But its popularity wanes in direct proportion to the visibility
and economic impact of its bureaucratic manifestations in everyday
life.  Experience with the ESA over the past twenty years has
generated a popular backlash against its excesses.  Radical environmentalism
today retains its religious character only on college campuses
and among clergy of &quot;progressive&quot; churches, where it
is one of the pillars of Political Correctness.  Outside that
insular world, most Americans are re-evaluating the impact and
legacy of that destructive era.
<P>
Despite its popularity among environmental activists, Professor
White's thesis has been widely disputed on both philosophical
and historical grounds.  Father Robert Sirico, a Paulist priest
and economist, squarely identifies the religious nature of environmentalism
and argues that it is inimical to our heritage.  Other writers
have also demonstrated the poverty of White's thesis against the
richness of the Western tradition and Judeo-Christian teaching.
 Christianity mandates individual<I> responsibility</I> as a necessary
corollary of individual <I>liberty</I>.  Whatever warm feelings
may come about from &quot;saving&quot; endangered species, adherence
to the basic tenets of &quot;species egalitarianism&quot; -that
all species are morally indistinguishable and that other species
are to be given priority over mankind's interests -is contrary
to our Western heritage and common sense. 
<P>
Most Americans have concluded that much of the environmentalist
litany is patently ridiculous.  If the premises of the ESA were
broadly accepted by the American public, we would let cows walk
in the streets, rats forage unmolested in our restaurants, and
bears roam in our school yards.  Moreover, reverence for &quot;natural
processes&quot; would mean abandonment of attempts to defeat the
HIV virus and other diseases.
<P>
<B>The Endangered Species Act and the Rule of Law</B>
<P>
Another sober realization now shaping the American political landscape
is that the Endangered Species Act works in opposition to the
economic interests of most Americans.  Unwary citizens can have
their entire estates bound up in land subjected to government
control, and thousands of jobs are lost through ESA enforcement.
 When it comes to endangered species, individuals are forced to
pit their own interests against the purported interests of the
state.
<P>
Thus it comes as no surprise that citizens &quot;shoot, shovel,
and shut up,&quot; cut down trees before they can become habitat,
ensure that weeds are plowed under rather than letting land lie
fallow, and fill all low spots to avoid vernal pools on their
land.  The fact that the law cannot be fairly applied without
extraordinary coercion is a telltale sign that it violates the
cornerstone of our ordered system of liberty-the rule of law.
<P>
Our legal system is based upon the rule of law.  It assumes that
the law exists to preserve the liberty <I>of the citizens</I>.
 To work, it must be universally applied and general enough to
receive the support of the populace.  It must also be certain
in its effects.  The ESA has popular support only when it is applied
against some giant corporation whose position in the community
may be easy to envy and criticize.  As regards certainty, it is
certain only that the ESA will yield disparate, unfair results.
 Landowners who do not destroy habitat will be affected, and then
only if the endangered species chooses their land instead of a
neighbor's.  It is also uncertain because government agencies
and large corporate interests can often buy special rules to avoid
it.  The ESA thus lacks the universality, generality and certainty
basic to the rule of law.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act needs to be amended.  Reform should
be grounded upon the principle of balance, and the objective of
the law should be to preserve not federal power but endangered
species.  The debate should begin from the premise that human
liberty is the guiding principle of American law.  Private property,
a vital prerequisite and safeguard of ordered liberty, should
not be denigrated.  Individual responsibility with regard to the
environment should be encouraged.
<P>
Congress must address specific deficiencies in the current law.
 But the first order of business should be to open up the debate
and insist on &quot;truth in advertising.&quot;  This means that
the philosophical underpinnings of the current program and the
proposed solutions should be openly discussed and called by their
right names.  The American people should not again submit to the
wholesale abandonment of their traditions and their liberties,
as when the ESA was passed in 1973.  If we wish to reauthorize
a new state religion-pantheistic environmentalism-we should be
open about doing so.  The law should not be &quot;curious,&quot;
as Chief Justice Warren Burger described the ESA in the case of
<I>TVA v.</I> <I>Hill</I>.  Its preferences must be clearly stated
and labeled.
<P>
Specific features that need to be changed in the law include the
following:
<UL>
<LI>Congress should provide that the listing and de-listing process
includes peer review of all candidates for endangered and threatened
species.  Funding of peer reviewers should be disclosed to ensure
that the review is objective, as should any special relationships
or conflicts of interest.
<LI>Public input into the listing and de-listing process should
be required, as should ample public notice so as to ensure the
opportunity for all those concerned or affected to be heard.
<LI>Congress should state explicitly that all species are not
created equal.  The revised ESA should state a preference for
mankind where balance is an issue.  And the impact on humans of
endangered species listings should be part of the listing analysis.
 Economic impacts should be part of any listing procedure as well.
 That is, a full analysis of the true economic costs of endangered
species listing should be required whenever a candidate is considered
for listing.
<LI>Congress should state that some non-human endangered species
may be determined to be more important than others.  In this way,
limited public resources may be allocated to those species deemed
the most important public resource. 
<LI>Congress should require periodic re-evaluation of species
listed and all candidates for listing.
<LI>Congress must compensate for the loss of private property
taken by endangered species regulation.  Compensation must be
required for full, partial, and temporary takings, and it should
be paid upon determination that private property must be taken
for use by an endangered species.  Also, a declaration of condemnation
and filing of condemnation proceedings must be filed not just
in any court competent to hear the action, but within the congressional
district of the affected citizen or that in which the property
is located.  Nothing in the condemnation proceedings may infringe
upon the property owner's right to just compensation as guaranteed
by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
<LI>Congress should also encourage individual efforts to enhance
endangered and threatened species.  Such private efforts have
the greatest chance of enhancing small numbers of species and
of preserving or creating critical habitat.  Permits should not
be required to use private property for endangered species enhancement,
except in cases where such efforts may constitute a public nuisance.
 Tax incentives should be established, including deductions from
estate and income taxes, for the contribution of private property
for endangered species habitat.  No income tax should be levied
upon the sale of critical habitat to conservation organizations
devoted to endangered or threatened species enhancement.  A divided
real property estate should qualify for endangered or threatened
species tax treatment.  In this way, the presence of an endangered
species would be a boon to the landowner instead of a dreaded
blight.
<LI>Commercial opportunities geared to endangered species enhancement
should be permitted.  Congress should allow private husbandry
of threatened and endangered species.  It also should allow regulated
marketing of threatened and endangered species, following the
enlightened example of Zimbabwe, whose game population has flourished
under commercial management.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Congress should address reauthorization of the Endangered Species
Act in a manner consistent with American tradition, through open
and honest debate, and with a view toward protecting both the
liberty of our citizens and truly endangered species.  Only in
this manner can the injustices and excesses of the existing law
be rectified.  In crafting the language to effect these changes,
and in monitoring their implementation, Congress must be alert
to the self-interest of the bureaucracy in perpetuating and extending
its discretionary powers. 
<P>
After Congress acts to correct ESA deficiencies, the states must
follow suit in revising state plans to reflect the new federal
policies.  State policy-makers must match federal changes with
innovative steps of their own in the balancing of competing interests,
compensation for takings of private property, and other changes
in the direction of common sense.

<B>Rethinking Welfare Reform in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
In 1966, one year after Lyndon Johnson and Congress declared war
on poverty, the poverty rate stood at 14.7 percent.  Over a quarter
century later, after approximately $5 trillion in federal, state,
and local welfare spending, the poverty rate remains virtually
the same at 14.5 percent in 1992.  In California, even as the
economy boomed in the 1980s, welfare caseloads continued to grow,
and they continue to grow rapidly in 1994.
<P>
Over the past three years the Wilson administration, in concert
with a reluctant Democratic legislature, has made several changes-from
cuts in individual grants to instituting fingerprinting programs-and
their effects on the California budget have been relatively beneficial.
 Budget tinkering, however, will not solve welfare's core crisis.
 Through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other
programs, we subsidize behavior that destroys communities.  Teenage
motherhood, divorce and separation, absent and delinquent fathers,
and even drug addiction can qualify a person for state payment.
 Fortunately, after nearly thirty years of destructive social
policy, a new consensus has emerged:  something has gone dreadfully
wrong with the welfare state.  Unfortunately, this new consensus
on the scope of the problem does not yet extend to agreement on
how to fix it.  
<P>
We can learn from the experience of past generations.  We need
not be prisoners of welfare state misconceptions and biases about
either &quot;root causes&quot; or workable solutions.  In fact,
it is only by looking beyond the &quot;welfare establishment&quot;
that we find innovative thinking and viable solutions.  The history
of that last thirty years teaches us one clear lesson: our goal
should not be to &quot;reform&quot; welfare or to turn it into
a new public works program.  Our goal must be to abolish it.
<P>
Much can be learned from examining how welfare was managed in
19th century, which was done largely, and more successfully, by
private charities.  We must relearn and reapply what was common
knowledge less than a hundred years ago, before the rise of the
welfare state, its entitlements, and its bureaucracies.
<P>
Prior to outlining new proposals for reform, we will examine trends
in California welfare in the 1980s and 1990s.  We will also explain
why Bill Clinton's program to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot;
will not help California-or do anything substantial to break the
cycle of dependency.  
<P>
<B>RECENT TRENDS</B>
<P>
<B>Expenditures</B>
<P>
Welfare in California operates on several different levels.  The
main program is AFDC, the costs of which are shared by the federal
and state governments.  AFDC falls into two categories:  AFDC-Family
Group (AFDC-FG) which goes to single-parent families, and AFDC-Unemployment
Parent (AFDC-U) which goes to two-parent households with at least
one unemployed parent.  In 1992-93 these two programs enrolled
2,458,6000 individuals per month at a cost of $5.9 billion, of
which California paid $2.8 billion and counties paid $0.4 billion.
 (California accounted for 27 percent of all money spent on AFDC
nationwide in 1993-more than double the average per capita for
the nation.)
<P>
The two AFDC categories differ in significant ways.  AFDC-FG now
accounts for 84 percent of the AFDC caseload.  Growth in the AFDC-FG
caseload was &quot;completely unrelated&quot; to fluctuations
in the unemployment rate for ten of twelve large counties in California
over a seven-year period through 1991-92.  In contrast, the Department
of Social Services found that the recession accounted from much
of the growth in the AFDC-U caseload.
<P>
Why do people go on welfare in the first place?  According to
nationwide data on AFDC, 75 percent of AFDC-FG cases begin receiving
aid because of changes in family structure, while only 15 percent
do so as direct result of a reduction in income.  Of those who
leave AFDC, 46 percent leave because of changes in family structure,
and 26 percent leave AFDC because of increased income.
<P>
This information suggests that offering employment in exchange
for AFDC-FG will not significantly reduce the caseload.  There
is another element at work-teenage pregnancy.
<P>
California has the highest teenage birthrate in the nation, with
births to mothers under age 18 comprising over 10 percent of all
births.  During the 1980s, the teenage birthrate increased by
12 percent.  These numbers have a direct effect on the AFDC-FG
program.  Approximately 54 percent of women currently receiving
aid had their first child as a teenager, and 32 percent of AFDC
families have additional children after first receiving aid, making
them eligible for a larger grant.  This suggests that if we reduce
teen pregnancy, AFDC payments will also fall.  We believe an inverse
relationship exists as well.  Reduce or eliminate AFDC and replace
it with a system absent the current perverse incentives, and teen
pregnancy will fall significantly.
<P>
Other forms of welfare in California include General Assistance,
a county-operated program which enrolls approximately 165,000
people per month, providing benefits mostly to adults with no
children.  Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Program
(SSI/SSP) is jointly funded by federal and state governments,
and provides aid to 960,500 aged, blind, and disabled people per
month.
<P>
The Department of Finance estimates that in the fiscal year 1993-94,
2.6 million people, or 8.2 percent, of all Californians received
some kind of welfare benefit.  This is up from 7.3 percent in
1991-92-an 11 percent increase in two years.
<P>
<B>Recent Reforms</B>
<P>
Some progress has been made in reducing the size of individual
welfare grants, which are currently 12.9 percent below 1990-91
levels.  The &quot;need standard&quot; (a schedule that reflects
the state's determination of the income that families need to
subsist) has increased to reflect the cost of living.  The difference
between the two is now 15.1 percent, and the legislature has lifted
some limitations on work income for recipients.  Despite these
changes in benefit levels, the AFDC caseload and budget will continue
to grow, 4.5 percent for AFDC-FG, and 4.7 percent for AFDC-U,
according to Department of Finance estimates..
<P>
The current 1994-95 budget will reduce individual grants for a
family of one parent and two children from $607 to $593 per month,
but because of increasing caseloads, the entire Health and Welfare
budget will increase by 3.3 percent.  The costs of new cases are
outstripping the reductions in individual grants.  Clearly, just
reducing the size of individual grants is not enough.
<P>
The new budget includes two additional changes.  First, beginning
in November 1995, AFDC families will no longer receive the automatic
increase in benefits from having another child.  Welfare families
will also be allowed to keep their benefits for one year after
marriage.

<P>
Even these modest improvements, however, are in jeopardy.  On
July 13, 1994 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
cutting individual welfare payments is against the law.  In 1992,
California obtained a waiver from the Bush administration to reduce
AFDC payments.  Now, two years later, Judge Alfred Goodwin of
the Ninth Circuit Court has written that the Bush administration
improperly considered the request's effect on the poor.  The ruling
also called into question this year's decision to deny additional
benefits for children born while their mothers are on AFDC.  The
Wilson administration is appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
<P>
In December 1992 welfare payments to out-of state emigrants were
reduced to home state levels, but a U.S. District Judge promptly
blocked the law.  In April 1994, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of appeals upheld the decision, agreeing that new residents must
be held equal with respect to the &quot;basic necessities of life.&quot;
 The Wilson administration is, once again, appealing the decision
to the Supreme Court.
<P>
In our 1992 report, we found that welfare fraud is more prevalent
than is officially reported.  New data collected by the Department
of Finance has backed that view.  To address this problem, Los
Angeles County has instituted a fingerprinting program for general
assistance benefits, as has San Francisco. That city-home to 14,900
general assistance recipients-has seen between 400 and 610 people
ignore two notices to be fingerprinted or be kicked out of the
system.  If just 350 of those people leave the system, the city
estimates savings of $1.2 million annually.  In the budget this
year is a provision for a pilot fingerprinting program in Los
Angeles for state AFDC benefits<I>.</I>

<B>AFDC AVERAGE MONTHLY CASES (IN THOUSANDS)</B>

<P>
<B>The GAIN Program</B>
<P>
Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) is California's version
of the federal JOBS program, a provision of the Family Support
Act of 1988.  The GAIN program is overseen by the Department of
Social Services and administered by the 58 counties.  The Department
of Social Services estimates the GAIN budget for all levels of
government for  the 1993-94 year to be $211 million.
<P>
The California Department of Social Services commissioned the
Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation in New York to evaluate
GAIN'S effects on welfare recipients.  MDRC has tracked 33,000
welfare recipients in six counties for three years.  A control
group that was precluded from the GAIN program but could seek
employment services in the community was compared with the 33,000
in employment rates, average earnings, average AFDC payments,
and percentage of each group that left the AFDC rolls.
<P>
That last category should be the ultimate test of any work-training
program, and GAIN's impact on this has been modest at best.  At
the end of three years MDRC found virtually no difference between
the control group and the GAIN group for both AFDC-FG and AFDC-U
in leaving welfare (the difference was only three percent).  In
some countries, there were marginal to significant increases in
average total earnings and employment of GAIN participants, and
welfare savings were achieved through individual grant reduction.
 Nevertheless, these gains are modest and it is premature to call
GAIN a success.  We can't say GAIN has succeeded until it moves
people off welfare for good or reduces the entire welfare budget,
and so far, that hasn't happened.
<P>
Undoubtedly, the GAIN program has produced positive results for
a number of individuals, although that number is a fraction of
the total AFDC population.  In California, 171,865 people, or
20 percent of adults receiving AFDC, will participate in GAIN
in the current budget year.  Thus, it is probably true that GAIN
has been a worthwhile reform, and should be continued.  Yet it
is too early to gauge its long-term impact or its effectiveness
in reducing welfare expenditures statewide.
<P>
It is also too early to gauge the effects of fraud prevention
measures.  If the San Francisco experience is typical, fingerprinting
programs may save the state considerably.  Likewise, some evidence
shows that moving AFDC recipients into training and education
programs like GAIN can achieve some savings in some counties.
 But legitimate welfare caseloads are still on the rise, outstripping
the modest gains realized through fraud prevention and worker
training programs.  Until we stem that tide, reducing individual
payments or stamping out fraud is akin to rearranging deck chairs
on the <I>Titanic</I>.
<P>
<B>THE SOCIAL COSTS OF WELFARE DEPENDENCY</B>
<P>
Governor Wilson justifies his welfare reform proposals &quot;because
of the severe nature of the fiscal circumstances facing California,&quot;
and in the face of Democratic majorities in the legislature, Wilson's
success in reducing welfare payments <I>at all</I> is laudable.
 But the logic of Wilson's economic argument implies that if fiscal
circumstances were more favorable, we should maintain, or even
increase, welfare grants.  In confining his arguments strictly
to the budget impact, Wilson ignores the seminal reason for welfare
reform: government welfare payments have demoralized their recipients
and have created a culture of dependency.  Yes, comprehensive
welfare reform will save Californians money, but saving money
in itself ought not be the primary goal.
<P>
Consider two recent news stories, representative of events occurring
across America nearly every day.  From <I>Newsweek</I> magazine:
<P>
The cops found the last of 19 [children] asleep under a mound
of dirty clothes; one 4-year-old gnarled by cerebral palsy, bore
welts and bruises.  . . . And though the six mothers living there
collected a total of $4,500 a month in welfare and food stamps,
there was barely any food in the house.
<P>
In Sacramento recently, four boys-two 17-year-olds, a 14-year-old,
and one just 13-were arrested for a string of robberies and callous
shootings.  &quot;Don't care about nobody,&quot; said the 13-year-old,
who was the &quot;designated shooter&quot; in the group.  The
grandmother of the 14-year-old spoke to the <I>Sacramento Bee:</I>
<P>
We are stunned and very sad.  I feel very badly about the people
who were hurt. . .  In my age it was different.  I worked all
my life.  I set an example.  I was a nurse for 30 years.  I got
an education.  None of this welfare business. . . . It's just
a mass problem, and I don't have the answers. . . . The truth
is, these kids need their mom.
<P>
It turns out that the boy's mom has a drug problem and his father
is gone. 
<P>
<B>The Illegitimacy Connection</B>
<P>
These examples are extreme, yet we see them in the headlines every
day.  At the same time youth crime has become more common and
increasingly serious, out-of-wedlock births have skyrocketed,
and both common sense and statistics demonstrate a strong correlation
with welfare.  Robert Tector of the Heritage Foundation provides
the common sense:  &quot;[A teenage single mother] will continue
to receive her 'paycheck' as long as she fulfills two conditions:
1) She must not work; and 2) she must not marry and employed male.&quot;
 In the early 1940s illegitimacy among blacks was 19 percent,
at a time when racial discrimination was high, and crime rates
were relatively low.  By 1965 that rate had risen to 28 percent.
 Since 1965, however, the rate is up to 68 percent overall, and
is much higher in many inner city neighborhoods.  Among whites,
the illegitimate birth rate stands at 22 percent, and for high
school dropouts it is 48 percent and rising rapidly.
<P>
Establishing that births to unwed mothers has increased is relatively
simple.  What links that fact with the breakdown of cities like
Washington D.C. and New York?
<P>
Social scientists Douglas Smith and Roger Jarjoura found that
high crime rates are caused by a greater number of single-parent
families.  Other factors found to contribute to high crime rates
were population density, mobility, and the percentage of adolescents
in a community.
<P>
Poverty<I> per se</I> is not the driving force behind violent
crime.  Other factors are far more decisive.  Dr. June O'Neill
of Baruch College found that young black men raised in single-parent
families were twice as likely to engage in criminal activity than
black men raised in two parent families, even accounting for variables
like family income, urban residence, neighborhood environment,
and parents' education.
<P>
Furthermore, children from one-parent families are two to three
times more likely to need psychiatric care than those in two-parent
families, and more likely to begin sexual activity at a younger
age, thereby increasing the chance the cycle will continue.
<P>
An alternative theory popular with the social welfare establishment
is that high crime rates are not the results of generous welfare
benefits and illegitimacy, but result from the absence of available
jobs in inner cities, giving residents nothing to do but join
gangs and commit crimes.  This is the philosophy behind Jesse
Jackson's answer to &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; laws.
 &quot;Four Balls, You're On&quot; includes job training, education,
and guaranteed employment.
<P>
The available evidence suggests that the more likely answer is
not the absence of jobs, but the absence of a<I> work ethic</I>,
the very foundation of seeking and keeping a job.  Mayron Magnet,
a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, illustrates the point:
<P>
That is the lesson of Korean economic success in ghetto neighborhoods.
 No opportunity?  Then why do Korean greengrocers flourish in
Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, where no such business has flourished
for years... It doesn't take arcane skills to run a vegetable
stand, only hard work, long hours, determination, rudimentary
entrepreneurialism, and family cooperation... What limits economic
opportunity for the underclass above all is the lack of such skills-skills
like being able to show up on time dependably, to be conscientious
and have manners, to treat customers well enough so they'll come
back, to stick to something unpleasant and arduous, to attend
to details.
<P>
Why do families with no fathers tend to produce juvenile criminals,
and  contribute to the overall breakdown of values in a community?
 UCLA political scientist James Q. Wilson believes the key to
community harmony is that &quot;fathers live there.&quot;  That
is, it the males who live in a given neighborhood are responsible
adults with something to protect, the community will likely be
safer than a neighborhood in which many of the males are rootless
and lawless.  Professor Wilson suggests that young males without
fathers still feel the need for them, and finding none present,
turn to street gangs for that guidance.
<P>
In addition, many of the single-mothers in the communities Wilson
is talking about are ill-equipped to be parents themselves.  A
recent study by the Columbia University Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse demonstrates the disastrous level of alcohol and
drug abuse among AFDC recipients.  From the report:
<UL>
<LI>37 percent of women on AFDC 18 to 24 years of age abuse or
are addicted to alcohol and drugs.
<LI>Mothers receiving AFDC are three times more likely to abuse
or be addicted to alcohol and drugs than mothers not receiving
AFDC (27 percent compared to 9 percent).
<LI>14 percent of pregnant women on public assistance in California
would test positive for cocaine use.
<LI>Nationally, 200,000 drug-exposed babies will be born every
year to mothers on AFDC.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
As the study shows, too many children are left not only without
fathers, but without any parent at all.
<P>
In an influential essay in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, Charles
Murray of the Manhattan Institute predicted that if this trend
is nor revised, we can count on high crime and high unemployment
in white communities, a crisis of bigger proportions because of
sheer numbers.
<P>
In every human society, from Brazil's Yanomamo Indians to Communist
China, the family has been the basis for bringing the next generation
into the society, teaching its members that particular society's
customs and laws.  Our welfare system thwarts this pattern by
subsidizing a system in which one person (usually the biological
mother) is charged with raising one or more children, and penalized
if she attempts to marry or become self-sufficient.  When viewed
through the scope of human history and experience throughout the
world, the result is unsurprising: many of our youth are growing
up uneducated, anti-social, and violent.
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: BOLD RHETORIC. BALD POLITICS</B>
<P>
In an NBC News interview, President Clinton commented on Charles
Murray's widely-read essay, published a month earlier.  &quot;He
did the country a great service.  I mean, he and I have often
disagreed, but I think his analysis is essentially right.  There's
no question that [ending welfare payments to single mothers] would
work.  The question is . . . is it morally right?&quot;
<P>
Clinton's answer to his own question is found in the &quot;Work
and Responsibility Act of 1994.&quot;  Unfortunately, his plan
doesn't live up the advance billing.  Instead of bold new ideas,
it falls into the pattern of other liberal &quot;reforms&quot;
of the recent past.  The plan simply calls for more of the same-more
job training, guaranteed (&quot;last resort&quot;) government
jobs, and incredibly, <I>more money</I>.  President Clinton would
spend an additional $9.3 billion over five years in order to &quot;save
money in the long run.&quot;  (It's a quintessential Congressional
reform plan: spend now, save later-in the &quot;out years&quot;
of the budget calendar).
<P>
Some of President Clinton's proposals are laudable.  He would
require unwed teenage mothers to live with their parents or a
responsible adult before they receive a welfare payment.  Currently,
young teenage mothers might be put up separately in their own
apartments.
<P>
The few positive effects of the Clinton plan, however, would be
offset by its sheer irrelevance in solving what the President
himself acknowledges is the core problem, namely, the cycle of
dependency.  Clinton's plan does propose to eliminate welfare
benefits after two years, but this change is a hollow reform because
the federal government would guarantee a public service job at
that point.  So much for &quot;ending welfare as we know it.&quot;
 This jobs program will almost certainly cost more than projected,
since by  administration estimates, government-subsidized jobs
will increase from 15,000 today to 394,000 by the year 2000. 
Furthermore, the major provisions of the plan will apply only
to those born after 1971.  This means that only one-third of welfare
recipients will be affected by the program.
<P>
In the final analysis, the Clinton plan will do virtually nothing
to solve the underlying problems of the American welfare system.
 For all of his eloquent speeches about the breakdown of the family
and the specter of teenage motherhood, the Clinton plan is nothing
but gradualism and &quot;business as usual&quot; for the welfare
state:  $9.3 billion in new expenditures and a guaranteed public
works job for those who can't find or keep a job in the private
sector.  This is warmed-over Democratic machine politics: put
people on the public dole and they'll vote for you forever.  A
&quot;guaranteed job&quot; is no job at all; it's merely disguised
public assistance, and no one will be fooled.  If there is no
threat of firing, whether explicit or implicit, what incentive
is there to work?
<P>
To his credit, President Clinton proposes to allow states to cut
benefits for additional children born while the mother is on AFDC.
 But it is likely that any Clinton reforms wouldn't take effect
until 1996 or 1997.  California can't wait that long.
<P>
The irony is that nothing short of radical solutions will change
the trends, yet Americans are traditionally wary of radical reforms
from which there is no escape, i.e., a Congressional mandate encompassing
the entire United States.  Americans want to see something work
<I>somewhere</I>; before it is implemented <I>everywhere</I>.
 The answer is for Congress and the President to remove all impediments
to state- and county-based reforms.  This idea, like most good
ideas, is not new; but has never been allowed a trial run.  Allowing
real freedom for states to test new welfare concepts would be
a radical departure from the history of the past thirty years.
 Its an idea whose time has come . . . again.
<P>
<B>WELFARE BEFORE THE WELFARE STATE</B>
<P>
Most people have at least heard of the two milestones of the American
welfare state:  the New Deal in the 1930's and the Great Society
programs launched in 1965.  But how many Americans know what welfare
&quot;programs&quot; were in place <I>before</I> the Great Society?
 Without AFDC, did single mothers and their children starve to
death in the streets?
<P>
Marvin Olasky of the University of Texas studied the approach
to welfare in the late 1800s and early twentieth century.  He
found that the approach to welfare was nearly the mirror opposite
of today's practices-and the results far more benign.  The ingredients
were legislative support for the family, and local community support
for those known as the deserving poor: widows, orphans, and the
disabled.  Distinctions were made between those physically unable
to work, and the able-bodied who were temporarily down on their
luck.
<P>
Olasky writes of a more striking crisis in the 1890s in New York
City:
<P>
Thousands of orphans roamed the streets.  Infant mortality rates
were 10 times present levels . . . A survey found 6,576 New York
slum families living in tenement 'inside' rooms-rooms without
windows facing out, only air-shafts, which many tenants used as
garbage chutes.
<P>
According to Olasky, a &quot;war on poverty&quot; was waged by
various local charities and religious groups using firm principles:
<P>
Emphasizing the restoration of broken ties to family and friends
. . . forging long-term contact between a volunteer and a needy
person . . . Using &quot;work tests&quot; and background checks
to distinguish among different types of applicants . . . Learning
to say 'no' in the short run so as to produce better long-term
results . . . Requiring work from every able-bodied person . .
. Helping the able needy to resist enslavement to the charity
of governmental or private masters.
<P>
Federally funded welfare has induced national amnesia.  Grants
are now seen by recipients, bureaucrats, and social welfare advocates
not as charity, but as an entitlement from a faceless bureaucracy,
for which nothing is owed in return.
<P>
Charity, in the proper sense if the word, is a voluntary expression
of compassion for someone in need.  Exactly who is in need is
determined by those willing to give, and when the transaction
is voluntary, the relationship enriches both parties.  Comments
by one Sacramento welfare mother points out the core distinction
in any charity program:  &quot;There are those who honestly need
it as a steppingstone.&quot;  She is right, but who best can distinguish
between those truly in need and those simply trying to sponge?
 The answer is-those who are closest to the problem: individuals,
private charities, and in some cases, local governments.
<P>
<B>THE FIRST STEP IS CRIME CONTROL</B>
<P>
No welfare reform plan can hope to succeed without simultaneously
addressing the other crisis of the American city-juvenile crime.
 The U.S. Department of Justice reports that in the four years
between 1988 and 1992, the number of juveniles in court for murders
increased by 55 percent.  For aggravated assault, robberies, and
forcible rapes, the increases were 80 percent, 52 percent, and
27 percent respectively.  But the real tragedy is that children
ages 12 to 17 are the most common <I>victims</I> of violent crime
in America.
<P>
When violent crimes like murder, rape, and armed robbery are commonly
committed by teenagers, some as young as 13, a light sentence
of 10 years is simply not enough.  These perpetrators must be
considered adult criminals and sentenced accordingly.  Their values
and outlook on life are so empty of human consideration that even
human life has no meaning.  And what values does one learn in
the prison system?  For most, exactly the same values they learned
growing up without proper parental guidance.  Turning these young
criminals loose at the age of twenty-five will do nothing but
endanger more innocent lives.  We must eliminate age discrimination
in sentencing.  Violent crime is violent crime no matter what
the age.
<P>
This get-tough policy regarding juvenile crime is not a matter
of imposing heavy punishment for the sake of retribution.  Its
goal is to remove the criminal element from the streets so that
the law-abiding population can pursue jobs, family life, and recreation
in safety and security.  Communities cannot be built in a war
zone.  
<P>
As we identify and incarcerate the few pathological juveniles
among the teenage population, so too can we identify those who
show early signs of criminality with relatively minor transgressions,
such as shoplifting or vandalism.  For these minor crimes, we
should not allow suspended sentences or lenient treatment after
a first offense.  On a second offense, even of minor crimes, the
time for leniency has passed.  There are any number of punishment
options, from boot camps, to forcing vandals to clean up the walls
of a city, to minimum security jail time.  The important thing
is not the specific punishment exacted, but that any punishment
is swiftly and surely applied.  This will send a message that
even minor transgressions will be taken seriously, and that actions
have consequences.  This is a message rarely conveyed today to
any criminals, least of all to juveniles.
<P>
Getting violent young hoodlums off the streets is essential to
making neighborhoods and schools safe for young people who want
to pursue positive goals, to build families and prepare for careers.
 Without such policies to bring crime under control, the &quot;positive
role models&quot; in every community will continue to be victimized
by gangs and street crime.
<P>
<B>INVESTING IN THE FUTURE</B>
<P>
The other component of radical welfare reform is fortifying family
structures through new incentives and new mechanisms for fostering
family life.  What do we know about successful child-rearing?
 Close supervision, attention to the child's needs (often in place
of the parents' selfish interests) and making that child feel
needed and loved are important ingredients.  It is abundantly
clear that most teenagers are incapable of the maturity needed
to raise a child.  This problem is greatly exacerbated if the
teenage mother is alone.  That is a recipe for social disaster,
as we have learned to our collective sorrow.
<P>
Once we accept this basic truth, there are several approaches
we can follow.  The first and most essential reform must be to
abolish the AFDC program at both the state and federal levels.
 It is time for the federal government to end its &quot;war on
poverty.&quot;  As part of a radical restructuring of welfare
policy, the social welfare function should be returned to the
states, with federal taxes reduced commensurably to allow states
the latitude to finance needed reforms at the local level.
<P>
Once the problem is reduced to a state and county level, it becomes
less overwhelming.  The people in each locality must then answer
two questions for themselves: First, what can we do about teenage
mothers and their children <I>today</I>?  And once we have agreed
that teenage motherhood is on the whole undesirable, how do we
reverse the trend?
<P>
For the present, for young mothers already on welfare, we must
move to alternative structures and incentives.  We  must encourage
them to support themselves in some way, either by getting married,
getting a job, or living with their family, or all three.  For
mothers with preschool age children and nowhere else to turn,
group homes can be established under county government or-better
yet-private charities to provide both generations much needed
parenting.
<P>
Once the children are of school age, the mothers must move out
on their own, and they will have a choice.  If they have proved
their willingness and ability to care for the child at home, they
may take him home, and enroll him in a public school.  If the
mother cannot provide for the child, or feels the child is better
off elsewhere, public or private <I>boarding</I> schools should
be created.  These new schools, financed through philanthropy,
vouchers, and local government money, can also be available to
non-welfare recipients.  The schools should have great latitude
in instilling discipline and responsibility in their students.
 No federal money, mandates, or federal court decisions should
be involved.  This is a plan that can radically change the face
of the inner city, but will only work at a grassroots, hands-on
level.
<P>
Several notable programs are meeting with success with no help
from the federal government.  In Cleveland, the private National
Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Development has
been counseling wayward teens since 1982.  The Institute employs
counselors (available 24 hours a day) assigned to young fathers
and mothers who haven't had parental guidance.  Fifty-seven year-old
Charles Ballard, himself a former teenage father and founder of
the Institute, talks about the requirements for the program: 
<P>
We only insisted on three things.  First, legitimize your child.
 Second, be in school or a GED class.  Third, find a job, no matter
how menial, to learn financial responsibility.  We also spent
a lot of time teaching how to change diapers, to feed and bathe
the child-and how to respect the mother.
<P>
In addition to boarding schools, adoption should be expanded.
 In particular, racism in adoption policies must be abolished.
 Just such a bill, authored by Senator Howard Metzenbaum, is currently
in the House/Senate conference committee.  According to Al Hunt
of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, there are currently 200,000
children available for adoption, 40 percent of which are black.
 Minority children on the average wait twice as long to be adopted,
in part due to a policy position by the National Association of
Black Social Workers, which calls interracial adoptions a &quot;blatant
form of racial and cultural genocide.&quot;  Such ideological
nonsense should not pass for social policy.
<P>
For the mothers who are unable to care for their children, once
relieved of the burden of not having to support them, they can
go to work.  If they have drug or alcohol problems, one-chance
community programs can be implemented.
<P>
In these ways, we can convince pre-teen girls that teenage pregnancy
is an impediment to success, not a path to independence.  The
boarding schools will instill this message clearly and effectively.
 Combined with abstinence (not condom) education, this is a program
that can significantly reduce the teenage pregnancy rate in coming
years.
<P>
<B>FEDERAL MANDATES: TIME FOR A REVOLUTION?</B>
<P>
There is a web of federal statutes that force state governments
to implement various welfare programs, including AFDC.  This labyrinthine
system of mandates hamstrings state legislatures if they want
innovative change.  Assume that a state legislator or the Governor
wants to create a new program to combat AFDC fraud, or amend an
existing program, or even eliminate one.  Included in such legislation
must be a provision for the Department of Social Services to apply
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver
to implement the change.  If HHS refuses, the state legislation
is invalidated.
<P>
During the last 12 years, not a single waiver has been denied
for welfare demonstration projects in California.  However, this
does not mean California has had a free hand in experimenting
with changes in AFDC or other elements of the welfare system.
 State Department of Social Services officials contemplating a
waiver request must calculate the costs, delays, and difficulties
in negotiating a formal waiver request with the federal government.
 Moreover, the request must first be approved <I>internally </I>with
the leadership of the legislature and the Governor's office. 
At this design stage, the request is &quot;pre-negotiated&quot;
with HHS regional and national headquarters staff, and informal
consultation that smokes out the arguments, the obstacles, the
threatened law suits, and the likely outcome.  Thus, all too often
this &quot;pre-negotiated&quot; stage acts as a screen against
genuine change: radical reforms are bartered away for  more &quot;realistic&quot;
ones.  In other words, the fact that waivers must be approved
by the federal government-and now by the federal courts!-determines
the parameters of permissible reform.
<P>
The waiver process itself leads to abominations such as the two
recent Federal Circuit Court decisions (described above) that
have invalidated wavers for California welfare reform.  That states
must apply for &quot;wavers&quot; to decide how they will spend
their tax money is perverse, and must be changed if we are to
make any significant improvements.  Unfortunately, this change
will require changes in federal legislation, which will not occur
without far more aggressive political leadership by governors
and state legislatures.
<P>
There is yet another, more fundamental obstacle to state experimentation
with welfare reform.  States are under many federal mandates that
are costly and burdensome.  But ending the mandates would be only
a first step in creating a policy framework for true reform. 
Bringing full welfare responsibility back to the states will also
require reducing the federal tax burden so that states may have
the fiscal resources to shape and administer alternative plans.
 Without significant federal tax reform as part of a total reformulation
of the federal partnership, shifting full welfare responsibility
to the states would be yet another unfunded mandate.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
Our proposals have covered only the AFDC program and the federal-state
nexus fro welfare policy.  We have not examined the General Assistance
programs, largely because they are locally administered.  California
counties are strapped for funds and have ample incentive for policy
innovation-if the state government and federal bureaucracy will
let them do it.
<P>
For a variety of reasons, reform on a comprehensive scale is only
possible through a massive power shift from Washington D.C. back
to the states, followed by further devolution to the counties
and local communities.  Inefficient and perverse programs like
AFDC must be eliminated and their budgets revert back to local
governments, to be replaced by more efficient systems of determining
who are the truly needy.  Innovations like these have heretofore
been stifled by the long arm of federal bureaucracy.
<P>
This policy shift will require a revolution in thinking about
welfare.  Not a revolution from above, but from below, in thousands
of communities across the nation.  Communities are different,
and we should leave administration of welfare for the needy to
them.  No county or state should be forced to apply to Washington
D.C. to change a failed system.
<P>
Congress has exhausted its moral authority in the realm of welfare
policy, and should return welfare to its rightful place in our
political system-to the people in the respective states and counties.
 Then the real revolution can begin.

<B>A Practical, Market-Based Concept to Solve Certain</B>
<P>
<B>Air Quality Problems in California</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<I>The following paper was  presented at a conference on air quality
cosponsored by The Claremont Institute and the California Environmental
Protection Agency, January 20, 1993, Los Angeles, California.
 </I>
<P>
Nearly everyone but the hard core socialist holdout on his academic
campus agrees that our ecological problems will not be adequately
addressed unless market forces are put to work to control pollution.
 Our efforts to solve these serious problems through police action
have been abysmally ineffective.  Not only have these efforts
been horrendously costly, taking jobs and hastening the de-industrialization
of our country, but they have also threatened our liberty.  Worse,
they have not solved the problem.  So, many of us are in agreement
that we need to go back to what works, the overpowering forces
of the market as the means to address our waste of the environment.
<P>
I would like to present an outline of an idea that is based upon
market principles, which at its core, stresses individual responsibility.
 Without individuals choosing between alternatives, no market
may exist.  Individual accountability is the swiftest and most
effective means to achieve our goals and is the essence of any
market.
<P>
Nobel laureate Ronald Coase demonstrated in &quot;The Problem
of  Social Cost,&quot; that both economic systems (economists)
and blame allocating systems (lawyers) cost society the same number
of dollars when applied to social ills.  If both systems cost
the same, why not continue increasing the regulatory system, exacting
fines from those who pollute.  First, the efficiencies and effectiveness
of using economics instead of blame to deal with social problems
that are generally caused by a majority of the population create
opportunity of choice.  Second, blame is difficult is allocate
among majorities and is ant-democratic.  Third, government lawyers
and their police enforcers  have not surprisingly demonstrated
gross inefficiencies in the area of controlling pollution.  In
summary, it is not possible to regulate clean air.
<P>
Sixty percent of the air pollution of this state is caused by
autos.  A small fraction of this total is caused by commuters
going to and from work.  (That is partly why the car-pool idea,
even when coerced, has not done much about air quality).  The
vast bulk of this air pollution is caused by housewives and other
individuals when they attend to their daily routines and affairs,
privately and efficiently, in their own autos.  These individuals
are very difficult to regulate-that is, it is not possible to
deny them the opportunity to move about by car.  It is this population
of users or buyers in the market that we must address.
<P>
Even though most of the individuals who cause the majority of
the air pollution would like to &quot;do something&quot; about
the problem, there are no opportunities for them to contribute
to the effort.  So, they go about wasting public resources without
regard to the true social cost of their activity other than to
perhaps experience some misguided guilt.  This situation is analogous
to the days when everyone talked about recycling as though it
was someone else's duty.  We all want clean air, but a public
commodity like air is hard to restrict, and is virtually impossible
to package for sale.  Air is the product, but it must be marketed
to the polluter / user.  How can this be done?  By putting a value
on air that is wasted.
<P>
Valuing a common resource poses a problem.  To John Locke the
waste of natural resources was immoral.  Locke's words regarding
the waste of common property are true today.  But, we live in
a relativistic society with little institutional regard for moral
sentiment.  To individuals, Locke's words probably still have
meaning, and I submit this is why they want to &quot;do something&quot;
about the problem.  To institutions, the notion that there is
some moral compunction limiting one's use of public goods is doubtful.
 Nevertheless, our government, which is to exist, &quot;by the
people, and for the people,&quot; may, even in this time of limited
moral accountability, be requested to follow the will of the people.
<P>
Who should put a value on wasted air?  Since it is a public resource,
the logical answer is that the state should initially put a value
on air that is wasted.  How is that value determined?  It should
be determined fairly, equitably and should not be influenced by
false notion that certain individuals have a right, because of
their social status, to pollute.  I suppose that the value of
wasted air could be set in some manner similar to rate setting
for other monopolistic enterprises, with public input.
<P>
How can the wasted air be quantified or sold?  The state of California
has at its disposal and use, extensive, detailed data on the amount
of pollution put into the air by virtually every one of the autos
in the state.  This data is provided by the Smog Check program.
 Each Smog Check testing device records all pertinent data from
each auto registered in the state and that data is stored in digital
memory storage in Sacramento.  Smog Checks are done annually or
bi-annually, depending upon the car's location, and upon each
transfer of the car.  Thus, there is an accurate means of measuring
the amount of air wasted by each auto in areas that do not attain
the standards set by the California Clean Air Act.  The state
should be able to bill each individual for the air that he or
she has wasted with precision during the period between Smog Checks.
 The bill for payment would logically come at the time the car
is registered or re-registered.
<P>
This program could be implemented with little cost of bother to
the state.  The state should alter its shopworn ad valorem system
of licensing fees and replace it with fees paid by the owners
of autos for the value of air wasted by each auto.  Obviously,
this would make low polluting cars very attractive to most people.
 This may not result in an immediate loss of state revenues, but
it most assuredly would have that effect over time because air
pollution from autos would decrease.  Many should cheer this result
on its own merit.  The cost to individuals would vary, according
to their use and wasting of air.  Thus, strong and symbolic incentives
would be given to the individuals to either drive lower polluting
vehicles or drive higher polluting vehicles less.  The choice
would rest with the car owner, not the state.  Like recycling,
wasting air will become not only a matter of conscience, but will
also carry a significant price to the individual choosing to pollute.
 The state would not have to regulate by coercion and thereby
restrict liberty, because the individual would choose how much
he could afford or wished to pollute.
<P>
Since the ad valorem system of taxation on vehicle license fees
is out of place in an age when autos are everyman's, and this
type of tax falls under Proposition 13, the first step to accomplish
this scheme would be for the state legislature to vote by the
supermajority of both houses to implement this program.  Failing
that, a vote of the people could implement this change.
<P>
As the author envisions this program, the cost of this new market
should be approximately equal in terms of dollars to our current
polluted/ regulated status.  In other words, there is no reason
for the state to establish a value for wasted air that is higher
or lower than the tax currently generated by the ad valorem system
of licensing fees.  This is based upon Ronald Coase's theorem
that market focus usually results in the same social cost as a
fault-allocating system.  Since there is presently no fault associated
with one's incremental wasting of air, the current total licensing
fee burden may initially set the value of wasted air.  The state
should not try to make a killing on this market just because it
will play a role in establishing it.  The price of wasted air
would thereafter be adjusted, depending upon the willingness of
the public to tolerate air pollution caused by cars.  Like cigarettes,
pollution may be literally priced out of reach. Or , we may find
a level of air pollution tolerable to the electorate.  Over time,
the improvement in air quality will offset the tremendous costs
of polluted air, enriching everyone.  But most importantly, the
individuals affected by the polluted air will now have a choice
in the matter.
<P>
One may anticipate that the ultra-egalitarians will argue that
individuals of lesser means will be shortchanged by this program.
 After all, under my program the poor must &quot;give up&quot;
something that God has provided them if they cannot afford to
pay for their wasteful use of it.  While I cannot agree with the
philosophy underlying such thinking, I can offer a solution to
this objection.  Presently some $100 millions are collected annually
from surcharges to vehicle registration fees.  These are supposed
to be spent on reducing air pollution caused by motor vehicles.
 Instead of spending all this money on air police employed by
the various air quality agencies, it should be set aside, invested
by private banks and used to provide low-cost loans and other
subsidies to qualified individuals who wish to get rid of their
belchmobiles and trade up into a new low pollution model.  Also,
there is no reason that the revenues raised by my air pricing
system cannot also be used partly for this purpose.  Putting poor
people into a new car may not make them rich, but it may help
them safely and reliably get to work.
<P>
I think that you will agree that this idea is practicable.  It
is timely. It is politically acceptable and realizable.  It would
be a good initial step  toward the establishment of individual
accountability for air pollution.  Best of all, by actually providing
individual incentives to clean up the air, it may mark the beginning
of the end to the ever expanding regulatory police state

<TITLE>THE CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLAN: BAD MEDICINE FOR CALIFORNIA?
</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 2.0z Beta">
</HEAD>

<BODY>

February 16, 1994
<P>

<CENTER>
<B>The Clinton Health Plan:</B>
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine For California's Ailing Economy</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION: A MANUFACTURED CRISIS</B>
<P>
 In 1990, state and federal governments spent $280 billion on
health care, amounting to over 42 percent of health care spending
in the United States.  This is up from just $24.9 billion in 1970.
 The nation's Medicaid bill in 1990 was $34.2 billion, up 150
percent since 1980.  MediCal cost California $9.9 billion in 1990,
up from $3.9 billion in 1983. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted,
government experts predicted that its 1990 budget would be $9
billion to $12 billion in 1990.  In reality it was $107 billion-almost
1000 percent higher than predicted. 
<P>
 Despite these statistics demonstrating government's inability
to control, much less predict, its own health care costs, the
Clinton administration proposes a radical <I>increase</I> in government
control.  To sell the idea, it must convince Americans that their
health care system is in a crisis.  Thus, for instance, we are
told that there are 37 million uninsured Americans. This is extremely
misleading.
<P>
 For one thing, the 37-million figure comes from a snapshot of
society which fails to account for people in-between jobs or recently
married.  In fact, &quot;half of all uninsured spells end within
four months, and only 12 to 13 percent of  the uninsured have
spells that last more than 24 months.&quot;  The Congressional
Budget Office itself has found that 51 percent of the 37 million
are uninsured for less than four months, and 72 percent less than
one year.  Realistically, then, we have 10.4 million Americans
who are without health insurance for twelve months or longer-nowhere
near the 37 million touted by the Clinton Administration.  
<P>
 For another thing, lack of health insurance does not mean lack
of health care.  By law, hospitals may not deny emergency health
care to anyone who walks through the door. Indeed in 1991, the
American Hospital Association estimated that hospitals provide
$10 billion annually in uncompensated care.  Fred Barnes memorably
illustrates the absurdity of the Clinton administration's claims
by revealing the free care now available to a poor uninsured AIDS
patient at a Washington D.C. health clinic: the patient would
be treated immediately, and if circumstances required it, he or
she would be given AZT, which costs $5000 a year.  The doctor
care, the AZT, any other required drugs, and laboratory work would
be financed, mostly by the federal government.
<P>
 In spite of the facts of the matter, the Clinton public relations
campaign has been effective.  The Center for Health Care Policy
and Evaluation examined 29 public opinion surveys over a two year
period and found that nine out of ten Americans indeed believe
there is a health care crisis.  When asked to relate health care
problems to their own personal situation, however, 70 percent
of Americans were &quot;very satisfied&quot; or &quot;somewhat
satisfied&quot; with the quality and availability of coverage.
 Satisfaction levels increased with income, but even 61 percent
of those making less than $20,000 a year were satisfied.  A Gallup
poll in May 1993 showed that 81 percent are &quot;satisfied with
the quality of health care for themselves and their families.&quot;

<P>
 What explains the mixed signals given by public opinion polls?
 While there is no crisis in access to health care, some health
care costs are soaring.  The goal of health care reform should
be to lower these costs, including and especially the costs for
the uninsured who receive medical care from emergency rooms. 
We will suggest below how such cost containment might be accomplished
without the radical bureaucratization of the Clinton-plan, which
judging from the history of government intervention in health
care and other areas, would lead to soaring rather than lower
costs.
<P>
<B>HEALTH CARE REFORM IN CALIFORNIA TODAY</B>
<P>
 In 1993 California enacted a form of managed competition, establishing
a Health Insurance Purchasing Cooperative (HIPC) to negotiate
with insurance companies on behalf of small businesses.  Businesses
with between five and 50 employees are allowed to join on a voluntary
basis.  In 1997 eligibility will increase to businesses with as
few as three employees. 
<P>
 California's HIPC provides a wide choice of plans to member businesses.
 Early results are encouraging: 32,587 Californians are already
enrolled.  Twenty-one percent of participating employers didn't
previously offer health insurance.  The rest are obtaining coverage
at a lower cost.
<P>
 HIPC does use a form of price control-no insurer may charge 20%
above the average premium-but since the plan is voluntary, businesses
and insurance companies can choose to leave HIPC if they find
a better option.  The system's weakness is that it does not sufficiently
address cost containment.  Included in the HIPC bill were provisions
reforming MediCal and malpractice insurance, but one of the major
causes of inflated medical costs, third party payment for health
care, is left unaddressed.  Still, HIPC provides a good foundation
for any further needed reform.
<P>
 Already the California legislature is considering such reform.
 For instance, Senator Bill Leonard introduced a bill last year
to create Medisave accounts.  It died in the Revenue and Taxation
Committee, but Leonard will submit a scaled back version of the
bill again this year as a pilot program for some state employees.
<P>
 One of the worst consequences of the Clinton health care plan
is that it would cut short the innovations in health care reform
now taking place in the 50 states.  Here in California, for instance,
it would eliminate the existing improvements brought by the HIPC
and force the creation of quasi-governmental bodies called &quot;Health
Alliances.&quot;
<P>
<B>THE CLINTON PLAN: EMPOWERING A NEW BUREAUCRACY</B>
<P>
<B>An Overview</B>
<P>
 The Clinton administration's claim that its health care plan
will help control costs was dealt a major setback on February
8, when the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified
to Congress that the &quot;premiums&quot; to be paid by employers
under the Clinton plan are, indeed, a tax, and that the plan will
add $74 billion to the federal budget deficit, rather than reduce
it by $58 billion as the White House has claimed.
<P>
 At the top of the pyramid of the Clinton health care bureaucracy
would be the National Health Board (NHB), comprised of seven members
appointed by the President to four year terms.  Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala described the proposed NHB as
a &quot;relatively minor oversight group.&quot;  In truth, it
would establish &quot;global budgets&quot; and &quot;premium targets&quot;
for state governments as well as establish and oversee a package
of  benefits which insurance companies would be required to offer
and which consumers would be forced to buy.  The NHB would also
&quot;certify&quot; individual state compliance with their specifications.
<P>
 Consider just the establishing of &quot;global budgets&quot;
by this &quot;minor agency.&quot;  These budgets-a form of price
controls; they set an advance limit on total health care expenditures-are
meant to encourage savings through increased efficiency.  The
history of price controls, however, teaches us clearly that they
end in restricting supply.  In this case, restricted supply coupled
with increased demand for health care-universal coverage-will
inevitably lead to some form of health care rationing.  (Canada's
provinces all operate under global budgets.  As a result, Canadian
hospitals close beds for part of the year, limit the number of
operations performed, or use what are known as &quot;bed blockers&quot;less
costly patients occupying beds that could be used to serve those
with more costly diseases.  Thus the infamous months-long waiting
lists for major surgeries.  Needless to say, in Canada as in Europe,
politicians in need of surgery go directly to the head of the
line, while everyone else waits, often in severe pain.)
<P>
 The Clinton plan creates several new bureaucratic agencies in
addition to NHB, including (but not limited to) the following:
<P>
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR):  collects
and analyzes data from Patient Outcome Research Teams (PORTs),
which gather physician and hospital medical practice patterns.
<P>
Long-Term Care Insurance Advisory Council (LTCIAC): a five-member
board appointed by the secretary of Health and Human Services
to &quot;monitor the development of the insurance market.&quot;
<P>
National Health Advisory Committee (NHAC): advises the NHB and
is comprised of  &quot;representatives of states, health providers,
employers, consumers and affected industries.&quot;
<P>
National Health Data Advisory Council (NHDAC): &quot;oversees
the information and data activities, including standard setting
and privacy protection, of the federal government under health
care reform.&quot;
<P>
National Privacy Panel (NPP): ensures &quot;privacy protection
as applied to health information.&quot;
<P>
Premium Target Advisory Commission (PTAC): appointed by the NHB
to recommend adjustments to the methodology for calculating premium
targets.
<P>
Risk Adjustment Advisory Committee (RAAC): institutes the &quot;Risk
Adjustment System&quot; which will set &quot;premium payments
to health plans to reflect the level of risk assumed for patients
enrolled in comparison to the average population in the area.&quot;
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to creating new government agencies and expanding
duties of existing agencies such as the Departments of Labor and
Health and Human Services, the Clinton health care plan would
create programs to train physicians and to mandate what specialties
medical students will study-or whether they will study a specialty
at all-on the basis of &quot;national need.&quot;
<P>
<B>Health Alliances</B>
<P>
 The Clinton health care plan would operate on individual Americans
most directly through regional health alliances.  These alliances,
like the current HIPC in California, are non-profit bodies created
to negotiate with insurance companies on behalf of businesses.
The similarities, however, stop there.  For one thing, there is
nothing voluntary about participation.  Due to the so-called &quot;employer
mandate&quot; component of the plan, all businesses with under
5000 employees would be forced to buy their insurance through
their regional alliance. Each employer's &quot;premium&quot; would
be 80 percent of their employees' health insurance costs, although
no company would be obligated to pay more than 7.9 percent of
its payroll.  The Clinton plan currently offers federal subsidies
on a sliding scale to companies with fewer than 75 employees.
 For example, the smallest businesses will pay premiums of no
more than 3.5 percent of payroll, and others will be subsidized
at various rates up to 7.9 percent.  The Clinton administration
has proclaimed the exact amounts of the subsidies to be negotiable.
<P>
 Health alliances would have the sole power to determine which
health plans operate in their geographic area and to decide how
those plans are presented to the public, effectively limiting
choices and eliminating competitive advertising.  Alliances may
exclude a health plan for a number of reasons: for exceeding the
average premium by 20 percent, for failing to have the &quot;capacity
to deliver services,&quot; etc.  Obviously the government, not
the consumer, will decide these things.  (The Clintons maintain
against reason that health alliances aren't the government.  But
what else can one call not-for-profit agencies created by legislation
to carry out such functions?)
<P>
 Health alliances would also have the power of the purse, that
is, the power to levy taxes:  They would be authorized to assess
businesses and workers up to 2.5 percent of their insurance premiums
to provide for the alliance's &quot;administrative allowance,&quot;
plus up to 1.5 percent of premiums to fund federal academic health
centers and graduate medical educational programs.  And in order
to comply with the global budget set by the NHB, alliances are
authorized to impose fee schedules on doctor's services.
<P>
 At least one of the plans offered in each alliance must be a
fee-for-service plan, in which consumers pay directly for a doctor's
care.  But this plan would be subject to strict price controls,
and the absence of tax relief for such expenses would make it
untenable for all but the rich.  If an individual refuses to join
a plan from the health alliance, they may obtain other insurance,
but will be charged double the premium they would otherwise have
paid.
<P>
<B>Community Rating</B>
<P>
 The most egregious problem with the Clinton plan is what is known
as &quot;community rating.&quot;-a complicated way of saying that
everyone in a given alliance area is charged the same insurance
premium regardless of health risk or condition.  The top ten causes
of death in the United States are behavior-related; community
rating provides no incentives for people with unhealthy behavior
to change their ways.  And it would supersede a longstanding tradition
of fairness in the insurance industry which &quot;protects insured
persons from paying excessive amounts to subsidize high-risk policyholders
and groups.&quot;  One commentator has concluded that community
rating undermines the very idea of insurance:
<P>
Healthy people purchase health insurance because they fear the
possible financial consequences of illness.  People purchase health
insurance while they are well, so that they will have it when
they are ill.  However, if health insurance become available regardless
of health status, much of the incentive to pay for health insurance
while healthy will be removed.  For many people, it will be a
rational choice to do without health insurance until the need
arises.
<P>
 The Clinton plan's answer to this problem, of course, is to force
everyone to buy high-priced, standard-package benefits, thereby
subsidizing high risk patients in the same alliance region.
<P>
 Beginning in 1993, the State of New York has operated under community
rating.  As a result, the average price for commercial insurance
is up 18 percent, and has more than doubled for some New Yorkers.
 The table below dramatically demonstrates the economic effects
of community rating.

<P>
<B>The Divisive Politics of the Clinton Plan</B>
<P>
 Taken together, regional health alliances and community rating
are a recipe for political gerrymandering.  The Clinton plan tries
to account for this problem by mandating that &quot;the entire
portion of a metropolitan statistical area location in a state
shall be included in the same alliance area.&quot; But this will
not keep politicians from fighting and conniving to place their
constituents out of high health risk areas like San Francisco
or Los Angeles, or areas with acute illegal alien populations
such as San Diego, in order to get the lower community-rated premiums.
 
<P>
 As Elizabeth McCaughey has written,  &quot;Everyone will figure
out that you get more health care for your dollar or pay lower
premiums in an alliance without inner-city problems.  The plan
will bear an incentive for employers to abandon cities and relocate.&quot;
Real estate prices will be drastically affected by all this reshuffling,
as businesses and homeowners attempt to leave high risk alliance
regions.
<P>
<B>Impact on the California Economy</B>
<P>
 Most economic impact studies on the Clinton plan have had a national
focus, but one can extrapolate from them a dire prognosis for
California.  Lewin-VHI, a non-partisan research firm based in
Virginia, found that 67 percent of firms not now providing insurance
will be forced to pay at least $1,000 per year extra per employee,
and that half of all working-age households will pay more for
health care under the Clinton plan.  Professors June and David
O'Neill of Baruch College estimate that 3.1 million jobs will
be lost as a result of the employer mandate alone.  Seventy-five
percent of these jobs will be concentrated in service industries
such as restaurants and agriculture.
<P>
 The most prominent study to date examining the effect specifically
on California comes from the Legislative Analyst's Office.  It
estimates the Clinton plan might result in 75,000 lost jobs. 
At the same time it estimates an eventual annual savings to the
state of several hundred millions of dollars.  But most of this
savings comes from shifting the financial burden of health care
to the federal budget, and away from state and county budgets.
 That is, California's taxpayers will still foot the increased
bill for the Clinton plan through federal taxes.
<P>
 The estimated savings in the Legislative Analyst's study amount
to the federal government assuming the burden for some services,
while the estimated costs generally amount to new mandates on
the state government.  For example, the Clinton plan requires
that states share the costs of a new federal program for home
and community based long-term care.  The Analyst predicts a cost
of $200 million in 1996 and higher thereafter.  We must keep in
mind though that the federal government can easily unload its
funding responsibility for the plan onto the states at a future
date.  This occurred in the mid-1980s when federal &quot;Revenue
Sharing&quot; was the first item to get chopped when Congress
started cutting costs.
<P>
 The Clinton administration also plans to increase federal taxes
on cigarettes and alcohol, which the state already taxes, as a
way to help fund the plan.  The Legislative Analyst predicts the
new federal levies will reduce state revenue by $200 million.
<P>
 The Wilson administration is worried about several adverse effects
of the Clinton plan on the California economy.  First and foremost
is the devastating effect of the employer mandate on small businesses,
which account for 85 percent of California's new jobs.  A White
House official's recent response to an expression of concern about
California job loss was unsettling:  &quot;We haven't factored
that in at this point.&quot;
<P>
 A survey of the 48,000 California members of the National Federation
of Independent Business revealed that over 90% oppose the employer
mandate feature of the Clinton plan.  They do not believe that
the promised subsidies for the smallest businesses will work over
the long term.  Such subsidies will simply put more strain on
the federal government to provide something else for which it
doesn't have the means.  Moreover, the subsidies require new appropriations
each year, and can be easily reduced or eliminated by Congress
after the health care plan is entrenched, putting the burden on
the states, whose coffers are already depleted.
<P>
<B>The Death Knell of Federalism</B>
<P>
 Under the Clinton proposal, by January 1, 1997, California must
submit a report to the National Health Board detailing how it
intends to comply with the Clinton plan.  If any state resists,
the secretary of Health and Human Services has two options: she
may withhold federal funds for hospitals and other federally funded
programs in the state or, failing that, she may do what is &quot;necessary&quot;
to make sure that the &quot;comprehensive benefits package is
provided to eligible individuals in the state during the year.&quot;
 In lieu of state compliance, she may also assess yet another
tax on premiums-up to 15 percent-to offset administrative overhead
in setting up one or more regional alliances in a non-participating
state.
<P>
 If the Clinton plan becomes law, the only option available to
the states besides compliance is a state-instituted &quot;single-payer&quot;
system.  Thus Assembly Bill 16, authored by Assemblyman Burt Margolin,
and Senate Bill 1098, authored by Senator Art Torres, which would
implement a Clinton-type plan on the state level.  These Clinton
clones include state global budgets, a seven member California
Health Commission responsible for creating a standard benefits
package, and are written &quot;in anticipation of federal action.&quot;
<P>
 In short, the Clinton plan will effectively usurp the authority
of state governments over health care policy.  Constitutional
justifications for like infringements on state powers in recent
years have cited the power of Congress to regulate commerce, a
power originally meant to override interstate trade barriers.
 In <I>Wickard v. Filburn</I> in 1942, however, the Supreme Court
used the commerce clause to rule that a farmer growing wheat for
his own consumption had an effect on interstate commerce.  Therefore,
Congress was permitted to bar him from doing so.  David Rivkin
warns that the Clinton plan threatens to stretch the commerce
clause to dangerous new limits:
<P>
 If the courts uphold Congress's authority to impose this system,
they must once and for all draw the curtain on the Constitution
of 1787 and admit that there is nothing that Congress cannot do
under the Commerce Clause.... For example, if Congress thinks
Americans are too fat-many are-and that this somehow will affect
interstate commerce, can it not decree that Americans shall lose
weight?  Indeed, under the new system, any activity that might
increase the costs of health care might be regulatable.
<P>
<B>MARKET-ORIENTED REFORM ALTERNATIVES</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B>
<P>
 The largest health-care cost-containment problem comes from the
fact that most medical bills are paid by third parties.  This
reduces efficiency because patients do not feel they are spending
their own money.  J. Patrick Rooney, Chairman of  Golden Rule
Insurance, employs an analogy to demonstrate the point:
<P>
Imagine if employers provided &quot;grocery credit cards&quot;
as a fringe benefit the same way they now provide employee health
care.  It would pay 80 percent of an employee's food bill after
a $100 per year deductible, then, 100% after the first $5,000.
 If that were a fringe benefit like health care, grocery stores
would stack only the highest-price food because that is all that
employees would want to buy.... People spend their own money on
food.... Hence, grocery prices are not increasing in the range
of 15 to 20 percent per year the way health care spending has
been.
<P>
 The use of Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) can change this destructive
pattern. These are tax-free accounts, similar to IRAs.  Employers
would purchase high-deductible, lower-premium health insurance
policies, and put the difference in the MSA to cover the deductibles.
 Employees would contribute, for example, up to $3,000 a year
to cover routine medical expenses.  At the end of the year, money
not spent on health care can be taken out of the MSA (subject
to income taxes) or rolled over for medical expenses in the next
year.  Since Americans never spend on health care in a year what
they spend on health insurance, money will usually be left over
at the end of the year.
<P>
 As competition for the savings account money increases, prices
will fall, making health insurance affordable for more and more
businesses and individuals.
<P>
 Vouchers might be provided to the poor for MSAs instead of, or
in addition to, the MediCal coverage they now receive.  This would
have the immediate effect of allowing doctors to compete for MediCal
patients rather than struggling to avoid them, because they lose
so much money in treating them in the highly regulated MediCal
market.
<P>
 The main objection to MASs concerns the numbers.  The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that the difference between the premiums
of high-deductible policies is insufficient to cover the deductible
that must be paid in the event of a catastrophe.  However, in
any given year, it is likely that the deductible will go unused.
 In Los Angeles in 1992, for example, health care costs for 88
per cent of the population were below $3,000.  In Chicago and
Cincinnati the numbers were 90 and 92 percent respectively. Even
if the CBO's estimate is correct, then, the contributions of one
year could be rolled over into the second year. As a last resort,
more of the employees' wages can be placed in the account to cover
the deductible.  While  the employee would see less take home
pay, the money could be removed at the end of the year if there
was no medical emergency requiring deductible payment.
<P>
 Another objection to MSAs is that people won't go to the doctor
as often if they know they are spending their own money.  But
this is the real key to cost containment.  Someone must decide
to spend money on health care or on something else.  Advocates
of MSAs believe the individual should do so-not the government.
<P>
<B>Medicare/ Medical Reform</B>
<P>
 As shown at the outset of this report, Medicare and MediCal costs
have exploded over the last 15 years.  The surest solution to
this is to inject competition into the system. For instance, vouchers
could be issued to both Medicare and MediCal recipients by which
they could purchase a private insurance policy or start a medical
savings account.
<P>
<B>Medical Liability Reform</B>
<P>
 Malpractice insurance cost hospitals and doctors $10 billion
in 1991, and that cost is estimated to rise to $15 billion in
1998.  The costs of &quot;defensive medicine&quot;- doctors ordering
unnecessary tests to guard against lawsuits-was $27 billion in
1993.  In a recent study of lawsuits filed against hospitals and
doctors in New York, 80 percent were found to be without basis.
To curb this trend we might adopt the rule that the loser pays
all lawyers' fees, a practice most other countries in the world
employ to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Insurance Mandates</B>
<P>
 The number of state laws mandating that insurance companies include
certain benefits rose from 48 in 1974 to over 700 in 1991.  These
mandates raise the prices of minimum benefits and make insurance
too costly for people with the lowest incomes-thus increasing
the number of uninsured.  This could be solved by offering a &quot;no
frills&quot; package of benefits to the public, absent the expensive
mandates.
<P>
<B>Occupational Licensing</B>
<P>
 By restricting entry into the medical profession, licensing laws
have increased the price of medical services.  While needed to
protect the consumer, these laws can be amended to increase efficiency.
 For instance, hospitals might be given more leeway in licensing
personnel for routine services.
<P>
<B>CONGRESSIONAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE CLINTON PLAN</B>
<P>
<B>The Chafee Plan:</B>
<P>
 Senator John Chafee's proposal has the essential structure of
the Clinton plan, but injects some competition into the formula.
 It would eliminate the employer mandate and avoids spending caps
and global budgeting.  States would be required to set up purchasing
cooperatives similar to health alliances, but more than one would
be allowed in a given geographic area.  A national commission
would establish a minimum benefits package.
<P>
 Under the Chafee proposal, health plans &quot;may not discriminate
on the basis of  health status.&quot;  This amounts to community
rating and all the problems that entails.  Chafee would create
MSAs, but they are not central to the plan.  The main problem
with the Chafee plan is the potential for expansion.  Hillary
Clinton herself has said that the Chafee plan is a good first
step, since much of the structure (National Health Board, standard
benefits package, community rating) is already in the bill and
may be easily expanded later.
<P>
<B>The Cooper Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Congressman Jim Cooper's proposal has much in common with both
Clinton and Chafee.  It eliminates the employer mandate, but a
national commission would establish a minimum benefits package
and premiums offered by the cooperatives will be community rated.
 The Cooper plan has been supported by some business groups, most
notably the Business Roundtable.  But it contains provisions that
impose significant costs and constraints on business, and which
can be easily expanded once the program is in place. William Kristol
has pointed out that through changes in the tax code in the Cooper
plan, &quot;businesses that today offer their employees generous
health plans would effectively be forced either to accept the
government's more austere benefit limits or face stiff economic
penalties.&quot;
<P>
 Another onerous provision of the Cooper bill  requires all business
firms with fewer than 100 employees (about 93% of all businesses)
to register with regional Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives,
forward information about all their full- and part-time employees,
and deduct from all paychecks the cost of health care premiums-whether
or not the firms were providing health care coverage.  The Cooper
plan doesn't include MSAs.  Like Clinton, its implementation would
require a massive tax hike.
<P>
<B>The Nickles Plan</B> 
<P>
 Senator Don Nickles' proposal is modeled on the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, which serves 10 million federal workers,
and gives its members a choice of nearly 30 plans with a variety
of benefits and prices.
<P>
 Nickles calls his bill &quot;The Consumer Choice Health Security
Act.&quot;  It would outlaw exclusions for pre-existing conditions,
cap medical malpractice awards, and require only that Americans
buy catastrophic health insurance.  A potential drawback is that
&quot;underwriting&quot; would not be allowed beyond age, sex,
and geography, a restriction that is only slightly better than
a full community rating.  But insurance companies would be allowed
to give incentive discounts to promote healthy behavior.
<P>
 The focal point of the Nickles MSAs, into which participants
could put up to $3,000 per year plus $500 for every dependent,
tax-free.  Tax credits would be offered to the poor to purchase
their own MSAs.
<P>
<B>The Gramm Plan:</B> 
<P>
 Senator Phil Gramm's proposal differs little from Nickles.  It
would institute medical savings accounts and leave most choices
up to the health care consumer.  Unlike Nickles, Gramm does not
require individuals to buy catastrophic insurance; rather it institutes
a wage garnishing mechanism to punish those who abuse the system.
 The Gramm plan has no community rating, though it does offer
some relief for individuals with pre-existing conditions.  And
it would require that losers pay winners' fees in malpractice
cases.   
<P>
 All of the these congressional alternatives offer cuts in Medicare
and Medicaid, as well as malpractice reform.  A final bill will
likely have these included.
<P>
 From California's perspective, any one of these plans would be
preferable to Clinton, since all avoid the job-killing employer
mandate.  Only Nickles and Gramm, however, avoid the other major
problems of the Clinton plan, and clearly address the cost-containment
obstacle of third-party payment.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
  No one believes that the revolutionary Clinton health care plan
will pass without being &quot;melded&quot; to Cooper or some version
of Chafee-Cooper.  It is unlikely any of the plans can pass in
the Senate without some Republican votes or in the House without
moderate Democrats.  The key question is this:  Will Republicans
and moderate Democrats hold out for a genuine alternative that
avoids a federal takeover of the health care industry and massive
new taxes to finance it?
<P>
 The answer may depend on how coherent the Republicans' alternative
plan is, and how persuasive Senators Dole, Nickles, Gramm and
other Republicans can be in taking it to the nation.
<P>
 Rejecting the &quot;crisis&quot; atmosphere fostered by the Clinton
propaganda machine is the first step in resisting the Clinton-Cooper
juggernaut.  The second step is an insistence on honest numbers
and truth-in-packaging.  The third step is to show courage in
resisting and rebutting the White House demagoguery against the
health care industry.  If these steps are taken, it will be possible
to gain widespread public support for an alternative plan that
provides practical remedies to real problems.
<P>
 Some health care reform-changing the federal tax code to allow
for medical savings accounts and Medicare reform, for example-must
be done in Washington.  But aside from these federal actions,
health care reform should be left to the states.  The best strategy
is to support market-oriented plans at the federal level that
won't encroach on the right of California and other states to
implement their own modifications in the future.  The Clinton
plan closes the door not only to consumer choice but to California's
policy options as well.

<B>The California Teachers Association:</B>
<P>
<B>Power Politics vs. Education Reform</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
Editor's Note
<P>
<I> This is the first in a series of reports on the California
Teachers Association and its role in the California public policy
arena. It sketches the outlines of a large and energetic organization,
and lays the groundwork for future reports on the CTA's pervasive
impact on California's educational system.</I>
<P>
<I> We will try to shed light on the CTA's record of opposition
to meaningful education reform-from alternative certification
and merit pay to charter schools, parental choice, and district
decentralization. We will explore its operations at the local
level-its collective bargaining strategies, its  relationships
with local school boards and superintendents, its role in the
fiscal mismanagement of local school districts, and its efforts
to obstruct charter schools. We will also spotlight CTA's not
negligible contribution to the state's budget and fiscal crisis
through Proposition 98 and other political stratagems. (Be forewarned:
the CTA is considering a &quot;Super-Prop. 98&quot;  initiative
measure that &quot;closes the loopholes&quot; and guarantees the
schools an even bigger slice of state outlays. It could be called
the Kevorkian Amendment: assisted suicide for the state budget.)</I>
<P>
<I> It is not accurate or fair to blame all of the state's education
woes on the teachers' union. Others have contributed and deserve
recognition. Some big city school boards (like Los Angeles Unified)
have failed at both management and leadership: those mammoth districts
need to be broken up.  The educational media have not been the
most vigilant watchdogs of the public interest in covering educational
matters: reporters' attention span is short and they often behave
like PR flaks for the education industry. What the PTA-or the
PTSA-stands for is hard to discern, but it is not parent empowerment.</I>
<P>
<I> Yet by far the most disappointing performance has been that
of the business community. With a few notable exceptions, business
leaders are surprisingly naive in dealing with educational matters.
Always seeking a safe &quot;middle road,&quot;  they're easily
coaxed  into supporting incremental add-ons and enhancements,
particularly if the new funds are targeted on &quot;at-risk&quot;
kids. (We should ask why the definition and number of &quot;at
risk&quot; students keep growing, and whether rewarding schools
with more money for finding more children &quot;at risk&quot;
is a good idea. In the business world, if you subsidize something,
you tend to get more of it. Is there any reason to expect anything
different in education?) The result is that nothing much changes
in public education except the price tag. Our schools aren't any
better than a decade ago, they just cost more.</I>
<P>
<I> Who is responsible for this state of affairs? California legislators,
State Board of Education members, the state school chief, elected
school board officials- are all accountable to the public, however
imperfectly. What about the CTA?  The CTA  is accountable only
to its members-which is fine; it is a private organization. The
problem arises when it claims to speak not for its members' interests
but</I><B> <I>for our children's future</I></B><I>. The point
was perfectly illustrated by American Federation of Teachers president
Albert Shanker's quip, &quot;I'll start representing kids when
kids start paying union dues.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I> The CTA can't have it both ways. If the level of  teachers'
salaries and benefits were the measure of school quality, California
would have the 7th best schools in the nation. Our public schools
rank 29th in math proficiency, 42nd in high school graduation
rates, and near the top only in one category-public disaffection.</I>
<P>
<I> It's time for our public officials to look beyond the familiar
rhetoric of &quot;more is better.&quot; More centralization is
not better. More categorical aid is not better. More strikes are
not better. More school district bankruptcies are not better.
More state debt is not better.  The only way to foster the needed
economies, innovation, and accountability is through a new kind
of thinking. Instead of trying to &quot;reinvent&quot; schools
from the top down, why not a revolution <B>from the bottom up-</B>through
radical decentralization, expanded charter schools and charter
districts, alternative certification of teachers,  and parental
choice? Such actions would set in motion a new dynamic:  local
communities could redesign their own schools without permission
from bureaucrats.</I>
<P>
<I> </I>
<P>
<I> The CTA stands across the path to such innovation, saying,
&quot;Over my dead body!&quot; Born of the struggles of the 70s,
it fears change in the 90s, and it means to fight any threat to
its financial empire. But it cannot hold back the tide of change
forever. Parents will continue to flee government schools in search
of a better education for their children, especially in the inner
cities. Creative teachers and talented principals increasingly
will seek out charter schools and other escape hatches. And savvy
politicians will learn that the empowerment strategy pays dividends
for everyone.</I>
<P>
<I> The task of bringing fundamental change to public education
in California will require more than summits and public relations
wizardry. The good news is-it doesn't require more money. What
it does require is more leadership.     </I>

<B>Part I: Profile of a Political Machine</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
    &quot;Follow the money.&quot;
<P>
    - Deep Throat in <I>All the President's Men</I>
<P>
 The California Teachers Association (CTA) operates what most
observers consider the best organized and most effective political
machine in the state.  Affiliated with the National Education
Association (NEA), the CTA's influence on California government
is unmatched by any business or trade group. Its political clout
is envied by other special interest lobbies.  It wages ferocious
political battle when its vital interests are at stake-which is
to say, its economic interests. 
<P>
 CTA represents teachers in over 950 of the state's 1,006 public
school districts, at most community colleges, and in the 19-campus
California State University system.  CTA's 235,000 membership
includes 186,600 full-time teachers and 39,900 associate members.
 Another 8,500 non-members are required to pay &quot;representation&quot;
fees to CTA for contract negotiations and collective bargaining.
<P>
 CTA's affluence (and influence) arises mainly from its large
membership and regular source of income, consisting of mandatory
teachers' dues.  With membership of more than 235,000, its annual
budget approaches $74 million.  A CTA member pays $600 per year-$200
more than the national average-with the NEA netting $99, CTA $376,
and local chapters $125.  (A chapter is defined as a local unit
of self-governance, chartered through CTA and affiliated with
NEA.)
<P>
 More than a third of all school districts-and all major districts-operate
as agency shops, thus forcing non-union teachers to pay the CTA
for collective bargaining expenses (although not for political
activities, under current law).  As of September 1991, 357 of
the approximately 900 CTA-chartered locals operated under agency
shop rules.   
<P>
 In a &quot;fair share&quot; agreement, a teacher with religious-
or philosophically-based objections against CTA membership must
contribute the equivalent dues amount to a CTA-approved charity.
In 1993-94 the 8,500 non-union members will pay $2,350,000-or
3.6 percent-of CTA's current budget.
<P>
 The amount of such &quot;representation fees&quot; is determined
by the union, unless challenged in court by an individual teacher.
 According to the Public Employees Relation Board (PERB), CTA
set its representation fees for the 1991/92 school year at 81.5%,
or about $300.  For 1993/94, the CTA adjusted the amount downward
to just over three-quarters of its spending.  In other words,
the CTA claims (under oath) that it uses 76.1% of all revenues
for negotiating collective bargaining agreements.  
<P>
 The CTA also imposes special levies on its members.  A recent
levy will generate over $12 million over three years, with funds
going to pay costs of defeating Proposition 174, the voucher initiative.
 Another levy instituted in 1990 yielded over $2 million for a
television campaign to protect Proposition 98-the 1988 Constitutional
Amendment guaranteeing a minimum funding level for public education.
<P>
 The CTA's clout is due not only to its financial resources but
to its vast membership, which can be mobilized in every state
legislative district down to the precinct level.  It has become
adept at guerrilla warfare as well, as seen in efforts to obstruct
and sabotage signature gathering to get Proposition 174 on the
ballot.
<P>
 A discussion of the emergence of public sector unions is beyond
the scope of this paper. But it is important to understand that
the emergence of teachers' unions is part of a larger phenomenon,
the rise of public sector unions in state and local government.
Secondly, it is important to note that this rise has been simultaneous
with the <I>decline</I> of unionization in the private sector
since 1960. Public sector unions have inherited all the folklore
and political mythology of traditional unions, but they are in
fact far more powerful than their private sector counterparts
ever were. The reason for this is essentially the absence of any
external market constraints on the demands public sector unions
can make: the only constraints are political, not economic. Thus,
when politics becomes the handmaiden of  politicized unions, and
politicians are so tied to them that they fail to balance competing
interests, public policy and the public interest are the victims.
<P>
 That the self-interest of its members is the touchstone of CTA
policy is made clear by the CTA mission statement, in case anyone
had any doubts.  According to the CTA's &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives: 1992-94,&quot; its central mission is threefold:
 &quot;To protect and promote the well-being of its members; to
advance the cause of free, universal, and quality public education;
and to contribute to the establishment of a more just, equitable
and democratic society.&quot;
<P>
That the interests of its members come first in this trilogy is
not news, but it is good to keep it in mind when listening to
CTA rhetoric about the needs of children. And, of course, &quot;free,
universal ...education&quot; will be pursued all the more energetically
if the union is in the politically protected position of being
the sole provider of this &quot;quality&quot; education. The document
then lists 11 institutional goals for 1992-94 in order to pursue
CTA's mission:
<P>

<CENTER>

<P>
CTA ASCENDANCY
<P>
 In the 1960s, certified teachers and classified school employees
(e.g., &quot;clerical&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot; workers)
were represented by employee organizations within school districts.
 These organizations were limited to representing their members
only, and could meet and confer over a school board's policies
of employment without negotiating a binding contract.
<P>
 CTA rewrote its constitution in the early 1970s to exclude administrators
as members and became more involved in collective bargaining for
its teacher members.  In 1975, Senate Bill 160 (Rhodda) and the
Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) were signed by Governor
Jerry Brown.  The Rhodda Act required school districts to recognize
elected unions as the sole bargaining agents and to negotiate
binding contracts with them.  Under the EERA, a union could become
the exclusive representative either in certification by the Public
Employee Relations Board (PERB) or by voluntary employer recognition.

<P>
 Many of the pre-existing certified teachers and classified school
employees' organizations established in the 1960s and early 1970s
remained largely unaffected by the EERA's new collective bargaining
system.  That was the case until 1982, when Governor Edmund G.
&quot;Jerry&quot; Brown granted forced dues privileges to state
employee unions, including teacher unions.  And in 1983, automatic
deduction of non-member &quot;agency&quot; fees became negotiable
for teachers unions.  
<P>
 In 1978, the struggle over collective bargaining rights was eclipsed
by Proposition 13, which slashed property taxes-the major source
of school funding.  At that time CTA's political action committee
and fragmented state organization was ineffective against the
initiative's juggernaut.  CTA President Ed Foglia explained: &quot;We
came to understand that politics is not just a publicity campaign.
 Politics is door-to-door-the kinds of things that you have to
do in order to win elections.&quot;
<P>
 Subsequently, Foglia helped develop a &quot;Blueprint for Political
Action,&quot; which is CTA's centralized system of data retrieval,
voter registration, absentee canvassing and extensive member education.
 This fostered a consolidation and integration of CTA's campaign
apparatus and statewide lobbying infrastructure.  
<P>
 In 1983 Alice Huffman, a close ally of Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, was hired as a lobbyist for CTA.  The following year she
was promoted to director of government relations, and soon after
CTA's political action committee was making the top ten lists
of state campaign donors.  Huffman's major accomplishment was
to help CTA better mobilize its economic resources and &quot;people
power&quot; in shaping public policy.  As Huffman points out,
she &quot;politicized&quot; CTA, overseeing the fine tuning of
a sophisticated grass-roots operation in which a chapter can,
on short notice, mobilize the people-power to man phone banks,
 walk precincts, or host media events.  Says Huffman, &quot;I
had to teach them that they [CTA] could do the right thing and
be successful.&quot;
<P>
CTA OPERATIONS
<P>
 Registered with the IRS as a 501(c)(5) non-profit labor organization,
CTA is exempt from property taxes. It receives tax deductible
contributions as well as government grants for educational research.
 With headquarters in  Burlingame, the thirty-one CTA offices
from San Diego to Eureka occupy 204,100 square feet of office
space.  
<P>
 CTA has approximately 480 full-time employees on its payroll,
nearly half the number employed by the state Department of Education
to direct the entire statewide education bureaucracy.  Included
in the CTA total are 21 managers and assistant managers, who are
paid an average of $110,000 per year (excluding benefits, which
are generous) to oversee CTA's 17 departments. These include Governance,
Governmental Relations,  Association for Better Citizenship (CTA/ABC
- CTA's political action committee), Group Legal Services, and
Training and Bargaining Services.  Three other departments-Communications,
Human Rights, and Instruction &amp; Professional Development-work
together to make up the Information and Development Division,
under the supervision of the associate executive director.  
<P>
GOVERNANCE
<P>
 There are two categories to CTA Governance: policy making and
policy implementation.  Policy making occurs at both the state
and chapter levels.  Smaller chapters hold regular meetings to
adopt policies and determine program direction, while larger chapters
delegate policy authority to an elected body, called the State
Council of Education. 
<P>
 The State Council is a 660-plus member representative body which
serves as the legislative and policy-making arm for the membership.
 Representatives are elected from among the state's rank-and-file
teachers.  The ratio of  representation is 1:350 members, so small
chapters share Council delegates while large chapters have more
than one.  The State Council has thirteen standing committees
that assist in developing recommendations to implement CTA policy.
 Policies are approved by a simple majority voice vote of Council
delegates.
<P>
 Among other duties, the Council approves the increasingly frequent
special levies, which is used to fund CTA's political action and
advertising efforts. Recently, the Council was asked to approve
a $6 dues increase, designed to raise an additional $1,000,000
annually,  &quot;for future political struggles,&quot; including
a possible 1996 initiative campaign for a successor to Proposition
98.  The Council is expected to approve the dues hike at its June
1994 meeting. This new levy would come on top of the $19 annual
surcharge approved in 1993 to fund the campaign against Proposition
174. A prior surcharge of  $12 in 1991 raised $2.4 million for
the advertising blitz that helped derail Governor Wilson's effort
to suspend the provisions of Proposition 98.
<P>
 
<P>
 Policy implementation is the responsibility of CTA's executive
body.  It has a 24-member Board of Directors (or Executive Committee),
three executive officers, 16 directors from various geographical
districts, an Executive Director, two Minority Directors-at-large,
and one NEA Director.  The board creates its own committees or
task forces to assist it in implementing policy.  Altogether,
these special committees and CTA leadership constitute the &quot;action
arm&quot; of CTA.
<P>
 The three executive officers-President, Vice President, and Secretary/
Treasurer-are elected by the State Council to a maximum of two
2-year terms.  The President serves as CTA's main executive officer
and official spokesman on policy matters.
<P>
LOCAL SERVICE DELIVERY / REGIONAL SERVICES
<P>
 For administrative and organizational purposes, CTA divides its
statewide operations into four geographical regions.  Most CTA
programs and services to chapters are provided and coordinated
through an integrated system of offices and staff throughout each
region.  These regions, in turn, are divided into Directorial
Districts A through P, each producing one elected director on
the Board of Directors.
<P>
 CTA regional offices were established in 1971.  Regional Services
assists with chapter organization, trains chapter leadership,
and develops communication systems among members, local leaders,
and the community (e.g., phone trees, drop systems, local Association
Newspaper, Media Relations).  This department also helps chapters
with collective bargaining negotiations, contract monitoring,
membership recruitment, Group Legal Services, and political action.
 Hence Regional Services is part of the action arm of CTA in implementing
the association's policies.
<P>
 Included in Local Service Delivery are the 24 Service Center
Councils, a network of chapter presidents and State Council representatives
who inform membership of actions under consideration by the State
Council and Board and coordinate membership participation in regional
CTA activities (i.e. political activities and CTA/NEA representative
elections).  More importantly, this department develops regional
strategic action plans to organize regional membership for political
action.  This grass-roots corps is the fountainhead of CTA's political
activities. 
<P>
 With 159 full-time employees in the four Regions, Local Service
Delivery's share of CTA's  1993-94 budget is 41.5% or $30,040,556.
 This large allocation suggests that Local Service Delivery plays
a vital role in implementing and coordinating CTA policy.
<P>
GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS &AMP; CTA/ABC-PAC
<P>
 The Governmental Relations Department seeks to attain CTA's political
objectives and serves as liaison to government and private agencies.
 Alice Huffman, who heads this department, explains: &quot;The
job of this department...is to help CTA implement through legislation
and political action the goals set by CTA members and enunciated
by the State Council of Education, the Board of Directors, and
the elected officers.&quot;  This involves aggressive lobbying
and massive political expenditures.  The department oversees membership
political activity and regularly organizes rank-and-file teachers
to flock to Sacramento to &quot;inform&quot; legislators on issues
of concern to CTA
<P>
 CTA/ABC (Association for Better Citizenship) provides campaign
contributions to CTA-endorsed candidates for local and state offices,
coordinates and directs membership involvement in political campaigns,
offers political action training, maintains a membership database,
and conducts member and public opinion polls to support the CTA's
political agenda.  Since 1985, CTA's PAC consistently has ranked
among the top five contributors to state legislative campaigns,
according to California Common Cause. It ranked number one in
1989-90.  In the past eight years the  CTA PAC  has given out
nearly $3.2 million in legislative campaign contributions.
<P>
 CTA claims to be non-partisan, but of the nearly $1 million it
donated to legislative campaigns in 1991-92,  91% or $903,352
was doled out to Democrats with an astounding 81% win rate.  Just
9% ($89,343) was donated to Republican candidates, and of this
small amount only $7,500 was contributed <I>after</I> the 1992
June primaries. This means that  80% of the amount given to Republicans
was given to spend against other Republicans.  Less than 1% of
CTA's $992,695 PAC money was contributed to Republicans to use
against Democrats.  
<P>
 With this record in mind it is curious to note that, according
to the co-directors of NEA's &quot;Republican Educators Caucus,&quot;
42.8% of CTA's membership are registered Republicans, including
CTA President Del Weber.
<P>
 CTA has a second political action committee, devoted solely to
ballot measures and non-candidate campaign expenditures.  Since
1985, this CTA Issues PAC has forked over more than $10 million
to support or oppose various initiatives. This total includes
expenditures to pass Proposition 98, but also includes hundreds
of thousands of dollars spent on measures completely unrelated
to education.  For example, in 1992 CTA spent almost $300,000
on behalf of failed Proposition 167, which would have raised taxes
on California businesses.  CTA has also expended funds to oppose
term limits ( Prop. 140) and prison inmate labor (Prop. 139),
to influence reapportionment (Props. 39, 118 and 119), and to
support Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird and Big Green (Prop. 130).
<P>
 CTA's success rate in political endorsements is impressive. In
November 1992, 99 of the 119 CTA-endorsed state and federal candidates
were elected-a whopping 83% win rate.  Of CTA contributions made
toward 181 local school board races and issues, CTA Secretary/Treasurer
Lois Tinson claims a 70% win rate.
<P>
 It is noteworthy that CTA dedicates at least 25% of its political
action money to local school board elections and requests that
local chapters' political action committees match these donations.
 Thus, while CTA/ABC  handed out over $1 million to state candidates
during 1991/92, it also gave over $300,000 to local candidates.
<P>
 School boards are considered the &quot;employer&quot; in collective
bargaining agreements (which set salaries, benefits, and other
working conditions), while the CTA is the bargaining agent. School
boards often give in to union demands for politically expedient
reasons.  This observation is underscored by the Little Hoover
Commission's study, &quot;Costs and Casualties of K-12 Education
in California&quot;:
<P>
The fact that school board members receive monetary contributions
from teachers' unions does...make for the appearance of a relationship
between unions and school boards and, at the very least, can contribute
to diminished public confidence in the board's independence.
<P>
 The Little Hoover Commission's study determined that this intermixing
of school board and union interests fosters a negative financial
impact on school districts and even the state budget:
<P>
Thus many of the agreements reached through collective bargaining
are not based on the long-term interests of the district and the
financial condition of the State...[such] decisions are not based
on the soundest of fiscal considerations [but] are arrived at
nevertheless because of political pressures.
<P>
 Such political pressures include the threat or execution of teacher
strikes, which force school boards to agree to unsound fiscal
policies regardless of the district's or State's financial condition.
 Indeed, teachers' salaries and benefits gobble up at least 83%
of the State's General Fund expenditures, reducing budgets for
textbooks, library books, maintenance, and other needs vital to
learning.  In 1991-92, a mere 3.87% of the school expenditures
went for vital learning materials like textbooks, computers, and
classroom supplies.  Moreover, during fiscal year 1991-92,  529
school districts-over half-ran budget deficits and four were so
miserably managed that they became wards of the state.
<P>
 In addition to its direct campaign contributions to causes and
candidates, CTA has spent millions on lobbying and other political
expenses.  According to California Common Cause, the CTA ranked
number one in political expenditures during the 1991-92 political
cycle, far outdistancing other moneyed interests such as the California
Medical Association, California Trial Lawyers Association, and
the Association of California Insurance Companies.  In fact, of
the $7.4 million that CTA spent on political purposes during 1991-92,
$3.9 million went for lobbying in Sacramento, making it the biggest
spending political lobby during the two-year session.  Moreover,
CTA's &quot;soft&quot; spending to run its political apparatus
handily doubles its total political expenditures.
<P>
 Perhaps more important than raw dollars spent on campaigns is
the extent of the grassroots political activism under the direct
control of the CTA.  CTA's Governmental Relations Department annually
holds a Political Action Institute in the first week of August,
designed to train teachers and local chapter leaders in effective
grass-roots politics.  Recently, the CTA claimed that more than
1,000 teachers received intensive training in political activism
to fight against Proposition 174, through the Institute and at
a Chapter President's Conference.
<P>
 Furthermore, a special department program of CTA/ABC, the Master
Plan for Political Action, actively promotes political involvement.
 The Master Plan provides workshops on political activism, internal
polling of members' political attitudes and participation in state
political parties, and instructional materials such as a political
action handbook. It  maintains a Political Action Database for
use in contacting and mobilizing members on political issues,
and hires outside political consultants.  Specific political contributions
and expenditures are recommended to the Board of Directors by
the CTA/ABC Committee to support the Master Plan.
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS
<P>
 The Communications Department's threefold task is public relations,
internal communications, and membership promotion. The department's
seven professionals and four full-time support staff issue numerous
publications, including tabloids, leadership newsletters, news
releases, feature and op-ed pieces, letters to the editor, and
the CTA Briefing Memo (directed to media professionals).  Its
primary aim is to boost CTA's public image and advance its political
agenda. The department coordinates the annual John Swett Awards,
given to newspapers, radio and television stations, and individual
journalists for what the CTA considers exemplary coverage of education
issues. 
<P>
HUMAN RIGHTS
<P>
 &quot;Members can call upon Human Rights,&quot; explains Department
Manager Dolores Heisinger, &quot;for assistance in racial-ethnic
minority group concerns, equal rights for women, teacher/student
rights, affirmative action, sex equity issues, discrimination,
academic freedom, far right attacks, segregation and integration,
violence in the schools, comparable worth, and peace and international
relations.&quot;  With just six employees and only 1.2% of CTA's
budget, this department focuses on minority leadership development,
women's leadership training and, in its words, &quot;far right
awareness.&quot;
<P>
 In a 1984 CTA pamphlet entitled &quot;Guidelines for Academic
Freedom in the Public Schools,&quot; the CTA Tenure and Academic
Freedom Committee expressed opposition to the &quot;New Right&quot;
as follows: &quot;Who dare take on religion, free enterprise,
patriotism, and motherhood?  We do, and we must!&quot;  When this
extreme statement is compared with the recent CTA-sponsored workshop,
&quot;Extremist Attacks on Academic Freedom,&quot; held at Madera
High School in February 1993, it appears to accurately encapsulate
CTA policy.  
<P>
 In the workshop booklet, CTA defines extreme groups and individuals
as those &quot;who attempt to set moral judgments for everyone,&quot;
and proceeds to list six &quot;far right&quot; organizations active
in California.  They are: Citizens for Excellence in Education,
American Family Association, Traditional Values Coalition, Concerned
Women For America, American Coalition For Traditional Values,
and Focus On The Family.  CTA claims that the policies of such
&quot;far right&quot; groups &quot;are detrimental to public education&quot;
and urges all CTA chapters to &quot;actively oppose&quot; them.
<P>
 Since CTA is an NEA affiliate, it is bound to support NEA resolutions
and policies and affirms this in its &quot;Statement of Mission,
Goals, and Objectives, 1992-94&quot; (see page 5 above). In the
arena of human rights, the NEA, and by extension the CTA, supports
affirmative action quotas, gay and lesbian rights, the dispensing
of condoms in public schools, abortion-on-demand, in-school care
for teen-age parents, a nuclear freeze, drafting women in the
military, gun control, socialized medicine, and statehood for
Washington DC. None of these policies have ever been submitted
to rank and file CTA members for their vote.  CTA by-laws do not
require it.
<P>
INSTRUCTION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (IPD)
<P>
 The goal of IPD, according to department manager Deborah Edginton,
is  to &quot;make the classroom work of our members both easier
and more productive.&quot;  IPD serves as CTA's liaison to dozens
of government agencies and private organizations, and thus provides
the basis of CTA's educational image. It spends only 1.4% of the
CTA budget on these instructional activities. 
<P>
 IPD sponsors numerous workshops and conferences to inform teachers
of their union rights, and synthesizes and disseminates information
that promotes the teaching profession.  IPD conducts research,
publishes studies on educational issues, provides research information
for other CTA departments, and works with a number of private
sector foundations providing funding for educational projects.
 
<P>
 As a non-profit labor organization, CTA is eligible for government
grants and tax deductible private donations. Thus IPD taps into
outside sources of revenue to finance its research.
<P>
 IPD staff works with three State Council committees, including
Curriculum and Instruction, Credentials and Professional Development,
and the Special Education Coordinating Committee. IPD has forged
a close relationship with colleges and universities to coordinate
and promote interaction between education departments and K-12
teachers on mutually beneficial projects.
<P>
GROUP LEGAL SERVICES 
<P>
 Providing free legal protection to CTA members and chapters,
Group Legal Services produces publications, conferences and workshops
on legal issues such as fair share, assists in agency fee reporting
and record keeping obligations, and maintains a comprehensive
labor-law library.  It fights teachers' lay-off notices, strengthens
probationary teachers' rights, comparable worth salary placement,
and defends CTA's right to strike.  At last count Legal Services
employed at least six attorneys and ten support staff in its Burlingame
and Los Angeles offices.
<P>
TRAINING AND BARGAINING SERVICES (TBS)
<P>
 Each summer CTA holds a Negotiations Finance Institute that has
trained thousands of contract negotiators.  Dick Odgers, Manager
of TBS,  explains, &quot;We've developed a Collective Bargaining
Reference Manual that serves as a guide for contract negotiations
around the state, and we were involved in the development of the
new State Budget forms which are in effect in 240 districts this
year [1991], all districts next year.  And we've developed training
for staff and chapters to help them understand these new forms.&quot;
<P>
 TBS maintains a Contract Master Index and Microfiche File to
provide chapters and negotiation teams with comprehensive contract
information.  Additionally, TBS furnishes ready access to California's
state budget, and often makes such information available to CTA
negotiators before it is available to school districts.
<P>
 CTA has developed a &quot;master agreement,&quot; containing
what are thought to be the best features of  all local agreements.
This functions as a template for local chapters to use in their
collective bargaining. Presumably, the CTA updates this template
each time new agreements are reached with desirable new features;
it is then redistributed to local chapters. Some of the features
of this master agreement will be examined in a future paper.
<P>
<B>SERVICE DEPARTMENTS</B>
<P>
 Service departments, operating from the Burlingame headquarters,
assist all other CTA departments.  They include the usual business
functions:  Accounting, Central Services, Data Processing, Governance
Support, Human Resources, and Management.
<P>
 
<P>
 In addition to these traditional service departments there is
a budget category, &quot;Other Expenditures,&quot; which finances
the purchase of property, equipment, and computers. It also includes
three not-so-traditional funds-the Crisis Assistance Fund, Media
Advertising Fund, and the Voucher/Choice Fund.
<P>
 <B>The Crisis Assistance Fund </B> provides money to chapters
undergoing negotiations or &quot;representation&quot; problems.
 This fund provides interest free loans of $70.00 per day to CTA
members on a chapter sanctioned strike of five days or more. 
It also enforces CTA's &quot;Brezhnev&quot; doctrine of exclusive
bargaining representation for all CTA chartered locals. Should
a chapter opt for alternative representation in collective bargaining,
CTA would disqualify the chapter and its membership and use its
Legal Services department to maintain CTA control.  Conversely,
CTA provides &quot;crisis assistance&quot; to CTA chapters not
certified as sole bargaining representatives in order to achieve
this coveted status.  Hence the purpose of this special fund is
to consolidate and expand CTA's control-and prevent defections.
<P>
 <B>The Media Advertising Fund </B> is financed by a dues increase
of $12 approved by the State Council of Education in March 1990.
 Its purpose is to sponsor annual television &quot;blitzes&quot;
promoting public education or CTA and place advertisements and
commentaries in the print media.  In 1991 this fund financed a
television commercial telling Governor Wilson, &quot;Don't Suspend
Proposition 98,&quot; which is generally credited with turning
public sentiment against Wilson's proposal.
<P>
<B>The Voucher/Choice Fund</B> consists of income generated by
a $19 dues increase for a period of three years, beginning in
1992-93.  It will generate over $12 million of the approximately
$13 million that CTA spent in its fall 1993 campaign against Prop.
174.
<P>
<B>THE CTA AND THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION REFORM </B>
<P>
 Despite its record of political success and legislative clout,
CTA is not satisfied. We learn from CTA President Del Weber that
CTA's mission to promote &quot;the well-being of its members&quot;
is failing: &quot;California's teachers work under grueling conditions,
with little support, a lack of funding and too many students in
their classrooms.&quot; Weber has hinted  at the CTA's future
strategy: &quot;Several circles within this organization...are
discussing that CTA might have to carry a future initiative for
school funding. The one we have is not working.&quot;  According
to Weber, the guaranteed minimum funding level under Proposition
98 is too easily evaded. (Proposition 98 was amended by Proposition
111, which effectively reduces the original 40% to about 33%.)
<P>
 Teachers' pay and benefits absorb about 80% of classroom funds
but only 51% of total funds spent at the district and county levels.
Translated, this means that 49% of funds are going to non-teaching
costs. So has CTA challenged California's top-heavy system of
thirteen non-teaching staff to every ten teachers?  Not yet. And
CTA has consistently opposed attempts to break up the state's
gargantuan school districts or cap non-teaching positions.
<P>
 Despite CTA's on-going campaign to puff public education's image,
CTA's policies are failing miserably at improving the actual quality
of public education. 
<UL>
<LI>Student drop-out rates in California schools are topping 30%-worse
than 41 other states-and 50% of those who do graduate get a seventh
grade education or less, lacking the basic skills to fill out
a job application.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>More than one million students in California do not speak
English well enough to understand what is going on in the classroom,
despite (or perhaps because of) tens of millions of dollars spent
on CTA-backed bilingual programs.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  SAT scores in California are declining relative to other
states' scores.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Violent crime in California's  public schools is on the rise,
threatening the safety of students, administrators and teachers
alike.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 CTA's answer to any criticism of the schools is always the same:
We need more money. But &quot;more money for schools&quot; always
translates to more money for salaries and benefits. This is not
to say that teachers' salaries are too high, but it is noteworthy
that  they are 7th in the nation, and that salaries have more
than kept pace with inflation since 1980.  
<P>
 It's interesting that teachers who are parents behave much like
other citizens when confronted with the choices available in the
public schools. According to a statement by NEA president Keith
Geiger, 40% of urban area public school teachers send their children
to private schools. AFT president Albert Shanker disputed this
figure in a series of paid ads in national magazines. But whatever
the rate of teacher bailout, it is not an indictment of unions.
Teachers-as-parents are parents first, union members second. Bravo!
<P>
 But teachers <I>as political activists</I> are another story.
Do we fully understand the implications of a <I>teachers' union
</I>using 91% of its PAC money, nearly half of which comes from
the forced union dues from non-Democrat members, to support Democrat
candidates for state and federal office?  Thomas Jefferson rightly
observed, &quot;To compel a man to furnish contributions of money
for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors
is sinful and tyrannical.&quot; 
<P>
 In 1992 the CTA sent 365 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention and 25 delegates to the Republican National Convention-a
ratio of over 14 to 1. This cohabitation of CTA PAC funds and
political operatives within the California Democrat Party  raises
interesting questions.  Is this heavy commitment to a single political
party a healthy thing <I>for California classrooms</I>? Even if
one assumes that individual teachers will make a conscientious
effort at fairness in discussing current events, it is disturbing
to know that teachers <I>collectively </I>so closely identify
their interests with the fortunes of a particular political party.

<P>
 And what about &quot;fair share&quot; fees taken from non-union
members?  Is it really credible, as CTA claims under oath, that
it devotes 76% of all its dues to <I>collective bargaining</I>?
 When taking into account not only CTA's overt political expenditures
but also the CTA activities that support its legislative, public
advocacy, and communications programs, the 76% figure appears
to be inflated.  After all, collective bargaining per se is the
job of the local chapter.  Yet CTA claims to spend only 24% on
its non-collective bargaining activities-the political and legislative
activities that are in reality its heart and soul.
<P>
 The CTA believes it not only has a right to speak for its members,
it should speak for <I>all </I>Californians in deciding what is
fit for public debate and decision. Regarding CTA's blocking campaign
against the 1991 petition drive to qualify the school voucher
initiative for the November 1992 ballot, CTA President Del Weber
explained their new mandate:
<P>
[CTA] realized that we would be accused of acting in an undemocratic
manner.  What was wrong, after all, with letting people vote on
an issue?  Our answer was firm.  There are some proposals that
are so evil that they should never even be presented to the voters.
<P>
 Arrogance and intolerance of this magnitude might be excusable
in almost any other interest group; after all, it's not unnatural
for groups to have strong opinions about the rightness of their
cause.  What is especially malodorous about the CTA's arrogance
is that these are the people who claim to know <I>better than
parents</I> what is best for California's children.  They claim
to teach citizenship, while trying to subvert the initiative and
referendum process. They claim to promote democracy, while suppressing
debate within their own organization. Through NEA and CTA Resolutions
they claim to speak for all teachers on dozens of controversial
(and often non-education) issues without polling their membership
to determine its views.
<P>
 The CTA, of course, is free to make claims and promote policies
as it sees fit. The public is also free to exercise some skepticism
about these claims and positions. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
 Teachers are entitled to representation in the legislative arena,
but so are parents and taxpayers. It is the job of  policy makers
to balance the professional views and economic interests of the
teachers' union with the interests of the public in improved educational
performance and expanded choices and opportunities.
<P>
 The test of sound policy in education should <I>not</I> be whether
a proposal meets with the approval of CTA or any other special
interest lobby. The test should be whether it expands choices
and opportunities for students and parents trapped in a failed
system.
<P>
 The dilemma facing the state's political leadership is as simple
as it is stark: The system that the CTA built hasn't failed the
CTA-it is doing quite well, thank you. But it has failed California.
That the state legislature is held in such low esteem by the voters
may have something to do with the public perception that special
interest lobbies are calling the shots. Whether in educational
affairs political leaders can change that perception without first
changing the reality is the question of the hour.
