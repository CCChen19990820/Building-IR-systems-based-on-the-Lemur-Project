<P>
Let me commence with two aphorisms, widely separated in time and substance.
<P>
The first is the observation of Aristotle that it is unjust to treat unequal things equally.
<P>
The second is the declaration of Marx that to establish equality, first we must establish inequality.
<P>
These two assumptions have been at war one with the other during the twentieth century.
<P>
What did Aristotle mean by writing that to treat unequal things equally is unjust? He meant that not all human beings are worthy of the same deserts, that not all actions are equally honorable and commendable, that not all works are of equally enduring value; so to confer equal rewards upon excellence and mediocrity would be profoundly unjust to the more deserving of praise. "To each his own."
<p>
What did Marx mean by asserting that inequality must be established before equality might be attained? He meant that the mighty must be pulled down from their seats, the alleged exploiters expropriated, whole classes destroyed-presumably by a general blood-letting-before the earthly paradise of communism might be realized. The bourgeois and all other opponents of socialist progress must be thoroughly discriminated against by the revolutionary proletariat. The bourgeois should be indulged no equality with the son of toil.
<p>
The Marxist regime in the Soviet Union fell at last after seven decades of terror and suffering; but the notion that "social justice" means equality of condition still works among us. In the connection, I commend you to three books: F. A. Hayek's <i>The Mirage of Social Justice;</i> Helmut Schoeck's <i>Envy: A Theory of Social Behavior;</i> and Gonzalo Fernandex de la Mora's <i>Egalitarian Envy: The Political Foundations of Social Justice.</i> The second book is by a German, the third by a Spaniard; it is a sign of the surviving domination of socialist assumptions about justice in America that these latter books scarcely were reviewed at all in the United States, though editions of both were published here. They deny the notion that there can exist a perfect social justice, attainable by positive law and social engineering; and their authors are agreed that the perfectly egalitarian society would be an unjust society. Let me suggest, also, that those present today would find a keen analysis of socialist errors about justice in a book of yesteryear of which I brought out a new edition some three years ago: W. H. Mallock's <i>A Critical Examination of Socialism.</i>
<p>
"All the four authors I mentioned a moment ago touch upon the vice of envy and its ruinous personal and social consequences. To that vice the Marxists appealed successfully in much of the world. "Why shouldst thou sit, and I stand?" cries incarnate Envy, in Marlowe' s play <i>Dr. Faustus.</i> "Come away!" Social justice will be attained, the poor are told, when they have unseated the affluent and supplanted them in their possessions. Such doctrines have devastated most of Asia and Africa ever since the Second World War, causing the massacre of the old leading classes, most hideously in the Congo-now Zaire-Portugese Timor, Portuguese Guinea, Chad, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and China. Yet the earthly paradise of social justice did not result from this slaughter: instead, squalid oligarchs and men of blood succeeded to power, and general impoverishment has been experienced. Perhaps we see today the beginning of such a progress toward social justice in the Republic of South Africa. Such is the justice of "the good old rule, the good old plan, that they shall take who have the power, and they shall keep who can."
<p>
Until recent decades, nevertheless, socially ruinous envy of this sort was not really powerful in the United States, and did not provoke a powerful political movement for such a restructuring of the economy as would even the scores. During several years of the Great Depression, my parents and my little sister and I lived in an old dwelling near the railway yards at Plymouth, Michigan, my father being a railroad engineman. Our house had no bathroom; its <i>necessarium</i> was an outdoor privy, inconvenient under snow. (We had thought we were buying the house on land contract, but it turned out that the man who pretended to sell the dwelling to us had no proper title to it himself, and so my parents lost their investment and went back to renting; they never did succeed in owning any house, lifelong.) Weekly there arrived in our house the newspaper of the Railway Brotherhoods, entitled <i>Labor.</i> In almost every issue there appeared a cartoon of a literally bloated Capitalist, in evening dress, smoking a bloated cigar; and such exploiters of the working poor were denounced in editorials.
<p>
But these circumstances and publications did not wake envy in my parents. They took it for granted that some people, whether by talent or by inheritance or by mere chance, prosper materially in life, while other people do not; this, they knew, was in the nature of things. They had a subsistence, and kinfolk, and love. The caricatures of the Bloated Capitalist did not rouse my father's wrath; my father did indeed think that the railroads were ill-managed, and that increasing centralization of the economy was to be regretted, and that pride would have a fall on Wall Street, as indeed came to pass; but I never heard my parents utter a word of envy. Things will be as they will be, they took it.
<p>
Blessed are those children reared in a household innocent of the deadly sin of envy. Their lives will not be tormented by a grinding resentment that they are not beautiful, or famous, or favored with the gifts of fortune. They will not demand as a natural right or an entitlement a presumptuous personal equality with everybody under the sun; nor maintain that their opinions are as good as anybody else' s. They will not covet a neighbor's goods. And thus they may come to know peace of soul. They will perceive the wisdom in these lines of a very early poem in Scots vernacular:
<p><i><blockquote>
I saw this written on a wall: <br>In what estate, man, that thou fall <br>Accept thy lot, and thank thy God of all.
</blockquote></i><p>
But I do not mean to imply that every form of equality is the work of envy. The Christian doctrine of equality has worked much moral good. This is the teaching that all souls are equal in the ultimate judgment of God; that God is no respecter of persons. Yet God separates the goats from the sheep; in my Father's house are many mansions, but they are not all on the same floor. God's ultimate judgment is not affected by rank and station, wealth or power, here below. All that matters, in the end, is goodness of heart; so sometimes the last, at the judgment seat, shall be first.
<p>
And the jurisprudential principle of equal justice under law, too, has worked much social good. The law also is no respecter of persons: the king himself is under the law, as Bracton put it in medieval times. Neither in civil nor in criminal cases, declares the system of law which Americans have inherited from Britain, does any class of persons enjoy privileges or immunities. This doctrine keeps the peace; and to keep the peace is the object of all law.
<p>
Whether political equality has worked much good is another matter. In most of the world, attempts at enduring and peaceful democracy have failed. Constitutional democracy of the successful sort has been confined chiefly to English-speaking countries, which have inherited the British historical experience. And even in such countries, who can doubt that democracy, political equality, is in grave trouble nowadays? Is not the United States being converted into a "plebiscitary democracy," with an election of the temporary dictator every four years, actually governed by a centralized bureaucracy nominally under the supervision of a body of squabbling politicians. How much genuine democracy of the sort discerned in America by Tocqueville, what Brownson called "territorial democracy," will remain by the middle of the twenty-first century?-Even today, indeed, how much political equality remains in elections determined chiefly by what candidates have the most money to spend on television broadcasts?
<p>
But political equality is too large and complex a subject for me to discuss today. I turn, therefore to the subject of equality of condition-that is, equality of incomes and other material rewards, equality in education, equality of mores, manners, lodgings, and tastes. It is this envious passion for equality of condition against which Tocqueville warned his time and ours. The total triumph of the doctrine of equality of condition would be a triumph of injustice. Unthinking demands for an equality allegedly just notwithstanding, a society in which everybody should be precisely in the condition of everybody else would be a thoroughly unjust society.
<p>
Zealots throughout the centuries have endeavored to establish communities totally egalitarian; all those endeavors have failed after much suffering. Utopians in the Greek and Roman eras, the Levellers and Diggers of England in the seventeenth century, Babeuf and his fellow conspirators of 1791, and the communist ideologues who held power in the Russian system for seven decades-these are only some of the enthusiasts for equality who for a time established a domination of equality in misery, collapsing soon or late because contrary to human nature. Yet, as Hegel wrote, we learn from history that we learn nothing from history. What failed disastrously in the late Soviet Union, a good many Americans now seek to enact in these United States.
<p>
The instrument of the doctrinaire egalitarian in America is not violent revolution, but employment of taxation-which, as John Marshall declared in the Dartmouth College case, is the power to destroy. A leveller pulls down the more prosperous classes in society through crushing taxation, levied to pay for "entitlements" for an abstraction called The Poor-in effect, to maintain a growing proletariat that contribute nothing much to society except their offspring. Rostovtzeff and other writers on Roman times have drawn the analogy between bread and circuses and the modern dole or "welfare" measures: in the Empire, the emperor with his soldiery united with the Roman mob to extort revenue from the propertied classes-until at last the ancient economy collapsed, and the frontiers could not be defended. Clinton Caesar, eager to placate the Welfare Lobby, proposes to establish new overwhelming "entitlements," particularly medical ones, to be paid for by employers-for of course the wealth of employers is assumed to be inexhaustible. As in the age of Diocletian men fled from public offices, lest they be taxed and regulated to extinction, so by the approaching end of this century employers may be inclined to flee to some other condition of life-but to what?
<p>
The mentality of the American leveller nowadays may be sufficiently suggested by a proposal advanced by some of Clinton's inner circle but not presented to the Congress. This was a new tax: a levy upon persons dwelling in large houses. If the residence should contain rooms which might have been rented, had the owner desired, to paying lodgers (or perhaps non-paying homeless persons)-why, the owner of the dwelling would be taxed for the rooms that might have been occupied by other people. This tax would have been a federal levy, not a local real-property assessment. It is just the sort of tax to have been devised by some former hippie, now a bureaucrat, spiritually akin to President Clinton, former hippie himself. The real purpose of this strange proposal clearly was punitive, meant to punish those wicked rich who possessed spare bedrooms. Make them pay through the nose for such undemocratic private possession of domestic amenities! An Englishman's home once upon a time may have been his castle; but now an American' s home should be his own only upon the sufferance of the Washington bureaucracy. If such a one should lodge homeless persons in his dining room, say, he might be indulged in a partial remission of taxes. One is reminded of housing in Moscow about the year 1919, when the communist regime requisitioned even the lavatories of private residences as night lodging for the underprivileged. Envious egalitarianism as implemented by Clintonian zealots might not be satisfied until the whole population of this land should be lodged in immobilized "mobile homes"-a universal rookery of trailer camps. Why should anybody be indulged in domestic comforts not readily available to all citizens?
<p>
Have I carried to absurdity my argument against equality of condition? Nay, not so; for the enthusiasts for total equality are not to be satisfied with small concessions. I commend to you a dystopia, -a longish short story, by Jacquetta Hawkes, that brilliant Englishwoman of diverse talents, published in her collection <i>Fables</i>-which volume appeared in 1952, during Britain's disagreeable experience with a socialist regime.
<p>
This fable is entitled "The Unites." God, having sensed no impulses from the planet Earth for a long while, dispatches a humble angel to investigate and report to Him. This emissary, who had visited Earth once long, long before, discovers on this later expedition that humankind has suffered a startling change for the worse. No longer, indeed, do men and women call themselves humans: they style themselves "Unites," for all are united in a kind of sub-human state, everybody precisely like everybody else. These degenerate beings live in some 500,000 Life Units dispersed about the globe, and subsist by primitive agriculture. Private property has been abolished altogether. Every Life Unit consists of four standard tenements: the Pink Block for the young, the Green Block for the cultivators, the Red Block for the industrial workers, the Black Block for the administrators and the governments. Kinship and family life have been swept away, as disruptive of social unity. If equality is the whole aim of existence, why should one person outlive another? There must be equality in death as in life. So on attaining the age of sixty-six, the older Unites are herded into the Finis Chamber of the Black Block, suffocated there, and their bodies incinerated. The only amusement in these Life Unit communes is a colossal sort of motor-drome in which some of the performers bloodily perish, to the crowd's satisfaction.
<p>
In short, through the doctrine of equality of condition what once was the human race has transformed itself into a moral condition scarcely distinguishable from that of the beasts which perish. And yet a few true human beings, eager to subvert this life-in-death, have survived somehow in Life Unit 1457. The visiting angel learns that this handful of young people are contriving to bring down the dreary system of equality. Indeed their slogan "Equality must be destroyed" prevails; the stupidity of the egalitarian administrators cannot resist the innovators; and in one Life Unit, at least, inequality is happily triumphant. But even so, the angel detects some ideologue of equality plotting already to bring back equal misery; thus the struggle between the forces of individual achievement and the forces of equality runs on in human societies. There are no lost causes because there are no gained causes.
<p>
Jacquetta Hawkes's fable or parable is set in a distant future; but in the closing decade of this century we move in that egalitarian direction. Equality is demanded in politics and in monetary incomes; more, it is demanded in formal education. My wife, Annette, ten years ago was a member of the Commission on Excellence in Education appointed by President Reagan. She promptly found that many folks in the federal Department of Education, and many educationists in teachers' colleges and teachers' unions, were concerned chiefly for what they called "equity"-that is, equality, sameness, at every level of schooling. Some insisted that American education must have both excellence and equity, a manifest absurdity: for the word "excellence" means to exceed, of course, to do better than others; while "equity," or uniformity, necessarily implies mediocrity. The more equality in schooling, the lower the achievement; and the greater the injustice toward students possessed of some talents. Forty years ago, I resigned a university post in disgust at a deliberate policy of lowering standards in the interest of "equity"-that is accommodating more students who, from stupidity or indolence, ought not to have been admitted to a university at all. In general, American standards for an education allegedly "higher" have declined still more since I departed from the Ivory Tower.
<p>
Egalitarian pressures are exerted in virtually every country to push into the universities most of the rising generation, however dull, bored, or feckless a young person may be. The consequence of this movement is to make the higher learning lower. Avoiding the dullness of most graduate studies in the United States, in 1948 I went abroad for my higher learning-to St. Andrews University, still -somewhat medieval in appearance, the oldest of Scottish universities, situated in a charming medieval town. Nowadays St. Andrews is under political pressure to change its character by admitting many more students, which would destroy the tradition of learning there by the North Sea. For what reason? Why, to "give everybody his chance." Perhaps we ought to confer the doctorate upon every infant at birth, and reserve the universities for people really interested in right reason and imagination, so eliminating degree-snobbery and degree-envy. The present disorders of the intellect on most campuses result from the combination of ideologue egalitarians among the professors with ignorant -and bored students.
<p>
Permit me to suggest some probable long-run consequences of national infatuation with equality of condition.
<p>
First, great injury to the leading class that every society requires for its success. This leading class is not identical with sociological "elites"; to ascertain the distinction, read T. S. Eliot's slim book <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture.</i> This leading class, even in the American democracy, is made up of public-spirited men and women of property; well-educated professional folk, lawyers among them; honest politicians who take long views; publishers and writers who help to shape public opinion on a diversity of matters; the clergy; persons experienced in military affairs, foreign affairs, and the arts of political administration; local leaders in charitable and civic concerns; those people of industry and commerce who know that there is more to life than getting and spending. I am even willing to acknowledge among this leading class some of the better professors of arts and sciences-although Nietzsche reminds us that in politics the professor always plays the comic role.
<p>
The authority of this class of persons in America has been declining in recent decades, from a variety of causes; and the decay in public and private morality, the decadence of education, the shallow populist tone of our politics, and a number of other afflictions result in considerable part from that decline of authority. Now a renewed demand for levelling assails this leading class. For one thing, it was possible for members of this leading class to take part in public and charitable concerns, and to set the whole tone of life in their communities, because most of them possessed some private means; they were not daily money-grubbing. Increasingly this class is being pushed to the wall by heavy-nay, savage-taxation. Most people here will have noticed how in the past few years various deductions and exemptions have been eliminated from income-tax returns, particularly for persons with incomes exceeding $100,000; for such folk, medical deductions from income are a thing of the past. Now the Clinton Administration imposes new burdens, falling principally upon the class I have just been describing. Many will pay more than half their incomes in taxes- federal and state income taxes, real-property taxes, sales taxes, and the rest. What margin will remain for such people to exercise the functions of voluntary leadership?
<p>
The late Michael Harrington, a few years past, was addressing a crowd of poor people. He said that too many affluent people were paying less than half their incomes in income tax. He was surprised by the reaction of his audience. They were indignant at Harrington's proposal that the state should take more than half a man's income, however large that income. "That's just not fair." some of them cried. His audience was right and Harrington wrong. And perhaps some in his audience perceived, better than did Harrington, what would happen to a society-including persons of very modest incomes-in which the Leviathan state should kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
<p>
Already many of you here today, and for that matter your servant, are paying more than half their incomes in taxation. Our time occupied in trying to make ends meet, how much leadership shall we be able to offer? More and more, in such circumstances, the remnant of authority and the power of decision-making are usurped by a centralized bureaucracy-and in the name of "democracy."
<p>
Second, an obsession with equality commonly results in general impoverishment, by diminishing saving and capital accumulation, and by "humanitarian" welfare measures that diminish the incentive to work for one's own subsistence. Egalitarian "entitlements" already have so increased the national debt that, as matters are drifting, the amount of interest on the national debt, annually, will come to exceed the total federal revenues collected by the present tax structure!
<p>
Decreased economic productivity, caused by a virtual oppression of industry and commerce, will afflict the poor worst of all-even though the mistaken policies of government were undertaken in the name of equality of condition for the alleged poor.
<p>
A third consequence of deliberate levelling in society would be grave intellectual damage, already in progress. Over the centuries there was developed in all civilized countries an elaborate edifice of schooling, originally religious in character, meant to impart some measure of wisdom and virtue to the rising generation. Aristotle instructs us that the process of learning cannot be made easy. The higher learning is concerned necessarily with abstractions, in large part; but the common man tends to dislike abstractions. As T. S. Eliot said once, there ought to be many different kinds of education for many different kinds of people; but the egalitarian zealot would enforce uniformity of schooling, perhaps of the "outcomes education" sort to produce conditioned responses, now being pushed in Virginia, Michigan, and other states.
<p>
The black-militant outcry against the study of the works of "dead white males" suggests what a thoroughly egalitarian system of schooling would discard. Thought always is painful; so let us get on with the rap sessions.
<p>
Those intellectual disciplines that nurture right reason and moral imagination, requiring real thought, are unpopular with the egalitarian, who regards them as archaic and snobbish. The egalitarian much prefers utilitarian schooling and vague "social studies." But both private wisdom and public order require that a substantial number of people be well acquainted with genuine works of the mind. The natural sciences, humane studies, and the philosophical habit of mind neglected, the person and the republic sink into ignorance and apathy; but the egalitarian zealot does not perceive these ruinous consequences until the decline no longer can be arrested. The condition of most of our public schools today, and the inferior performance of most colleges and universities by contrast with their work half a century ago, ought to suggest to us how far, as a people, we already have slipped down the slope toward intellectual failure. What I say of American education is quite as true of British education nowadays, and, with few exceptions of Europe generally. But the educational egalitarian is not deterred-not quite yet: so long as "everybody has equal opportunity" to spend four or five years in an educational establishment professedly higher, social justice has been achieved, he fancies.
<p>
In short, ladies and gentlemen, I have been arguing that it is profoundly unjust to endeavor to transform society into a tableland of equality. It would be unjust to the energetic, reduced to equality with the slack and indolent; it would be unjust to the imaginative, compelled to share the schooling and the tastes of the dull; it would be unjust to the thrifty, compelled to make up for the losses of the profligate; it would be unjust to those who take long views, forced to submit to the domination of a majority interested chiefly in short-run results.
<p>
But I shall not labor this point, already made forcefully by Alexis de Tocqueville and other writers whose talents exceed my. own. The egalitarian society, far from satisfying desires for "social justice," would be unjust to the very people who made possible a tolerably orderly and prosperous society. Eric Voegelin remarks that the tolerably just society is one in which the more aspiring natures are free to exercise their talents, but the large majority of people, who desire merely a quiet life,-are secured against oppression by the aspiring natures. Mediocre necessarily, the egalitarian society would discourage or suppress enterprising talents-which would result in social stagnation. Life in a social tableland of equality would be infinitely boring.
<p>
Yet don't I believe in equality of <i>opportunity?</i> No, friends, I do not. The thing is not possible. First of all, genetic differences cannot be surmounted between individual and individual; Thomas Jefferson and the whole school of "created free and equal" knew nothing whatsoever of human genetics, a science of the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Second, opportunity depends greatly upon family background and nurturing; and unless it is proposed to sweep away the family altogether, as in Jacquetta Hawkes's fable, the rising generation of one stock will differ greatly in opportunity from the rising generation of a different family. For instance, I read every evening to my four little daughters, or told them stories; while my neighbors did not so instruct and converse with their children; accordingly, my children have enjoyed superior opportunities in life. It would be outrageously unjust to try somehow to wipe out these advantages of genetic inheritance or familial instruction.
<p>
Inequality is the natural condition of human beings; charity may assist those not favored by nature; but attempts to impose an artificial equality of condition and intellect, although in the long run they fail, meanwhile can work great mischief in any society, and-still worse-damage human nature itself.

<P>
Leviathan is a Hebrew word signifying "that which gathers itself in folds." In the Old Testament, Leviathan is the great sea-beast: "Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?" In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes-whom T.S. Eliot calls "that presumptuous little upstart"- made Leviathan the symbol of the state, or rather of mass-society, composed of innumerable little atomic individual human beings.
<p>
Today I am concerned not with Hobbes, but with Donald Davidson and his book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>. In 1938, long before the administration of Lyndon Johnson popularized the slogan "The Great Society," Davidson wrote that his Leviathan is "the idea of the Great Society, organized under a single, complex, but strong and highly centralized national government, motivated ultimately by men's desire for economic welfare of a specific kind rather than their desire for personal liberty." Four decades later, Leviathan looms larger than ever.
<p>
The southern states that once formed the Confederacy have been the most conservative region of America, it is generally agreed. Once upon a time, Richard Weaver told me that Middle Tennessee is the most southern part of the South. There in Middle Tennessee, near the town of Pulaski, in 1893, Donald Davidson was born. Surely Davidson was the most redoubtably conservative of those able American men of letters who have been called the Southern Agrarians. As poet, as critic, as historian, and as political thinker, Davidson was a stalwart defender of America's permanent things during an era of radical change.
<p>
<b>Scourging the Centralizers.</b> I propose to discuss with you Donald Davidson as the latter-day champion of the South's political and social inheritance. Ever since the forming of the Union in 1787, the dominant political tendency in the southern states has been resistance to the centralizing of power. Far more than any other region, the South has set its face against Leviathan-that is, against the swelling omnipotent nation-state, what Tocqueville called "democratic despotism," the political collectivity that reduces men and women to social atoms. In his strong book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>, published in 1938, Davidson scourged the centralizers- and that at a time when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was doing much as he liked with the United States of America.
<p>
Permit me first to say something about Davidson and his writings; and then to discuss the social principles for which the Southern Agrarians and their allies stood.
<p>
Browsing in the library at Michigan State College, in 1938, an earnest sophomore, I happened upon a new book, published by the University of North Carolina Press, entitled <i>The Attack on Leviathan,</I> subtitled <i>Regionalism and Nationalism in the United States.</i> It was written eloquently, and for me it made coherent the misgivings I had felt concerning the political notions popular in the 1930s. The book was so good that I assumed all intelligent
<p>
Americans, or almost all, were reading it. Actually, as I learned years later, the University of North Carolina Press pulped the book's sheets after only a few hundred copies had been sold: clearly an act of discrimination against conservative views. I had a hand in the reprinting of the book by another firm in 1963; and now I aspire to bring out a third printing in the Library of Conservative Thought, which I edit for Transaction Books.
<p>
Opinion Shapers. Professor Davidson rowed against the tide of opinion among America's intellectuals in 1938. Centralizing nationalism, he argued, is of necessity tyrannical and enslaving. For a specimen of his method and style, take this passage from his chapter on American literature. He has been criticizing Emerson, and he finds that the opinion shapers of New York and Boston during the 1930s are Emerson's heirs:
<p><blockquote>
In our own time, the metropolitan critics are making national prescriptions that are equally partial, though somewhat more confused. In one sentence they assure us that the industrial unification of America is desirable and inevitable; but in the next sentence they declare that the civilization thus produced puts upon us an intolerable spiritual bondage from which the artist cannot escape save through the shibboleths of Marxism and Freudianism. Wearily, they proclaim that America is standardized; but angrily they scorn the rural backwardness of regions that prove to be, after all, less urban than New York. Confidently they announce that America must be industrialized; but they sneer at Mr. Babbitt of the Middle West, the creature of industrialism. They urge the provinces to adopt the intellectual sophistication of the Eastern metropolis; but among themselves they bewail the poverty of the modern temper, which in its sophistication has left them nothing to enjoy.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Now could one write, in this year of 1989, a better description of the mentality of such American intellectuals? One might substitute, of course, the phrase "the industrial unification of the world" for that of America; for nowadays the whole of the world must be subjected to those environmental mischiefs and social discontents that already have worked immense harm in the "developed countries."
<p>
<b>Sword of Imagination.</b> Davidson was bold enough to defend the agricultural economy against industrial aggrandizement. (Parenthetically, it seems worth remarking that in recent years the dollar volume of agricultural produce in the industrial state of Michigan has exceeded the dollar volume of manufactured products.) Bolder still, he took up the cause of his own region, the South, against the nationalizers of New York and Washington. He appreciated, too, other American regions: New England, the Great Plains, the Lake States, the Pacific coast. But it was the South which required the service of Davidson's sword of imagination.
<p>
"Can principles enunciated as Southern principles, of whatever cast, get a hearing?" he inquired in <i>The Attack on Leviathan.</I>
<p><blockquote>
...It seems to be a rule that the more special the program and the more remote it is from Southern principles, the greater the likelihood of its being discussed and promulgated. Southerners who wish to engage in public discussion in terms that do not happen to be of common report in the New York newspapers are likely to be met, at the levels where one would least expect it, with the tactics of distortion, abuse, polite tut-tutting, angry discrimination and so on down to the baser devices of journalistic lynching which compose the modern propagandist's stock in trade. This is an easy and comparatively certain means of discrediting an opponent and of thus denying him a hearing. It is also a fatal means. For if such approaches to public questions are encouraged and condoned, then confusion has done its work well, the days of free and open discussion of ideas is over in the South, only matters of crass expediency can come into the public forum at all, and we face the miserable prospect of becoming the most inert and passive section of the United States, or else of falling into blind and violent divisions whose pent-up forces will hurl us at each other's throats. Then will Jefferson's prophetic vision come true. We shall take to eating one another, as they do in Europe.
</blockquote>
<p>
Such matters have not much improved since Davidson wrote those sentences, half a century past: the South continues to be treated by Congress as if it were a subject province (in voter registration especially), and the New York newspapers remain ungenerous.
<p>
<b>Urban Symbol.</b> New York City was to Donald Davidson the abomination of desolation. He and his wife spent their summers at Middlebury College in Vermont; and Davidson took extraordinary pains to avoid passing through New York City en route. For that matter, he detested sprawling modern cities generally, Nashville included, though he found it necessary to reside most of his life in the neighborhood of Vanderbilt University. To his volume of poems <i>The Tall Men</i> (published in 1927) Davidson had a prologue, She Long Street," the antithesis of the rural Tennessee of yesteryear, that land of heroes. That Long Street-I think of devastated Woodward Avenue in Detroit- is the symbol of a dehumanized urban industrial culture:
<p><blockquote>

The grass cannot remember; trees cannot <br>
Remember what once was here. But even so, <br>
They too are here no longer. Where is the grass? <br>
Only the blind stone roots of the dull street <br>
And the steel thews of houses flourish here <br>
And the baked curve of asphalt, smooth, trodden <br>
Covers dead earth that once was quick with grass, <br>
Snuffing the ground with acrid breath the motors <br>
Fret the long street. Steel answers steel. Dust whirls. <br>
Skulls hurry past with the pale flesh yet clinging <br>
And a little hair. <br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Thirty-five years later, Davidson published another volume of verse, to which he transferred the title <i>The Long Street.</i> In his poem "Old Sailor's Choice" he describes Ulysses's voyage to hell and beyond. Contrary to the counsels of a modern Circe, Ulysses chooses Charybdis over Scylla, though modern men lust for Scylla's deadly embrace, "the monstrous lips, the darting neck of their love-death." Davidson describes the ensnaring monster Scylla, a very modern horror:
<p><blockquote>
Within her cliffs of sheer synthetic rock<br>
She glides on steely pathways. Plastic walls<br>
Checkered in pseudo-marble cavern her lair.<br>
These throw you off guard. "How," you ask,<br>
 Can anything go wrong where all is right- <br>
Rectangular, side-ruled, and functional? <br>
Mercy, pity, peace can be manufactured. <br>
Scylla can end your pain <br>
Now that the State decrees a tax increase <br>
And no one can complain. <br>
The neat-cut stencil echoes the brisk type. <br>
Machines do the rest. The postage is metered. <br>
And there is your release: <br>
Well-packaged, mercy, pity, peace. <br>
And I saw the stretching neck and the grinning teeth <br>
In the soundproof room where artificial daylight <br>
Blacks out the scudding clouds and the churning storm-wrack <br>
And the secretary with half-naked breasts <br>
Extends the telephone on a crimson claw <br>
And murmurs Washington is calling! <br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Washington did not call Donald Davidson, who was a guardian of the permanent things, which perish on the pavements of the Long Street. The Scylla of "Old Sailor's Choice" is the enormous welfare state, which devours the spirit.
<p>
Poetic Works of Politics. We return to Davidson's prose. Politics, I never tire of repeating, is the art of the possible-and the preoccupation of the quarter-educated. That is, politics ranks low in order of precedence of the works of the mind, if one refers simply to defecated political theory and practice, cut off from revelation and right reason and imagination. But Professor Davidson never divorced politics from religion or imaginative literature or tradition. He knew that the greatest works of politics are poetic. In his later collection of essays entitled <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees</i> (1957), he writes about the dissociation of the poet from society, now
<p><blockquote>

...painfully apparent as society has accepted the dominance of science and consequently has become indisposed to accept poetry as truth.... In this phase of operations the poet may well become an outright traditionalist in religion, politics, and economics. He examines the defects of modern civilization. He develops a sense of catastrophe. With an insight far more accurate than the forecasts of professional social philosophers, he begins to plot the lines of stress and strain along which disaster will erupt. He predicts the ruin of modern secularized society and makes offers of salvation. These are unheard of or unheeded. Then upon the deaf ears and faceless bodies of modern society he invokes the poet's curse.
</blockquote>
<p>
Eliot's poetic curse was that famous fatal dismissal, "This is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but a whimper." Davidson, fiercely though he reproached a sensate age, was not quite ready to pronounce a curse upon his time . Tradition still might reassert its old power. Take this passage from his essay "Futurism and Archaism in Toynbee and Hardy" contained in <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees:</i>
<p><blockquote>

'You cannot turn the clock back!' is the commonest taunt of our day. It always emerges as the clinching argument that any modernist offers any traditionalist when the question is: 'What shall we do now?' But it
 is not really an argument. It is a taunt intended to discredit the traditionalist by stigmatizing him a traitor to an idea of progress that is assumed as utterly valid and generally accepted. The aim is, furthermore, to poison the traditionalist's own mind and disturb his self-confidence by the insinuation that he is a laggard in the world's great procession. His faith in an established good is made to seem nostalgic devotion to a mere phantom of the buried past. His opposition to the new-no matter how ill-advised, inartistic, destructive, or immoral that new may be-is defined as a quixotic defiance of the Inevitable. To use a term invented by Arnold J. Toynbee, he is an Archaist. By definition, he is therefore doomed.
</blockquote>
<p>
To abide by Tradition is not to fall into Archaism, Davidson told the rising generation. As for turning back the clock-why, as Davidson puts it, "Neither can you turn the clock forward, for Time is beyond human control." When a Futurist uses this clock metaphor, we perceive an unconscious revelation of his weakness. He wishes to imply that his design, and his only, is perfectly in step with some scientific master cloak of cause and effect that deter nines the progress of human events. This implication has no basis in reality, since the Futurist actually means to break off all connection with the historical process of cause and effect and to substitute for it an imagined, ideal process of quasi-scientific future development which is nothing more than a sociological version of Darwinism.
<p>
<b>Gifted and Versatile.</b> Such was the conservative mind of Donald Davidson. If I have made him seem somewhat abstract-why, that has been my blunder. He was remarkably versatile: a collector of folk ballads, a gifted lecturer, a writer of librettos, an historian, even from time to time active in the troubled politics of Tennessee. He was all too well aware of the huge blunders in public policy during the 20th century. If one turns to the second volume of his history of the Tennessee River, one finds three chapters accurately exposing the failures of that enormous undertaking, so ardently commended by the liberal press and most Tennessee politicians-yet so founded upon economic and social fallacies.
<p>
In person, Davidson was a lean and austere gentleman who smiled rarely; his conversation, nevertheless, was lively, and he was a kindly host. He had been a courageous soldier. To the end he lived with dignity, lamenting the destruction of dignity within universities. Once I walked with him on the campus at Vanderbilt; he told me of how most of the trees there had been felled not long before to make space for more automobiles. This was bad enough; but to make his indignation perfect, grim rows of parking meters had been installed. A militant survivor from what he called "the old regime," Davidson spoke contemptuously of his university's administrators. Students venerated him. He wrote to me on August 31,1954: "Living in Nashville and teaching at Vanderbilt University is very hard on a Southern Agrarian, I can assure you. It is, in fact, nothing but warfare, and we can't survive very long without some place to lick our wounds for a while." (He wrote this from Ripton, Vermont, where the Davidsons spent their summers at the Breadloaf School.)
<p>
<b>Neglected Agrarians. </b>Vanderbilt's administration disparaged the Agrarians and, in effect, would not accept Davidson's or AllenTate's papers as gifts. For that matter, the literate South generally neglected those Agrarians, the most illustrious of southern sons, in their own time. Only when New York paid attention to Tate, Warren, Ransom, Lytle, and others did the South prick up its ears. As that 17th-century "Person of No Quality" put it,
<p><blockquote>

Seven cities now contend for Homer dead,<br>
Through which the living Homer begged his bread.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
I fear I have given you, ladies and gentlemen, only a fragmentary summary of Donald Davidson's social thought. But now I pass to some remarks on the Southern Agrarians generally-one of them, Mr. Andrew Lytle, will spend some days at a seminar in my house, next month, so the breed is still quick-and to the pressing question of what to do about Leviathan.
<p>
Nearly sixty years ago, when I was a fourth-grader in the very northern town of Plymouth, Michigan, twelve southerners published a book entitled <i>I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition. </I> That slim volume, a heartfelt defense of the permanent things in the South's culture, has been discussed ever since; a literature of assent or of disapproval has developed about it. Young men and women who come to study with me in my northern fastness discover this literature-even without my having commented on any of it-and read-the books, night upon night, even to the witching hour of three.
<p>
Christian humanism, stern criticism of the industrial mass society, detestation of communism and other forms of collectivism, attachment to the ways of the Old South, in valor and in manners- these were the principles joining the twelve Southern Agrarians who took their stand in Dixieland in 1930. Their twelve essays were approved by T.S. Eliot and some other reflective people at the time the book was published; yet for the most part the Agrarians met with hostility and ridicule. Today their book sometimes meets with understanding, for we are farther down the track to Avernus.
<p>
<b>Reminder and Challenge.</b> As Louis Rubin says of the Twelve Southerners, <i>In Take My Stand</i> "is the rebuke to materialism, a corrective to the worship of Progress, and a reaffirmation of man's aesthetic and spiritual needs. And because the South has come so late into the industrial world, it appeals to the hungering memory within the Southerner's mind of the tranquil and leisurely Southern life that existed before the machines and superhighways came. As such the book constitutes both a reminder and a challenge. What are you losing that you once possessed? Are you sure that you want to discard it entirely?"
<p>
Despite the considerable attention paid nationally to these Agrarian writers, it was not easy for them to find publishers; or, if their writings should be published, to keep them in print. Yet they persisted; and in the long run their high talents as men of letters gave them for some years, about the period of my college days, ascendancy over the realm of letters, even in Manhattan-a mild domination that endured until recent years, when it was overthrown by the squalid oligarchs of the <i>New York Review of Books.</i> (Even here the South has made a successful counterattack, most conspicuously in the homage paid to Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy.) As a group, the Agrarians illustrated well the remark made by Lionel Trilling in 1950 that the 20th century writers possessing imagination were not liberals-distinctly not.
<p>
<b>Demolished and Uglifiled.</b> The Twelve Southerners, Donald Davidson among them, knew that the South would change. As Stark Young put it in his essay "Not in Memoriam, But in Defense," which concluded their book "That a change is now in course all over the South is plain; and it is as plain that the South changing must be the South still, remembering that for no thing can there be any completeness that is outside its own nature, and no thing for which there is any advance save in its own kind. If this were not so, all nature by now would have dissolved in chaos and folly, nothing in it...."
<p>
Yet the South's pace of change has been more rapid, these six decades past, and more overwhelming, than even the gloomiest of the Twelve Southerners expected. Old Nashville, the domicile of the Fugitives and the Agrarians, has been thoroughly demolished and uglified, Strickland's capitol on its hill besieged by the haughty office towers of state and federal bureaucracies and of teachers' unions. Much else, in Nashville and nearly all the South, has gone by the board-among those losses, the disappearance of Southern architectural styles.
<p>
Along with the dwindling of a distinctive Dixie has come relative economic prosperity. It is factory-town prosperity. The rural pattern of existence, which the Agrarians praised, still endures here and there south of Mason's and Dixon's Line, but it has been brutally buffeted during the past sixty years.
<p>
Of the Twelve Southerners, two-Andrew Lytle and Robert Penn Warren-still are here in the land of the living. Modernity has been doing its worst to wipe out Southerners of their sort, in part by sweeping away-in the South and elsewhere-the sort of schooling that men like Davidson and Lytle and Warren profited by. And the welfare state has striven to efface, as impoverished and culturally deprived, the old rural pattern of the South-or, for that matter, of Northern rural counties like that I inhabit-which endured little altered until the building of the "good roads."
<p>
Tide what may betide, the Southern Agrarians will loom large in histories of American thought and -letters. With liberalism in America now nearly mindless, some of the rising generation in this land are finding in Donald Davidson's prose and verse, and in the writings of other Agrarians, an understanding of personal and social order far removed from desiccated liberal attitudes.
<p>
Six decades after Donald Davidson, Andrew Lytle, Lyle Lanier, Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom, Frank Owsley, John Gould Fletcher, H.C. Nixon, Robert Penn Warren, John Donald Wade, Henry Blue Kline, and Stark Young took up arms against Leviathan, how goes the fight?
<p>
Like the Celts of the Twilight, it seems, the Agrarians have gone forth often to battle, but never to victory. America's farmers now total perhaps 5 percent of the national population. The South has been subjugated a second time by the federal government, and endures a second political Reconstruction-although this time the southern economy is far from ruined. Centralization of power in Washington was carried much farther by Lyndon Johnson than ever it had been by Franklin Roosevelt; states still nominally sovereign are reduced to a condition little better than that of provinces. The nationwide television broadcasters are rapidly effacing any remnants of regional cultures. The public educational establishment exhorts its teachers and its charges to sing "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" rather than "Dixie." In many other ways, Leviathan looms far vaster than the monster was in 1930.
<p>
<b>Swallowed by Leviathan.</b> And yet the predictions of the Twelve Southerners like those of Cassandra, are being fulfilled. Our great cities, a hundred Long Streets, are nearly ruined, ravaged by crime, their population corrupted or endangered by deadly narcotics, all community destroyed. Our boasted affluence is given the lie by the swift and sinister growth of a genuine proletariat, voracious and unruly, subsisting at public expense. Our layers of governmental bureaucracy are increasingly inefficient and vexatious. Our legislatures, national and state, seem willing to yield to every demand of a pressure group, regardless of the true public interest. Our judges, or many of them, have turned demagogues. Our air is polluted badly, our countryside uglified, public taste corrupted. Our children are brought up indulgently on images of terrible violence and gross sexuality. Schooling at every level is reduced to child care, adolescent sitting, and collegiate mating: humane letters and history are contemned. While we talk windily still of free enterprise, the industrial and commercial conglomerates move toward oligopoly on a tremendous scale. Religious belief and observance have been first reduced to the ethos of sociability, and then to ignorant discourses on revolution. Leviathan, the monstrous society, has swallowed his myriads. What hope for the person and the republic?
<p>
Certain sanguine neoconservatives inform us that America in this year of our Lord 1989 is virtually an earthly paradise of democratic capitalism. This sensate, materialistic, bored, trivial, and often perverse culture of ours today, the summit of human striving? What an absurd contention! But then, most neoconservatives are liberals thinly veiled. Leviathan does not need to pursue such people: they swim eagerly into his maw. The patronage empire of the great "charitable" foundations, by the way, is yet another manifestation of Leviathan.
<p>
<b>Salute to the Southerners.</b> So I do commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the genuine conservatism of the Twelve Southerners. It is not the only mode of conservative thought, but it is an important mode. The authors of I'll Take My Stand did not propound a rigorous ideology or display a model of Utopia: their principal purpose it was to open our eyes to the illusions of Modernism. The Southern Agrarians proclaimed when I was a child that the southern culture is worth defending; that society is something more than the gross national product; that the country lane is healthier than the Long Street; that more wisdom lies in Tradition than in Scientism; that Leviathan is a devourer, not a savior. Your servant, a northerner of northerners, salutes those Twelve Southerners, some quick, some dead. Study what they have written, and you will discover that they are no mere Archaists.
<p>
"Worn out with abstraction and novelty, plagued with divided counsels, some Americans have said: I will believe the old folks at home, who have kept alive through many treacherous outmodings some good secret of life." So Donald Davidson writes in his chapter "The Diversity of America." He continues, "Such moderns prefer to grasp the particular. They want something to engage both their reason and their love. They distrust the advice of John Dewey to 'use the foresight of the future to refine and expand present activities.' The future is not yet; it is unknowable, intangible. But the past was, the present is; of that much they can be sure. So they attach themselves-or re-attach themselves-to a home-section, one of the sections, great or small, defined in the long conquest of our continental area. They seek spiritual and cultural autonomy....They are learning how to meet the subtlest and most dangerous foe of humanity-the tyranny that wears the mask of humanitarianism and benevolence. They are attacking Leviathan."
<p>
Amen to that, Donald Davidson, my old friend, now passed into eternity. Ladies and gentlemen, go forth and do likewise: strike a blow against Leviathan, the monster of the mass-age.

<P>
With some trepidation I commence my remarks on this large subject, the lot of educational reformers being hard. In 1953, Professor Arthur Bestor published a book entitled <i>Educational Wastelands: The Retreat from Learning in Our Public Schools.</i> There survives a Jewish tradition that all the Prophets were stoned to death or otherwise slain by the People. From 1953 onward, the Educationists belabored Dr. Bestor with epithets, until he departed from this world. And the Educationists' retreat from learning has continued with few impediments.
<p>
In my preceding lecture of this series about Prospects for Conservatives, entitled "Prospects Abroad," I ventured to suggest the possibility of an Augustan Age for the United States and for the twenty-first-century world-supposing we Americans do not endeavor to impose our ways upon all the peoples of the earth. But in discussing American education, I cannot be so sanguine.
<p>
Marxist educational notions and methods have been exposed as grim fallacies-except in these United States, perhaps. Yet what are we to say of present American educational notions and methods? Ever since the publishing of the report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education, "A Nation at Risk," seven years ago, a great deal of talk about education, and scribbling about it, have occurred. As for any evidences of general improvement, however-why, one does not discover them easily.
<p>
The United States now is the great power in the world. Nevertheless, who can praise an educational system that turns out young people marvelously ignorant-except for a very small minority-of history, geography, and foreign languages, and so, unfitted to have much of anything to do with concerns larger than those of their own neighborhood? Worse still, what future have a people whose schooling has enabled them, at best, to ascertain the price of everything-but the value of nothing? We Americans stand today politically dominant, intellectually enfeebled. Conservatives have before them a complex work of intellectual restoration.
<p>
<b>Plight and Possibilities.</b> Nowadays nearly everybody-except for the National Education Association's bosses and affiliates, and the professors at most schools of education- confesses that something is badly wrong with learning in America. While we linger in a mood of remorse and recrimination, opportunity exists for genuine reform. Permit me to address you first, and basically, on the plight and possibilities of the higher learning.
<p>
For half a century, our higher education has been sinking lower. Nobody is more painfully aware of this decay than is the conscientious professor of some experience, and nobody suffers more from it than does the perceptive undergraduate. America's higher learning lies in a state of decadence. But eras of decadence sometimes are succeeded by eras of renewal. It is all a matter of will, reason, and imagination. As Samuel Johnson put it, "Why, sir, we <i>know</i> the will is free; and there's an end to it."
<p>
<b>Higher Education's Mission.</b> Conceivably we Americans, after decades of blundering and incertitude, may be entering upon an American Augustan Age. For successful healing, candid diagnosis is required. The people of the United States now spend annually upon higher education more money, probably, than did all the nations of the world combined, probably, from the foundation of the ancient universities down to the beginning of World War II. Yet there prevails a widespread discontent at the results produced by this costly endeavor. Surely it is time for us conservatives to examine afresh the mission of the higher education.
<p>
The primary end of the higher learning, in all lands and all times, has been what John Henry Newman called the training of the intellect to form a philosophical habit of mind. College and university were founded to develop right reason and imagination, for the sake of the person and of the republic. By its nature, the higher education is concerned with abstractions-rather difficult abstractions, both in the sciences and in humane studies. In any age, most people are not fond of abstractions. In this democratic milieu, therefore, higher education stands in danger everywhere from leveling pressures.
<p>
In Britain, a very few years ago, the member of the opposition party who had been designated minister of education in a prospective Labour government denounced Oxford and Cambridge universities as "cancers." Presumably he would have converted those ancient institutions, if given his way, into something like the Swedish "people's universities" -that is, lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away. Every man and woman an intellectual king or queen, with an Oxbridge degree. The trouble with this aspiration is that those kings and queens would be intellectually impoverished-and presumably Britain generally would be impoverished in more ways than one.
<p>
Recently we have heard similar voices in the graduate schools of Harvard. Why discriminate against indolence and stupidity? Why not let everybody graduate, regardless of performance in studies? Would not that be the democratic way? If young people do not care for abstractions, and manifest a positive aversion to developing a philosophical habit of mind, why not give them what they think they would like: that is, the superficial counter-culture?
<p>
<b>Lowering of Standards.</b> The educational degradation of the democratic dogma already has prevailed, with few exceptions, throughout the western world: it has gone far in France and Italy. In the United States, ever since World War II, the lowering of standards for admission and for graduation, the notorious disgrace of "grade inflation," and the loss of order and integration in curricula, are too widely known and regretted for me to need to labor these afflictions here. Some cold comfort may be found in the fact that we have not sinned more greatly than have other nations of the West-somewhat less, indeed.
<p>
Here and there, some signs of renewal in higher education may be discerned; certainly we hear much pother about it. But it remains to be determined whether it is possible to restore or improve the true higher learning, what with powerful political and economic pressures against improvement. Being somewhat gloomy by conviction, yet sanguine by temperament, I may mutter to myself, "Say not the struggle naught availeth!"
<p>
Why are this lowering of standards and this loss of intellectual coherence ruinous to higher education? Because the higher learning is intended to develop, primarily, a philosophical habit of mind. The genuine higher education is not meant, really, to "create jobs" or to train technicians. Incidentally, the higher education does tend to have such results, too; but only as by-products. We stand in danger of forgetting, during our pursuit of the incidentals, the fundamental aims of learning.
<p>
Why were colleges and universities established, and what remains their most valuable function? To discipline the mind; to give men and women long views and to instill in them the virtue of prudence; to present a coherent body of ordered knowledge, in several great fields; to pursue that knowledge for its own sake; to help the rising generation to make its way toward wisdom and virtue. The college is an instrument to teach that truth is better than falsehood, and wisdom better than ignorance. Of course the college has done other things as well, some of them mildly baneful-such as serving as an instrument of social snobbery. But I am speaking still of the college's fundamental mission.
<p>
The college is intended to confer two sorts of  benefits. The first sort of benefit is the improvement of the human person, for the individual's own sake: opening the way to some wisdom to young men and women, that there may be something in their lives besides getting and spending.
<p>
<b>Essential to Society.</b> The second kind of benefit is the preservation and advancement of society, by developing a body or class of young people who will be leaders in many walks of life: scientists, clergymen, political officials or representative officers, physicians, lawyers, teachers, industrialists, managers, and all the re! t. The college is a means to help to form intellects, assure their competence, and (a point often forgotten today) to help to form their characters. Here I am not speaking of an elite, for I share T.S. Eliot's conviction that a deliberately-cultivated series of elites would tend toward narrowness and arrogance. Rather, I refer to a fairly broad and numerous class of tolerably educated men and women who would leaven the lump of society in a wide variety of ways. Most of them never would be famous, or powerful on a large scale; but they form that body of well-schooled people essential to any modern society, and especially important to a democratic society.
<p>
Now a higher schooling merely technological and skill-oriented-what once would have been called a mechanical education, as opposed to a liberal education-can neither impart wisdom to the person nor supply intellectual and moral leadership to the republic. I do not object to learning a trade-far from it. But a trade is best learnt through apprenticeship, internship, on-the-job training, or technical schools. Except for the learned professions, learning a trade is ill suited to a college campus. If we convert higher education into technical training merely, we may find ourselves living in what Irving Babbitt called "a devil's sabbath of whirling machinery." For if the philosophical habit of mind is developed nowhere, "the center cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."
<p>
Let me descend to particulars. The biggest fad in education today is the movement styled the Information Revolution. An extensive jargon is developing to serve this revolution's uses. The revolution is supposed to usher in an Informational Society; we even are told that this Informational Society will supplant the Knowledge Society. One of the grave faults of American schooling at every level is the eagerness to embrace the newest gadget- mechanical or intellectual-at the expense of the tested tools of learning. The apologists for television used to tell us that their darling has molded the minds of "the best informed generation in the history of America." Also, if we are to believe the report "A Nation at Risk," it has molded the minds of the most ignorant generation in America. For information is not knowledge; and knowledge is not wisdom. This is movingly expressed by T.S. Eliot in some lines of his choruses for <i>The Rock:</i>
<p><blockquote>
The endless cycle of idea and action,<br> Endless invention, endless experiment,<br> Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness; <br>Knowledge of speech, but not of silence; <br>Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word. <br>All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance, <br>All our ignorance brings us nearer to death, <br>But nearness to death no nearer to God. <br>Where is the Life we have lost in living? <br>Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? <br>Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? <br>The cycles of Heaven in twenty centuries <br>Bring us farther from God and nearer to the Dust.<br>
</blockquote><p>
Aye, where is the knowledge we have lost in information, not to mention the wisdom? What college and university used to endeavor to impart was not miscellaneous information, a random accumulation of facts, but instead an integrated and ordered body of knowledge that would develop the philosophical habit of mind-from which cast of mind one might find the way to wisdom of many sorts.
<p>
Doubtless the prevalence of computers may confer upon us various material benefits. But so far as genuine education goes, the computer and its Informational Society may amount to a blight. They seem calculated to enfeeble the individual reason and to make most of us dependent upon an elite of computer programmers-at the higher lever of the Informational Society, I mean; they may develop into vigorous enemies of the philosophical habit of mind.
<p>
<b>Technological Flotsam.</b> One thing to remember, then, in discussing what higher education should do for people in the dawning years, is that waves of technological! innovation commonly carry on their crests a mass of flotsam. Such a disagreeable mass was flung upon the beaches of academe by the ideological tempests of the 1960s and 1970s. At university and college we are only beginning to recover from the damage done to the philosophical habit of mind by that storm. The gentlefolk and scholars of the Academy would be highly imprudent if they should assist in fresh devastation by setting gadgetry above intellectual discipline.
<p>
I am arguing that educational neoterism does mischief often. Nor do I believe it to be the primary function of university and college to create a kind of tapioca-pudding society in which everybody would be just like everybody else-every young man and woman, ideally, possessed of a doctoral degree, if innocent of philosophy.
<p>
Instead, the primary mission of university and college is to point the way toward some measure of wisdom and virtue, through developing the philosophical habit of mind. I am saying that universities and colleges were founded in the hope that those institutions might help the rising generation toward two forms of order: one, order in the soul of the person, the direction of will and appetite by reason; the other, order in the commonwealth, through the understanding of justice and freedom and the public good. I am arguing that our basic reform of the higher learning must be the restoration of these venerable aims-a task for conservatives.
<p>
Is it absurd to imagine that our vast factory-like campuses might be humanized? Is it ridiculous to argue that the American obsession with getting and spending could be chastened sufficiently to permit American higher learning to be sought for its own sake? Perhaps; but perhaps not, too.
<p>
I lack time to offer you a detailed program of educational reformation. But I venture now to suggest the essential measure that must be undertaken if we are to move from intellectual decadence toward intellectual renewal.
<p>
First, the quality of American primary and secondary schooling must be mightily improved before there can be any very marked increase of intelligence and imagination among college and university students. This improvement must have two aspects: the teaching of true intellectual disciplines, and the rousing of the moral imagination. Despite endeavors of the federal Department of Education to entice schools into improving themselves, little has occurred as yet in the way of practical reform.
<p>
I find it highly doubtful that any marked reformation of the public schools can occur until the several states, and perhaps the federal government too, adopt some form of the "voucher plan," which would provide for much greater diversity and choice in schooling. Here I commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the new book by John E. Chubb and Terry M. Moe, <i>Politics, Markets, and America's Schools</I> (Brookings Institution). As Mr. Chubb puts it, "The public education system functions naturally and routinely, despite everybody's best intentions, to burden schools with excessive bureaucracy, to discourage effective school organization, and to stifle student achievement."
<p>
Second, the American appetite for requiring vocational certification must be curbed. A very great part of the student body on nearly all campuses is enrolled mostly because "you have to get a degree to get a job." Thus universities and colleges are crowded with young people who would prefer to be somewhere else, earning money or at least active and emancipated from abstractions. It needs to be remembered that universities and colleges are centers for the study of abstractions; and most people's interest in abstractions is distinctly limited. Many of the skills in business, industry, technology, and governmental service are best acquired by internship or apprenticeship; being compelled to linger in college is little better than marking time for many undergraduates. Were universities and colleges relieved of the responsibility for turning out half-finished candidates for routine employment, they could undertake their primary duties so much the better; and the whole atmosphere of the typical campus would grow far more cheerful.
<p>
Third, the humane scale in learning should be regained by creating no more mass campuses with many thousands of undergraduates in a lonely crowd, and decentralizing so far as possible the existing Behemoth campuses. The old collegiate structure of the academic community should become the model once more. Institutes for technical training, as distinct from the abstractions with which higher education is supposed to be concerned, should be situated elsewhere than on the same campus with college or university.
<p>
Fourth, curricula at nearly all universities and colleges should be greatly revised, rigorously, so as to provide students with a genuine intellectual discipline, purged of the intellectual boondoggles that have disgraced college programs to some extent ever since the beginning of this century, but especially since the late Sixties. At the majority of American establishments of a learning allegedly higher, theoretical sciences and imaginative humane studies have been pushed into a dusty corner of the curriculum; that folly must be undone. Reading through directories of colleges recently, with a view to finding a good college for our third daughter, I discovered that at the typical college nowadays only some five percent of the undergraduates are enrolled in "letters," which once upon a time was the American college's principal discipline. If the rising generation's more intelligent members have acquired little knowledge of great literature, history, languages, and the natural sciences- why, the person and the republic will fall into disorder, soon or late.
<p>
Fifth, we must emphasize through the whole of higher education the ancient principle that the ends of all education are wisdom and virtue. I do <i>not</i> mean that the purpose of the higher learning is to "impart values." The whole notion of teaching "values" is mistaken, although held often by sincere people who mean well.
<p>
For what true education attempts to impart is <i>meaning,</i> not value. This sly employment of the word <i>value</i> as a substitute for such words as "norm," "standard," "principle," and "truth" is the deliberate work of the doctrinaire positivists, who deny that there exists any moral significance of a transcendent or an abiding character. In America, the notion of educational "values" has been advanced by sociologists and educationists of the Instrumentalist school: it is intended as a substitute for the religious assumptions about human existence that formerly were taken for granted in schools. A "value," as educationists employ the word, is a personal preference, gratifying perhaps to the person who holds it, but of no binding moral effect upon others. "Other things being equal, pushpin is as good as poetry," in Bentham's famous phrase. Choose what values you will, or ignore them all: it's a matter of what gives you, the individual, the most pleasure and the least pain.
<p>
Etienne Gilson points out that positivists deliberately advance the concept of "values" because they deny that words, or the concepts represented by words, have real meaning. Thus the word "honor" may hold value for some, but may be repellent to other people: in the view of the positivist, the word "honor" is meaningless, for there is no honor, nor yet dishonor: all really is physical sensation, pleasurable or painful. But if "honor" has an illusory value for you, employ it; if you dislike "honor," discard it.
<p>
<b>Imparting A Moral Heritage. </b>Time was when every school child used to be familiar with the catalogue of the seven cardinal virtues and the seven deadly sins. The positivists and a good many other folk today deny the existence of those seven deadly sins, or of any other sin. As for the virtues-why, they would like to convert those back into "value preferences," with no moral imperative to back them. But justice, fortitude, prudence, and temperance are not "values" merely; nor are faith, hope, and charity. It is not for the individual, bound up in self-conceit, to determine whether he prefers justice or injustice; it is not for him to decide whether prudence or imprudence suits him better. True, the individual may so decide and act, to others' harm or his own. But it is the function of education to impart a moral heritage: to teach that the virtues and the vices are real, and that the individual is not free to toy with the sins as he may choose.
<p>
What true education transmits is not values, but instead a body of truth: that is, a pattern of meanings, perceived through certain disciplines of the intellect. The sort of education that prevailed in Europe and America until about 1930, say, was an endeavor to instruct the rising generation in the nature of reality. It traced a pattern of order: order in the soul, order in the commonwealth. That old system of education began with information; it passed from information to knowledge; it moved from knowledge to wisdom. Its aim, I repeat, was not value, but truth.
<p>
The Benthamite and Deweyite educational structure of our day, little concerned with meaning, aims confusedly at personal advancement, technical training, sociability, socialization, custodial functions, and certification-not to mention fun and games. The very possibility of ascertaining the meaning of anything is denied by many a department of philosophy. What does this twentieth-century educational system transmit to the rising generation? Chiefly certain technical and commercial skills, together with that training in the learned professions that is indispensable to our civilization. Modern schooling, at any level, offers little toward the ordering of the soul and the ordering of the commonwealth.
<p>
We Americans possess the riches and the power that could give us an American Augustan Age. Do we possess mind and heart requisite for an Augustan era? It has been said that the Americans of our time know the price of everything and the value of nothing; it might better be said that they know the price of everything, the value of some things-and the meaning of next to nothing. We have not schooled ourselves, this past half-century and more, for Augustan responsibilities.
<p>
<b>Fading Heritage.</b> So far as we remembered our heritage of culture at all, most of us Americans assumed that somehow it would endure automatically, unregarded and unrenewed-a form of perpetual motion. But that heritage has been fading among us for several decades. In educational fad and foible, in arid specialization, in mere processes of certification for potential employment, we have laid waste our inheritance of reason and imagination.
<p>
Having failed to apprehend meanings, we are forced back upon a rude pragmatism in private life and in public a groping for "what works"-or seems to work. In private existence, such servility to the evanescent moment leads to the alienist's couch and the divorce court; in the affairs of nations, such naive improvisations may end in ruinous blunders, not to be undone.
<p>
The education of yesteryear was founded upon certain postulates. One of these was that much truth is ascertainable; another, that religious truth is the source of all good; a third, that we may profit by the wisdom of our ancestors; a fourth, that the individual is foolish, but the species is wise; a fifth, that wisdom is sought for its own sake; a sixth, that for the sake of the commonwealth, schooling should quicken the moral imagination.
<p>
These postulates have not ceased to be true; it is only that they have been forgotten in our century's obsession with power and money, and our century's illusion that ideology is a ready and satisfactory substitute for thought. Some eyes have been opened to the mischief done by that obsession and that illusion. Here and there, some attempts at recovery of the true ends of education are being made.
<p>
<b>Winning Back the Inheritance. </b>Many in America and throughout the world have been disinherited of their cultural patrimony. Yet they may win back that inheritance, if they have fortitude and tenacity sufficient. "The dead alone give us energy," we are told by Gustave Le Bon. In the long run, the man and the state that have rejected the legacy from many centuries will be found nerveless. And the man or woman who has sought out that intellectual legacy will be emboldened to defend the Permanent Things Against Chaos and Old Night. 
<p>
My old comrade in arms Arthur Bestor found the schools of America in 1953 educational wastelands; they are no less arid today. Yet say not, ladies and gentlemen, that the struggle naught availeth. Some conservative irrigation conceivably may cause the desert to bloom. If nothing is done-why, hand in hand with the Hollow Men, we go round and round the prickly pear at five o'clock in the morning.
<p><blockquote>
This is the dead land <BR>This is cactus land <BR>Here the stone images <BR>Are raised, here they receive <BR>The supplication of a dead man's hand <BR>Under the twinkle of a fading star.
</blockquote><p>
Unless conservatives act intellectually and vigorously to renew right reason and imagination among us, by the conclusion of the twentieth century America may be an egalitarian wasteland of mind and spirit, with everybody compulsorily schooled, and everybody equal in ignorance.

<P>
This year's series of Heritage Lectures is concerned with the somewhat pressing question of whether our American culture will survive the tribulations of our age. In the two previous lectures, I have discussed the ideology called "multiculturalism" as a menace; and whether a civilization that lacks belief in a religion can endure. In my final lecture, in December, I mean to talk about means for combating cultural decay. Today I have chosen for my subject the degradation of the democratic dogma.
<p>
I take my title from the writings of Henry and Brooks Adams. They found American democracy in process of degradation more than a century ago. The decay of the American Presidency from George Washington to Ulysses S. Grant, Henry Adams remarked, refuted altogether Darwin's theory of evolution. To a similar thesis I shall return presently.
<p>
But first, indulge me in some observations concerning the present condition of what is called "democracy" near the close of the 20th century. We are informed by certain voices that soon all the world will be democratic. But whether or not, the American mode of democratic government prevails, the abstract ideology called <i>democratism</i> that any government which has obtained a majority of votes be received as "democratic." Enthusiasts for unrestricted democracy presumably forget that Adolph Hitler, too, was democratically elected and sustained by popular plebiscites. Alexis de Tocqueville warned his contemporaries against "democratic despotism," 20th century writers discuss "totalist democracy."
<p>
I am suggesting, ladies and gentlemen, that <i>democracy</i>-literally, "the rule of the crowd"-is a term so broad and vague as to signify everything or nothing. The American democracy, a unique growth although an offshoot from British culture, innocent of ideology's fury-functioned fairly well in the past because of peculiar beliefs and conditions: a patrimony of ordered freedom, and especially, as Tocqueville pointed out, Americans' <i>mores,</i> or moral habits. What is called "democracy" today in most of the world-and nearly every regime represents itself as democratic-bears much resemblance to America's political and social pattern as the oar of the boat does to the ore of the mine. All that these regimes maintain in common is a claim that they rule with the assent of the majority of the people. The tyranny of the majority can be more oppressive, and more effectual, than the tyranny of a single person.
<p>
<b>Not Readily Transplanted.</b> Neoconservatives' demands nowadays that all the world be thoroughly democratized overnight remind me strongly of a similar enthusiasm not long after the end of the Second World War. Gentlemen such as Chester Bowles then proclaimed that Africa, liberated from European domination, promptly would rejoice in an array of democracies on the American model. The United States took measures, then and later, to accelerate this happy progress economic restraints upon trade of one sort or another with Portugal, Rhodesia, and latterly the Republic of South Africa. We all know, of course, how blissfully democratic Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) are today; while South Africa's peoples, thanks to the beneficence of American and European liberals, enjoy the prospect of civil war in emulation of what occurred in the Congo three decades ago. America's democracy is not readily transplanted overseas. If anybody emerges alive from the present agony in Somalia, will a peaceful democracy, told by the nose, soon come to pass there? Was the ejection, after the Second World War, of the Italian government from part of Somaliland, and the withdrawal of the British administrators from another portion of that territory, a victory for democracy in Africa? Ask the Somali dead.
<p>
My point is this: Merely to shout the word <i>democracy</i> is not to bring into being a society endowed with order, justice, and freedom. Those blessings grow but slowly, and by good nurture. The roots of the American democratic republic run back through hundreds of years of American, British, and European experience. While we prate about exporting American democracy to Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia-although, as Daniel Boorstin has written, "the American Constitution is not for export"-our own political institutions seem to be crumbling. We may sink into the Latin American brand of democracy, class against class, the economy periodically ruined by inflation, with a semblance of order restored from time to time by the military.
<p>
<b>Recalling 1929. </b>Sinclair Lewis, late in life, wrote an implausible novel <i>It Can' t Happen Here</i>-a fictional affirmation that a fascist regime might be established in the United States; the book was published in 1935. The novel was more comical than convincing; but it does not follow that the American democratic republic will endure for eternity, as Rome was supposed to last. I may be one of the very few persons present today who remembers clearly the events of the American experience between, and including, the years 1929 and 1933. I find America's social and economic and political circumstances today markedly similar to those of that tumultuous era. Changes still larger than those worked by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal may come to pass during the next four years, say. Economically, the position of the United States is more precarious than it was in 1929: our national debt is astronomical in quantity; personal (family) debt, on the average, is more than four-fifths of a family's annual income; the apparatus of credit is vastly overexpanded; and taxes begin to be crushing. In certain of our cities, ferocious riots far exceed in magnitude the disorders of 1929- 1933, and after: those riots really are proletarian risings. This is a time in which, in Yeats's lines, "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."
<p>
In 1957, at Bruges, during a conference on Atlandc community, I met Amaury de Riencourt, the author of a book entitled <i>The Coming Caesars,</i> published that year, the book was very widely discussed then, but now is forgotten. Unless measures of restraint should be taken, Riencourt wrote-and taken promptly-the United States would fall under the domination of 20th century Caesars. Riencourt argued:
<p><blockquote>
Caesarism is not dictatorship, not the result of one man's overriding ambition; not a brutal seizure of power through revolution. It is not based on a specific doctrine or philosophy. It is essentially pragmatic and untheoretical. It is a slow, often century-old, unconscious development that ends in a voluntary surrender of a free people escaping from freedom to one autocratic master....
<P>
Political power in the Western world has become increasingly concentrated in the United States, and in the office of the President within America. The power and prestige of the President have grown with the growth of America and of democracy within America, with the multiplication of economic, political, and military emergencies, with the necessity of ruling what is virtually becoming an American empire-the universal state of a Western civilization at bay....
<P>
Caesarism can come to America constitutionally, without having to alter or break down any existing institution. The White House is already the seat of the most powerful tribunician authority ever known to history. All it needs is amplification and extension. Caesarism in America does not have to challenge the Constitution as in Rome or engage in civil warfare and cross any fateful Rubicon. It can slip in quite naturally, discreetly, through constitutional channels.
</blockquote><p>
Just so. Caesarism slipped into the White House constitutionally, if not naturally, with the murder of President Kennedy in 1963. The plebiscitary democracy would elect Lyndon Johnson President in 1964; but Johnson's military failure would undo him, despite his panem et circenses; and a rebellious senator would strip him of the purple. If Caesars do not win their battles, they fall. In this, although not in much else, perhaps it was as well that the war in Vietnam was lost.
<p>
On a wall of my library hangs a photograph of myself with President Johnson; both of us are smiling; it is well to be civil to Caesar. It might be thought that Russell Kirk would not have been eager to visit Caesar in the Oval office of the Imperial Mansion; indeed I was not. But, in collaboration with James McClellan, I had written not long before a biography of Robert Taft; Johnson, as a senatorial colleague, had delivered a funeral eulogy of the famous Republican; and so I was induced by the patroness of the Robert A. Taft Institute of Government to present the President with a copy of the book, at a little White House ceremony.
<p>
<b>A Visit to Caesar.</b> Present for that occasion in the Oval Office were two Democratic Senators who had been on good terms with Senator Taft-Byrd of Virginia and Tydings of Maryland. Lyndon Johnson towered tall and masterful, clearly a bad man to have for an adversary. The Taft book was presented, and the President exchanged some brief remarks with me; photographs were taken while my irrepressible wife strolled behind the presidential desk, examining photographs of Lady Bird, Lynda Bird, and other folk at the ranch.
<p>
True to his reputation if to naught else, President Johnson wheeled and dealt with Senator Byrd and Senator Tydings the while. He knew me for a syndicated columnist, but surely never had opened any of my books. "Stay in school! Stay in school!" Johnson had shouted, over television, to the rising generation. Yet this Caesar had no need of books; he had been the vainglorious disciple of Experience, that famous master of fools.
<p>
No, Johnson did not open books: with Septimius Severus, he might have said, "Pay the soldiers; the rest do not matter." Had he not Robert McNamara, creator of the Edsel, to counsel him? Power was all, and surely the power of the United States, under Johnson's hand, was infinite. All the way with LBJ! There came into my head, in the Oval Office, a passage from Amaury de Riencourt:
<p><blockquote>
With Caesarism and Civilization, the great struggles between political parties are no longer concerned with principles, programs and ideologies, but with men. Marius, Sulla, Cato, Brutus still fought for principles. But now, everything became personalized. Under Augustus, parties still existed, but there were no more Optimates or Populares. No more conservatives or democrats. Men campaigned for or against Tiberius or Drusus or Caius Caesar. No one believed any more in the efficacy of ideas, political panaceas, doctrines, or systems, just as the Greeks had given up building great philosophic systems generations before. Abstractions, ideas, and philosophies were rejected to the periphery of their lives and of the empire, to the East where Jews, agnostics, Christians, and Mithraists attempted to conquer the world of souls and minds while the Caesars ruled their material existence.
</blockquote><p>

All the way with LBJ! <i>Ave atque vale!</i>
<p>
<b>Consequences of Hubris.</b> Every inch a Caesar LBJ looked; he might have sat for Michelangelo for the carving of a statue of a barracks emperor. Experience, nevertheless, had not taught this imperator how to fight a war. To fancy that hundreds of thousands of fanatic guerrillas and North Vietnamese regulars, supplied by Russia and China, might be defeated by military operations merely defensive-plus a great deal of bombing from the air, destroying civilians chiefly, that bombing pinpointed by Johnson himself in the White House! The American troops in Vietnam fought admirably well-how well, my old friend General S. L. A. Marshall described unforgettably in his books-but their situation was untenable. "Imagination rules mankind," Bonaparte had said-Napoleon, master of the big battalions. Had Johnson possessed any imagination, he would have sealed Haiphong, as Nixon did later. Only so might the war have been won.
<p>
Afflicted by <i>hubris,</i> Johnson Caesar piled the tremendous cost of the war-a small item was the immense quantity of milk flown daily from San Francisco to Vietnam, American troops not campaigning on handfuls of rice-upon the staggering cost of his enlargement of the welfare state at home. One might have thought he could not do sums. He ruined the dollar and bequeathed to the nation an incomprehensible national debt. Both guns and butter! It had been swords and liturgies with earlier emperors.
<p>
It is with variations that history repeats itself. Ignoring history, LBJ was condemned to repeat it.
<p>
Morally, he was the worst man ever to make himself master of the White House. The corrupt antics of Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes did not bring him down, although he had been intimately connected with both.
<p>
In June 1961, an agent of the Department of Agriculture, Henry Marshall, had been found shot to death in Texas. Marshall had been about to expose the criminal wheeling and dealing of Billie Sol Estes, and in that wheeling and dealing Lyndon Johnson, then Vice-President, had participated. A justice of the peace declared the murder of Marshall to have been suicide.
<p>
But in March 1984, a grand jury in Robertson County would look into the mystery. A federal marshal and Billie Sol Estes would certify before that jury. Estes, under immunity, swore that the killing had been decided upon at a meeting at Vice-President Johnson's Washington residence; Johnson had given the order and directed a hanger-on of his, Malcolm Wallace, to execute it. The grand jury believed Estes, it appears, and concluded that Marshall's death had been a homicide. No one was indicted, for the grand jury presumed that the murderers already were dead.
<p>
Such frequently is the way of Caesars. Like some other Caesars, Johnson, from small beginnings, accumulated while in public office a large fortune. No one ever accused him of the vice of scrupulosity. An ill man to deal with, Lyndon Baines Johnson.
<p>
Yet Eugene the Poet, Eugene the Giant-Killer, would fetch Caesar down. I do not think that Eugene McCarthy would have converted himself into a Caesar; nay, American conservatives might have been better content with President McCarthy than they would become with President Bush or will be with President Clinton.
<p>
<b>Politics of the Absurd.</b> For the past several months, the American people endured the least edifying of presidential campaigns. No one of the three gentlemen who aspired to the presidential office commanded much respect, and their debates were more concerned with trivia and intemperate accusations than with the great and most difficult public decisions that must be made very soon. The feeblest of the three candidates proposed to refer all of those decisions to the electorate at large, by electronic means of polling-as if every American voter were able and eager to express a considered judgment on what courses should be undertaken in the conduct of foreign policy, on how the national debt should be reduced, on how civil disorders should be averted, on what to do about the American proletariat, on the improvement of public schooling, on the allocation of priorities in public expenditure, on the afflictions of centralization and bureaucracy, on the question of immigration, on the modes of averting an economic collapse on the scale of what occurred in 1929-on these and innumerable other public issues, it is proposed that we take a hasty popular poll! That way lies democratic madness. Why bother with statesmen? Surely the typical American voter is omniscient. We have entered upon the politics of the absurd.
<p>
This year's three presidential aspirants seemed absurd to a great multitude of citizens. How had they been selected for candidacy? Mr. Perot selected himself, soon withdrew (but not from modesty), and then selected himself afresh. Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were selected chiefly by primary campaigns, the results of which were determined chiefly by the amount of money they were able to spend, respectively, on television advertising. In the case of President Bush, his being an incumbent of the office, with large benefactions to bestow, saved the day for him. I was general chairman of the Buchanan campaign in Michigan. We Buchanan backers had only ten thousand dollars to spend; while the Bush people spent half a million dollars in Michigan. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi;</i> to them that hath shall be given. Certain Roman Caesars bought the imperial purple. Increasingly, our presidential candidates win by purchasing time on the boob-tube.
<p>
<b>Not As Framers Intended.</b> The Framers of the Constitution gravely distrusted democratic appetites, as such had been demonstrated by Shays' Rebellion. Also they distrusted arbitrary power in a chief executive. So they endeavored-unsuccessfully, as matters have turned out-to devise a prudent method of selecting presidents, far removed from popular vote. This was the Electoral College. It was assumed by the Framers that within each of the several states there would be chosen (through divers modes) able and conscientious presidential electors, free agents, "men of superior discernment, virtue, and information" (in Senator Thomas Hart Benton's phrases), who would select a strong and good President "according to their own will," regardless of popular sentiment of the hour. This upright intended Electoral College never has functioned as the Framers intended, nevertheless, because with the rise of great coherent political parties came the pledging in advance of electors to the candidacy of some particular individual- Adams, or Jefferson, or Burr, say-and therefore the reduction of the Electoral College to insignificance, except so far as the College preserved the idea of a nation of sovereign states, the presidential electoral vote being cast by the several states according to their representation in the Congress-and not according to the popular vote, nationally regarded.
<p>
The Framers of the Constitution conceivably might have revised a different move for the Electoral College that could have survived the rise of great political parties. One such arrangement might have been to make the sitting governors of the several states, if chosen long before the presidential election, the independent choosers of the President, so removing the selection from the ephemeral preferences of the great mass of ill-informed voters nationally. But "the saddest words of tongue or pen are simply these: 'It might have been."' Now we expect presidential candidates to exhaust themselves, and their supporters' fund, by <i>two</i> overwhelming national campaigns-one the primaries and conventions held in every state, the other the frantic struggle on the eve of the November election, every four years. This method is supposed to ascertain the popular will; but in effect it blurs distinctions between parties, the candidates promising to be all things, to all men-and women; and commonly this method gives us demagogues or else bladders of vanity as party candidates. All too possibly it may give us more Caesar-presidents; President Bush endeavored to be one such, causing the deaths of a quarter of a million people in Iraq; but the popularity of that exploit rapidly evaporated. The more we behave as if the President were the embodiment of the American democracy, and do little about the Congress except to revile senators and representatives, the less genuinely democratic this nation must become.
<p>
Electronic technology becomes a tool of plebiscitary democracy. As Mr. James M. Perry put it in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> on November 4, hereafter, having upheld the presidential contest of 1992, "Candidates will build on what they saw this year-800-telephone number satellite hookups, soft Larry King-style interviews, televised town meetings." It's a brave new world, with words like "teledemocracy" and "interactive communications" being used by the scholars to describe it. Notions like Mr. Perot's "electronic town hall," should they come to pass, would concentrate the national public' s attention upon the presidential candidates merely, sweeping aside the mechanism of parties and in effect reducing the Congress (or, on the level of the several states, the state legislatures) to little more than ratifying bodies, pledged to whatever programs the victorious presidential candidate might advocate and decree. The peril to true representative government, and to America's old territorial democracy, is too obvious for me to labor this point. The presidential candidates, in such a novel system, necessarily would have to raise enormous quantities of money from such special interests, pressure groups, and ethnic blocs as might expect to profit from the ascendancy of some vigorous demagogue or some persuasive instrument of oligarchy.
<p>
Yet a good many Americans fancy that these developments founded upon television and telephone will bring about "government of the people, by the people, and for the people." At our county Republican convention in my state of Michigan, an amiable young candidate for the office of representative in the Michigan legislature-a person who thought himself conservative- declared himself delighted at the prospect of serving the people "in the new direct democracy." Now direct democracy did not function well in ancient Athens, when the whole electorate-a few thousand men-could assemble in the agora; it would function disastrously, if at all, in the United States of the 20th century, with a population of some two hundred and fifty million people. In any event, the People possessing no unanimous collective will on any question, this virtual abolition of representative government would come down to skillful manipulation of the moment's public opinion by a circle of electronic-media specialists in the service of the President: an extreme form of plebiscitary democracy. In effect, the Presidency would become a dictatorship achieved without violence and checked only by the necessity of an election every four years. How very democratic!
<p>
<b>Plurality President.</b> I speak thus alarmingly only of future possibilities, not of the swiftly approaching reign of Clinton Caesar. For Mr. Clinton achieved a majority of the popular vote merely in his own state of Arkansas; he is a plurality President merely, no popular hero empowered by the Demos to shape the world nearer to his heart's desire. Moreover, he has promised all things to all men-free medical care; free college education, or virtually free, for all comers; emancipation from the tiresome restraints of bourgeois morality; more lavish entitlements for such minorities as can turn out the vote; Lord knows what all benefits. These promises cannot be fulfilled; therefore the reproaches which were heaped upon President Bush these past four years will descend upon President Clinton twofold, not long after his inauguration; and he lacks the rhetorical skill and cunning with which Franklin Roosevelt, in highly similar circumstances, deflected or repelled such criticisms. So feebleness, rather than militancy, is liable to predominate during the Clinton years. And if President Clinton presumes to increase income taxes, as he has said he will do-why, the new Congress, mindful of the fate of the late Bush Administration, may turn rebellious. <i>In fine,</i> Mr. Clinton will not be crowned with laurel.
<p>
Clinton's successors, nevertheless, may have more happy opportunities for the concentration of power in their hands. Increasing military involvement in the European continent, or the collapse of the world economy in a fashion more ruinous than what occurred from 1929 to 1992, might whet presidential candidates' eagerness for power, and public willingness to entrust all to the Great White Father.
<p>
Circumstances from Siberia to San Francisco strongly resemble political and social and economic circumstances in most of the world between the two World Wars. The coming of immense inflation of currencies-now quite conceivable-might cause such immense public resentment and distress that executive forces and legislative bodies might be swept out of power, in country after country, and by plebiscites might usher in persons not at all scrupulous in their attainment -of power. Such radical changes would be accomplished in the name of Democracy, of course, but what would result would be plebiscitary democracy, ruthless enough.
<p>
In the name of Democracy, America' s representative government, under the Constitution, might be swept aside, and politics might be debased to contests between hypocritical ideologues, every one of them claiming to be more democratic than the others. What's in a name? In Haiti, "democracy" signifies the arbitrary power of deposed President Aristide to have rubber tires slung round the necks of his opponents, and they set afire. In South Africa, the apotheosis of democracy, one man one vote on Benthamite principles would end in civil war and general impoverishment. In the United States, the demand for more democracy might lead to the legalized plundering of the hardworking by those who prefer not to work at all. And a line of American Caesars might be required to preserve any sort of order.
<p>
<b>Recovering True Representative Government.</b> I am arguing, ladies and gentlemen, that these United States would be only degraded by a submission to an ideological democracy, in either domestic or foreign policy, a Rousseauistic democracy restyled "teledemocracy." What we require is a vigorous recovery of true representative government, one of the principal achievements of our culture, a legacy from centuries of British and colonial experience and from the practical wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution of the United States. Say not the struggle naught availeth, friends. In my concluding lecture of this series, I will endeavor to let some cheerfulness break in, suggesting means for cultural restoration in a diversity of aspects.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Come November, hundreds of thousands of immigrants are likely to cast their first votes in a presidential election. That's because record levels of foreigners have filed applications for citizenship with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Last year, 1.2 million of them formally sought citizenship, up from an annual average of only 230,000 in the 1980s. To handle these numbers, the INS has pumped an extra $80 million into its naturalization budget. But the waiting list continues to grow.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This rush to citizenship offers us both opportunity and danger. We have the opportunity to help more immigrants become Americans, and thus protect our country from the dangers of Bosnia-style multiculturalism or Quebec-style separatism. The danger is that, to cope with the volume of applications, the INS will lower its naturalization standards and devalue citizenship like a worthless peso.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Preparation for the tests and ceremony of citizenship has long been a powerful instrument of unity, an engine of assimilation that turns newcomers into U.S. citizens who understand our political traditions and are proud to be Americans. A citizenship ceremony is among the most moving events in American public life. Patriotic songs and colorful speeches about freedom and opportunity fill the program. The event concludes with a duty-bound oath in which immigrants forsake foreign political allegiances and pledge themselves wholly to their new country. As new citizens pick up their official citizenship papers, they also receive small American flags and voting information. Friends and family greet them outside. The day will be remembered the way most Americans remember graduations, weddings, and the birth of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; All of the difficult moments leading up to citizenship reinforce its meaning for the participants. In order to naturalize, immigrants must  live in the United States for five years. They must pass an FBI criminal background check. Ultimately, they will have to be interviewed by an INS officer and demonstrate the ability to speak, read, and write in English (with some exceptions for elderly applicants) and pass a test on U.S. history and government. Only those who really want citizenship will get it. And when they do, they enjoy a satisfaction that most other Americans can never experience. "Citizenship makes me feel at home in America, like I really belong here," said Mohsen Borhani, an immigrant from Iran, shortly before he became a citizen last fall.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This process of naturalization, and the accumulation of enough cultural capital to acquire citizenship, ultimately yields more than a set of political entitlements. It infuses new citizens with a sense of duty and loyalty to their new home. "I am no longer a Canadian and it is long past time to assume the responsibility that comes with American citizenship," said Adele Hardwick, a Canadian immigrant, right before she naturalized last November. "The right to vote is a great privilege," added the German-born Erling Hans Ulstein. "I would like to take part in the democratic process and know that I didn't just live and work here, but did my part as an American citizen," he said.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; With so many new applications for citizenship, however, the INS is threatening to lower its standards to the point where naturalization is no longer a meaningful experience. Naturalization receives little sustained attention from academics, politicians, and the media. Perhaps as a consequence, our notion of citizenship has cheapened since the turn of the century. Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates. Agents hint that their superiors are more concerned about meeting a quota than making sure everybody does a good, thorough job.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"We have about 15 minutes for each interview," says Dan Childs, an INS officer based in Arlington, Virginia. "If I want to take a little extra time to check something, it really backs things up. We're always behind, even if things go smoothly. I usually skip my lunch hour just to catch up. You can guess what you want about the INS giving us so many appointments and so little time." What's more, the tests on U.S. history and government are hardly demanding. In the Arlington office, successful applicants need to score only seven out of 12, or 58 percent. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The INS is now considering lowering its standards even further. The agency is reviewing proposals to water down the language requirements and exempt entire classes of immigrants from the test on U.S. history and government. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has even suggested eliminating altogether the mandatory personal interviews in order to save time, and a battery of civil-rights organizations have egged her on. Hispanic activist Harry Pachon says that the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which he used to head, promotes naturalization because citizenship "is the missing ingredient to Latino empowerment strategies."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For activists like Pachon, naturalization is not an important aspect of the complicated assimilation process, but a political power grab. The easier, the better. Leticia Quezada of the Los Angeles School Board wants to break down the distinction between citizens and noncitizens entirely by giving the vote to people who have not naturalized. "At one time only white males could vote," she says. "My position is that it's time we cross the line in terms of citizenship." Illegal aliens are already counted as constituents in congressional apportionment under the rules of the 1982 Voting Rights Act, even though they can't vote. California, for example, may have as many as three extra seats in Congress because of its illegal immigrant population.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Statements and policies like these won't calm Americans' jitters about immigrants. In one recent poll, 66 percent said that the United States is no longer a melting pot. Around the globe, they see cultural differences tearing countries apart. Many Americans are beginning to wonder: If immigrants in all of their racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity fuel the "balkanization" of America, then what good are they? Naturalization is the only legal instrument that allows the United States--a "nation of immigrants"--to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans once expected immigrants to naturalize--and to do it for the right reasons. In the early part of this century, a broad social movement set its sights on the "Americanization" of the U.S. foreign-born population. The Americanization Movement was in essence an educational drive to promote the assimilation of the millions of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe who swarmed to the United States on the eve of the First World War. The Americanizers, according to historian Edward George Hartmann, encouraged a barrage of "special classes, lectures, and mass meetings, where [immigrants] might be instructed in the language, the ideals, and outlook on life which had come to be accepted as the traditional American point of view." They made naturalization central to their efforts, since it would help transform foreign nationals into patriotic Americans.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This was the vision of the Founding Fathers for their new republic. Their main concern regarding immigration was whether newcomers would rid themselves of any undemocratic principles that they might have learned in unfree lands. Would America's openness ultimately usher in people with opposing values?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country," wrote Alexander Hamilton, "would be nothing less than to admit the Grecian horse into the citadel of our liberty and sovereignty." The solution, according to Hamilton, was to draw immigrants gradually into civil society, "to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American attachments; to learn the principles and imbibe the spirit of our government; and to admit of a philosophy at least, of their feeling a real interest in our affairs."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Americanization Movement drew from these principles. When President William McKinley fell in 1901 to the bullet of anarchist Leon Czolgosz--an American by birth but of obvious foreign parentage--people looked to naturalization, not restriction, as an answer to their so-called immigrant problem. After McKinley's death, the Sons of the American Revolution rushed to print a small leaflet entitled <i>A Welcome to Immigrants and Some Good Advice.</i> It urged immigrants to become citizens as soon as possible. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Since 1907, more than 13 million immigrants have become citizens. According to the 1990 Census, more than half of all adult immigrants who had arrived before 1985 were citizens in 1989. Even so, few immigrants come to the United States because they want to be Americanized. The vast majority migrate to improve their economic status. Assimilation, however, starts to work on newcomers immediately as they pick up a few words of English and become familiar with American customs and mores. Any decision to naturalize comes gradually. The choice is very difficult, because it involves thorny questions of loyalty, identity, and family. Naturalization may lead to full membership in American society, but it can also seem like a betrayal of one's heritage.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But as the years go by, immigrants form families, buy homes, and sink roots in the community. They begin to understand how citizenship can improve their quality of life. Like any characteristic of assimilation, the rate of naturalization increases over time. By the end of 1993, about 38 percent of immigrants who arrived in 1982 had naturalized, as had about 41 percent of those who came in 1977. Immigrants who naturalize typically do so after living in the United States for about 10 years. Asians and Africans tend to naturalize more quickly than other groups. Canadians and Mexicans tend to wait the longest.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The bureaucratic inefficiencies of the INS--which has a reputation for being one of the worst-run federal agencies--stand in the way of many applicants. One study estimates that a third of all applicants abandon their quest for citizenship before any formal resolution. In some INS districts, the wait between the first application and the actual citizenship ceremony can be two years. With dozens of forms, questions, and interviews to navigate, it is easy to give up.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For those who persevere, the formal citizenship interview is the cornerstone of the process. The one-on-one encounter with an INS officer lasts for about 15 minutes. Nobody but a lawyer may accompany the naturalization applicant. The INS examiner's first priority is to make sure that every form in the citizenship application is complete and that the FBI criminal background check has not turned up anything unsavory. His second task is to determine a candidate's English-speaking ability.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The test on U.S. history and government is next. The exams all draw their content from a series of short books published by the INS. Their actual administration, however, can vary considerably among the INS districts, which are allowed to develop their own testing procedures. They may be conducted orally or in written form. Applicants who pass a fill-in-the blank test generally are assumed to have met the English-language reading and writing requirements. The questions are simple enough: "Who was the first president of the United States?" "Why do we have a holiday on the 4th of July?" "Who makes the laws in the United States?" They also may ask applicants to name their governor or one of their senators. Some questions have several possible answers. If a test asks "Who was Abraham Lincoln?", an INS examiner will accept any of these responses: the 16th president, author of the Emancipation Proclamation, deliverer of the Gettysburg Address, president during the Civil War, the president who freed the slaves, and so on. Some of the questions are a little tricky. If asked "Who elects the president?", most Americans will say, "the people." The correct answer, however, is the electoral college.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Passing the exam does not require a perfect score. The INS office in Seattle, for example, uses an oral test with 16 questions--eight in history and eight in government. Four correct in each category earns a passing grade. In truth, the majority of test-takers do not squeak by--they do quite well. Most score in the 80 to 90 percent range. Scores of 100 percent are common.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Americanization Movement of the early 20th century viewed the classroom as an important tool, both to teach newcomers how to speak English and to instill them with the value of citizenship. Immigrant-aid organizations, community colleges, and adult education programs continue to offer citizenship training courses today, but their impact on the foreign-born population is probably not as great as it was 80 years ago. Part of the problem is that public agencies like the INS do not encourage immigrants to enroll in citizenship education. Cost is not the reason, since civics instruction is cheap. Rather, they generally have not engaged in the types of innovative partnerships with local groups that can boost interest in naturalization, streamline the INS, and ultimately Americanize people who might otherwise be left out of the system. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One exception, however, can be found in Seattle, Washington. A program there could serve as a model for the whole country and allow a new spirit of Americanization to regain a foothold in the naturalization process.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Students who enroll in one of the 21 citizenship classes offered by community colleges, churches, and immigrant-aid organizations in the region receive special consideration from the INS. They are screened for English fluency and pay a tuition of $60 to $120, depending on where they learn, in addition to standard INS application fees. But instead of waiting half a year for their INS interview, as is common in Seattle, students wait just 10 weeks. During this period, they attend citizenship class and prepare for the INS exam, which they take in the 10th week. The waiting list for the initiative has hundreds of immigrants on it.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For three hours a night, four nights a week, Greg Gourley serves as an an instructor in the program. He tells his students what they will need to know in order to pass the INS naturalization exam--plus a lot more. Like test-takers everywhere, many naturalization applicants simply want to earn a passing grade. Gourley teaches to the test, but includes a lot of information that probably will not be on it. "Being a citizen is about more than just passing an exam," he says. For example, he instructs the class in the Pledge of Allegiance. By the third or fourth week, everyone has memorized it. They recite it at the start of each class, even though none will be asked anything about the pledge during their naturalization interview. "Just about every kid in the United States knows that pledge," says Gourley. "It's important for these people who are going to be citizens to know it, too."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Students take the classes because they have some learning to do. "The Soviets didn't teach us anything about America--nothing true, anyway," says Viktor Bozhko, a Ukrainian in a citizenship course at Lake Hills Baptist Church, in Bellevue. "This is the best way for me to learn about my new home." Says the Cuban-born Ramon Negrin, one of Gourley's students at Bellevue Community College: "This is a good refresher course. It's making me proud to be an American."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; These citizenship courses deepen immigrants' understanding of U.S. history and government. They turn borderline cases into applicants who ace their exams. They also can bring new people into the system by instilling those who otherwise would hesitate to apply with the knowledge and confidence they need to pass. Receiving 20 to 30 hours of citizenship instruction over 10 weeks' time would teach something to just about anybody, from a thoroughly assimilated immigrant to a well-educated native. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Immigration and Naturalization Service doesn't have the resources to provide this education itself. What is needed is a modern-day Americanization Movement of private and local public institutions that would revive the old-fashioned ideal of civics instruction for immigrant adults, at a time when millions of them suddenly want to naturalize.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This mission is doubly important for immigrants, most of whom cannot fall back on childhood stories about patriot Nathan Hale's regret that he had "but one life to give" for his country, or President Lincoln's determination that government "of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth." Yet they must learn such stories, for this is the stuff of which citizens--citizens of a nation dedicated to a proposition--are made. Ben Franklin once remarked that our Constitution offers Americans "a republic--if you can keep it." Turning immigrants into citizens, into Americans who cherish both their freedoms and their responsibilities, may be the surest way to keep this republic safe through the ages.

<h2>ASIAN STUDIES CENTER</h2>
<P>
Not surprisingly, four of the ten countries with the best ratings
on Heritage's <a href="/townhall/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><I>Index of Economic Freedom</a></I> - and eight of
the top 20 - were from the Asia-Pacific region. When the United
States, Canada, and Chile are included - all of which belong to
the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) --
the more broadly defined region boasts 11 of the top 20 freest
economies in the world. The APEC nations also now account for
40 percent of all global trade.
<P>
In recognition of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific community,
The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center was established
in 1983. Today, the Center is recognized on both sides of the
Pacific as one of the most important research and policy centers
on diplomatic, economic, and security issues affecting the United
States and Asia. 
<P>
While trade and security issues dominated the calendar, Director
<a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a> and the Asian Studies Center staff made a strong
case in 1994 for significantly upgrading U.S. relations with the
Republic of China on Taiwan, a booming country of more than 20
million people that continues to be treated as a second-class
world citizen by the United States. Visiting Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/plunk.htm">Daryl Plunk</a>
and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard V. Allen</a>, National Security Advisor to President
Reagan and Chairman of the Asian Studies Center's Advisory Council,
provided Washington with much-needed guidance on defusing the
growing crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons program. And
Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a> offered the White House an agenda
for the mid-November APEC summit, proposing that leaders of the
18 member countries set a &quot;time certain&quot; for establishing
a trans-Pacific free-trade area, the topic of an Oct. 27 Asian
Studies Center conference featuring Nancy Adams, U.S. Trade Representative
for APEC Affairs, and Paula Stern, former Chairwoman of the U.S.
International Trade Commission.

<h2>WHAT AMERICANS WILL PAY IF CONGRESS FAILS TO REFORM MEDICARE: THE STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IMPACT</h2>

<b>By Robert E. Moffit, John C. Liu, and David H. Winston</b><sup>1</sup><br><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<hr><a href="wel-62mp.html">Index-Map of Supporting Data by Congressional District</a><br><a href="fyi62cmp.html">Data Table: Cost of a 3.52% Medicare Tax by State</a></center><hr><P>Medicare's increasingly dangerous financial plight leaves Congress with only two options if the program is to continue providing health care to seniors:  either restructure and reform the program or significantly increase payroll taxes on America's businesses and working families. While payroll taxes technically are shared between employers and employees, in reality most taxes on business are shifted to workers in the form of reduced wages or compensation -- in some cases, even job loss. Thus, any new payroll tax to shore up the financially failing Medicare system will be another tax on America's working families.
<P>
Medicare's seven-member Board of Trustees, which includes President Clinton's Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor, has determined that the Medicare Hospitalization (HI, or Part A) Trust Fund, which finances hospital services to the nation's elderly, will be insolvent in the year 2002. It urges "prompt, effective and decisive action" to address Medicare's financial condition. In the words of David Walker and Stanford Ross, the Board's two "public trustees" (private citizens), Medicare "is clearly unsustainable in its present form," and its reform "needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative."2<P>Several proposals have been advanced to restructure Medicare. Using a well-tested model for congressional reform, Heritage Foundation analysts have proposed transforming the current Medicare system into one that would look like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers. The FEHBP, unlike Medicare, is based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition.3  This would allow Medicare enrollees to pick government-certified private insurance plans and, like retirees in the FEHBP, receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. Similar legislation is being considered on Capitol Hill.
<P>
Americans are beginning to understand that unless Congress restructures Medicare to preserve high quality medical services but at lower cost, Congress will have to cut the supply of medical services available to enrollees or significantly increase the HI payroll tax to avoid the bankruptcy of the HI Trust Fund.4  With the notable exception of the 1989 repeal of the costly Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988,5 Congress has expanded, not deleted, Medicare's benefits and services. Its failure to reform the program means that Congress will likely resort to higher taxes on working families to cover Medicare's soaring costs. But given the gravity of Medicare's financial condition, particularly the threatened bankruptcy of the HI Trust Fund, the level of taxation on workers and businesses that would be needed just to finance the program in its current form would be enormous, dwarfing even the Clinton Administration's tax hike of 1993, the largest single tax increase in U.S. history.
<P>
Taxpayers also should realize that in addition to any HI payroll tax, they will pay general taxes to maintain the solvency of Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services. Taxpayers already subsidize 71 percent of the cost of Part B's premiums. Unless Congress implements changes, the taxpayer's share will increase automatically to 75 percent on January 1, 1996. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the taxes required to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.6<p><b>Medicare's Payroll Tax.</b> Middle-class American families with children today surrender well over one-third of their income to federal, state, and local taxation. Federal taxation alone takes approximately 25 percent of this average family income.7  And among many families, federal payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare even exceed the federal income tax.8<p>Medicare's hospital insurance program currently is funded through a 2.9 percent federal payroll tax, divided equally between employers and employees with each paying 1.45 percent, except for the self-employed, who pay the full 2.9 percent. The imposition of an even higher Medicare payroll tax, like the imposition of a mandate on an employer to purchase health insurance for employees, is an additional labor cost on business.9  But business labor costs are largely passed on to workers in reduced wages, benefits, or even employment. Standard economic analysis confirms this well-known "pass through" effect of business labor costs on the wages of employees. A survey of the economic literature by Lewin-VHI, one of the nation's leading econometrics firms, indicates that for every additional $100 in mandated benefits an employer must provide for an employee, an average of $88 will be paid for in reduced wages.10<P>Today, the Medicare HI tax is still a relatively modest payroll tax. But over the years it has grown steadily to finance the hospitalization program, and it will get bigger if Congress cannot refor
m Medicare in a cost-efficient fashion. When the HI tax was first imposed in 1966, it was limited to the first $6,600 of taxable income per year. In the years since the enactment of the Medicare program, the maximum taxable amount has been raised 23 times.11  Through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), Congress, upon the recommendation of the Clinton Administration, repealed the legal limitation on taxable income as part of its major 1993 tax initiative This means that all earnings today are subject to the HI payroll tax.
<p>

<b>FINANCIAL INSTABILITY AND FUTURE TAX INCREASES</b>
<P>
As explained in the Medicare Trustees' Report, the "adequacy of the HI program's scheduled financing to support program costs in the future is examined under three alternative sets of assumptions:  low cost, intermediate, and high cost. The low cost alternative is a more optimistic set of assumptions from the standpoint of HI financing and the high cost alternative is a more pessimistic set of assumptions."12  Further, continues the Report, "[the] intermediate set of assumptions represents the Trustees' best estimate of the expected future economic and demographic trends that will affect the financial status of the program."  The analysis used in this study uses the intermediate assumption. The reality is that under any of the three assumptions, the HI Trust Fund will face insolvency in from six to eleven years. Because the current political environment has focused the debate in terms of "preserving the solvency" of the HI Trust Fund, long-term solutions are necessary. 
<P>
The Medicare trustees have outlined three possible scenarios for Congress should it choose not to reform the Medicare program and decide simply to raise the HI payroll tax. The options range from taking immediate action to various stages of delay. Naturally, if Congress fails to take immediate steps as suggested by the trustees, the required increase in the HI payroll tax will be higher in the future than it would be if they raised the HI tax immediately. Because the trustees believe that "prompt, effective, and decisive action is necessary,"13 the analysis in this study centers around their estimate that the increase required to achieve long-term actuarial balance is 3.52 percent of taxable payroll.14<P>In order to achieve a long-term actuarial balance in the HI trust fund (permanent fiscal solvency),15 the Medicare trustees have stated that HI payroll taxes could be increased immediately or by a higher amount at some future time. If Congress opts to place the HI Trust Fund on a course towards permanent fiscal solvency through an additional increase in the percentage of taxable income, this will mean 3.52 percent in additional taxation, bringing the total HI payroll tax to 6.4 percent, divided equally between employers and employees.
<P>

<b>THE TAX CONSEQUENCES IF CONGRESS FAILS TO REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<P>
Using the Heritage Foundation health care simulation model (see appendix for technical specifications), Heritage analysts have computed both the magnitude and the wage effects, by state and congressional district, of an additional 3.52 percent HI payroll tax on workers throughout the country. This analysis represents a "snapshot" of the impact of the payroll tax based on 1993 earnings data, the most recent data generally available. It indicates the impact if the tax had been in effect in 1993. Given the general growth of earnings, total costs would be even greater if the new tax were levied in 1996 or thereafter. Assuming that such a tax increase went into effect, households would face serious financial consequences.
<P><ul>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #1:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would result in a total of $123.03 billion in new taxes levied on employers and employees in its first year of implementation.  Had the increase been in effect in 1993, the aggregate increase in taxes would range from $101.2 million on wage earners in Wyoming to a high of $7.74 billion on wage earners in California during the first year. Businesses in those states would face a similar levy. Other high tax states would include New York ($9 billion, split between employers and employees), Texas ($8 billion), and Florida ($5.9 billion). As earnings and payroll costs increase in future years, tax revenues also would increase.
<p>
Earners in different congressional districts in some cases would face heavy new tax burdens. In aggregate, the 14th district of New York would be hardest hit ($362,000 each on workers and employers), followed by the 29th district of California ($303,000).
<p>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #2:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would have a significant impact on employees' earnings, equal to a $115.6 billion loss in earnings if its effect had been felt fully in 1993. Since most of the payroll tax on employers in practice is passed through to employees in reduced earnings, the total impact on workers is larger than the increase in direct payroll taxes. On average, using an 88 percent "pass through," and had the tax increase been fully in effect in 1993, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would range from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. To put this in perspective, average wage earnings ranged in 1993 from $19,840 in Arkansas to $32,659 in New Jersey. Thus, the loss would not be insignificant for the average wage earner. Workers, on average, would experience a negative impact on their earnings exceeding $1,000 per year in both the District of Columbia ($1,052) and Alaska ($1,002). Other states in which the negative impact on workers' earnings would be substantial include Connecticut ($996), Massachusetts ($992), Maryland ($980), and New York ($954). This is based on 1993 earnings. In future years, the size of this cost to employees would increase proportionately with the increase in employee earnings compared with 1993.
<P>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #3:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would be larger than the tax increase of 1993. Enacted as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Clinton Administration's tax recommendations amounted to $262.5 billion over five years, the largest single tax increase in American history. But if Congress fails in its efforts to reform and restructure Medicare, and resorts to a 3.52 percent additional payroll tax to shore up the financially troubled hospitalization program, the HI tax increase could exceed it. According to the analysis conducted by the Medicare trustees, the revenues of such a payroll tax could reach $711.0 billion over just five years,16 almost tripling the huge 1993 Clinton tax increase.
</ul><p>

<b>WHY THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE EVEN WORSE</b>
<p>
If Congress fails to reform Medicare and resorts instead to a heavy new payroll tax to rescue the Part A Trust Fund from bankruptcy, even an increase as high as 3.52 percent, that new level of taxation on America's working families will still be insufficient to maintain the program in its current form. The reason is that the other part of Medicare, the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program (SMI, or Part B), will require an alarming increase in general tax support to continue paying for physician and outpatient services. While Medicare Part B, because of its design, is not threatened with financial insolvency, its costs are exploding. Over 70 percent of these costs today are borne by taxpayers. Under current law, the Congressional Budget Office projects that taxpayers already will be spending $370.5 billion in taxes over the next five years, subsidizing 75 percent of the Supplementary Medical Insurance program.

<h2>APPENDIX</h2><br>
<b>COST CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS<br>
<p>

State-Level Analysis Assumptions</b>
<p><a href="fyi62cmp.html">Data Table: Cost of a 3.52% Medicare Tax by State</a><br>
<p>
The national aggregate of employee earnings was derived from the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. These earnings are for 1993. The cost calculations assume the payroll tax increase had been in effect that year:  the normal growth in earnings means that the payroll tax and its associated costs would be higher in 1996 and subsequent years.
<p>
Due to the nature of self-reported income surveys, the CPS generally underestimates earnings. In order to compensate for this, we compared the CPS total with the national employee and proprietor earnings reported in the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i>  table on national income in 1993 (as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, <i>Survey of Current Business</i>, April 1994) in order to develop a multiplier to adjust the CPS reported earnings.
<p>
After April 1986, all state and local employees were required to pay Medicare taxes. In 1991, however, the law was amended to allow those hired prior to that date to opt out. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that as of March 1994, 1.7 million workers were not covered by Medicare. Using the 1.7 million figure we removed those workers and their earnings from our totals based on the state-by-state distribution of state and local employees and their earnings in the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>.
<p>
Based on a survey of economic literature estimating the "pass-through" wage effect of employer mandates by health care econometrics firm Lewin-VHI, we assumed 88 percent of the cost of the additional tax to be passed to employee in reduced compensation.17  We also assumed that the pass-through had fully occurred. Therefore, we assumed the total cost of the additional Medicare tax to employees to be 88 percent of the business's share of the Medicare tax (about 1.56 percent) in addition to the 1.76 percent tax on wages paid directly by the employee. 
<p>
 Total cost to employees (direct and indirect pass through) was divided by the total number of wage earners who did not opt out to determine the average cost per wage earner by state.
<p>

<b>Congressional District Analysis Assumptions</b>
<p><a href="wel-62mp.html">Map-Index of Supporting Data</a><p>
To calculate the cost of the Medicare HI tax at the congressional district level, we used the 1990 U.S. Census STF-3D file in addition to our state-level findings, calculated using the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i> . The 1990 STF-3D file contains congressional district data, while the <i>Current Population Survey</i> data can be analyzed at the individual and state levels.
<p>
In order to account for increases in earnings that occurred 1990-1993, we compared the 1990 STF-3D numbers with the earnings for each state, calculated using the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. We assumed that for each state, increases in wages were normally distributed within the state.
<p>
It also was necessary to remove from our analysis the earnings of those state and local employees exempt from Medicare taxes. To do so we again compared the distribution of state and local employees in congressional districts, calculated using the 1990 STF-3D numbers, with the 1994 CPS state-level distribution of earnings of the exempt 1.7 million state and local employees. As in the case of earnings, we assumed those state and local employees were normally distributed throughout the state's congressional districts. In addition, we did not account for state and local employee wage differentials between congressional districts.
<p>
The total number of households per congressional district also has changed since 1990, so we compared the total households from the STF-3D file with total households in the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i> to calculate the number of households per CD in 1993. We determined the cost per household in our analysis; however, because this includes households with no income, the actual cost to households with income will be higher.

<i>NEW YORK, JANUARY 12</i>
<hr>
<h2>This 'Liar' Business </h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>





I want in on the Hillary business, for reasons natural (that's where 
the action is) and unnatural (I am among those who think it important 
what language you use). The water she lives in had been getting hotter 
and hotter, and then a few days ago columnist William Safire of the 
New York Times ran his diagnostic fingers over the accumulation and 
concluded that Hillary Clinton is "a congenital liar." 
<p>
One winces a little on seeing the charge against her expressed in 
exactly that language. To begin with, we don't know -- do we? -- 
whether when she emerged from the womb shouting Beeeh! she knew very 
well that the situation called for her to shout Baaah! but as a 
congenital liar she could not avoid dissimulation. A liar being 
someone who somewhere along the line took to telling untruths, a 
congenital liar is someone who tells untruths because the truth simply 
won't come out of his lips. In the feud a few years ago between 
Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, kindled by Miss McCarthy's saying 
nobody could believe anything Miss Hellman said, Lillian complained, 
and Mary reiterated that everything Lillian writes is a lie, including 
"and" and "the." 
<p>
At that level, of course, charges and countercharges become polemical 
flourishes intended to titillate onlookers. They are no longer 
clinical distinctions between the truth and the non-truth. So by 
adding the qualifier "congenital," Mr. Safire gave away too much 
ground, and soon the whole country was seeing a smiling President 
telling a crowded press conference that, as President of the United 
States, he suffered under certain "constraints" which prevented him 
from dealing with Mr. Safire as he'd have done in private life. For 
those whose imagination wasn't keen enough to know just what that was, 
the White House press secretary Mike McCurry had given a hint. Citizen 
Bill Clinton would have poked Citizen Bill Safire in the nose. 
<p>
Now what seeps through all that stuff is, actually, some idea of what 
remains of the House of Chivalry. Not much. When that house was 
intact, you would never see a man seated in a bus while a woman was 
left standing. Any man who threatened publicly to poke another man in 
the nose wouldn't be noticed nowadays, on the grounds that that threat  was probably made in a crowded bar, where nobody heard or cared, or 
else it was made in a press conference announcing what the intention 
was of Mike Tyson to do to the challenger sometime in the future in 
Las Vegas. It is really surprising that the women's lobby didn't 
resent the language used by Mr. Clinton against Mr. Safire on the 
grounds that manifestly, it was sexist-talk. He wouldn't have said it 
if Mr. Safire's quarry had been a male. 
<p>
And so we arrive at the piquancy in this situation. Mrs. Clinton said 
a half-dozen things that weren't correct, most conspicuously that she 
hadn't personally insisted on firing the seven-man White House Travel 
staff. In fact, according to her ex-employee and Clinton pal Mr. 
Watkins, she did want them fired. 
<p>
But what fascinates is that this episode and a few others having to do 
with the nature of her relationship with the Madison Guaranty outfit 
invite the formal scrutiny of investigating panels and, theoretically, 
the courts themselves, because perjury is contingently involved. 
<p>
But the man who, if he weren't President, would poke Bill Safire in 
the nose, "lies," if that is the word for it, quite consistently. 
Anyone who has watched the tube over the past couple of months will 
have lost count of the frequency of Mr. Clinton's telling the people 
that the objective of the Republican Party's budget drive is to hurt 
the old, the homeless, the sick, the lame, the children, and the 
environment. If something is not true, and it is nonetheless affirmed, 
that gives us a lie, and the generator of that lie, is -- a liar? 
Forget the "congenital" business -- about which most of us don't know 
very much, since our memory reaches back only to when Mr. Clinton in 
the Sixties took marijuana but didn't inhale. How is it that 
politicians are shielded as they are? To get to the White House one 
promises one thing, does another. Or else reaffirms on Monday what one 
repudiates on Tuesday? Some would go so far as to guess that if he 
were simply "Mr." Clinton even then he wouldn't actually go to Mr. 
Safire's office and poke him in the nose. Clinton reserves such 
activity for larger bodies, like the Republican Party, or Congress, or 
the voters who vote for the wrong people. The voters who were lied to.

<hr>
<h2>Forbes's Rich Problem</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>






Steve Forbes's campaign is revealing, challenging, and amusing. The sheer improbability, last November, that he would get anywhere tended 
to interdict any other consideration of his candidacy, yet here he is, 
running second in various states. In the debate in Iowa on Saturday 
the other candidates all consolidated as a Get Forbes posse. He 
escaped, but bruises landed, inflicted by fellow Republicans, of 
course, and, in many cases, fellow conservatives. 
<p>
He has split the conservative vote, and, accordingly, Senator Gramm 
went after him lustily. This was in part a professional obligation 
(there is no way Phil Gramm can stop Dole and share affections with 
Steve Forbes) and in part personal (Senator Gramm is smarting from 
Forbes's ads).
<p>
Forbes has of course been baiting Gramm in a television and radio 
campaign that has suffused Iowa with Forbes's agenda. His complaint is 
that Gramm's insistence on a reduction in government expenses pays 
insufficient heed to the possibilities that open up under a return to 
supply-side policies. Gramm counters that you can't have effective tax 
relief without asphyxiative government policies that would hugely 
reduce government expenditures. Without exactly saying so, Forbes 
resists this, preferring to cite the prodigality of growth when the 
yokes are removed from the taxpayers' necks. It is a nice quarrel, and 
conservatives tend to hope that both sides will win. 
<p>
Now the special vulnerabilities of Forbes on the larger political 
scene are difficult for such as Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan and indeed 
Lamar Alexander to cope with. His company has a private airplane 
blissfully named Capitalist Tool. And his company has a gorgeous big 
yacht, which will take you around the world, if you press the right 
button. Now the Internal Revenue Service, over the years, has examined 
the expense accounts of these two amenities with ferocious attention, 
but the records absolutely establish a business purpose in maintaining 
them. The primary weight of their expense rests on the shoulders of 
the stockholders, who are the Forbes family. 
<p>
There is that, plus also the general political disability of disposing 
of great wealth. The public doesn't find this disqualifying -- FDR was 
relatively rich -- and anyway, right-wing inclinations do not go in 
lockstep with wealth. (Bill Gates voted for Clinton.) In 1958 there 
were three contenders for statewide office in New York. Averell 
Harriman was standard-bearer of the left wing of the Democratic Party; 
challenger Nelson Rockefeller was standard-bearer of the left wing of 
the Republican Party; Corliss Lamont was, pure and simple, a Communist 
fellow-traveler running on a socialist ticket. All three gentlemen 
were heirs to great fortunes. 
<p>
So that the Republican public, in a Republican primary, is not going 
to be frightened off by the documentation of Steve Forbes's wealth. It 
is a slightly different matter that he has put that wealth entirely at 
the disposal of his campaign. That understandably irritates those poor 
souls who have to spend half of every day collecting nickels and dimes 
from house to house; but there is no indication that the public is put 
off on the matter, although there may be a considerable difference 
between the cited popularity of Steve Forbes and the number of people 
who will actually turn up to vote for him. 
<p>
His primary problem has to do with the widespread belief that a flat 
tax would hurt the middle class, specifically, those who earn between 
$70,000 and $200,000. Forbes acknowledges that for the first year, 
perhaps two years, taxing families with incomes over $36,000 at 17 per 
cent, disallowing deductions, and immunizing dividend and estate 
income would mean a deficit, but one which, he vows, would soon 
disappear under the promptings of an invigorated marketplace. But of 
course the first thing done by the other candidates and their 
accomplices was to try to figure out how much less this would 
hypothetically cost Steve Forbes personally, compared with what they 
figure out he paid last year. 
<p>
The estimated saving is substantial. Forbes was justifiably inflamed 
at the preposterous suggestion that someone is going to run for 
President of the United States in order to spur on a tax reform that 
will save the new President money on his income tax. The gentle Steve 
Forbes waxed wroth on the point and retorted that he will have spent 
twenty times the hypothetical saving on his presidential campaign. A 
rather convincing point: It doesn't really make sense to spend $20 
million in a campaign in order prospectively to diminish one's tax 
payments by about $200,000. Some will remember the character in the 
Hollywood movie whom the all-powerful, manipulative gang offered 
either of two alternative posts: Commissioner of Baseball, or 
President of the United States. William Powell paused, twitched his 
moustache, then said, "Which pays more?" 
<p>
Mr. Forbes isn't playing a political part, isn't going to be 
President, but he has done an endearing thing.
<p>

<h2>Is There a God Behind Religion?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
Wm. F. Buckley Jr.


 

Most public discussion of religion has to do with earnest 
constitutional and political quarrels. Does the First Amendment 
prohibit the recitation of a public prayer in the public schools? The 
display of a crcche at Christmas? The display of the Ten Commandments? 
Then there are the derivative issues: Is the Christian Coalition 
dominating GOP politics? Do Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed have a 
stranglehold on the Republican Platform on the question of abortion? 
Homosexual marriages? Euthanasia?
<p>
Odd, but almost never does the discussion turn on religion itself. 
i.e., what is the excitement all about? If students heard a prayer in 
the public schools, or if religious sentiment crystallized against 
abortion, what is it all about? The public schools, for two 
generations, have proceeded without any notice taken of religion, as 
the Supreme Court has decreed. Interesting question, What about non-
public schools? Obviously one begins by excluding schools that are 
explicitly religious in orientation. One would expect that in the 
Catholic parochial schools, the Orthodox Jewish schools, the Episcopal 
schools, religion is an explicit factor. But what about others? There 
are 240 private boarding schools in America. What do they do? The 
Supreme Court isn't going to tell them what to do. They can worship 
the god Pan, if that's what the trustees decree. 
<p>
One doesn't know where to turn for an answer to that question: How 
does religion fare in the private non-denominational schools? But the 
mere inquiry provokes the curious mind to ask what is, one supposes, 
the primary question: Why?
<p>
A recent visitor remarks that attendance at her Episcopal Church has, 
in the past half-dozen years, increased by 100 per cent. Why? Is 
there, as we are here and there told, a religious "revival" in the 
offing?
<p>
Again: Why?
<p>
The anthropologists are there to tell us that it is in human nature to 
aspire for a spiritual life, even as it is in human nature to wish to 
exercise sexual appetites, and of course it is biologically necessary 
to appease hunger. The idea of the sociological set is, in effect, to 
say, There there, Mrs. Jones, we quite understand why you believe in 
God, etc., but kindly do so in a fashion that doesn't get in the way 
of public affairs, you know, like bicycle paths, or the diminishing 
supply of buffaloes. 
<p>
What surprises is the relative reticence of the religious community. 
In the United States, overwhelmingly, the Christian community. A 
politician running for office is prepared to say that he believes in 
school prayer because he insists that the Constitution does not 
prohibit school prayer. But ambient folkways prevent him from saying: 
I think Jesus Christ was divine and therefore I find the lessons He 
taught us illuminating and vital in affecting our lives.
<p>
Wow!
<p>
Does that make him an anti-Semite?
<p>
No no, Madam. He is an anti-Semite only in the sense that the patron 
of the Yankees is anti the Red Sox. Never mind the difference in the 
order of gravity, the point is that a Christian exercises his faith 
without believing that others' faiths are wrong, misled; even as, 
mutatis mutandis, the Yankee patron, always free to apostatize from 
his allegiance, nevertheless proceeds to demonstrate his loyalty. The 
Christian owes absolutely nothing more to other religions than a 
respectful toleration of them. The wonderful old saw about the inter-
religious conference in Tokyo fifty years ago is amusingly relevant. 
After the ecumenical blessing at the banquet, one participant turns to 
the pilgrim on his right. "My miserable superstition is Buddhism. What 
is your religion?"
<p>
It would be grand to hear public figures in the course of discussing 
this or that public or private question say, "Well on this matter, I 
am instructed, or try to be, by the New Testament, which, you know, 
tells us that greed is, well, you know, wrong. So is adultery. . . . I 
don't say I live up to the Christian calling, all I say is that I wish 
I did because I recognize it as truth."
<p>
There is no reason at all for the listener whose god speaks different 
tongues to object to the superordination of Christ over, say, Buddha. 
But the question before the house is: Why don't people say, more 
often, Yes, I love my country and my flag, and my God, but let me tell 
you Who my God is, and why what He has told me has for years and years 
given me comfort and fortitude and stimulated my love for -- yes, you, 
Madam. <p>

<title>Buckley: Has the WTO Threatened Us? -- 1/23/96</title>

<h2>
Has the WTO Threatened Us?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Well, it happened: the World Trade Organization ruled against an 
existing law, and people are up in arms. Candidates Dole and Buchanan 
have suggested that this is on the order of the British navy moving in 
to restore the crown as sovereign in U.S. affairs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here is the quarrel. Brazil and Venezuela, in recent months, attempted 
to bring into the United States what we might as well call "dirty 
oil," meaning that it is oil that contains a higher density of 
pollutants than is permitted by the Clean Air Act. So, we denied that 
oil access to the American market. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A suit was filed with the WTO by Brazil and Venezuela, which asserted, 
correctly, that the same quality of oil turned down at our frontier 
was in fact being pumped, sold, and burned within the United States. 
This is, plain and simple, discriminatory, and of course the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade exists in order to protest 
discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the United States has several defenses, none of them conclusive -- 
they are an attenuation of the violation rather than an excuse for it. 
It happens that the load of oil being permitted to market 
notwithstanding its high pollution content was something on the order 
of an exception. The franchise was given with a view to saving a 
considerable deposit of oil, on the understanding that the 
international standard would be invoked beginning in 1998. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now if one engages in a treaty of this kind there has to be an arbiter 
somewhere. The disarmament treaties of the Twenties and Thirties 
failed for many reasons, but one of them was that there was no 
effective tribunal to call attention to the violations of Germany, 
Italy, and Japan. For that reason, a court was set up, armed with the 
power to make a finding (subject to appeal) and to levy either a fine, 
if the situation was not rectifiable, or else compensation (to the 
wounded nation or industry). The court, having ruled against the 
United States, has not come through with a specified penalty, and in 
any event, this being the very first ruling the WTO has come through 
with, there is abounding procedural confusion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One source of the confusion is the motives and political interests of 
the people involved, directly and indirectly. Mickey Kantor is of 
course our trade representative. He is having a hell of a time. On the 
one hand, he very much wants to defend the environmental code approved 
by President Clinton, which means, No dirty oil. On the other hand, he 
desperately wishes to be outside the line of fire directed against 
those who tolerate an extra-national body telling the United States 
what to do. To date, Mr. Kantor has said that in fact the court is 
factually correct; that the court has no right, really, to rule on 
U.S. environmental laws; and that the United States will appeal -- 
probably. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now the long perspective on the question is that the GATT treaty was a 
dozen years in formation, under the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton 
Administrations, with the Congress as a prime mover. Our motives were 
simple: most trade discrimination in the world is against U.S. 
producers. We have, we thought, and thought correctly, more to gain 
than to lose by endorsing a court that could actually hand down 
rulings of the kind that free up trade. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan are talking about the hideous nature of an 
extra-national authority, and Mr. Buchanan even said that when he 
became President, the first thing he would do is repeal the GATT 
treaty. But the U.S. position is made difficult by the simple fact 
that a) we promoted and passed the GATT agreement (while avoiding the 
treaty requirement to come in with two-thirds of the Senate vote), 
endorsing b) a fact-finding body (the court) that would look into 
complaints and c) dispose of sanctions in the event a signatory was 
found guilty of discriminatory practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We now have several alternatives. We can resign from GATT, which would 
be a long-term invitation to restricted trading; or we can pay the 
fine or compensation on the Brazilian and Venezuelan oil; or we can 
modify the Clean Air Act to exempt the privileged producer of the 
dirty oil. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What we can't do is argue that somebody took away our lollipop. We are 
a grown-up nation, and if we pulled a fast one at the expense of a law 
we ourselves promoted and ratified, then we should take the 
punishment. If ever the WTO engages in systematic anti-U.S. rulings, 
why it becomes simple. We pull out. But not before that happens.

<title>Buckley: School Uniforms?! -- 1/26/96</title>

<h2>
School Uniforms?!
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
One commentator dealt bravely with the seven general categories of 
national problems addressed by President Clinton and finished his 
appraisal with the sentence, "Why on earth does the leader of the free 
world have to concern himself with school uniforms?"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Well now, there are those who found that the most novel and 
potentially the most resonant sentence in the President's address. 
Flash ahead ten years, close your eyes, answer the question: "What was 
the highlight of President Clinton's State of the Union speech in 
1996?" Right, the answer will be: Oh, that's the speech in which he 
came out for school uniforms. . . . To say that was the "highlight" of 
the speech is of course to take liberties, consigning all else he said 
to generic political thought. The President declared in favor of 
health care, law and order, unity, growth, and husbandry. So does 
every candidate running for President. It was the school-uniform bit 
that caught the attention of the unwary, who asked first, What does 
Mr. Clinton know about school uniforms? and asked second, How is it 
that he intuits their importance?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not long ago a public-school teacher in New York City wrote to the 
Wall Street Journal a letter bristling with authenticity, relating 
that the foremost problem in the city's schools was: discipline. In 
the absence of it, she complained, practically nothing else is 
possible. What has been called the "hijacker's leverage" is operative 
here. Just as one terrorist can dictate the movements of a super-jet 
carrying five hundred passengers, so one unruly student can, for as 
long as he is able to keep it up, affect the climate of a schoolroom. 
In the late Sixties, one senior at Harvard appeared at the office of 
the president hours before the Commencement ceremony demanding that he 
be scheduled as a speaker during the ceremony. If not, he informed the 
stunned president, the ceremony would not proceed. A half-dozen noisy 
protestors, even in an assembly of two thousand, can make solemn 
processions impossible; as also, studious classrooms. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The head of Cardinal Hayes High School in New York made a point of it 
some years ago. That school -- formally a diocesan school although 
many of its students are of other faiths, 85 per cent of them 
minorities -- has arresting academic attainments; 85 per cent of its 
graduates go on to college, compared with less than 15 per cent in 
comparable public schools made up of identically endowed students. It 
is very important, the principal told his visitor, to insist on a 
school uniform. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why? one naturally wondered. Because, he said, the symbol irradiates 
several things. The first is that the student is a member of a 
regulated community. When you are in uniform, your dress bespeaks 
hierarchy. The symbol is very important. At Cardinal Hayes the 
students are simply not expected to be late in arriving at school, and 
punctuality is accepted as a part of the system: related, in a way, to 
the requirement that the students wear their simple grey jackets and 
pants, a shirt and a tie. On the question of disorder in the 
classrooms it is as simple as that there is no disorder in the 
classrooms. Defenders of the antinomian behavior of so many public-
school students confide to you that the reason for the success of the 
private schools is that they simply expel anyone who is in any way 
nonconformist. But such chaos-defenders run into statistics: 2 per 
cent of the students at Cardinal Hayes are expelled. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The maintenance of order, the minor conformity that issues from the 
wearing of identical uniforms, is always a latent problem because the 
schools deal with boys and girls who are going through their unruly 
period in life. The sociologist who some time ago remarked that a 
single broken and unrepaired window is an invitation to corollary 
shambles gave us all an epiphany. Of course it is true! we realize. 
Student unruliness is met in different seasons in different ways. At 
Eton in the 1830s the students outnumbered faculty by about 100 to 1, 
and the notorious Doctor Keate attempted to solve his problem by 
flogging a dozen students every day. We shrink from such measures, but 
ought to welcome civilized substitutes, and the school uniform is the 
beginning of wisdom in this field, and we say hurrah to the President 
for coming upon that insight.

<h2>
Misfire On Drug Policy
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The bipartisan Council on Crime in America, whose most conspicuous 
spokesman is William Bennett, does fine work, but when it touches on 
the matter of drugs its analytical powers simply decompose, as though 
the writer were high on crack cocaine or the legal stuff.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last week the Council exploded in opposition to the call for an 
approach to the legalization of drugs made by seven writers (myself 
included) in this journal. To the title of the symposium -- "The War 
on Drugs Is Lost" -- the Council replies that that is most certainly 
not so. To the end of proving this, it cites the reduction of drug use 
by non-addicts. It declined by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The 
planted axiom of course is that that decline is owing to the war on 
drugs. But what is it that accounts for the decline in the number of 
users of tobacco during the same period, from 33.5 million to 26.5 
million? The use of tobacco is not illegal. But since 1979, and 
beginning even before that, the deleterious effect of cigarettes was 
so persuasively argued that even William Bennett gave up smoking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A look at the formal side of the war on drugs is required. If 
something is illegal, then the law that makes it so is effective to 
the extent that it imprisons those who violate it, thereby 
hypothetically reducing the number of lawbreakers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That would seem obvious, but isn't to the distinguished members of the 
Council on Crime in America. In 1985, 811,000 arrests were made for 
drug offenses. In 1994, 1.35 million arrests were made for drug 
offenses. Does that mean that the war on drugs is effective? Well, no. 
An effective law diminishes, rather than increases, the number of 
violators who have to be arrested. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And then of course one asks, If 1.35 million drug users were arrested 
in 1994, how many drug users were not arrested? The Council informs us 
that there are more than 4 million casual users of cocaine (defined as 
people who use it less than once a week). How so? Why haven't they 
been arrested? And goes on to say that there are over 2.2 million 
heavy (at least weekly) users. That makes a total of 6.2 million who 
violate the law from once a week, to every two weeks or so. How 
effective is the war when such figures can be cited? Now take the big 
one. There are over 70 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, 
and about 10 million who continue to do so. Why aren't they in jail? 
Does the Council on Crime in America really wish that they were in 
jail?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It must have embarrassed the Council that the same week it sputtered 
forth on the great success of the war on drugs, The Economist cited 
another Council report on crime in America which gainsays its entire 
position on the drug war. We learn that only one criminal is jailed 
for every hundred violent crimes committed; that over one-half of 
America's convicted felons are not sentenced to prison (because, in 
part, the prisons are full); that the most violent criminals serve 
less than one-half their sentences, and the average murderer released 
in 1992 from a state prison had served only 5.9 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Economist cites the experience of a patrolman in Haughville, a 
scruffy area of Indianapolis. "He drives up and down in the evenings, 
past anoraked figures who stand outside liquor stores and turn their 
faces from him. He can guess what they are; few people apart from drug 
dealers stand around on nights like this, when the puddles in the 
potholes freeze hard. Besides, Patrolman Reichle knows most of them: 
he reckons he has arrested one in five of these young men." City 
prosecutors "do not even bring charges against drug dealers until they 
have been arrested several times. Those who do get charged and found 
guilty will not go to prison, unless they have other convictions. 
President Bill Clinton's call for a crackdown on drug dealers sounds 
pretty hollow in Haughville."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such is overcrowding in state prisons in Indiana -- notwithstanding 
that the national increase in prison space is threefold since we 
decided to wage hard war on drugs -- that even a relatively new 
American prison might have merited describing by Charles Dickens. 
"Prisoners pass their days in narrow, ill-lit cages; there are no 
chairs or tables, so the men pace up and down like zoo animals or 
slouch upon the floor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what has the war done? It has made a mockery of an anti-drug law 
that is simply ignored by millions; it has induced violent felonies in 
pursuit of drug profits; and it is self-evidently powerless to do 
anything about the recent increase in marijuana use by reckless 
adolescents. It is a pity that men and women of the moral and 
intellectual character of William Bennett treat drug legalization as 
the equivalent of moral acquiescence in drug abuse, when other reasons 
for repealing our stupid laws are so clearly articulated, primary 
among them to relieve non-drug users from the heavy load they bear in 
the phony and ineffective war. One forgets -- who won the Hundred 
Years War back then? Was it really necessary to take it on for one 
hundred years?

<title>Buckley: The Problem of the Fatherless Child I -- 2/6/96</title>

<h2>
The Problem of the Fatherless Child I
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The weekend paper ran a cartoon by Mike Smith of the North American 
Syndicate. In a sequence, the freckled little girl with long hair, 
reproduced eight times with eight balloons, tells us what she is 
thinking: "This is Cindy." "Cindy is 13 years old." "Which means she 
can't drink." "She can't drive." "She can't even buy cigarettes." 
"Which is all the better for the health and safety . . . of her 
daughter." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In October, in this space, I designated the single-parent household, 
as so many others have, as the primary social problem in America. I 
meditated that since the steep rise in illegitimate births over the 
past thirty years (from 5 per cent to 18 per cent among whites; 25 to 
63 per cent among blacks) few ideas have crystallized on how to arrest 
a development that is afflicting one million children per year (they 
will in their lifetime -- mostly before they reach maturity -- run a 
600 per cent greater chance than children raised by two parents of 
life in poverty, criminal activity, addiction to drugs, illiteracy). 
The single novel idea, developed at systematic length, is that of 
Charles Murray, who in his book Losing Ground endorsed an end to 
public welfare as a disincentive to sexual promiscuity (and to sloth). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I asked readers to share with me their own suggestions on how to deal 
with the problem. The reply was overwhelming, over eight hundred 
letters, and I take this opportunity to thank them deeply and to 
apologize for the mechanical impossibility of acknowledging them 
individually.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no mistaking the anger out there. It tends to focus on that 
which is most palpable: The cost imposed on the individual whose 
sexual activity is conventional, by those who proceed to produce 
children who then become, in virtue of the father's absence and 
dereliction, charges to them. One mother writes that she thinks it 
wrong, somehow, that her daughter and son-in-law are postponing a 
family until their material fortunes improve, yet find themselves 
helping to pay for the support of other mothers who do not postpone 
motherhood until after they are married.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some who complain focus on the moral dereliction of the here-today 
gone-tomorrow sire, some focus primarily on the utilitarian question: 
What to do about people who misbehave in a world in which misbehavior 
is usually not defined in a moral context. It may be legal misbehavior 
to deny an opportunity for equal treatment to a minority 18-year old, 
but it is not legal misbehavior to deny equal treatment to an infant 
born out of wedlock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some do focus on the quite extraordinary insouciance of the young 
generation of studs. One lawyer from South Dakota who has heard "over 
seven hundred child-support cases" sends along a transcript (the names 
of the principals are blacked out), of an illuminating example.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The situation was as follows. The young defendant is brought in to 
answer for his failure to send the required check to the mother of two 
of his children. We learn that he has sired a third child by another 
woman, and his complaint is that he simply cannot earn enough money to 
satisfy the demands being made on him, and the court simply has to 
recognize this.
<p>
REFEREE: So you're saying that you're going to hide out from the child 
support obligation?
<p>
DAD: I would if need be.<p> 
REFEREE: You know it's possible that could be a felony?
<p>
DAD: Yes, I know that.
<p>
REFEREE: You, I assume voluntarily engaged in intercourse with each of 
those women, is that much correct?
<p>
DAD: Mm-hmm.
<p>
REFEREE: And the consequence was that on at least three occasions 
these women conceived and had children?
<p>
DAD: Yeah.
<p>
REFEREE: And that certainly isn't society's fault.
<p>
DAD: I never said it was.
<p>
REFEREE: You know, society's not treating you unfairly. You weren't 
required to have any children.
<p>
DAD: Well, I don't think it's, you know, up to society to not let me 
have a living at the same time, either. . . . There's got to be a 
compromise so the State can be happy and I can be happy too.
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Respondents were all but unanimous in asking the law to bear down on 
the fathers, mostly absent. Some suggest DNA tests immediately after 
birth, when more often than not the father shows up proudly, even if 
it is only for a few weeks: do a DNA on the baby and the father, to 
preserve perpetual evidence of biological responsibility. And then, 
not a few respondents ask, Why is it not criminal, the activity we 
speak of?

<h2>
The Problem of the Fatherless Child II
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
We pursue the social problem of one million children per year born 
into fatherless homes and review some of the letters from hundreds of 
readers who wrote in to make suggestions on how to deal with a problem 
that began its steep rise approximately in 1965. And many ask, Why 
ought it not to be a crime to father a child out of wedlock?
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed. It's a crime to drive when one has had too much to drink, 
though the statistical chances the driver will hurt somebody when his 
blood alcohol is 0.1 are less than that he will have hurt the child he 
sired. Two out of five black men in Washington, D.C., between the ages 
of 18 and 25 are in jail, on probation, or being prosecuted, in an 
area in which over 75 per cent of black children are born to an 
unmarried mother.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fair question.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several respondents remind us that there are laws against statutory 
rape. But the paradox is that if you have sex with a girl under 18 you 
can be jailed in most states, but if you have sex with a girl under 18 
who becomes pregnant, the organically required "rape" dematerializes. 
And over 30 per cent of the fatherless children are born to mothers 
under twenty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The indignation, resentment, and scorn came in profusely, and from the 
tenor of most letters one could discern that they were not written by 
censorious temperaments. A great many wondered what has happened to 
the primary sanction against illegitimacy in the past, which has been 
shame. Shame before God, yes, but also before the community. "She has 
to feel the pain of society's anger and disapproval of her 
irresponsible, selfish act. Pain hurts, there's a recoiling reaction 
to it." "Bring back the old stocks of the Puritan times . . . 
Wrongdoers could go to work and support their families but when not at 
their places of employment spend so many hours a day on public 
exhibition."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some call for compulsory national service for the father, penal in 
character . . . Yes, deny them what most desire intensely, a driver's 
license . . . Some would make the father the legal custodian of the 
child, taking the mother for special training.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several decry the failure of black leaders sufficiently to emphasize 
the terrible damage done by wanton sex. "If thirty years ago I were a 
Ku Klux Klan leader who would want to do major damage to blacks, I 
would invent the welfare system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many favor biological intervention. Norplants, vasectomies, tubal 
ligations. Many caution against the facile alternative of abortions, 
but some, including self-professed Catholics, argue that abortion 
under the circumstances is merciful . . . Why not move against the 
lubricity of the rock and roll culture, by such measures as advocated 
by Senator Dole? Or, "Establish public brothels in strategic areas 
where illegitimacy is most prevalent."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proffered approaches depended heavily on what respondents saw as 
the primary cause of the blight. The blame is, for some, primarily 
that of the government (welfare, lax law enforcement, the improper use 
of tax revenues). For others, the culture -- the movies, TV, rap 
music, pornography, ultra-feminism, divorce. And for others the 
evanescence of the idea of -- Sin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"There is only one solution, and you know what it is. The moral law of 
the Supreme Being." "The deterrents you outlined in your column? You 
called them the equivalent of Pentagon contingency plans to invade 
Switzerland: i.e., they're not going to happen. You're right. The sad 
fact is that the one major success the liberals have had is the 
destruction of the family during the last 30 years. What worked for 
the first 190 years in this country is no longer possible or even 
worth writing about. The family is the basic unit of our society and 
it has a cancer. And yet the components of the cancer -- illegitimacy, 
promiscuity, adultery, increased divorce, homosexuality -- are 
accepted as 'lifestyles' and even exalted. . . . "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I reiterate my thanks to the 800 plus who wrote in. The research in 
hand will be made available to any responsible researcher or research 
organization willing to bear the cost of reproduction.

<title>Buckley: Oh No! Running for President? -- 2/16/96</title>

<h2>
Oh No! Running for President?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that he will run for re-election as 
President of Russia. It is his duty to "consolidate all healthy forces 
and prevent shocks that could lead to a civil war." That is quite a 
threat to toss about, something no candidate in New Hampshire has got 
around to. In the past few months Mr. Yeltsin has got rid of those of 
his lieutenants identified with the reform movement. This greatly 
surprised those members of our State Department who rued the long 
interval back in 1991 during which Gorbachev was falling apart and 
U.S. policy refused to recognize the importance of Yeltsin. We did so 
only after that dramatic day in Red Square when Yeltsin defied the 
revolutionists and soon after was elected president.
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was demoralizing to read the assessment of Yeltsin by Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, Yeltsin's former press secretary. "Power is his ideology," 
he said, "his concubine if you want, his lover -- and his passion. 
Everything that is beyond the fight for power concerns him much less." 
When that remark about Yeltsin was aired, Kostikov was instantly fired 
(he had been ambassador to the Vatican). Fifty years earlier he'd have 
been instantly executed. Even ten years ago he would have suffered 
something more resonant than dismissal from a diplomatic post.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many contenders for the presidency of Russia, but the 
thinking in some quarters is that there will be a run-off between the 
two lead candidates, and that they will be Yeltsin and Gennadi 
Zyuganov. Now Mr. Zyuganov, formerly a provincial teacher, is running 
on the Communist Party ticket and is thought the probable victor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It staggers the mind. Suppose that in Germany a politician were to run 
on the National Socialist Party ticket. He might say, "Let's see if 
this time around we can do it without killing the Jews, or invading 
France." Zyuganov being a very acute politician, it can't be said of 
him that he got tripped up into running as a Communist. As with 
Yeltsin, one can't know what this politician's internal designs or 
attachments or loyalties are. But Zyuganov proclaims his attachment to 
Communism, intending to persuade the Russians that much of the pain 
they now experience -- en route to a free society and a free market -- 
they didn't experience back then under Stalin and Brezhnev, when no 
one was ever fired from his job, prices were stable, and crime was at 
low tide. In December's parliamentary race Zyuganov faced a liberal 
challenger. At one of their encounters, posters were flaunted: 
"50,000,000 VICTIMS OF CIVIL WAR, COLLECTIVIZATION AND REPRESSION 
WOULD NOT VOTE FOR ZYUGANOV." He won handily.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great revisionism is underway. It begins by closing the memory. 
Four years ago, 84 per cent of high-school students tested knew what 
the Gulag was. Today, only 34 per cent can tell you that the Gulag was 
that great charnel, the archipelago in which twenty million Russians 
were killed, either by execution squads, or starvation, or exposure. 
Such historical tablelands, when brought to the attention of the 
Communist candidate for President, are shrugged off as incidents of 
yesteryear. "We can't answer for the mistakes of the past."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is lost sight of is the primary finding of history in the matter 
of the Communist approach to government. It is that the cruelty, the 
repression, the economic sclerosis are an organic part of the whole. 
When Gorbachev authorized glasnost his critics proved absolutely 
correct, that glasnost would need to be repealed, or else that it 
would bring on the dissolution of the Communist enterprise, because 
free speech and Communism are irreconcilable. Yeltsin is already 
moving toward economic interventionism, and in his pursuit of power 
will almost certainly go further. The Communists in China are 
experimenting with economic freedom carefully sequestered, but their 
fear of its leverage on civil rights brings them to furious 
exhibitions of power and threat; because experience teaches that 
economic freedom requires a measure of personal freedom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, after all of this, the next President of Russia might be a 
Communist. What will be his attitude toward the liberated republics? 
We know what the position is of Zhirinovsky, the hero of the super 
nationalists: bring them all back. If that were accomplished, we would 
be facing a Communist leader of a new Soviet Union and wondering, 
quite reasonably, whether it would be thought new for so very long.

<h2>
'Ideology' On Our Mind
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The point has been made, most specifically by Washington Post 
columnist David Broder, that the principal candidates for President 
shrink from "ideology." Thus Mr. Clinton separates himself from the 
Gephardt wing of the Democratic Party, and Senator Dole allows a 
certain amount of water to pass between him and Newt Gingrich. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The whole matter of ideology both vexes and enlightens political 
thought. The word is used differently in political discourse. The 
average voter will seek some consistency, or appearance of 
consistency, in a candidate's platform. The philosopher scorns 
ideology because too often it overwhelms reason, prudence, philosophy. 
The word was French and came out of the crucible of the French 
Revolution, which was the bloody complement of the American 
Revolution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Senator Phil Gramm has generally been considered the most consistent 
of the conservatives running for the Presidency this year. If you 
believe A, that government activity ought not to replace non-
government activity except when required, you will believe B, that the 
government should not run the local pizza parlor. Ideology is a body 
of ideas reflecting the social needs and aspirations of an individual, 
a group, a class, or a culture (American Heritage Dictionary). But 
ideology is also "a set of doctrines or beliefs" that form the basis 
of a political, economic, or other system. If your position on a 
political question derives from a doctrine, then you are committed to 
subordinating your political position to your doctrinal position. 
Otherwise, you tend to wobble. Some wobbling is an aspect of political 
opportunism -- Senator Gramm in Iowa did not criticize federal 
subsidies of the ethanol program, which is a relic of the Department 
of Energy's extravagances. Sometimes it is an extra-ideological 
deference to reality (let the Federal Government help Los Angeles 
after its earthquake). 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But then we begin to line up other political questions, to be 
scrutinized ideologically. And it is here that the word "presumption" 
is useful. If you believe A -- that the government should stay out of 
the way -- you believe this either dogmatically or empirically. Was it 
right to intervene in Somalia? No, if the undertaking was designed to 
transform Somalian culture -- we should know that this can't be done; 
we tried and gave up making the world safe for democracy. Yes, if the 
single objective was to prevent mass starvation. Presumptively, stay 
out. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about tariffs? Long ago, conservative doctrine shaped up in favor 
of free trade. This was, indeed, an extension of anti-government 
doctrine. A tariff is a tax paid by one American for the benefit of 
another American. But it is more than that, because it denies to the 
American consumer the advantage of competitive bidding, and 
derivatively deprives the foreigner of the wherewithal to patronize 
American production. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about educational vouchers? Conservatives will in almost every 
situation honor the supremacy of the consumer over the regulator, so 
that if Mrs. Jones wants that school for her child, not the public 
school, the conservative would seek to expedite the choice. . . . Is 
that question ideologically related to school prayer? Yes, it is: the 
state should not intrude its wishes, or its restrictions, in the 
culture of free men, freely associating with one another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Immigration? National independence? The state is by no means useless, 
as the anarchists insist. The state is a "natural" institution, and 
exercises its authority in matters that relate to the commonweal when 
these are clearly national concerns. The flow of immigration into a 
country is self-evidently the proper concern of the state inasmuch as 
only its agents can say Yes or No at the border. And the traffic needs 
to be regulated because there is a greater demand than supply. Mr. Fox 
Butterfield finished his memorable book on Communist China by quoting 
one Chinese who said that if the means to do so could be found, every 
Chinese would go to America to live. "Even the lamp posts would go." 
And sovereignty asserts a recognition that the world has yet to see 
(or even envision) a cultural unity that combines in acceptable 
priorities what we have called the American proposition.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, Mr. Clinton edges away from ideologues in his own party (every 
problem is a state problem, and every dollar earned is forfeit to the 
state's agenda), and Senator Dole tries to shape an ideologically 
lucid opposition that appeals both to voters whose dogma is 
conservative, and to those whose inclinations are conservative. It is 
tough going, as much an art as a discipline.

<title>Buckley: Buchanan And the GOP -- 2/23/96</title>

<h2>
Buchanan And the GOP
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The New Hampshire event throws light primarily on Pat Buchanan even 
though, at only a point or two ahead of Senator Dole, his victory was 
nominal. The exhilaration was there, bringing to mind that of Senator 
Eugene McCarthy in 1968 when even though he did not defeat the sitting 
President, he came close enough (at 42 per cent) to electrocute Lyndon 
Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson announced that he would not run 
for re-election. What has the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire told his 
own party?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is not instantly clear, because many of his positions are also 
held by other contestants. Steve Forbes is not the original flat-tax 
man, but he is the flat tax's primary champion -- Buchanan, with this 
or the other modification, agrees. On turning functions over to the 
states and, where possible, to individuals, Buchanan's position is 
also that of Lamar Alexander. Senator Dole took a strong stand against 
the degeneracy of Hollywood and so pleased the social conservatives, 
to whom Mr. Buchanan speaks eloquently. Buchanan is isolated from the 
others on two matters, one specific, the other general. He would 
repeal the two treaties that commit us to free trade, NAFTA and GATT. 
And he would adopt an isolationist foreign policy. The other three 
would not. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And yet when Mr. Buchanan speaks of his candidacy he singles it out as 
entirely unique, a messianic episode. And there is a sense in which he 
is correct. These things are not up for arithmetical measurement. 
Suppose one reasonably predicted that on ten positions involving 
public issues, Buchanan and Alexander (or Dole) would vote the same 
way on eight. Does that make them in the long perspective 
indistinguishable?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The answer is, No. Because Buchanan is a figure whose persona 
overwhelms the political grid. In Houston in 1992 he declared that the 
United States was engaged in a war to the death between two cultures, 
the traditional and the countercultural. Many thought him correct (I 
do), but his tone was not that of Abraham Lincoln, but that of John 
Brown. The afflatus is historically distinguished and honored, and as 
often as not the prophet is martyred. He is seldom brought on, like 
Churchill, to act as leader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is another question, a matter of public and moral psychology. 
There are those Americans (again, I include myself) who believe that 
the isolationist temptation, both politically and economically, is a 
temptation most fiercely to be avoided, since its implications can be 
lethal. Although I do not believe for one minute that, if he were 
President, Mr. Buchanan would actually rush to dismantle NATO (any 
more than I believe that if Dole were President he would immediately 
balance the budget), the fact is that Buchanan said exactly that. The 
go-it-alone insularity is reflected in his economic nostrum for 
demoralized American workingmen: Blame foreigners. Charge the Japanese 
10 per cent on imports, the Chinese 20 per cent. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political conundrum looms, as such wise men as there are in 
Republican politics acknowledge one thing, namely that there would not 
be much point in nominating Pat Buchanan with the mission of 
dispossessing President Clinton, since that is inconceivable. Buchanan 
is a prophet, not a king. That being so, practical men will pause over 
how exactly to handle the phenomenon. The memory of George Wallace 
comes to mind. In 1968 his popular strength was critical: he more or 
less owned the South, and he had a large following among hardhats in 
the industrial Midwest. But the Democrats were moving sharply left 
just then and had no time for him or for conservative Democrats in 
general. He avenged himself by running as an independent candidate, 
securing 13.5 per cent of the vote, and ensuring the election of 
Richard Nixon. Wallace's followers voted Republican for the next 
twenty years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The challenge is to detach from Buchanan that in his campaign which 
the Republican Party ought to concern itself with, and be grateful to 
him for giving it focus. Buchanan almost singlehandedly revitalized 
moral political sentiment on the matter of abortion. His call for a 
national acknowledgment of a common culture has as its symbol a vote 
against Bilingual America. His earnest suspicion of predatory 
government is repeated by other candidates, but they are toothless in 
their language by comparison. The sheer joy with which Buchanan takes 
his positions is -- a joy to hear. A long night with the master 
cheerleader. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It will end in a few weeks, and then Republicans need to hope that the 
idealistic imperative of replacing Mr. Clinton will generate the 
necessary poultices, and mobilize the common will; which requires 
reorienting America in the general direction fought for by Pat 
Buchanan.

<title>Presidential Patter</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Presidential Patter</h2>
</center>
<hr>
New York, July 11 
<p>
<p>
There were about twenty people -- mostly men, four women -- engaged
in myriad activities, including law, banking, journalism, the academy.  
They have in common a bond to the conservative political enterprise  
which, to a not inconsiderable degree, is affected by their resolutions.  
And the evening's extemporaneous subject matter was the presidential  
race. 
<p> 
The rubric called for direct speech, freed of any obligation to diplomatic  
protocol. In that spirit, one commentator confessed his sense of security  
with Senator Dole. "I feel comfortable with opportunists, because I  
always know what to expect." Dole, most agreed, is scheduled to be  
nominated, the beneficiary of a Republican tradition that consummates  
the nomination of the front-runner. 
<p>
Bush led in 1988 and of course in 1992, and was confirmed by the  
Republican Convention. Reagan led in 1980, Ford in 1976, Goldwater in  
1964. By contrast, the Democrats make way for relatively obscure  
candidates. The polls reported that 2 per cent of the American people  
knew, in January 1972, the name of George McGovern: six months later  
he was nominated for President. The polls in January 1976 recorded 3  
per cent of the public knew the name of Jimmy Carter, and 12 months  
later he was inaugurated President of the United States. 
<p>
Such arrivals of the star in the third act tend not to happen in the GOP.  
Accordingly, Mr. Dole would need to slip up, something in which he is  
practiced, but not something he has done in the past few months, during  
which his campaign has revealed near-perfect professional performance.  
Another commentator opined that Dole might well suffer during the  
campaign, when his age might become visible. FDR was able to  
campaign in 1944 as if whole in mind and body, but this is not so easily  
done any more with the ubiquitous television cameras. And even without  
a slip, there will be some heavy breathing in the voting booths at the  
prospect of sending to the White House a man who would be 73 when  
inaugurated, 77 at the turn of the century. 
<p>
A participant took the floor to pass along something he situated at least  
half way between rumor and fact. He had been told (needless to say, by a  
reliable source) that Colin Powell would figure heavily in the politics of  
1996. 
<p> 
Just to begin with, whoever gets the presidential nod, Powell is almost  
certain to be invited to run for Vice President. If indeed Mr. Dole gets  
the nomination, Powell will feel a very strong impulse to serve him as  
Vice President, on the grounds that it is all but inconceivable that Bob  
Dole would run for a second term. In other words, Colin Powell would  
be inaugurated as President in January of 2001. 
<p>
Now on this subject, the commentator went on, his word has it that  
Powell will, as scheduled, proceed to do his book tour during September  
and October. But at the end of the tour, he will make a declaration of  
principles addressed unambiguously to the political scene -- and that set  
of political principles will be unambiguously conservative. That act will  
immediately make him a presidential candidate unless he rules himself  
out, intending to accept the Vice Presidency with Dole. We need to  
remember about General Powell -- or to teach ourselves, if we did not  
know it -- that he is the most spellbinding political orator since Reagan.  
"No one else comes even close to his amalgam of dignity, self- 
deprecation, firmness, and hope.'' 
<p> 
Still, whoever it is will need to contend with Bill Clinton. An observer  
began by reciting the disqualifications of the incumbent. "Just to begin  
with, he seems to have repealed the public bias against adultery." On  
every important position he has taken conflicting stands. He is scorned  
by the rest of the world, manipulated by his own staff, arrested in his  
thinking by any visiting shaman. "Still . . . He has the powers of  
Houdini. Throw him in the trunk of the car with eight chains bound  
around him, toss the car into the ocean, and before you know it, he  
comes bobbing up to the surface.'' 
 <p>
Even now, the observer continued, Clinton is substantially up over his  
ratings of a few months ago, and it is by no means certain that he will be  
swamped by the Republican nominee. Anything can happen, which is  
bad news for the Republic, and there is no insurance policy written to  
cope with this contingency.

<title>WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE MIAs?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>What to do about the MIA's</h2>
</center>
<hr> 
<b>New York, July 14</b>
<p>
<p>
Representative Randy Cunningham of California was a navy pilot during  
the Vietnam War. He was shot down. In recalling those days, in  
Congress last week, he broke into tears as he spoke of American soldiers  
who had died in his arms. He said that the Vietnamese had killed  
American prisoners and were withholding evidence to that effect. His  
conclusion: The recognition of the government of Vietnam "is not a  
political issue for me. This is right and wrong." 
<p> 
It isn't easy to talk back to such as Mr. Cunningham, certainly not if one  
has had no such experience of imprisonment by the Vietnamese. But  
then Senator John McCain was five and a half years a prisoner who  
endured torture. So was it with Pete Peterson of Florida. Bob Kerrey of  
Nebraska wasn't a prisoner, but in pressing the goals of war he won the  
Congressional Medal of Honor. John Kerry of Massachusetts won a  
Silver Star. And these four legislators support the recognition of  
Vietnam. 
<p> 
Whatever one's conclusion in the matter, we need, on meditation, to  
reject the suggestion that this is a moral question. The recognition of de- 
facto governments is the American tradition. Cuba and North Korea are  
exceptions, and the question is, do we want Vietnam to continue as  
another exception? 
<p> 
Here are the unspoken points in the controversy. 
<p>
1. There are no Americans alive who were put down as "missing in  
action.'' How do we know this? By the application of common sense.  
Since any live American soldier, captured between 1966 and 1975,  
surely wishes to return, why would he be kept in Vietnam? 
 <p>
If the Vietnamese kept hinting that a hundred Americans -- let alone  
1,618 Americans -- were going to arrive on a Boeing 747 the day after  
the United States handed over a billion dollars or whatever, the story of  
the MIAs would be comparable to the story of the Cubans caught by  
Castro during the Bay of Pigs invasion, or the Americans held hostage  
by Iran in 1979. Nothing is more useless than a dead hostage, and for  
that reason talk about the "whereabouts" of the MIAs should be  
restricted to talk about where they are buried. 
<p> 
2. If they are buried. Stories about the ferocity of the Vietnamese are not  
exaggerated, and when Congressman Cunningham is reduced to tears  
recollecting what the Vietnamese did, we can reasonably assume that his  
memory is exact. The Vietnamese killed a number of American  
prisoners. As a matter of fact, Americans killed some Vietnamese  
prisoners. And Americans killed a great many Vietnamese women and  
children in air raids. Wars animate the dark side of human nature, and  
although there is a difference between dropping a bomb on Dresden and  
executing soldiers at Katyn, no combating army is at all times governed  
by the models endorsed by international conventions. The American  
officer in charge of the Andersonville prisoner-of-war camp a century  
ago was hanged after the war because of his treatment of prisoners,  
13,000 of whom died. He was a Confederate captain, and his victims  
were American Unionists. We can't hang the malefactors in Vietnam  
because we lost the war. The short of it is that the Vietnamese don't  
know where all their victims were buried any more than the Argentines  
know where their victims -- dating back only 25 years -- were buried, in  
part because many of them were dropped from airplanes into the sea. 
<p> 
3. The Vietnamese government in recent months has been here and there  
cooperative in tracking down graves of dead American soldiers, but that  
government has not come forward with all the records it keeps. 
 <p>
Why is this so? 
 <p>
Almost certainly because those records would reveal that many  
Americans were in fact either killed, or permitted to die of starvation or  
of wounds. It should not surprise us that such records are tenaciously  
kept from view. And one wonders what is the nature of the satisfaction  
that bereaved wives and mothers would get from knowing that the man  
they loved, mysteriously missing since that day when he was captured,  
was in fact killed not in combat, but in detention? What would we have  
accomplished except the revival of bitterness and rage? And if we are  
dealing with the psychological question alone, do we really help the  
survivor by extinguishing hope, even hope forlorn? Would it satisfy those  
who have made all but a lifelong mission in search of her, to find the  
bones of Amelia Earhart?

<title>MURDER DOWN</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>MURDER DOWN?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
 New York, July 18 
<p>
<p>
The headline was wonderfully reassuring to this part of the world.  
"Murder Rate Plunges in New York City." There are corollary decreases  
in other crime -- robberies down 22 per cent, auto theft down 25 per  
cent. The question arises: Is this a statistical blip? If not -- if it is a  
genuine trend downward -- what are its causes? More jails? Less crack  
cocaine? A dulling of the criminal spirit? 
<p>
The optimists should read the essay in the July Atlantic Monthly by  
Adam Walinsky. For that matter, so should the pessimists. It is an  
eloquent and heavily informed overview of what has happened in the  
past three decades, and Mr. Walinsky wonders why America permitted it  
to happen. Everyone deplores the high rate of crime but there is nothing  
resembling a true mobilization to combat it. 
<p>
Here are the salient figures. In the 1960s, for every violent crime  
committed we had 3.3 police officers. In 1993, for every police officer  
there were 3.4 violent crimes. Consider New Haven, Connecticut. In  
1990, with its population down 14 per cent from 1960, its robberies had  
increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 per cent. In this perspective,  
the reduction of crime in New York is, however welcome, a mere fillip.  
And the figures on police stretch out to less than one-tenth the effective  
police power of thirty years ago. ". . . in another formulation, each police  
officer today must deal with 11.45 times as many violent crimes as his  
predecessor of years gone by." 
 <p>
We have a half-million police officers, and the proposal in the crime bill  
of Mr. Clinton was an extra one hundred thousand. How many  
policemen would we need to add in order to restore the same balance as  
in 1960 of police to violent crimes? Five million. 
<p>
Are we making any strides in that direction? Only in the private sector.  
One and one-half million security officers protect corporations, private  
residential areas, shopping malls. Good. But a lot of people spend their  
time outside privately protected areas, like the overwhelming majority of  
the American people. The Department of Justice estimates that 83 per  
cent of all Americans will be victims of violent crime at least once in  
their lives; about a quarter, victims of three or more violent crimes. 
<p>
Two out of five killers, Mr. Walinsky advises us, are undetected. These  
missing killers commit what the trade calls "stranger murders." The  
notion that crime is overwhelmingly a matter of passion is simply no  
longer arguable. And the chances of the stranger murderer getting away  
are 80 per cent. Walinsky quotes a New York Times description of Omar  
Rosario going to work in a grocery store, whose previous owner was  
murdered. "Rosario prepares for work by donning a bulletproof vest and  
sliding a 9-millimeter semi-automatic into his waistband. When a young  
man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the store, Mr. Rosario  
takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the pocket of his pants, his  
finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets him see the gun in his  
hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young man pulls a gun, he  
will be killed.''' 
<p> 
That's one way to go, but it hasn't had a large effect. In the last ten years,  
twice as many Americans were killed by strangers as were on the  
battlefield during the ten years we fought in Vietnam. In the black  
community the statistics are dire: One out of every 21 black men is  
killed, double the rate of American servicemen in the Second World  
War. "The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history  
but of this generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of  
government to create a welfare system that began the destruction of black  
family life. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality,  
celebrated license, and glorified fecklessness." 
<p> 
Adam Walinsky has for many years advocated a Police Corps, an ROTC  
that would offer four-year college scholarships to young people in return  
for four years of police service following their graduation. This is not an  
expenditure from which the Contract crowd should shrink. To begin  
with, it is to confirm the most solemn obligation of government, which is  
to provide for domestic security. "President Clinton has requested $261.4  
billion for defense against foreign enemies who killed fewer than a  
hundred Americans in all of last year. It would be silly to suggest that  
the Federal Government should not or cannot spend an eighth as much --  
2 per cent of even a shrunken federal budget -- to defend the nation  
against domestic enemies who killed more than 10,000 people who were  
strangers to them in 1994, and who will surely kill more in every year  
that lies ahead."

<title>Why Not ID?</title>
</head><center>
<h2>Why Not ID?</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
 NEW YORK, JULY 25
<p>
Thirty years ago the philosopher/strategist James Burnham included a 
chapter in his book Suicide of the West in which he undertook to list 
the stands in public policy that distinguish the American conservative 
from the American liberal. For instance? Capital punishment: most 
conservatives are in favor of it, most liberals against. Gun control, 
the other way around. Many of the dividing points had to do with 
aspects of foreign policy during the Cold War, no longer relevant. If 
Mr. Burnham were alive and writing today no doubt he'd have included 
in his list strategic anti-missile defense. There is a Grand Canyon 
that divides conservative and liberal opinion on that subject.
<p>
We paleos (for "paleolithic conservatives": i.e., those of us who were 
conservative beginning way back in past geological eras) were weaned 
in a kind of anti-cyber, anti-computer tradition. Mr. Burnham listened 
with instinctive approval to a classmate who initiated the idea of a 
chain-letter from one friend to two friends to four friends to sixteen 
friends urging a quiet mutiny against numerical identification. The 
idea was always to misplace one digit in anything that requires 
absolutely accurate disclosure. A kind of quiet sabotage of the 
computer age, was the dream. If enough people wrote 123465 where 
123456 was the correct code, then the mighty house of Mainframe would 
come tumbling down.
<p>
It is in fidelity to that tradition that so many conservatives oppose 
any move toward an identification number. Professor Thomas Sowell of 
the Hoover Institution has written that "nothing polarizes the 
political Left and Right like the idea of a national identity card." 
The Nazis and the Communists and indeed the South Africans required an 
ID. Isn't that reason enough for free governments to shrink at the 
thought of it?
<p>
Not in my view. In the past three weeks I have three times been asked 
to give my Social Security number. Why? Presumably because no two 
people have the same Social Security number. When we were in the army 
and desired to get free postage, we were required to write our serial 
number on the envelope. When we travel abroad we are required to hand 
over our passports, each one individually numbered. In many situations 
the requirement is to show your driver's license, preferably in states 
in which your picture also appears on that license.
<p>
What then is the reason for such heated opposition to an 
identification number, as has been proposed by various congressmen 
anxious to do something about illegal immigration? The idea, as we 
understand it, is to develop an ID which can't be violated by the 
owner or duplicated by a black marketeer. Presumably what then happens 
is that the young man who asks for a job in a restaurant or at a 
construction firm is asked (under obligation of law) to show his ID. 
If he can't come up with it, he is deemed to be illegal, and doesn't 
get hired.
<p>
What's wrong with that? "Control is the name of the game for 
liberals," Professor Sowell writes, "even when they call it 
'compassion.' A national identity card would not only permit even 
greater government snooping into people's private lives, the 
information gathered would almost inevitably lead to more laws forcing 
more people to do more things the way the politicians want them done. 
It is a down payment on totalitarianism." Mr. Sowell sees a tunnel 
ahead, and the light at the end of it is the complete submission by 
the individual to the government.
<p>
We should concede this, namely that in totalitarian societies an ID is 
absolutely essential. The contrapositive, however, is not justified -- 
that every society that has an ID will become a totalitarian society. 
As noted, already there is an ID of sorts, done by Social Security. As 
a weapon against illegal immigration it is not reliable because it is 
very easy to get a Social Security card. But if a) it is a legitimate 
goal to regulate immigration, then b) the means to do this effectively 
should be there, and c) it would not appear to make sense to deny the 
government instruments that are not inherently cruel or indecent. To 
authorize an ID that merely proves you are who you say you are is not 
the same thing as to authorize a government enema or truth serum.
<p>
On such matters one thinks of George Gilder, the American conservative 
bard of the computer, whose threnodies remind us how much we owe to 
the computer, not least that it enables us, without further ado, to 
establish that we are Americans, entitled to the rights guaranteed us 
under the Constitution.

<title>The Susan Smith Case</title>
</head>
<center><h2>The Susan Smith Case</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
NEW YORK, JULY 28
<p>
<p>
The brother of Susan Smith asked the jurors what would be the point of 
sentencing Mrs. Smith to death -- hasn't there been enough tragedy in 
her family already? That statement did not resonate very widely 
because Mrs. Smith's family comprised the two boys she murdered, and 
an ex-husband who had already told the jury he thought she should be 
executed. And of course the point logically arises: If there is a law 
in South Carolina specifying execution for capital offenses, what 
capital offenses are we going to sub-specify as especially appropriate 
for execution?
<p>
Well of course no one disputes the sheer horror of the means by which 
Mrs. Smith elected to kill her children. Under the circumstances, the 
defense needed to go in a different direction from what the defense 
has done with O. J. Simpson. It needed to plead with the jury the 
awful aspects of her own life.
<p>
Newspaper readers are familiar with the details: the suicide of her 
father when she was 6, seduction by her stepfather when she entered 
her teens, a marriage that resulted in two sons followed by a divorce 
followed by a love affair with her boss alongside a love affair with 
her boss's son coextensive with sex with her stepfather. The reason 
for all of this, the defense explained, is the trauma of the suicide 
of her father and the fear she felt that to break away from her 
stepfather would be in the nature of renewing the wound that had left 
her fatherless at 6 -- and how are we doing, ladies and gentlemen of 
the jury, have we got you in the Menendez mood? You do remember the 
Menendez brothers, and how convincing it was that they really felt 
they had to empty their shotguns at their mother and father?
<p>
It pays, if only as an exercise, to credit the teleology of Susan 
Smith's mental development. Let us assume that the suicide of her 
father led her compulsively to submit to sex with her stepfather. Let 
us suppose that that driving compulsion to love copiously led her to 
leave her husband and take to her bed her boss, and then his son; that 
her anxiety for the continued sexual devotion of the son led her to 
interpret his statement that he would not marry a woman and take on 
the burden of two children to the perfectly logical conclusion that 
the children were an insufferable burden: that that led her 
compulsively to strap the two impediments onto the back seat of the 
car, and let it slide into the lake. A quite natural sense of self-
protection caused her to tell police of a black abductor who at 
gunpoint had whisked the children away. And then after nine days, as 
the circumstantial evidence tightened about her, she began to descry a 
noose. At that point she confessed.
<p>
Now the refinement of the McNaghten defense, which requires the 
prosecution to establish that the defendant knew the difference 
between right and wrong, would not appear to have applied. Mrs. Smith 
acknowledged to her ex-husband that she was "sorry" she hadn't 
accepted his offer to take the boys home with him.
<p>
What was fought over, in the jury deliberations, is really the 
question of capital punishment. 1) The gravity of the offense was 
established. 2) The defendant's knowledge that what she did was wrong 
wasn't doubted. In which case, 3) shouldn't she be sentenced to death?
<p>
The risk in capital prosecutions was of course highlighted by the 
Menendez verdict. The law, roundly stated, tells us that you may not 
kill another person except in self-defense. The Menendez brothers had 
no such excuse, but they were got off by a lawyer who mesmerized the 
jury into rogue theories of psychological compulsions.
<p>
Such arguments go to eristic legal lengths. Suppose we begin with the 
simple postulate that murder is aberrational behavior. Then the 
question -- under the handling of defense lawyers -- becomes: What 
caused such behavior? Mean parents? Suicidal fathers? Cruelty? Sex? 
Fear? -- the list is infinite because the postulate is fixed. It is 
that if somebody is murdered, it has to be that the murderer departed 
from the moral fixes that restrain other human beings. Accordingly the 
quest is for the cause of the misbehavior, and the only penological 
reason to keep the murderer in jail is to prevent him from doing it 
again.
<p>
It became, really, that all over again, a fight over capital 
punishment. "What happened to Michael and Alex is a tragedy," said the 
defense. "To strap Susan in a chair and send 2,000 volts into her in 
the name of justice -- "
<p>
He was interrupted by the prosecution, who reminded him that more 
humane means of execution had been authorized by the State of South 
Carolina. But the State of South Carolina might just as well abolish 
capital punishment now that Susan Smith has been spared.

<title>Newt Draws Fire</title>
</head>
<center>
<i>New York, July 28, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>Newt Draws Fire</h2>
<p>
<a href ="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
 

<p>
<p>
It's interesting how many left feeling insecure when the subject of Newt Gingrich comes up. Dan Quayle, Spiro Agnew, Jesse Helms -- they can be handled with that equanimity that mainlines its way onto critics who are confident they are peering down on their targets. Newt Gingrich doesn't work for them in quite that way. For one thing he has a very advanced academic degree; for another, he is politically defter than most of his critics, and nothing generates hurt like yet one more primary victory by Tricky Dick. Gingrich stitched together a year ago the unthinkable, a proposed legislative agenda for a Republican Congress. The whole world laughed at such presumption and the next 
thing we knew, the House of Representatives became Republican. They stopped making certain kinds of jokes about FDR after 100 days, but in the case of Newt, the need to laugh begins to sound like the aristocracy in the Winter Palace, continuing to twit while the Revolution gathered outdoors. 
<p>
Consider Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. Her recent assault on Gingrich was ostensibly triggered by his confession that he was not schooled in foreign policy (he had blurted out that Taiwan should be recognized diplomatically). But Miss Dowd doesn't conceal the totality of her concern over the Speaker. She entitled her piece "The Loss of the Dodo"; led off by remarking that Newt was "sickeningly" cute; and ended by confessing her "distress" at the prospect of "the Speaker 
frolicking in the woods with a bunch of guys in sheets and dresses."
<p>
The "cute" business was a reaction to Mr. Gingrich's having told a visiting witness that she was welcome to "come see my dinosaur." The reference is to a facsimile skull kept in Mr. Gingrich's office, which wouldn't strike most people as "cute," so long as the addict stops short of dinosaur figures on his stationery or calls for a National Dinosaur Day.
<p>
As to the foreign-policy statement (Why don't we just recognize Taiwan?), in the same issue that carried Miss Dowd's column, the Times ran a major story about Taiwan and the loss of national identity by its people. Taiwan is large enough and important enough to warrant recognition, but we have here the problem of, "If you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread" -- neither Taiwan nor China will affirm the obvious, which is that modern Taiwan is as much a zone of modern China as Algeria is a zone of France.
<p>
Then there is the frolicking in the woods. 
<p>
Miss Dowd noted that Mr. Gingrich would spend the weekend at the Bohemian Grove, "the exclusive men's club in northern California. . . The camp is a saturnalia of juvenilia, with a lot of old white rich 
guys running around naked and in sheets, costumed as Druids. They drink dawn-to-dusk gin fizzes, relieve themselves on redwoods, and put on theatricals where they dress up like women." 
<p>
Well yes, but if you are playing the part of a woman in a theatrical, what should you dress like? Miss Dowd might as well have written that she doesn't understand why the people in the Metropolitan Opera chorus go around clutching spears. 
<p>
About five years ago, CBS's Leslie Stahl did an interview with me about women joining the Century Association. A few minutes into the discussion she interrupted herself. "Would you be willing to talk 
about the Bohemian Club?"
<p>
Well, I said, it isn't something we're supposed to talk about. . . .
<p>
"Well," Miss Stahl pressed, "what about this business of going around naked?"
<p>
I lowered my voice. "In the years I've been going to the Bohemian Club," I whispered, "I have seen men naked only in the shower, and now I'll tell you something in confidence." Her eyes hungered for my 
revelation. The camera whirred. "The Admissions Committee of the Bohemian Grove does not like to admit to membership people who shower with their clothes on." Miss Stahl simply smiled, gamely. 
<p>
Did Maureen Dowd believe that men in the Grove go about naked? No, she did not. Two days before her story appeared she telephoned an old friend, an ex-member of the Club, who told her the naked business was sheer fantasy -- "It just doesn't happen." Perhaps Miss Dowd thought to be cute by perpetuating the legend, and in a way she succeeded, and I'd even go so far as to deny that she was at this point sickeningly cute. 
<p>
Saturnalia? Those in the Bohemian Grove who drink gin fizzes all day long (I know of two) drink gin fizzes from dawn to dusk wherever they are. A drunkard need not bother to travel to California in order to indulge his habit. But then Miss Dowd would rather spice up her column than report facts, 
proving only that the antagonism to Newt conquers all, even if it does not excuse all.

<title>What About The 'Overclass'?</title>

<h2>What About The 'Overclass'?</h2>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i>William F. Buckley Jr. </i></a><hr>
</center>
<p>
<p>


<p>
<p>
The author Michael Lind was interviewed on the (indispensable) MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour and was questioned about some of the theses of his book The Next American Nation [reviewed this issue, p. 60]. One of these is that the United States is headed toward a "Brazilianization" 
of society, by which Mr. Lind meant that the affluent class is self-perpetuating and is sealing itself off from the rest of the country. How? By sending its sons and daughters to the most privileged 
colleges, taking refuge in private country clubs and mansions, intermarrying, and so on. The greatest entitlement in the hands of this overclass, said Mr. Lind, is the institution of the "legacy" in 
the primary colleges and universities. 
<p>
Interviewer David Gergen came up with a half-dozen super-prominent men in American political life who had not attended the fancy colleges. Furthermore, 45 per cent of top chief executives either dropped out of college or graduated from a second- or third-category college. How did 
Mr. Lind account for that? Oh. Well, he wasn't saying that meritocracy was dead in America, in fact it is more pronounced than it was in the nineteenth century. It just isn't meritocratic enough.
<p>
It is a very old complaint, that which is leveled at the wealthy and their progeny. It certainly attracted the attention of Andrew Carnegie, who favored a 100 per cent inheritance tax. The current 
federal estate tax is very high -- 60 per cent; 80 to 85 per cent on money left to grandchildren, beyond the generation-skipping allowance. The federal estate tax doesn't yield all that much revenue (the 1995 
estimate is $15.6 billion, or 1.2 per cent of total federal receipts) and definitive studies haven't been done -- because they can't be done -- to measure the economic impact of the high taxes. We do not know how many industrious and inventive Americans switch into overdrive instead of continuing to chug-chug up the hill to accumulate more to leave their children and grandchildren. The avoidance of taxes is a primal urge, like sex and patriotism and religion, and lighthearted redistributionists are well counseled to be aware of this, though when the jacobinical fever rages, people don't care whether they are stifling production with their taxes. All that they care about is that 
the Haves shall have less. 
<p>
On the matter of the "legacy" to entry into fancy colleges, Mr. Lind is on insecure ground again. It is true that at the margin, the practice goes on. But it is very far from being comprehensive. Twenty-
five years ago the admissions director of Yale University got into serious trouble with the alumni after several years' application of what very nearly amounted to an anti-legacy policy, during which he 
reduced to 13 per cent (from about 18) the sons of Eli admitted.
<p>
The question was raised, For what reason are alumni expected to give funds to their alma mater? Yes, perhaps, as a measure of gratitude for education and experiences received. And yes, because they wish their alma mater to continue to retain fine scholars. But first-rate scholars are going to be teaching somewhere -- they don't have to teach at any one university. At about that time (the Sixties), 
Professor C. Vann Woodward, the distinguished Southern historian, was lured away from Johns Hopkins by Yale at considerable expense. This move did not further "education": the kids are as bright at Johns Hopkins as at Yale; and anyway, professors at that level are hired primarily to write books and teach graduate students.
<p>
To contribute to Yale to make it possible for Vann Woodward to move there traces to a perfectly understandable pride, tribal in character, in maintaining in first-rate condition the university to which the 
alumnus hopes his son or daughter will one day be admitted. Mr. Lind's thesis isn't really persuasive unless somebody comes up with Animal House students congestively present at Yale or Harvard or Stanford. That won't happen because such folk don't, pace Lind, get admitted. No alumnus is going to yell, whatever his contributions to his alma mater, if his son is turned down after coming in with a combined SAT score in three digits.
<p>
An old bark, an old tree, bringing to mind that the problem in Brazil is that they don't behave as we do.

<title>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</title>
</head>
<center><h2>Hiroshima -- Happy Birthday?</center></h2>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
William F. Buckley Jr, New York August 4th
<p>
Harry Truman was not an ambiguist, just to begin with. And in any 
case, important declarations are usually summary. "I do," is all that 
is necessary in answer to the question, "Do you take this man for your 
lawfully wedded husband?" When asked for final approval to drop the 
atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Harry Truman, in Potsdam, scribbled out in 
longhand, "Suggestion approved. Release when ready." It seems a 
millennium since the idiomatically similar order was given by Admiral 
Dewey to the captain of his flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay in 
1898: "You may fire when you are ready, Gridley." Truman authorized 
the non-platonic beginning of the nuclear age, at the convenience of 
the commander of a bomber squadron on the 39-square-mile island of 
Tinian.
<p>
Time magazine did a good job last week in describing the elements of 
the contest between East and West that was finally detonated at Pearl 
Harbor, and a harrowing account of the terrible bloodiness of the 
Pacific war and of the breathless interval between the bomb's falling 
at Nagasaki and the quiet-spoken words of the Emperor Hirohito, 
besought by a cabinet divided between surrender and suicide. He 
elected to surrender.
<p>
Books have been written and prayers for divine guidance said to 
examine the morality of the bomb. If it is true that the intentions of 
the perpetrator are the final determinants of moral rectitude, then 
Truman is clearly blameless. He had weighed reports of projected 
American casualties in an invasion of Japan; estimates ranged between 
thirty thousand and a half-million dead and wounded. The same 
strategists projected Japanese casualties at many times that number, 
and even as Truman thought about the question -- before even the trial 
bomb at Alamogordo had established that Little Boy (Hiroshima) and Fat 
Man (Nagasaki) would indeed work their devastation -- we were 
routinely proceeding with our concentrated bombing of Japanese cities. 
Over eighty thousand were killed in the firebombings of Tokyo even as, 
a few months earlier, we had in three waves killed almost as many 
Germans in Dresden with the saturation bombings.
<p>
Did Harry Truman give sufficient thought to alternatives? There was 
the possibility of encouraging an earlier intervention against Japan 
by the Soviet army. There was the possibility of amending the terms of 
surrender sharply enough to affect the thinking of the bitter-enders 
in the Japanese military. The answer to these questions can't be 
given, not because the alternatives weren't presented to Truman, but 
because we don't know to what extent they captured his attention. We 
had only just conquered Okinawa, with a loss of 12,500 American 
servicemen. A national poll showed 90 per cent of Americans supporting 
in effect unconditional surrender. As far as Truman was concerned, we 
should give him the benefit of the doubt: the nuclear bomb was simply 
the next weapon in line. We had traveled, in Truman's lifetime, from 
biplanes to B-29s. Why cavil at a single bomb that could effect the 
same damage as a thousand bombers?
<p>
The soul-searching came later. It required centuries to mobilize 
civilized opinion against slavery and against torture. It is not 
finally settled even now on capital punishment. Nor is it on nuclear 
weaponry as a deterrent, but then of course in order to deter, nuclear 
weapons need to threaten. A civilized scholar very close to several 
Presidents once observed to me that if the Soviet nuclear flotilla had 
actually launched, he would have seen no purpose in counselling the 
President to launch our own: what had been there as a deterrent, 
designed to be conclusive, hadn't worked -- so why kill 150 million 
Russians? No one of course will ever know whether such reasoning would 
have stayed the hand of a U.S. President. It sufficed that Soviet 
leaders did not rule out nuclear retaliation: whereupon nuclear 
stalemate was born. It had a long life.
<p>
It does surprise that the evangelistic energy now spent on the horrors 
of Hiroshima does not bear little buds that would encourage the 
development of defensive means to intercept the hypothetical nuclear 
bomb of tomorrow. For reasons quite impossible to understand, those 
most transfixed by the horrors of Hiroshima are most unconcerned by, 
or even hostile to, any effort to accost not the evil in men's minds 
and nature -- perhaps because this is not possible -- but the weapons 
such men can deploy.

The sudden thrust by the Croatians at the expense of neighboring Serbs tells us not very much that there is armed life in the area and that finally something stoexcept pped what was appearing to be a Blitzkrieg by Bosnian Serbs.

The break in America from the isolation of yesteryear was the result of the reduction from thirty days to thirty minutes of the traversability of the space that had shielded America from Europe for four centuries. The principled arguments -- revisionist but nonetheless convincing -- against our entry into the First World War were decreasingly safe when used to oppose our entry into the Second 
World War. It is of course a hackneyed irony to remark that Sarajevo triggered the First World War and is now a point of conflagration that could trigger, if not a world war, a collapse of the scaffolding we 
hoped to build in the postwar years. 
<p>
The primary cause of disillusion with world-mindedness after the Second World War was the diplomatic defeats we suffered in Europe and then in Asia. Having joined the Allies in a mission initiated to restore sovereignty to Poland, we were maneuvered into the totalitarian desolation of much of Europe under Stalin. At the other end of the world, having triumphed over imperialist Japan we stood by helpless against the Communization of China under Mao Tse-tung. To say the least, this damaged the sensibilities of those Americans who dreamed of making the world safe for democracy. But a further and protracted jolt was the formation of the United Nations. Not that the idea of an international body was wrong, but that the UN became almost overnight the diplomatic ganglion of hypocrisy. There the Soviet Union dominated the votes of the Third World. After jubilation over the retreat of British imperialism in India, Americans stood shocked and aghast when Pandit Nehru refused to condemn the Soviet tanks that gunned down students in Budapest who sought a few scraps of liberty. 
The United Nations, in short, didn't work, and indeed sheltered the most impudent rhetorical hypocrisies in diplomatic history. 
<p>
After the Nuremberg trials the civilized world seemed to be united on at least one proposition, namely that genocide would not again be tolerated. Well, it was tolerated. When it happened in Africa we 
managed discreet sighs and, in the closet, whispered that civilization had yet to reach certain parts of the world. But then with the end of Communism a refreshment of international idealism temporarily took 
over. The UN, for one thing, would no longer serve as an echo chamber for Soviet lies and hypocrisy. Then along came Yugoslavia, RIP.
<p>
There to the north, northeast, and west loomed the mighty power of Russia, Germany, France, and England. Diplomatic efforts to arrest ethnic cleansing crystallize as games concocted to engage the 
attention of students at war colleges. In the background geographically, in the foreground geopolitically, was the United States. On the one hand it was clearly the burden of Europe to handle 
the mess in Yugoslavia. On the other hand, we were the undisputed superpower, and it turned out that we could not breathe the requisite concern into our NATO allies. And so, month after month, year after 
year, nothing is done except that people kill each other and latent hostilities are stimulated. There is the Serb affinity for Russians and vice versa, the Western European historical affinity for Croatia. 
The Muslim world correctly questions whether there is any reliable concern in Europe for aggressions at its expense. The Greeks watch nervously at movement in the other Macedonia, and the Turks, however frequently they are reminded of their own historical excesses, let it be known that they are brothers of the Bosnians being killed, tortured, raped.
<p>
In New Jersey if year after year a county can't manage its own schools, Trenton takes the schools over. The metaphor is easily resisted: How exactly does NATO take over Belgrade? But that is the 
wrong approach in a century in which the question, How do we split an atom? was answered: We shall proceed to do so. 
<p>
The NATO enterprise is discredited. The Europeans are mired in their spiritual trough, and the feeling in America is, more and more: Two hot wars and one cold war are enough for one century. You figure it 
out.  Unhappily, history won't stand by to permit us our alienation. The reason we are entangled in Europe -- and in the Pacific -- is that we can't escape the consequences of  what happens there.

<title>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<i>New York, August 15, 1995</i>

<br>
<h2>Are States' Constitutions Unconstitutional?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
During the recess from Washington, our legislators have an opportunity 
to reflect a little, and it would not be time lost if they gave 
thought to a prayer amendment. There are several reasons to do this. 
One, the restoration of traditional authority for local schools; a 
second, the elucidation of a constitutional disfigurement done over 
the last generation by the Supreme Court; a third, to rebuke the 
Supreme Court for its fanatical misinterpretation of the First 
Amendment. <p>
But the question suddenly arises, Is a constitutional amendment 
necessary? When questioned early in the year about what had gone into 
the Contract with America, Newt Gingrich admitted that thought had 
been given to the prayer amendment but that since it required a two-
thirds majority, this was a challenge better put off until other 
problems had been coped with. The failure of the Balanced Budget 
Amendment (although by a single vote in the Senate) reminded us of the 
difficulty of amassing a two-thirds majority. It is therefore 
especially bracing to consider alternative means of accomplishing the 
same end, devised by the constitutional historian Harry Jaffa of the 
Claremont Institute.<p>
He reasons as follows. Forty-seven of our fifty states explicitly 
invoke the name of God in their own Constitutions. They vary in 
phrasing, but they are nowhere sectarian. By this is meant that the 47 
states in question nowhere cite God using denominational language. The 
President's home state of Arkansas, for instance, launches its 
constitution by saying, "We the people of the State of Arkansas, 
grateful to Almighty God for our civil and religious liberty, and 
desiring to perpetuate its blessings . . ." In Maine, the people 
acknowledge "with grateful hearts the goodness of the Sovereign Ruler 
of the Universe," while from Colorado we have the relatively Spartan 
intelligence that the people, "with profound reverence for the Supreme 
Ruler of the Universe," nevertheless authorize the election of Pat 
Schroeder to Congress. <p>
Suppose that a joint resolution of the Congress, requiring only simple 
majorities in both houses, were to declare that children in public 
schools might lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such 
acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is present in their own 
state constitution, or in the constitution of any other state? The 
Supreme Court could go beyond fuming and raging over the ensuing 
resumption of prayer in the public schools only by pronouncing the 
constitutions of 47 states to be unconstitutional. It is a reasonable 
guess that the Court would want to stop short of any such declaration. <p>
And bear in mind that the state constitutions have provisions 
equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of 
the First Amendment. California, for instance, ordains that "Free 
exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or 
preference are guaranteed. . . . The legislature shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of religion." And we bear also in mind 
that every enabling act by the Congress for the admission of a state 
to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision: "The 
Constitution of [the state being admitted] shall always be republican 
in form and shall not be repugnant to the Constitution of the United 
States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence." <p>
These are freighted words in two senses. As regards the religious-
freedom clauses, we are reminded historically that the 13 states 
admitted to the Union since the Civil War were scrutinized by 
Congress, which in ratifying their constitutions affirmed that they 
were admissible under the U.S. Constitution. More, the invocation of 
the Declaration of Independence, as an instrument to which the 
constitution of the aspiring state must not be "repugnant," 
strengthens the viability of the Declaration, which of course speaks 
of the rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] Creator." Such 
rights are "unalienable" because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God." It is always reassuring to know that 
some element more majestic than the God of legal positivism looks 
after and approves of our liberties. <p>
So then it is up to Speaker Gingrich.<p>

<title>Jerry Garcia, RIP</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>New York, August 18</i>
<hr>
<h2>Jerry Garcia, RIP</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
If I ever heard a song played by the Grateful Dead I wasn't aware of 
it. If I had been, I'd have pricked up my ears and listened real hard 
because I have a memory. It is of a young man who came to work at my 
shop. He had just graduated from Harvard, wanted to do some opinion 
journalism, and qualified for a summer internship that stretched into 
two or three years.<p>
It was toward the end of the decade of the Sixties that he drew me 
aside one day, after we had gone to press. He said that he had been to 
a concert by the Grateful Dead and that it was a wonderful experience, 
and that he would go again whenever the group was in reach, and he 
invited me to join him at one of the concerts, which I wish I had 
done. <p>
I have to suppose that, like so many others, I would have survived the 
experience without such harm as finally came to Jerry Garcia and, 25 
years before Garcia, to our young intern. He did his work, but with 
progressive listlessness. His editorial paragraphs had never been 
razor sharp but they had been trenchant and readable, and now they 
were murky.<p>
Things got worse, and now came the trappings, which were conventional. 
It began with sandals, then went in the usual direction, though I 
don't remember that he ran a ring through his ear. When an anniversary 
issue was planned for the magazine he suddenly demanded that his 
"generation" be represented, so I told him to go ahead and write what 
he thought would be a useful essay.<p>
I don't remember seeing it myself, but I was told not that it was 
unsuitable, or unfinished, or unprofessional, but that its meaning was 
impenetrable. At about that time an associate ten years older reported 
his (informed) opinion that our intern was going off the deep end. At 
a collegial staff lunch he once excused himself so abruptly as to 
provoke the melancholy conclusion that he had needed a quick jolt of 
whatever drug he was taking. One day he announced that he would be 
married, and soon brought in an addled flower child dressed as he 
dressed. One weekend they just faded away. A few years later we 
received formal invitations to a second marriage, to a South American. 
He went with his new bride to her country and taught English. In due 
course he sent us an article submission. It was potentially 
publishable but needed work, and the managing editor sent it back to 
him with recommended changes. We did not hear from him again, except 
after another interval of five years or so, when we learned he had 
married yet again, this time to a native, and gone off to live in the 
hills. Question before the house: Is Jerry Garcia in some way 
responsible for this?<p>
The issue of Newsweek that put Garcia on the cover quoted in huge type 
the words of a 21-year-old college student. "It's a free life when 
you're at a show. It's all about happiness. I'd just take my watch off 
and want time to stop." It isn't easy to rail against anyone who 
brings happiness, and one has to assume that many, perhaps the 
majority, of those who heard "shows" by the Grateful Dead achieved 
their highs without the use of intoxicants. But something unusual 
accounted for the young Americans, pictures of them reproduced in the 
days just gone by, exhibiting Dionysiac pleasure in their role as 
Deadheads. Exuberance finds its forms throughout the world and 
concentrates its energies on the young. But is the joy unconfined? 
Ought it to be?<p>
Jerry Garcia died only a week after leaving the Betty Ford Center. He 
is quoted as having said two years ago that, really, he needed to do 
something to restore his health, otherwise he would be dead, like "two 
years from now." He went on schedule, and is said to have died with a 
smile on his face, no doubt because he was a happy man but also 
because he made so many others happy. But he also killed, if that's 
the right word for such as our intern, a lot of people. And although 
he had a pulsating forum world wide for thirty years and knew from his 
own experience what his habits were doing to him, he never went public 
on it, not really. One has to suppose, sadly, that in his case, going 
public on his problem, extending a truly firm handshake to his 
legions, would have required the dramatic gesture of retiring from the 
stage. If he had done so, it would not have been wounding to those of 
us who were never exposed to Jerry Garcia's special intoxicant, but, 
if he had done so, how many would have had better prospects for 
health, love, and longer lives?<p>

<title>Where Does Fuhrman Take Us?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<i>New York, August 25, 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Where Does Fuhrman take Us?</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html">
<b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</b></i></a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
One account analyzes the Mark Fuhrman situation as follows: If the 
exposure of the tapes comes in as the closing episode in the trial, 
the probability is high that the disgust and loathing for Detective 
Fuhrman (richly deserved) will provoke in the jury a sentiment 
extraneous to the question, Did O. J. kill his former wife and her 
companion? Instead, the analysis goes on, the jurors will ask 
themselves, How can we express our disgust? Well -- the analyst 
concludes -- by voting, Not Guilty.<p>
The prosecution will of course make an earnest, desperate attempt to 
situate the tapes in context. Marcia Clark will argue that Houdini 
himself could not have contrived to arrange the evidence against O. J. 
with which the prosecution has made its case. The chief of police in 
Los Angeles, Mr. Willie Williams, told a press conference that "it is 
inconceivable to believe that for this one murder 10, 20, 30, or 40 
people got together to plot against Mr. Simpson." Only Oliver Stone 
could stitch together a plot to do in O. J. that originated at two in 
the morning and matured with a bloody glove at his residence, and 
bloodstains that identified O. J., his ex-wife, and Mr. Goldman here 
and there along the route from the scene of the crime back to 
Simpson's residence.<p>
But the thinking at the moment is that the jury will waive matters 
that have dulled in memories of men and women who must be feeling as 
though they had been sentenced to perpetual isolation during a 
seemingly endless trial. Human sensibilities are as they are, and the 
jurors are not likely to blame the defense for their incarceration. 
The enemy will be the Establishment: the judge who ordained their 
isolation, the prosecution that droned on endlessly, and, above all, 
the Los Angeles Police Department, which retained in its ranks someone 
who -- if the tapes are to be believed -- lives in fury against the 
existence of blacks, women, homosexuals, and civil rights. <p>
It is mystifying what exactly were the objectives of Mr. Fuhrman in 
his recorded conversations with Laura Hart McKinny, the scholar at the 
North Carolina School of Arts, starting in 1985. He reported to her 
(according to one passage in the tapes) how on one occasion he and 
fellow officers handled four suspects. "We basically tortured them. We 
broke 'em. Their faces were just mush. They had pictures of the walls 
with blood all the way to the ceiling and finger marks of [them] 
trying to crawl out of the room." A messy business, handling suspects 
in that way. It required Mr. Fuhrman and his fellow law enforcers to 
clean themselves up with a garden hose. <p>
Now the Fuhrman narrative gives one pause. It does not surprise that 
here and there one comes upon sadists, whether in Los Angeles or in 
Gulag. The viewers of the Rodney King beating tend to reason, Why 
should we be surprised? Such evidently is the way the police in Los 
Angeles, and perhaps elsewhere, routinely act. But the Rodney King 
story is complicated. Extensive investigations revealed that there was 
a genuine, spastic concern that King might be armed, might have 
intended his own impetuous defense using a weapon. But in the Fuhrman 
telling of the treatment of four suspects there would seem to be 
nothing of that. It was clinical sadism. <p>
Already a quiet investigation by the Los Angeles Police has begun, 
designed, no doubt, to track the record of men handled over the years 
by Detective Fuhrman. Why did they not complain of their treatment by 
him? And if there was a record of Fuhrman engaged in such activity, 
why was he retained in the force? How will he be handled by the law? 
As a perjurer? He swore under oath that he had not used the term 
"nigger" when manifestly he had done so, using the word not in the 
detached tones of a storyteller, but with invidious gusto. "You're 
talking sh--. You sound like a nigger."<p>
It is endlessly fascinating. Fuhrman the cool bigot. O. J., who earned 
the confidence of his private investigator because of the coolness of 
his behavior in Chicago in the hours immediately after the killing. 
How could somebody so casual in his conduct during those hours before 
being told of his ex-wife's murder be guilty? But of course such 
reasoning, from the particular to the general, would justify 
confidence that the Fuhrman observed on the witness stand could not be 
the same Fuhrman who spoke into those tapes. <p>
The jury's responsibility in this case is awesome, extending far 
beyond the question of O. J.'s guilt or innocence. It touches on the 
recognition of the awful baseness of which human beings -- Americans -
- are capable. <p>

<title>China is Huffing and Puffing</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><i>NEW YORK, AUGUST 29</i><br>
<hr><br>

<h2>China Is Huffing And Puffing</h2><p>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"> <i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.
</center></b></i></a>
<hr><br>
We must suppose that the generals crowd around the power center in 
Peking with enticing war scenarios, as they dream of a military 
adventure against Taiwan. The Red Chinese, as one used to call them, 
have not fought a war since they took on Vietnam, a venture that ended 
in stalemate. That was twenty-odd years ago, and twenty-odd years 
before that, the Chinese army marched against the United States and 
South Korea, winning an ambiguous victory. That's a long time between 
wars, and the hunger for military action is sharp in the hearts of the 
Old Guard. They are men who stood by Mao Tse-tung during a period when 
he did more than any other man to damage China. And now the military 
sees the abandonment of Maoist ideals and, still more humiliating, an 
exactly corresponding rise in economic productivity. For that reason, 
among others, they clamor for the annexation of Taiwan.<p>

The pressure is exerted through the central figure in China, Deng 
Xiaoping, but biological decomposition is far along, and Deng must 
lean heavily on Li Peng and others. And the whole team would appear to 
speak with one voice on the matter of Taiwan. It isn't that they plan 
tomorrow to invade, but they desire that the diplomatic community 
should acknowledge, so to speak, that that is their right; they are 
dealing, after all, with a rogue province.<p>

The temperature heated almost to explosive levels when the President 
of Taiwan, Mr. Lee Teng-hui, went to Ithaca for a Cornell reunion. The 
eyes of the world were on the event because only one year earlier, 
President Lee had been denied the right to stop over in Hawaii to 
refuel his airplane. The outcry was so sharp on the Western side that 
President Clinton lifted the ban in order to permit the Cornell visit.<p>

How to handle China is a difficult question, but one shouldn't begin 
by picking a fight with Japan. Mr. Clinton pressed China in the cause 
of human rights while accomplishing nothing to further human rights, 
punctuating his Asia policy with threats to forbid the sale of 
Japanese Lexises. Peking withdrew its ambassador from Washington and 
imprisoned Harry Wu. The ambassador is coming back and Harry Wu has 
been released, but the pressure to bring this about had little to do 
with inventive U.S. diplomacy. It had to do with the congress of women 
in Peking, which China did not want to lose. After that, they covet 
the Olympics for 2004.<p>

But Taiwan does not sleep over it all. For one thing, Mr. Lee is going 
to run for a second term as president in March 1996. This will be the 
first election in which all Taiwanese participate. A free election in 
China is itself a unique event, but the Taiwanese venture especially 
galls Peking, on the quite logical grounds that Taiwan is acting like 
an independent country. Which indeed it is doing, which indeed it is. 
The historical haze that sits over the Taiwan Straits, as if Taiwan in 
an accidental moment of recent geological history had become detached 
from the mainland to float 170 miles out to sea, has become a miasma. 
Although there is fear among many Taiwanese of a mainland invasion, 
early indications are that Mr. Lee will be re-elected. He hasn't come 
out for the independence of Taiwan, but he has in recent months 
stressed that Taiwan is not receiving the kind of attention owing to 
an entity which has the most favorable balance of trade in the world 
and ranks tenth in economic power.<p>

And then Taiwan is not a military pushover. It has weapons, including 
American F-5s. Almost as a matter of definition, an island of 21 
million people would fall, in any prolonged engagement, to an army 
recruited from one billion people. But as one Taiwanese recently 
remarked in private conversation, if it looked as if military conquest 
were actually being scheduled, Taiwan could pull the diplomatic card 
from its sleeve: Declare itself an independent country, conduct a 
plebiscite that would confirm this status, and then ask for 
recognition. This would not diminish the mainland's proprietary 
rhetoric, but all the axes of diplomacy would necessarily rotate in 
the direction of recognizing an independent state.<p>

Always there is the possibility of a new regime in Peking after the 
death of Deng. But the prospect of one that is latitudinarian on the 
Taiwan question is beyond today's horizon.<p>

<title>Se Habla Ingles</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 5</i><hr>

<h2>Se Habla Ingles</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><i><b>William F. Buckley Jr.</b></i></a><hr></center><br>
 

It was wise of Senator Dole to come down on English as the national 
language when he was firing away over the weekend at anti-U.S. 
academics. The movement to make English the official language of the 
United States is making legislative headway. The State of New 
Hampshire has just now enacted an English-language bill, and what 
appeals to New Hampshire, beyond apples, tends to appeal to 
presidential candidates.<p>

The principal lobbying group in favor of universalizing English (it is 
called "U.S. English") is ironically headed up by someone whose native 
language wasn't English (he is Mauro E. Mujica). And of course the 
heftiest warrior for English was the late senator and semanticist S. 
I. Hayakawa, whose native language was Japanese. Senator Hayakawa 
wanted nothing less than a constitutional amendment. U.S. English will 
settle for less; others want more.<p>

There is of course the other side. Why does the United States have to 
have a common language? After all, Switzerland doesn't.<p>

The first thing to learn about Switzerland is never to invoke what 
happens there in an effort to prove any point about any other country. 
Switzerland breaks all the rules, gets away with it; is a wonderful 
country with, unhappily, a bad drug problem.<p>

There are very good historical reasons why the French should have been 
permitted to nourish their language in Canada and, more recently, to 
insist on the recognition of French as a substitute language in 
everything from ballot forms to road signs. But every now and again 
Canada threatens to become two nations, and so reminds us of the 
burden the British would have been spared if, two hundred years ago, 
they had, after defeating the French, exported them back to France, or 
else sent them south to the United States, where immigrants were 
taught English.<p>

Opponents of the universalization of English use two arguments. The 
first is multiculturalist in ideology, the second, a faux 
cosmopolitanism. There is every reason in the world for the schools in 
the United States to teach foreign languages, beginning with Spanish, 
which is progressively important in commerce and hemispheric comity. 
But hanging onto one's Spanish if that is the native language is 
entirely different from depending on it.<p>

It makes sense in addressing the issue to close our eyes to what 
happens with the first generation. Yes, many immigrants -- perhaps 
millions -- who arrived here in middle age went on to become 
conversant with English. But millions did not, and will not, and it is 
an expression of geniality to give them radio and television and 
newspapers in Spanish.<p>

But their children need to be treated differently. I have experienced 
a 15-year-old boy who speaks English with difficulty even though he 
has lived in New York City with his mother for five years. It turns 
out that in public school, before he moved to a parochial school where 
he now studies, young Saul was taught six classes every day, five of 
them in Spanish.<p>

The quarrel is between two camps, one of them, so to speak, total 
immersion in its approach, the second a little looser. There are those 
who believe that English can only be rapidly mastered if every 
foreigner is required to use it when engaged in any transaction over 
which that person is superintended. Thus, for instance, employees at 
McDonald's would be required to talk to each other in English while 
on-premise. One way to generalize this approach is that everywhere 
you're not permitted to smoke, you are permitted to speak only in 
English.<p>

The approach of U.S. English is less draconian, so also is the House 
bill introduced by Representative Bill Emerson. It would enforce the 
use only of English in all government communications, forms, ballots, 
whatever. Mr. Emerson's bill has 180 sponsors, and in a previous 
version had also as sponsor Newt Gingrich, who endorses 
enthusiastically the notion of a national language, nationally 
accepted as such.<p>

It is really quite cruel to go in the other direction. A few years ago 
a middle-aged woman told me that when her parents were sent to Moscow 
they plunked her down in a Russian school. "I cried every day for 
about a month and in about six weeks I understood everything that was 
said in Russian." To stand in the way of young people devoting 
themselves to the English language is on the order of encouraging 
obesity by cramming them with Mars bars. It is surely the case that 
every immigrant who can now handle English is grateful for the 
experience even if it meant crawling through gnarled, spiky, thorny 
brushwood for a few months or years.<p>

<title>The Passions of the Greenpeacers</title>

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 8</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Passions Of the Greenpeacers</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Commentator/philosopher Herbert Agar had a term for it -- "the 
anarchic passion to smash." He was writing fifty years ago about 
whatever it is that causes some people, especially when young, to give 
vent to the impulse to wreck -- if necessary, the nearest thing in 
sight. The politicization of that impulse had a lot of help during 
this century from ideology, which seemed to give it some purpose. The 
young Bolsheviks destroying everything they could lay their hands on 
in St. Petersburg. The young fascists on a spree in Milan. The Nazis, 
who could objectify that passion to smash in search of anything 
Jewish.<p>

We have it now, that anarchic passion, and the animating instrument is 
nuclear -- well, nuclear anything. Most recently the decision by the 
French to conduct some nuclear tests in the South Pacific. But 
anything that has the word "nuclear" attached to it helps to bring on 
that same spirit. Not long ago Jane Fonda was enthralling the younger 
generation by her movie The China Syndrome, the hero of which was a 
nuclear meltdown that threatened, oh, the end of the world, or 
something very close to that. The Greenpeace movement is based on an 
undifferentiated hostility to everything nuclear, and it is having a 
wonderful time these days in Tahiti.<p>

The French are a highly utilitarian people, in ways commendable and 
not so commendable. They acknowledge force majeure, as when Hitler 
quickly and decisively proved that his army was better than their 
army: so they quickly surrendered, and got along with the occupiers 
without too much of a fuss, leaving it to the exiled Charles de Gaulle 
to help to mobilize Great Britain and the United States to effect 
French liberation.<p>

When nuclear power was shown to be a reasonable means of providing 
energy, the French, without much fuss, simply went nuclear, so much so 
that nearly 80 per cent of French electricity is nowadays generated by 
nuclear plants. In the Sixties, President de Gaulle decided that it 
was not prudent to depend on American nuclear missiles to serve as a 
dispositive deterrent to Soviet expansionism, so he developed what he 
called a force de frappe, something small enough to be manageable but 
deadly enough to discourage overt Soviet military aggression. 
President Chirac, thirty years later, was persuaded that one more set 
of tests was necessary to ascertain that French nuclear resources were 
authoritative. Evidently only that one series is deemed necessary to 
achieve the desired level of efficiency -- and safety -- because M. 
Chirac has declared that after the conclusion of these tests, in May, 
he will commit France never again to test nuclear weapons.<p>

Philip Shenon of the New York Times reports on the honeymoon of a 
Seattle dermatologist, Sonja Krejci, and her new husband, Dr. Bill 
Clark, bound for a romantic Polynesian resort island after a scheduled 
connection at Papeete. But when they landed, far from making their 
connecting flight, they were imprisoned in the airport building 
surrounded by rioters, tear gas, and smoke. At one point the rioters 
assaulted everyone with rocks and stones, causing Dr. Clark, who is an 
orthopedic surgeon, to consider the possibility of needing to use his 
professional resources to keep his bride alive. "At one point," 
reports Mr. Shenon, "some of the rioters found a bulldozer, 'and they 
just drove it right into the terminal building -- smashing cars and 
destroying the restaurant,"' as the poor doctor put it. An estimate of 
the damage done to the airport comes to $11 million. No estimate is 
yet in on how many honeymoons originally scheduled for Tahiti have 
been rescheduled elsewhere.<p>

A reader of the ongoing press reports on the activities of Greenpeace 
and others stops suddenly -- or might do so -- to ask: What is it the 
protestors fear? Are the French experiments, conducted 750 miles from 
Tahiti, endangering anybody in Tahiti? For that matter, are they 
endangering anybody or anything in Mururoa, the atoll used for the 
nuclear testing? Has anybody detected a rise in pollutants in the area 
where the first tests were undertaken? Has a whale been killed? Two 
whales? Has $11 million in damage been done to the sea surrounding 
Mururoa?<p>

The answer has to be No, for the simple reason that if it were Yes, we 
absolutely would have heard about it. The Greenpeace types desperately 
need a martyr. A poisoned ocean, a scarred sun -- something that 
points to Chernobyl. But there isn't anything there. Only the anarchic 
passion to smash. <p>

<title>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 15</i>
<hr>
<h2>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Richard Lugar was in town, and when that happens these days to the 
restrained, brainy senior senator from Indiana it means he is engaged 
in promoting his presidential candidacy. You shut your eyes, think for 
a minute: Who is Richard Lugar? The snippets form up deep in the 
memory. Yes . . . Rhodes scholar . . . mayor of Indianapolis . . . 
U.S. senator . . . strangely overlooked by George Bush when he went to 
the other senator from Indiana, Mr. Quayle, as Vice President, given 
that Lugar had been around longer and has here and there been 
prominent in foreign-affairs analysis.<p>

"I know more about foreign policy than anyone running for President or 
serving as President," he says, "and that is a modest claim." He is 
not the wisecracking kind, but it is an effective line and, one 
supposes, will be used by him in Iowa and New Hampshire, provided he 
can find an audience there that is interested in foreign policy.<p>

Well, what are his audiences interested in hearing about? The answer 
is: mostly taxes. Senator Lugar has proposed the elimination of the 
Internal Revenue Service. The what? someone in the company asked. Yes 
. . . exactly that. And a 50 per cent reduction in the capital-gains 
tax. And a $500 tax credit, not exemption, for every child.<p>

Well, but how are we going to finance all that?<p>

A consumption tax. Richard Lugar is all for growth, but he doesn't 
count on it to guarantee the long-term growth of the American economy. 
What we do need to do is to disencumber the economy, which is groggy 
from taxation and regulation. But the future of the economy is the 
world market. Hundreds of millions of people who want, and will 
increasingly be able to pay for, American products.<p>

But doesn't that run into the burgeoning protectionist bloc? Yes, 
indeed it does, and Pat Buchanan is doing a very good job in stirring 
that up. "I had an exchange with Pat recently and I told him the 
United States was running a trade surplus with Europe." He was flatly 
unaware of this, and showed it.<p>

"Senator Gramm said recently," a guest said, "that as a sometime 
economics professor he is well equipped to challenge the high-tariff 
people, but that this can't be done in a two-minute give-and-take or 
over talk radio. Are you going to talk about 'comparative advantage' 
in a stump debate?"<p>

Well, said the senator, the answer to that question is: You have to do 
it. "Do you know something? It costs one thousand dollars less to 
assemble an automobile in Indiana than it does in Mexico. One thousand 
dollars, because our workers have the training, the capital plants, 
the education, the advantages of transportation. Windshield wipers for 
cars, manufactured in Canada, are moving to the U.S. -- because it's 
cheaper. But Pat has them cheering and hollering with arguments from 
another age."<p>

Is it true, as recently heard, that if GATT and NAFTA were up for 
ratification tomorrow in the Senate they wouldn't get through? Yes, 
the senator said, that is true, and true also that some of the young 
Republican congressmen are infected with the protectionist virus.<p>

The candidate went on to talk about the problems of the front-runner. 
A few months ago, he said, Mr. Dole was running ahead of Mr. Clinton 
in California. Now he is behind. It is entirely possible that in May 
the GOP will wake up to find that no one candidate has got a majority 
of the delegates. So what has been planned between May and August? The 
answer to that is: Nothing. Nothing has been planned between May and 
August. But during that time I could knit together my positions -- for 
lower taxes, and increased trade -- and take on Clinton after my 
nomination. "But you have to learn to put your message, like on 
tariffs, down in black and white, in large type."<p>

Well, one guest asked, why haven't you done that? Gotten a couple of 
ad people together and given them that assignment? The senator is not 
fast on the polemical draw. He might have said that there is no 
equivalent of E=mc2 for the tariff argument, but he let it go. "That's 
a good idea."<p>

Is Senator Lugar getting anywhere? The objective indices aren't 
pulling for him. His finances are strained, and he barely showed up in 
the Iowa skirmish two weeks ago. He leaves you with the comfortable 
feeling of having been in the company of a decent, well-educated man 
who was a groundbreaking mayor, and is a fine senator.<p>

<title>Defend America?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 19</i>
<hr>
<h2>Defend America?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois has introduced a measure under the title, 
Defend America Act of 1995. He is joined by Rep. Martin Hoke of Ohio 
in coming up with an idea strange to the imagination, namely that the 
defense of America depends to some extent on the freedom to act, and 
that that freedom to act was substantively forfeited in 1972 in the 
ABM Treaty.<p>

We are talking about that legendary bone of contention that allegedly 
forbids certain kinds of experiments in anti-missile technology, and 
flatly forbids deployment in more than one site. For a long time, a 
technical argument engaged legislators and diplomats as to whether 
experiments focused on the "brilliant pebble" were precluded under the 
terms of the 1972 agreement. The idea has been to arm satellites with 
slingshots, in effect, to destroy atmosphere-bound missiles. But the 
interesting question became, in the first phase, Why don't we pull 
away from the 1972 treaty? When Caspar Weinberger was secretary of 
defense under President Reagan he argued the legitimacy of 
experimentation, but Congress was not convinced, and appeasers all 
over the world argued against pulling back from any treaty the Soviet 
Union had agreed to.<p>

Mr. Reagan, though the proud author of the original insight into anti-
missile missiles (the Strategic Defense Initiative), never got around 
to serving the six-month notice required by the treaty to announce its 
rescission. Out of office, Mr. Weinberger publicly argued in favor of 
rescission, but his voice and other voices were drowned out by 
appeasers and others afraid of any initiative the Soviet Union would 
frown on.<p>

But of course now, although we have a treaty, there is a question 
whether the entity with which we entered into that arrangement still 
exists. The government of "Russia" is not the legitimate heir to the 
government of the Soviet Union, any more than the government of Lenin 
was the heir to the government of Nicholas II. Still . . . (it is 
argued) it does no particular harm to proceed as though the treaty 
were alive. The thing to do is to rescind it.<p>

Now this can hardly be interpreted as a provocative act given that the 
doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction is no longer operative, since 
Russia and America are no longer at war against each other. But the 
Senate of the United States, on September 6, reached a "bipartisan 
compromise" on the matter of missile defense. The senators who 
produced that compromise claimed to have been guided by their concern 
for missile defense. But what they proceeded to do was to authorize 
future deployment only on behalf of America's allies, and American 
forces abroad. The important question, which has to do with research 
and deployment for continental defense, is therefore skirted, leaving 
us, in the phrase of defense strategist Frank Gaffney, in a state of 
"abject vulnerability" to nuclear attack by missiles of a rogue state.<p>

The senators who framed the great evasion of September 6 acknowledge 
all the correct things. "The threat that is posed to the national 
security of the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and 
cruise missiles is significant and growing, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively. . . . There is a danger that determined countries will 
acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future and 
with little warning by means other than indigenous development." The 
senators' research even acknowledges that "the concept of mutual 
assured destruction, which was one of the major philosophical 
rationales for the ABM Treaty, is now questionable as the basis for 
stability in a multipolar world." So? So -- do nothing. That is, 
nothing that contributes to continental defense.<p>

Congressman Hyde, with his keen eye for the quick of a question, 
acknowledges that the shadow of the 1972 treaty has the effect of 
dimming strategic and tactical visibility, and should be disposed of 
once and for all. Accordingly, the Hyde -  Hoke measure would direct 
the President to notify the Russian Federation that the United States 
intends to exercise its right under the treaty's Article XV to 
withdraw from the accord.<p>

One has to hope that an enlightened debate will ensue. There aren't 
really many questions that need answering. 1) Does rescission of the 
treaty in any conceivable way endanger Russia? (No.) 2) Can research 
and deployment help us to shore up our defenses? (Yes.) 3) Are there 
other nations that might benefit from a vigorous anti-missile program? 
(Yes. All nations that wish protection from missiles.)<p>

<title>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 22</i>
<hr>
<h2>Steve Forbes, Front and Right</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
The entry into the presidential race of Malcolm (Steve) Forbes Jr. is 
something more than merely ho-ho time. Commentator William Schneider, 
on CNN, snappily summed it up: If Dole stumbles, it becomes an open 
race, and Forbes has the money to project his views.<p>

They are as rumored. The single unusual feature of his free-market 
program is a call for a return to the gold standard, something we have 
not heard much about since Lewis Lehrman retired from politics. Money-
exchange issues don't have the sex they had back when William Jennings 
Bryan set out to save the American people from crucifixion on a cross 
of gold. What the word "gold" tends to communicate today is merely 
sound currency, anti-inflation. Mr. Forbes assured his following that 
when his Administration takes office, once again people will be able 
to think in terms of 4.5 per cent interest rates on their mortgages.<p>

Beware, said Forbes, the use of the comparative "-er." As in "cheaper" 
government, "lower" taxation. Forbes would do away entirely with the 
tax code. He calls for a $36,000 exemption from federal taxes, after 
which the tax would be a flat 17 per cent. Capital-gains taxes would 
be phased out. Prometheus, unbound.<p>

Steve Forbes will tell you in unharassed conversation that there is 
something missing in the other campaigners for the Republican 
nomination. In his announcement speech he paid the formal courtesies 
to the other candidates: every one of them would be an improvement on 
what we now have. "[Yet] I think a lot of people would agree, there is 
an empty feeling in this campaign so far. One reason is that none of 
the other candidates is raising high the banner of economic expansion 
and opportunity. . . . But there are other reasons for the empty 
feeling. The fact is, the other candidates, on both sides, are 
insiders. And we all know that if the insiders had the answers, they 
would have implemented them by now." The emphasis, says Forbes, is on 
his own entrepreneurial background. This uniquely qualifies him, in 
his understanding, to lead the charge to high-octane economic energy.
<p>
But when he has the quiet opportunity to do so, he focuses, of course, 
on Phil Gramm, the only competitor in sight, in the event Dole should 
founder. "He is as smart a man as I have ever known," Steve Forbes 
will tell you. But -- he thinks -- Gramm's candidacy overstresses the 
negative, the need to cut spending in particular. Forbes is the 
enthusiast who sees an American giant bursting with innovative energy, 
shackled by the Lilliputians of Washington with their tax codes, 
regulations, bureaucracy -- the culture of Washington, which, he says, 
as a true outsider he is uniquely liberated from. Steve Forbes truly 
believes that the special music in the political air of 1996 is not 
elsewhere being heard, and that he can serve as the tunesmith for the 
nation.<p>

The announcement speech he made was hardly musical (". . . like John 
F. Kennedy did," "like Ronald Reagan did . . ." -- Steve Forbes and 
Adlai Stevenson attended the same college!). But it was very very 
American. He has come into the political fight with the brashness of 
the wholesome iconoclast. There is nothing there of the grouch, no 
petulance, no swagger: Steve Forbes is not Ross Perot. And even though 
the odds are preposterously adverse, he is willing to make the run and 
to finance his own campaign.<p>

What can sympathetic but skeptical conservatives say about it all? 
"Look," Forbes said recently to a friend. "I am a male, I am white, a 
Protestant, an Ivy Leaguer, rich, business-oriented, without practical 
political experience. It couldn't be worse, but at least I'd like to 
be free to fall down on my own arse, without any help from 
conservatives." Fair enough, and bon voyage. <p>

<title>Buckley:  Grave Business In Los Angeles</title>

<h2>Grave Business In Los Angeles</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>


 

The cliche has it that anything Johnnie Cochran et al. can do to 
spring their client is okay. If this is so, they have certainly abided 
by that liberty. At the end of Thursday, Mr. Cochran had done his best 
to convince the jurors that either O. J. Simpson is guiltless and 
should be set free, and perhaps lionized in an effort to expiate the 
troubles he has seen, or else the jurors don't believe in the Bible, 
in the Constitution, or that Hitler went too far.
                                              <P>
Now pay close attention to what is going on. The cameras take us to an 
impromptu press conference called by Fred Goldman, who is the father 
of Ron, the young man killed alongside Nicole. Mr. Goldman is teeming 
with resentment and fires both barrels. "He's talking about racism and 
he's talking about hate? Who does he connect himself with? This man 
ought to be ashamed of himself to talk among decent human beings. He 
is one of the most disgusting human beings I have ever had to listen 
to in my life. Because of racism, we should put aside all other 
thoughts, all other reason, and set his murdering client free?"
                                    <P>
Well, that statement brought counterfire from the other side. The 
elder sister of O.J. took the floor for the first time to plead the 
innocence and virtue of her brother. But she said something more 
important, really, than that she was standing by for sibling loyalty. 
She said that "only" the jurors could pronounce the truth on all these 
questions being raised. The truth, of course, on whether O.J. killed 
Nicole and Goldman. But, derivatively, the case Mr. Cochran was 
pleading: that Mark Fuhrman, the racist detective, was 
indistinguishable from Adolf Hitler, that the Los Angeles police are 
happy to send an innocent man to jail for life, even though they know 
him not to be guilty. The point here is that, once again, we are asked 
to see the jury as an instrument for uncovering the Truth. To believe 
this is to surrender to the powers of hypnotists.
                         <P>
That of course is what Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck have attempted 
to do, to hypnotize the jury, and the inducements have been about as 
comprehensive as they can be. If you believe that Hitler was evil, 
then you have to fight Hitlerism in America, which is embodied in Mark 
Fuhrman, who uncovered the glove with O.J.'s blood on it, which glove 
had been placed there by Hitler. If you believe that the Los Angeles 
Police Department did some sloppy work, then you must believe that its 
motive in doing so was to advance the fraudulent case against O.J. If 
you believe, with Luke, that little lies often indicate bigger lies, 
then you must vindicate O.J. You cannot, simultaneously, believe in 
O.J.'s guilt, and in St. Luke's divine inspiration.
                <P>
It does remind one -- does it not? -- of some of the great show trials 
of the Thirties, conducted by Stalin. When it was charged that 
Bukharin was guilty of counterrevolutionary activity, not only the 
Soviet court nodded its acquiescent head, but a lot of other people 
did too, including American intellectuals. It required the labors of 
the Dewey Commission and some hard analysis by a generation of 
scholars to set the record absolutely right. In Moscow the court was 
the creature of Josef Stalin and would have ruled, if told to do so, 
that the earth is flat. The question seriously arises whether the 
court, in Los Angeles, becomes the creature of Johnnie Cochran, whose 
use of apocalyptic rhetoric transforms the question, Did he do it, or 
did he not do it? into the question, Do you believe in God, do you not 
believe in God? Into, Do you believe in civil liberties, do you not 
believe in civil liberties? 
                                                                                <P>
If one had confidence in Judge Ito one might hope that he could move 
the jury back to reality, to relieve the jury of any notion that it is 
complicit in Nazism if it finds O.J. guilty. How would the Soviet 
court have reacted if it had been given, the day before its ruling, 
Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon to read? But Judge Ito is in over 
his head, and just possibly it is true that Western judicial procedure 
is in over its head. If a persuasive shaman is left free to seduce a 
bleary, near-dead-from-fatigue jury that theirs is to justify death, 
or to save Western idealism, then we are talking about something very 
different from the administration of justice.

<title>Buckley:  The Hangover</title>

<i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 5</i>

<hr>

<h2>The Hangover</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
The brainy wife of the brainy professor said, "I think the O.J. 
verdict should be protested." The brainy professor said, "How?"
                            <P>
Indeed. How?
                    <P>
The prattle, in which such as Senator Dole are engaged, is that we 
must accept the verdict and turn over a new leaf. Well, it is one 
thing to accept the verdict as a juridical reality: Nobody is arguing 
that O. J. Simpson should be sent back to jail. It is quite another 
thing to abide by the superstition that justice has been done. A lot 
of white folks who lynched black folks in the bad days went scot free 
because white jurors wouldn't convict them. But there are those who 
left that age with their honor intact: they screamed and yelled, and 
insisted that justice was not done. Screaming and yelling doesn't come 
naturally to a lot of people, but the brainy wife of the brainy 
professor was right, the verdict should be protested. 
          <P>
One way to do this is to remark the little filigrees on formal 
acquittal, and resist their effrontery. Johnnie Cochran tells the 
press moments after the verdict that the will of God has been done, as 
he knew it would be. One sighs: someone who can compare Mark Fuhrman 
to Adolf Hitler can, one supposes, adduce the will of God as 
motivating the jury's finding. Let us in charity assume that the 
relatives of O.J. sincerely thought him to be innocent, and pass over 
their bulletins to the effect that justice had been done. But what are 
we to make of O.J.'s solemn declaration that, now that the distraction 
has been swept away, the police should get serious and search out the 
real killer. He, O.J., will do "whatever it takes" to identify him. 
One way to begin this search is for everyone to submit a blood sample 
to the laboratories. And then ask the one out of 28 million with the 
telltale blood -- that adds up to about thirty people, sprinkled about 
in Tibet, Tierra del Fuego, and Kazakhstan -- what they were doing on 
the night of June 12, 1994.
<P>
And yes, we really should equip ourselves against hit-and-run self-
vindication by legerdemain. Johnnie Cochran was on Larry King Live on 
Wednesday saying what you would expect, the phone rings, and lo! O.J. 
is on the line. He says serene things, and then chastises a woman who 
had called in to ask Mr. Cochran to explain the shadowy creature who 
had been identified by the limo driver as coming into the Rockingham 
driveway just before 11 the night of the murders. O.J. says, Did the 
woman not listen to the witness, because the witness, if you followed 
him carefully, had said something quite different, and oh! how much 
he, O.J., had suffered from people drawing conclusions from the 
testimony which the testifiers had simply not said, understand?
                                     <P>
It is on the order of rising to say, "I told you there wasn't a purple 
cow on the property that night, DID I NOT?" People begin nodding their 
heads. We are off to the races with the reconstruction of the scene 
that night in June, one little piece at a time. 
                         <P>
What effect will the verdict have on the career of Colin Powell, 
somebody asked? Answer: One would hope none. But there is most 
definitely a danger there. When 75 percent of black Americans believe 
that the answer is A, not B, and 75 percent of white Americans 
believe that the answer is B, not A, then what we have is a breakdown 
in communication between two cultures. Either we share a common 
language and a common rational apparatus or we do not. It is a very 
very scary thing when three-quarters of one ethnic group flatly 
disagree with three-quarters of another ethnic group about the 
structure of rational arguments. It is simply wrong to suppose that 
the white majority believed O.J. to be guilty because he was black. It 
is simply undeniable that the black majority believed him innocent 
because he was black. And -- remarkably -- those figures remained 
static throughout those endless months of testimony. It was tempting 
for the white majority to conclude that the black majority was engaged 
in iconolatry. O.J. is a hero and that is the end of it. 
                <P>
Not entirely hard to understand. If the spelunkers were to come up 
from their caves with evidence that St. Francis of Assisi ate live 
pigeons for breakfast, there are those of us who would simply refuse 
to believe it. Legends, to be legendary, must be sacred, inviolate. 
But this is not to dodge the question: Yes. If the innocence of O.J. 
is a black postulate, then intercommunication has suffered a quite 
awful setback.

<title>Buckley:  Understanding the Papal Bull</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center>

<i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>Understanding the Papal Bull</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>



The impression made by Pope John Paul was quite simply stunning. 
Granted, the panoply was intoxicatingly splendid; yet all those 
millions of candles and choirboys and bishops would not have given the 
spectator such life as he got from what he saw and heard if its 
centerpiece had been a nice old bore. The transfiguring feature of all 
those appearances was the man, and his words. "May the Holy Spirit 
strengthen your hearts, making them blameless and holy before our God 
and Father, so that you may serve His people with ever greater joy." 
We are not talking about sound bites.
                                                            <P>
But one needs to be reminded that the exhortations of a pope are 
customarily done in the paradigmatic mode, which is fitting for the 
primary spokesman for Biblical injunctions. The language of Moses and 
of Christ is totalist in its formulation. We are enjoined to be -- 
saintly.
                                            <P>
This is beyond the reach of all but the very few. Even so, what we 
hear said about how we should be cannot be attenuated by the 
foreknowledge of man's inability to attain perfection. Give everything 
you have to the poor and join the pilgrimage of Christ -- here is a 
rock-solid injunction, toward the discharge of which human efforts are 
almost necessarily asymptotic. States are the organs of individuals, 
and so one runs into difficulties translating Christian imperatives 
into social policy. This is a problem that every pope in this century 
has faced, and Pope John Paul II cannot solve it, perhaps because it 
cannot be solved.
                            <P>
It has frequently been noticed that papal declarations tend to be 
undernourished on the matter of production. The emphasis is almost 
always on distribution. Thus we hear from papal declarations dating 
back more than one century about the obligation of the rich to give to 
the poor. The question naturally arises: It is right for Wealthy John 
to give to Poor Peter, but do we translate this into an obligation by 
John to vote to instruct Internal Revenue to descend on Wealthy James, 
to give to Poor Peter? The incorporation of individual virtue into 
state policy is a difficult business.
                 <P>
Consider the question of immigration. The Pope said, shortly after 
landing, "America keeps compassion, generosity and concern for others 
at the very heart of its efforts. . . . From the beginning until now, 
the United States has been a haven for generation after generation of 
new arrivals. Men, women, and children have streamed here from every 
corner of the globe, building new lives and forming a society of rich 
ethnic and racial diversity based on commitment to a shared vision of 
human dignity and freedom."
  <P>
Now this is not accurate historical accounting. What it is is a 
sublimation of American history. It is American history as it would be 
recounted if Americans were all saints -- and if no grass ever grew to 
interrupt the waterflow of goodness.
                                                                              <P>
What is true is that American compassion has been marked and still is: 
50 per cent of the world's immigration to the developed countries is 
into the United States. But it is also true that several times in 
American history Congress has elected to limit, or even to suspend, 
immigration. Sometimes the motivations of individual congressmen are 
xenophobic -- they just don't want any more foreigners. The Oriental 
Exclusion Act was quite straightforward on this matter.
                                                               <P>
But sometimes, also, practical considerations were at the forefront of 
legislative action. During the Depression it would hardly have made 
sense to invite a large wave of immigrants into a country in which 
millions were suffering and 20 per cent were unemployed. And then the 
question arises today: Is it a trespass on Christian principles to 
advocate a temporary restriction in the current rate of immigration? 
Is Barbara Jordan -- who headed the commission that recommended 
exactly that -- anti-Christian?
                                               <P>
Manifestly, it isn't so. Yet to advocate reduced immigration isn't to 
fault the Pope for speaking in the language of prophets, who deal not, 
and should not deal, with such questions as: Is California going broke 
under the burden? Is multiculturalism breaking up our culture? Why are 
there national borders, if immigration is not properly a matter of 
government policy?
                                   <P>
What we are left with is the papal injunction to: compassion, 
generosity, and concern for others. The particularization of those 
sentiments is necessarily a problem for individual states.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  Should There Be a Law?</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 13</i><hr><h2>Should There Be a Law?</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 

This is an exploratory column, its purpose to encourage thought on a 
question that badly needs thinking about. 
<p>
The Problem: The birth every year of one million babies to unwed 
mothers. 
<p>
The Consequence: One million children who, on reaching the age of 13, 
tend to run into difficulties. The statistics tell us that the child 
raised by a single parent is likelier by a factor of 600 per cent to 
commit crimes, consume drugs, quit school, and bear, or sire, children 
out of wedlock. Assume -- if only to be hopeful -- that the problems 
diminish after age 19, we are still left with six million teenagers 
who are a heavy social burden, as also, of course, a burden to 
themselves. 
<p>
A Social Deterrent? Since manifestly it is against the interest of 
society, for reasons moral and material, to encourage the birth of 
babies to unwed mothers, what might be done to discourage the 
practice? Only one serious suggestion has been made, and at book 
length, by Mr. Charles Murray. He believes that welfare payments to 
unwed mothers serve as inducements and therefore that to eliminate 
that miscarriage of charity would significantly reduce illegitimacy 
(which is up, in the last thirty years, from 5 per cent to 18 per cent 
among whites, from 25 per cent to 63 per cent among blacks). We have 
seen that Congress has played around with this question, and that the 
proposal is well on its way to limit payments to two illegitimate 
births. This approach hardly addresses the problem with appropriate 
sternness. Among other things, we all know that if the third child 
were sick or starving, we'd look after it. The effort should focus on 
preventing the procreative act, rather than on mistreating the child.
<p>
A Civil Delinquency? As things now stand, the father (or mother) of a 
child born out of wedlock runs into no civil resistance of any sort. 
As far as the law is concerned, it is safer to have a bastard child 
than to double-park. A couple of years ago Bill Moyers did a 
documentary on the culture of wanton sex and found himself speaking to 
a young black stud, about twenty years old if memory serves, who 
proudly acknowledged fatherhood of three children by three different 
girls/ women, and gaily announced his intention of pursuing his 
bluebirdism, since he found it amusing. All that Mr. Moyers was able 
to manage was a gentle sigh for the pieties of yesteryear, which will 
get you exactly nothing from the people we are talking about. 
<p>
Are There Other Deterrents? Well yes, there are. To list some such is 
not necessarily to recommend them. But just as the Pentagon 
undoubtedly has a file on how to invade Switzerland, here is one on 
some of the deterrents that might be given a little thought.
<p>
 -- Deny a driving license to the parents for five years. (This side 
of imprisonment and death by hanging, this is the deepest known 
deprivation in the American culture.)
<p>
 -- Require the father to perform ten hours of appropriate work every 
week on whatever project makes sense. 
<p>
 -- Require the father to spend three evenings every week sequestered. 
Including Saturday night.
<p>
 -- Do a vasectomy on the man. A Norplant on the girl. 
<p>
Now these approaches raise problems, to put it lightly. There is, to 
begin with, the problem of locating the father. This accomplished, 
some proceeding or another would need to address the question whether, 
when the sexual union was done, the parties had agreed somewhere along 
the line to get married. In Sweden, about one-half the babies are 
conceived pre-marriage, but 90 per cent are born to two parents living 
together. How do you handle the situation: "Henry said he loved me and 
we'd be married just as soon as he finished high school"?
<p>
Is there a constitutional problem? Suppose that Henry says that 
without a driver's license he will be fired, because he earns his 
money delivering newspapers? Can the physical detention of the father 
be done without a judicial proceeding? Are there at hand convenient 
ways of absolutely identifying the father by DNA? Are vasectomies and 
Norplants acceptable, under such circumstances, in moral theology?
<p>
All these are designed as open questions, to flush out thought. 
Although commentary can't be acknowledged, I'd welcome having it, 
directed to me here at NATIONAL REVIEW, 150 East 35th Street, New 
York, N.Y. 10016.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  The UN at 50</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 24</i><hr><h2>The UN at 50</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Fifty years of the United Nations certainly does not bring on 
undifferentiated congratulations. The world organization received a 
jump start on hypocrisy when, in San Francisco, on a motion that 
Sweden, Switzerland, and Ireland be admitted, the ruling was negative, 
on the grounds that they were not "peace-loving nations." They were 
three countries that had not gone to war. But the term "peace-loving" 
had already got into the hands of the wordsmiths who gave us the 
"Democratic Republic of Germany," which was Soviet-speak for 
undemocratic unrepublican East Germany. 
<p>
In the Security Council we had from the outset the Soviet Union as a 
permanent member with veto rights, and then China, with the same 
rights. And in the General Assembly, with spooky consistency the Third 
World powers voted against Western measures, in line with Soviet 
measures. When in 1960 Fidel Castro, freshly arrived in power, visited 
the UN, he was hailed as a hero. In 1979, after he had clearly 
established himself as a ruler as tyrannical as those who presided 
over North Korea and Albania, he visited the United Nations again; 
and, again, was treated as a hero by the majority of its members. 
<p>
On Sunday, President Clinton opened the celebratory proceedings by 
giving a moderate speech about this and that. Later in the day, Castro 
spoke -- the usual tirade against Western conventions, larded with the 
usual declamations in favor of self-government everywhere except in 
Cuba -- and got an ovation. Much heavier applause than that given to 
the President of the host country, our old friend, the superpower, 
Uncle Sam. 
<p>
We pause to note that one reason for the anti-U.S. fever within the UN 
these days is our failure to pay our debt to the UN. When the 
organization was founded, President Truman accepted an imposition on 
the U.S. of 40 per cent of the UN's budget. In the immediate postwar 
world that was not an unreasonable allocation, given that we were at 
the time generating about 50 per cent of the world's production. In 
1972 we reduced our share to 25 per cent, in line with the reviving 
economic fortunes of other countries. But in 1982 we began to stall on 
our payments, in part because we thought the allocations for peace-
keeping expenses were rigged against us, in part because the relevant 
committees in Congress found it tempting to economize at the expense 
of an organization not all that popular back home.
<p>
But the result of it is a very considerable embarrassment. If the 
State Department believes we are unfairly burdened, then that case 
should be made. But to make it by simply refusing to pay is to act the 
deadbeat. We are not alone in lateness in paying our share, but we are 
the major offender and certainly the most conspicuous. It would be 
nice to hear from the presidential candidates that they don't go for 
cheating on obligations, whether to the American Express Company or to 
the United Nations.
<p>
The pointed objective of Fidel Castro this time around is to generate 
pressure to repeal the U.S. embargo. It is nice to see the 
tatterdemalion prince of universal prosperity through Marxism begging 
U.S. business to come on down and give him a hand. And on the merits 
of the argument, there is every reason to restore relations with Cuba 
given that it is no longer a salient of a global power seeking the 
overthrow of the United States. We would need to swallow our pride, 
but then that is healthy: we did not succeed in bringing Castro down, 
and it is not dignified to salve our bad consciences by continuing 
policies appropriate only during the Cold War. We are trading with 
Vietnam and China, and we never really broke off from trading with the 
Soviet Union, so why Castro?
<p>
He made his demonstration at the UN, and sharply, and sadly, reminded 
us all that if the division within the UN were once again suddenly to 
return to Communist superpower challenging Western superpower, we'd 
almost certainly find ourselves face to face with the old lineup. 
About 80 per cent anti-American. The old juices run strong, anti-, and 
jealous of, success; there are memories mired in anti-colonialist 
slogans, and then, too, some defensible skepticism over U.S. 
leadership. 
<p>
But the UN is with us. We should pay our debt, ignore most of its 
pieties, and make policy as we have always made it, soliciting UN 
sanction but quite prepared, when necessary, to ignore it.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  New York Live</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>NEW YORK, OCTOBER 27</i><hr><h2>New York Live</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
New York City early in the week was just the place to sharpen up on 
political and social protocol, Messrs. Giuliani and Rangel acting as 
dancing masters. The headlines went to the mayor, who sent two 
bouncers to Lincoln Center to escort Yasir Arafat out of the theater. 
This was done, apparently, even though the Palestinian delegation had 
received three tickets for the concert organized by the mayor for his 
international diplomats. The ouster was hailed by Mr. Giuliani's most 
intimate associates, condemned by everyone else, the State Department 
apoplectic in the matter. Mr. Giuliani's point was that as a 
prosecutor years ago he had handled, or been given to study, instances 
of terrorism done by Arafat and his organization. He would not, he 
declared to the press, serve as gracious host to anyone who had 
engaged in terrorism. 
<p>
That position can empty the house, of course. The former prime 
minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, not only participated in terrorist 
activity, he headed up Irgun, a terrorist organization. Nelson 
Mandela, even in jail, headed up an organization that proudly and 
defiantly exercised and defended terrorism. But if Mayor Giuliani had 
led President Mandela from the floor, he'd have provoked the black 
community, and maybe even would have violated one of the civil-rights 
laws. President Jiang Zemin of China is not too old to have 
participated in the Cultural Revolution, sustained by acts of state 
terrorism designed to tranquilize inquisitive children. And of course 
we had Castro.
<p>
Castro is a continuing phenomenon. After his opening speech at the UN 
he donned his battle fatigues and went up to Harlem, where he was 
treated as O.J. would have been if he had killed two women, not just 
one. Representative Charlie Rangel gave and got a bear hug, a 
significant emotional advancement for a man who only a few years ago 
railed against any commerce, diplomatic or material, with South 
Africa. <p>

The curious were entitled to wonder exactly why. Why should Democratic 
die-hard Charles Rangel be enthusiastic about the accomplishments of 
Fidel Castro? To begin with, there are no accomplishments save for 
full employment for prison guards and executioners. The only 
significant accomplishment of Fidel Castro is to have kept himself 
alive, given that there are at least a million Cubans who would gladly 
pull the trap on any scaffold on which Fidel Castro was poised. And 
staying alive was a considerable achievement, given that the United 
States' Operation Mongoose made several attempts to assassinate him, 
including one that dispatched for his use a scuba-diving suit that 
after a few minutes would transform itself into a host of piranhas; 
and, on another occasion, a superb cigar, except that it was designed 
to explode after two or three draws. On this matter, Fidel had himself 
a good laugh, when he told his audience in Harlem that he was not 
participating in State Department ceremonies because he didn't want to 
"interfere in this country's foreign affairs." 
<p>
Castro was received at the Council on Foreign Relations, which is okay 
given that the CFR flat-out invites any state leader, no questions 
asked, to its chambers to discuss that leader's line. And then also 
Castro dined privately with twenty establishment figures. Among them 
was Robert McNamara, defense secretary at the time Castro was 
receiving nuclear missiles aimed at the United States. We must suppose 
that Secretary McNamara apologized for acting so peremptorily back in 
1962 when he demanded the withdrawal of the missiles. We like to think 
that Castro was big about it and forgave McNamara. 
<p>
He was after all in an expansive mood, boasting that there were more 
doctors per capita in Cuba than in the United States and offering to 
send to America a few doctors to look after Americans in need. We were 
reminded of Eva Peron, who in 1949 offered straightfacedly to send 
clothes for the underclad children in Washington. . . . <p>And all the 
while New Yorkers thought that the burlesque was on Broadway.

<html><head><title>Buckley:  Yitzhak Rabin, RIP</title>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 7</i>

<hr>

<h2>Yitzhak Rabin, RIP</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

Viewing the TV and reading the papers in the days after the 
assassination one got some idea of how Mr. Rabin operated. One 
reporter said that to see Mr. Rabin was as easy as calling him up and 
taking the ten-minute trip from the reporter's office to the office of 
the prime minister. Another spoke of his "thirty or forty" sessions 
with him over the years.
<p>
And then there were the eulogies. A retired professor who served many 
years on the college admissions committee spoke once of the skill 
developed after a few years in detecting letters of recommendation 
that are synthetic. Just so, listeners to eulogies develop after a 
while an ability to discriminate between the formalistic and the 
genuine. Many eloquent statements were made, some of them -- from men 
and women who had worked closely with Rabin -- heartfelt beyond any 
histrionic power to deceive. The tribute paid by Henry Kissinger is 
not easily forgotten.
<p>
Three days ago I'd have thought it singular to recall that twice Mr. 
Rabin was with me on Firing Line and that he had once come with a 
friend to lunch with my wife and me in Switzerland. To say this now, 
which is to confess to only three encounters with him over the years, 
suggests I was practically an exile, all but ignored by the great man, 
so profuse were his journalistic and social energies.
<p>
The various passions stirred by his death are by now familiar. We know 
that a cruel element of the tragedy was the background of the 
assassin: of all things, an Orthodox Jew, rising to kill the greatest 
living Jewish hero. There is the consternation having to do with the 
political legacy. Yes, Shimon Peres will pursue the same ends. But 
although it is acknowledged that the death of Mr. Rabin will renew the 
momentum of the peace movement, its longevity cannot be taken for 
granted. When Lincoln died (Ambassador Eagleburger likened the two 
events) the nation was for a period buoyed by the sentiments he 
expressed in his second inaugural address, but it was not long before 
Reconstruction became the ugly thing it was.
<p>
In the case of Israel, something needs to be done to restore the 
perspective of those who fought Rabin. It is difficult to believe that 
people who deem themselves Israeli patriots would as recently as a few 
weeks ago design an effigy of Rabin wearing swastikas. In New York 
City one young follower of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane declared on 
television that violence can be "bad" but it can also be "good." He 
had whatever reserve of good sense it took to decline to say that he 
was pleased that Rabin had been a target of "good" violence, but he 
left that impression, cultivating as he was the line that the return 
by Israel of parts of the West Bank was high treason.
<p>
Policy differences, then, can hardly be expected to disappear in 
tribute to one martyr. Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu was convincing in his 
disavowal of the killer-division of the Israelis who join him in 
opposing the policies of Rabin and Peres. But there are Jews who are 
models of civil rectitude who oppose those policies, and they will not 
be silenced by the silencing of Mr. Rabin, nor should they: the 
security of Israel is properly the paramount concern of the Israeli 
government.
<p>
It's not all that easy to communicate to others the meaning of the 
birth of the State of Israel. Jeffrey Hart, writing several years ago, 
put it, "Now I can understand why Israel in fact has become sacred. 
The history of the twentieth century is, to put it mildly, unique. The 
Holocaust is a sort of hole in the cosmos, a guarantor of the 
existence of evil. It is an equivalent for Jews of the Crucifixion. 
Israel then became the equivalent of the Redemption. This is true even 
for relatively secular Jews. Judaism has never successfully separated 
God and Tribe. The People itself is the God carrier. I think that from 
a full experience of the twentieth century I am willing to accept the 
sacredness of Israel as a religious fact."
<p>
That is the reason the death of Yitzhak Rabin was a transfiguring 
event. That he died, and how he died, and when he died, and for what 
he died. <p>

<html><head><title>Buckley:  What Made Colin Run?</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<center>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 10</i>

<hr>

<h2>What Made Colin Run?</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

The grave dignity of Colin Powell's announcement had the effect of 
causing dismayed observers to thrash out at those who had opposed his 
candidacy. This is a psychological phenomenon: Mom has an accident 
coming home from work and reproaches abound -- Why did Dad let her go 
on working so late in life? Why didn't Sonny, who after all is a car 
salesman, force Mom to get a better, stronger car? To say nothing of 
Mom's stupid eye doctor, who should have known Mom's glasses needed 
strengthening.
<p>
It happens even to wise and street-smart chappies, e.g., William 
Safire of the New York Times. He let himself go twice in his Powell 
column, once directly, once obliquely. He set up his target by 
carefully orienting his argument as testimony to General Powell's 
courage, a technique he knows as paralepsis, which is the affirmation 
of the point you wish to make by denying it ("I come to bury Caesar, 
not to praise him"); only Safire did it the other way around. 
"Certainly Powell was not chased off the field by the performance last 
week before the National Press Club of the Hard-Right Follies; the 
finger-wagging by that old abortion-and-school-prayer set was manna 
from Heaven for a moderate Republican's nomination campaign." Later in 
the same column, Mr. Safire made reference to "Arlen Specter, the pro-
choice candidate, with nobody on his side on that issue except the 
majority of Republican voters."
<p>
The Miami Herald weighed in weightily. "True conservatives want frugal 
government, but also prudent investments in children, concern for the 
needy, and a desire to widen economic opportunity, not just pile 
benefits onto the wealthy. General Powell says that 'the party of 
Lincoln' (a phrase borrowed from Kemp) [my impression was that the 
phrase was first used by Andrew Johnson] can balance these interests 
best, and that's why he chose to be a Republican. But he recognizes 
that he will have to fight -- hard -- to restore those values to a 
party lately hijacked by the Christian Coalition and its acolytes." 
And then Maureen Dowd, also of the New York Times, contributed the 
news that General Powell "had exposed the Christian Right as a 
panicked sectarian phenomenon."
<p>
What are we to make of all this? The Christian Right is indeed 
sectarian, which is why it isn't the Muslim Right, or the Jewish 
Right, however much the three faiths may have in common. And 
"panicked" is probably a defensible term to describe a movement deeply 
concerned by a rise of 400 per cent in serious crimes during the past 
generation and 300 per cent in illegitimate births. The word 
"panicked" is subjectively used, of course. Only three days ago, one 
newspaper report informed us that President Clinton was "panicked" at 
the prospect of General Powell's running. We have to assume that a 
metaphor was intended, given that nobody caught Bill Clinton about to 
throw himself out the window.
<p>
But the reference by Bill Safire is confusing, the business about 
"that old abortion-and-school-prayer set." Either he is saying that 
there should be term limits on concern over abortion and school 
prayer, or else he is saying that the questions have been debated and 
are behind us. It isn't that Mr. Safire is indisposed to stay in a 
battle for as long as it takes. He was a doughty soldier during the 
Cold War, which began many years before Roe v. Wade, but Safire was in 
there right up until the Berlin Wall came down, God bless him, and if 
it takes a hundred years to guarantee the safety of Israel, we cannot 
reasonably doubt that Bill Safire's great-grandchildren will be 
sounding the Zionist bell, and more power to them. If he is saying 
that, on the contrary, people ought to give up on school prayer, there 
are those who respectfully disagree, among them -- who knows? -- God!, 
who is contingently capable of influencing elections. And a call to 
acknowledge human life in the fetus isn't a question of the kind one 
ought to get bored about unless research absolutely establishes that, 
all the time, a fetus was really no different from a tomato.
<p>
The right-wing gentlemen who met last week to serve notice on General 
Powell that he had made references disquieting to them, honorable 
representatives of conservative positions within the GOP, spoke 
respectably on the issues to which they have devoted themselves for 
many years. They didn't raise a single question about General Powell 
that hadn't been raised, that same week, by George Will, but Mr. 
Safire and Miss Dowd and the Miami Herald have an instinctive sense -- 
maybe it was sharpened by reading General Powell's autobiography? -- 
who to pick on when Mom has an accident on the highway, and who to let 
alone.<p>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 14</i>
<hr>
<h2>X-Ray Time</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
It is useful to examine the federal deadlock through a strictly 
democratic prism.
<p>
1. We have a separation of powers that authorizes Congress uniquely to 
pass legislation; and a subdivision here that authorizes only the 
House of Representatives to write bills that will cost money.
<p>
2. The President is authorized to veto any bill presented to him by 
Congress. To override a presidential veto requires two-thirds of the 
vote in each house.
<p>
3. In the existing situation, a majority of both houses passes a 
measure that would simultaneously do a great many things, including 
program an increase in payments required by the public to sustain 
Medicaid and Medicare.
<p>
4. The President exercises his veto, complaining specifically about 
the measure's health-care provisions.
<p>
5. Congressional leadership asks itself: Given that an override of the 
veto cannot be recruited, how might Congress force its hand on the 
President?
<p>
Force its hand!? Yes, that is what Messrs. Dole and Gingrich are 
saying in effect, because they are seeking to implement what they 
understand as strict instructions from the American people. They are 
to move toward balancing the budget, and their plan for doing so is 
blocked by the President's power.
<p>
But Congress also has power. The continuation of federal activity, 
including the health benefits, requires financing. It is generally 
assumed that so-called entitlements are inertial forces that cannot be 
interrupted. But the forward movement of those forces requires 
constant propulsion, and this is doable only by appropriations by 
Congress.
<p>
The leadership is quite confident that its mandate hasn't withered 
since it was enunciated in the November election. A national survey 
done by Public Opinion Strategies only a week ago reveals that 66 per 
cent of Americans favor "balancing the budget [even] if that means 
that spending on Medicare and Medicaid would continue to increase but 
at a lower rate." Accordingly, Congress uses its trump card and 
freezes spending at the highest level authorized by a preceding 
Congress, i.e., at 4.9 trillion borrowed dollars.
<p>
So: The people voted, Congress acted, the President vetoed, Congress 
used its primordial power.
<p>
In a parliamentary system, such an impasse would be quickly solved. 
The parliament would be dissolved, an election scheduled. If the party 
upholding a balanced budget prevailed in that election, the prime 
minister would resign and be replaced by a member of the validated 
party. If otherwise, the prime minister would be back with a compliant 
legislature. But then, the prime minister wouldn't be occupying the 
executive mansion unless placed there by the ruling faction in the 
legislature. What we face today is what the British would call a 
constitutional crisis.
<p>
The public has not yet been discomfited, and no one will be for a 
period, the exception being 800,000 furloughed federal workers. The 
Treasury secretary is maneuvering and isn't likely to run out of gas 
unless a major creditor nation decides that there is too much harum-
scarum going on and, instead of holding its reserves in dollars, 
switches to yen, or marks, or pounds sterling.
<p>
What we do have is high-pitched political theater. The people are 
vaguely aware of the instructions they gave to the new Congress, but 
they are, with various degrees of intensity, concerned with medical 
care, and that element of Americans most concerned is of course the 
senior citizens, and it is they who exercise critical clout. The 
President is relying on his incantatory evocations of starving 
children and homeless old people, with here and there a tear shed for 
what used to be Yellowstone Park. Presidential indignation makes its 
way quickly to the headlines.
<p>
By contrast, it is Congress that is held to be the agent of all those 
things, and we come quickly on the supreme irony, which is that 
references are almost inevitably to the "rigid," the "defiant," the 
"reckless" Congress, the complement of the lonely, single defender of 
the people's interest. There was never a better example of everybody 
being out of step except Johnny.<p>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 17</i>
<hr>
<h2>25 Hours at Sea</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Countdown time. In little more than a week, the government of the 
United States is scheduled to close down, there having been an impasse 
between the Executive Branch of government and the Legislative Branch. 
An esteemed world leader is assassinated, resulting in an Air Force 
One flight to Israel. Lo and behold, in the very same airplane are: 
the leader of the Executive Branch and the two leaders of the 
Legislative Branch. 
<P>
They will be 25 hours in the same airplane! Could it be that the God 
Jehovah planned it that way? The golden opportunity to come together, 
35,000 feet up in the air, a thousand miles away from the nearest air 
field, and spend some time discussing the future of the Republic? 
<P>
But protocol reigns, and the airplane belongs, so to speak, to the 
leader of the Executive Branch; the two leaders of the Legislature are 
on board as guests. The initiative, therefore, has to come from the 
host.
<P>
But he doesn't approach them. Why? Well, we are told, he was grieving 
the loss of the slain world leader. The President of the United States 
could not drive from his mind his concern for intra-Israeli 
reconciliation. During the 12 hours heading east all he could think of 
was -- Hebron. To that problem, and the surrounding problem of the 
West Bank, he bent his mighty political powers -- that, and his 
concern for the grieving widow and children. 
<P>
On the journey back, the doctor told the President he simply had to 
make an effort -- as a sacrifice for his country -- to distract 
himself from his preoccupation with Israeli fratricide. He needed 
therapy. And, since Bill Clinton is a soldier, even if he never went 
through formal basic training, he consented to make the effort, but 
stipulated that the only game he would consent to play was Hearts, 
which reminded him of the valentines he used to exchange with the 
slain prime minister. 
<P>
Meanwhile, at the other end of the plane the two legislative leaders 
fidgeted, wondering when the President would come in, or else summon 
them to his quarters, to put it all out on the table. There isn't that 
much time left! is what was going through their minds. They looked out 
the window and saw Ireland go by, no summons. A couple of hours later 
they spotted Gander. Then Nova Scotia. Then Long Island. They 
permitted themselves to wonder whether a deal could be made between 
Long Island and Andrews Air Force Base, which after all was 90 minutes 
away, time enough to come up with something that would put off the 
crisis for a couple of weeks, maybe. 
<P>
At that point Senator Dole is said to have turned to Newt and 
suggested that maybe the President could be persuaded to meet with 
them in Dayton to discuss the problem. But Newt was getting a little 
fed up and said there wouldn't be any rooms available in Dayton, not 
till all those Serbs and Croats and Muslims were out of there. Dole 
nodded and was about to suggest an alternative meeting place when an 
aide appeared, with the landing instructions. 
<P>
They couldn't believe it! It was stipulated that the two leaders of 
the Legislature should disembark from the rear of the airplane. At 
first they reasoned that the purpose for this was to avoid any body 
contact with the President that might result in impetuous bargaining 
over what to do about the close of government at midnight. But no, Bob 
Dole said, there's no realistic fear of that happening, since there 
will be too much hustle and bustle getting out of the plane. There has 
to be some other motive. After all, in Israel we all disembarked up 
front. To change that plan now suggests a motive. 
<P>
Newt looked up. He had got the idea! He was a historian, he told Bob, 
and he knew something about affronts on a major scale, and this was 
one of them. It hasn't absolutely been established, but there are 
revisionists out there who are convinced that Brutus acted as he did 
because of the inferior box Julius Caesar had stuck him in at the 
Colosseum's opening on the Ides of February. The President, he said, 
is trying to provoke us! He doesn't want reconciliation, he wants a 
public shoot-out with as many blasts on TV as he can get out of it! 
<P>
Senator Dole furrowed his brow. There was always an alternative, he 
said. We could let the budget stay unbalanced? 
<P>
Newt shook his head. No. We'll follow the lead of Caesar, and see what 
happens.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 21</i>
<hr>
<h2>McNamara's Final Surrender</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Robert McNamara has every right to publish a book advising the world 
that in his opinion we had been wrong, "terribly wrong," in engaging 
in war in Vietnam. But what more can be said about the liberties of 
Bob McNamara? He is free, if he is so impelled, to join the Communist 
Party; or to form one, if it no longer exists. What is creepy about 
his most recent exercise in self-mortification is the auspices under 
which it is being done. 
<P>
If you missed it, Mr. McNamara went to Vietnam, alongside a few other 
dignitaries whose names do not get into the papers, under the auspices 
of the Council on Foreign Relations. The announced purpose was to 
explore whether the war might have ended sooner, or indeed might have 
been averted altogether.
<P>
Now I am a member, however inert, of the Council on Foreign Relations, 
and I wonder why it should sponsor on a trip to Vietnam someone who 
has publicly abjured the reasoning of Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, 
Johnson, and Nixon, and the overwhelming majority of their advisors, 
on why the operation in Vietnam was justified. Inasmuch as Mr. 
McNamara received approximately 100 per cent of the publicity of the 
visiting delegation, the world has quite reasonably concluded that his 
oblation constitutes an official apology by the United States for 
acting as it did.
<P>
Well, the world is wrong; Mr. McNamara arrived with no such portfolio. 
When a few days ago Japan finally elected to apologize for Japanese 
conduct in Korea during and before the Second World War, the apology 
was tendered by the prime minister and represented official government 
opinion. McNamara's sole credential was as one representative of the 
Council on Foreign Relations. Several questions arise. The first is, 
What is the purpose in sending on a mission to investigate tensions 
with Vietnam an American who has publicly rejected, indeed scorned, 
the reason for such tensions? He wholly rejects the reasoning of the 
President who made him secretary of defense, the successor President 
who in 1964 was elected by a landslide in part because of his 
reaffirmation of the policy of containment, pronounced twenty years 
earlier by President Truman calling for resistance to Communist 
aggression whether in Greece, in Berlin, in Iran, in Guatemala, in 
Korea -- or in Vietnam.
<P>
It would have been interesting if our former secretary of defense, in 
his meeting with General Giap -- essentially Vietnam's secretary of 
defense -- had met as old football coaches might have done to exchange 
locker-room talk about what might have worked in this situation, what 
in that situation. But Mr. McNamara wasn't in Vietnam to say to Giap, 
"You proved the better soldier." He was there as the prominent 
American whose support of the war, advertised so proudly while in 
office, had mutated, after thirty tortuous years, into a profound 
rejection of all the premises of that war. If a Christian theologian 
decides, at age 78, that on second thought he doesn't really think 
Christ was the Redeemer, he isn't very useful as a delegate to a 
conference inquiring into the causes of impiety. And there is no 
evidence that Mr. McNamara ever thought to ask General Giap such 
questions as, Since I have retreated from my moral position about 
going to war, have you retreated from yours about treating the people 
of Vietnam like slaves?
<P>
In 1964, McNamara absolutely affirmed that the Vietnamese were 
responsible for a second assault on an American naval vessel on August 
4, 1964. He now declares that he is "overwhelmingly" convinced that no 
such assault actually occurred. And who does he ask to confirm his 
reversal? Why, the man who would have engineered the Tonkin Gulf 
attack. It happens that I am a student, however superficial, of the 
Tonkin Gulf episode, and I am convinced it never happened, but I am 
deeply convinced that the military and the Administration did 
genuinely believe it had happened. But the idea of going to Giap to 
ask for final judgment in the matter is the equivalent of going to 
Goering at Nuremberg and asking, Did you really slaughter six million 
Jews?
<P>
There is no effective way absolutely to teach people what manners are 
appropriate in what situations. I mean, there are several hundred 
thousand wives, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters 
who lost their husband, offspring, sibling, father in Vietnam. And 
they are justly solaced by their conviction that the fight was made in 
pursuit of a most honorable cause, i.e., to spare the people of South 
Vietnam the miseries of living under such as General Giap and Ho Chi 
Minh, while continuing to maintain the animating strategic policy of 
the Cold War. We lost the battle in Vietnam, but won the war -- 
finally -- not least because the enemy had at least a temporary 
experience of American resolution in Southeast Asia.

<html><title>Buckley:  The Hot Plotters</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 28</i>
<hr>
<h2>The Hot Plotters</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
The search for a greater choice of presidential candidates can't reach 
more desperate lengths than the situation reported over the weekend, 
namely that a Hot Plot has been hatching by means of telephone 
conference calls. Of the seven players who participated in these 
calls, reported to have lasted two hours each, three are relatively 
unknown, the others being Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas, and 
Lowell Weicker.
<P>
Time magazine reports that in their last telephone conference, it 
couldn't be settled which of the plotters should enter his name in the 
formal contest. About Senator Bradley there is this problem, namely 
that he would put his audience to sleep if he recited King Harry's 
speech to his soldiers at Agincourt. Mr. Bradley was recently in 
California testing the waters. He found them uniformly cold, if that 
is the right word for waters that react not at all to the finger stuck 
in them seeking Delphic encouragement. 
<P>
Gary Hart, of course, has troubles that date back to his hubristic 
outing on the yacht Monkey Business, the design of which caper has to 
have been to prove that the American voters don't care any more about 
adultery than they are supposed to care about abortion. To be sure, 
Senator Hart, unlike most of the others on the party line last Sunday, 
is a charismatic political campaigner. But when the opportunity came 
up earlier in the year to run for the Senate from his home state, 
Colorado, he decided to pass it up. If you can't count on your home 
state for senator, it doesn't make much sense to go for 26 states.
<P>
Paul Tsongas is an attractive former senator who fired off a Roman 
candle or two during the Democratic primaries in 1992 by calling for a 
reduced federal deficit. He ran into the usual problem, which is that 
most voters are a) in favor of a balanced budget, and b) in favor of 
everything that causes the budget to be unbalanced. In any event, Mr. 
Tsongas has medical problems which are said to have caused him to rule 
himself out as the candidate of the Hot Plotters.
<P>
Lowell Weicker did succeed when he ran as an independent for governor 
of Connecticut, soon after his defeat for re-election as senator at 
the hands of Joseph Lieberman. Governor Weicker's reign calls to mind 
the blurb written by Evelyn Waugh for his friend Nancy Mitford's 
novel. "In 1945," Mr. Waugh wrote, "Miss Mitford voted the socialist 
ticket. Having done her best to make England uninhabitable, she went 
to France to live." It was Mr. Weicker who instituted the income tax 
in Connecticut, which has served no purpose other than to make the 
state less genial than it once was to middle-class residents and to 
corporations, many of which have fled. There is this additional 
problem, which is that Mr. Weicker is the most obnoxious moralist 
since Savonarola, suggesting that any deviation from whatever was his 
most recent political epiphany marks the dissenter as a cretin. 
<P>
So where do we go from here? As regards Bradley - Hart - Tsongas - 
Weicker, the answer is: absolutely nowhere. What their putative 
coalition is meant to say is that there is (their word) a "huge" 
hunger for the kind of politics they represent. How does one reduce 
this agenda into idiomatic political language? Well, the easiest way 
to put it is that they are anti-Newt.
<P>
The Speaker has been having a rough time of it in recent days, and 
some of it is his fault. It isn't a fault you'd score against a 
philosopher, who happily comes up with reticulate bearings to help to 
understand any phenomenon. Years ago, wondering about some political 
quandary, I asked a distinguished historian to trace the cause of the 
problem and he replied unhesitantly, "William of Occam." He meant by 
this the introduction of relativist thought engendered by the denial 
of universals in the fourteenth century.
<P>
Okay, but of course Mr. Gingrich is supposed to speak in an idiomatic 
mode, and when someone calls to his attention a quite awful specimen 
of human depravity, it is not wise, let alone prudent, for him to cite 
federal welfare as the progenitive cause, even if, in a seminar, a 
professor might persuasively track depravity back to welfare, back to 
original sin. But of course the trouble with an etiological search so 
comprehensively concerned to identify the prime cause of human 
misbehavior is that it could finger Newt Gingrich as suffering from 
the sin of intellectual pride.
<P>
But the surviving point has got to be that the courage and the stamina 
of the Speaker have given the voters a vision of something truly 
distinctive from such an awful stew as one gets from the Hot Plotters, 
who don't even have an interesting idiosyncrasy to call attention to 
them.

<hr>
<h2>Have You Ever Had Terminal Blah Time?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
We confront, from our pillars of light, every problem that plagues or 
threatens to plague mankind, of every variety. Columnists have written 
on how best to avoid a war or how best to become involved in a war or 
how best to make a Floating Island. With less than a few keystrokes, 
the opinion makers can redesign the Cathedral of Chartres, advising 
where all the mistakes were made, and how they might be avoided. 
Scientific contentions having to do with the best mineral for 
preserving human teeth can become causes celcbres and contestants will 
stand their ground with all their weapons oiled, well poised to 
discredit a silly argument from the other side. But what happens when 
you are sick? 
<P>
A bizarre question, because incapacitating illnesses don't . . . seem 
to happen. We are all familiar with the law that the charismatic 
leader must appear to be immune to the abrasions that hinder mere men 
and women. Sensing this, though the idea was not yet explicated, FDR 
took pains to disguise his infirmity. Fidel Castro, we learned soon 
after his ascendancy in Cuba, simply cancelled all public engagements 
when feeling ill. In such a society as he rules over, it is easier to 
do this than it would be, say, in America, where arbitrary action is 
accepted only when caused by nature. You can cancel a game in the 
World Series because a hurricane got in the way, but not because Joe 
DiMaggio didn't feel well. In 1985 in Washington the weather was so 
cold that the whole inaugural parade was put off. That meant the 
President could not take his oath of office in the usual place, so he 
took it instead in the rotunda of the House of Representatives. And 
everyone knew that it was actually a re-enactment, because the 
constitutional date for taking the office had come the day before, but 
they don't like doing these things on a Sunday.
<P>
But what if one were really sick? A gentleman sent down two weeks ago 
for execution pleaded a postponement on the grounds that he was 
suffering from a terrible head cold and could not take in his own 
execution and that surely this was one of the designs of death-
sentence architects. Suppose that the Queen of England were to be 
crowned on Tuesday and that morning she announced to the Court that 
she simply was not up to it, that sitting up there on the throne for 
two or three hours would constitute a torture she'd find unbearable. 
What then?
<P>
What if she faced the same hideous plight as the columnist stricken 
with some combination of cold, sinus, nose-clog, throat-tightening 
even after two days of antibiotics, when time comes for him to produce 
. . . a column? 
<P>
There are ways to go that dramatize your immobility. Wanda Landowska 
slightly messed up one fugue from a sonata and then closed her 
harpsichord, permanently. Toscanini reacted similarly to a lapse of 
memory. Franz Liszt decided he would no longer perform before large 
audiences and ostentatiously pulled down the piano cover after he was 
through. The statesman of high office is less prone to apocalyptic 
departures from public life, though Charles de Gaulle did that 
exactly. 
<P>
What irks the quotidian analyst is the triviality of the challenge. I 
am not John McCain, whom one would have understood if he had ended any 
attempt at communication after five years in the Vietnamese prison 
camps. It is just, in the great scheme of things, one spark plug that 
won't ignite, not even after submitting it to the one-hundredth 
homeopathic distraction. 
<P>
So that, burrow as you might in these lines in search of an apercu 
worth pocketing, forgive me; my cupboard is bare. <p>

<html><title>Buckley:  Who Is to Blame?  -- 12/19/95</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<center>
<i>NEW YORK, DECEMBER 19</i>
<hr>
<h2>Who Is to Blame?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
On the program 60 Minutes, a half-dozen retiring legislators submitted 
to friendly interrogation inquiring into the reason for their decision 
to give it all up, go home. Most of their complaints we are familiar 
with. Unquestionably the most searing is the business about money: 
Senator Alan Simpson reported that a senator has to raise a minimum of 
$10,000 every week, which is a heavy load. When you consider 10 thou 
times 52 times 6 that adds up to over $3 million -- which is only one-
third of what retiring Senator Paul Simon had to spend to get back 
into the Senate. 
<P>
Is that situation inherently corrupt? Not a bad question. One senator 
put it this way. He gets back to his hotel at 10 P.M. after a hard day 
of electioneering and he has twenty telephone messages, all of them 
from strangers. But one name he does recognize, because that goodbody 
had donated $1,000 to the senator's campaign. The senator has the 
energy left, at that time of night -- after such a day -- to make one 
phone call, so whom does he call? Right. And even if it happened that 
the caller's message was, Please vote in favor of Measure X, and the 
senator goes out and votes against Measure X, it still remains that 
the only person who got through to him was a Measure X enthusiast, and 
enthusiasms have a way of communicating themselves, not least when 
fueled with thousand-dollar bills. Is there a way to stop all that? 
No, not under our system. It could be changed only by going to a 
parliamentary system on the British model.
<P>
But a less conventional complaint of some of the retiring gentlemen 
had to do with the under-celebrated art of compromise. People just 
don't understand, one man put it, that politics is -- you guessed it, 
the art of compromise. The gentlemen being interviewed were too polite 
to say it in exactly as many words, but what they were criticizing was 
the Gingrich House. To use bald figures, one had the impression that 
if Gingrich would simply give up on tax reform, he'd get substantially 
what he wanted in the way of tax reform. 
<P>
And of course compromise is the civilized approach to most 
controversies, but the operative word in that sentence is "most." And 
the entrenched mood of the congressmen who do not wish to compromise 
with Mr. Clinton is reinforced by the rhetoric used by Mr. Clinton and 
his satellites. It could be that your call to reduce medical expenses 
by $270 billion in seven years could be adulterated a little, say to 
$250 billion in eight years, that kind of thing -- do it, take a deep 
breath, and sigh resignedly over the rough nature of democratic 
compromise. 
<P>
But to engender receptivity for the compromise mode requires 
rhetorical adaptation at the other end, and this President Clinton is 
ostentatiously declining to do. He speaks instead of Republicans 
wishing to cut medical services for the aged and the indigent, using 
words appropriate to a situation in which Congress was planning to 
sequester a million people every year in a huge federal compound and 
let them die there of starvation and exposure. Slowly. 
<P>
Even the most dogged defenders of state welfarism here and there break 
under the strain. The New Republic's editorialist, remarking on the 
success Mr. Clinton is having with his phony scare tactics, lays the 
final blame on the voting public. "The only people being fundamentally 
irresponsible in the recent -- and continuing -- budget battle are the 
American people. They are, to borrow a phrase from our colleague 
Michael Kinsley, big babies. A year ago, in a realigning election, 
voters ushered in a Republican Congress that had pledged, in complete 
candor, to balance the federal budget. In the days before that 
election, voters backed Republicans over Democrats by a 2.8 per cent 
margin. Then the Republicans made a fatal error: they tried to deliver 
on their promise. The result is that in the last few months, the party 
positions have been completely reversed. The Democrats now lead by 2.4 
per cent." 
<P>
But then whom do you blame for the people's immaturity? The 
editorialist suggests it is the people themselves who are to blame, 
for wanting one thing and authorizing another. "Speaker Gingrich, for 
all his failings, is the first American politician actually to 
confront the public with the reality. For that, he gets an approval 
rating of 27 per cent." Any effort to bail out the American people for 
this act of irresponsibility would have to reason to the people's 
ignorance for believing what their President has been telling them, 
six times a day, for the past six weeks. If the voters believe Clinton 
is correct -- that passage of the Contract with America will result in 
agony and death for uncounted hundreds of thousands of Americans -- 
then they are right to say no to Mr. Gingrich. 
<P>
And the problem becomes: What to do about demagogues in the White 
House? Vote them out of office? Yes, but what will inform the voters 
that that is the thing to do?<p>

<hr>
<h2>The Inside War</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>

The sequence is roughly as follows:
<P>
1. Senator Dole makes a statement: He will not, in 1996, urge the GOP 
to endorse a constitutional amendment that would ban the practice of 
abortion. 
<P>
Buzz . . . Why is Bob doing this? He needs the right wing of his party 
to get nominated . . . No, stupid, he is thinking about the election 
now. He has already won the nomination. He is following Nixon's rule: 
Woo the Right in order to be nominated, the Left in order to be 
elected. 
<P>
2. Ralph Reed, the Executive Director of the Christian Coalition, 
fires immediately. "Senator Dole's remarks not only represent an 
uncharacteristic departure from his previous record, but a stunning 
reversal from the winning Reagan position that has sustained the 
Republican Party for 15 years and helped make it a majority party. Not 
a single pro-life incumbent of either political party lost in 1994 and 
1995. Senator Dole is also the only leading candidate who has declined 
to sign a pledge that he supports the pro-life plank in the Republican 
Party platform." 
<P>
The sentence of the court was duly executed: "The Christian Coalition 
will distribute 22 million voter guides in the presidential primaries 
next winter and spring. Those voter guides will accurately reflect 
Senator Dole's and other candidates' positions on this issue." The 
next day, the Dole campaign "clarified" its candidate's remarks.
<P>
3. Noemie Emery ("a freelance writer living in New York") writes a 
lead article for The Weekly Standard. Early in its career, The 
Standard published an eloquent editorial affirming the pro-life 
position. Miss Emery says in effect, Look. Though we rightly consider 
the fetus a human being, it is something less than that exactly, and 
under the circumstances different moral perspectives are 
understandably brought to bear on the question, and the GOP should 
drop its categorical position and settle, instead, for progressive 
restrictions, leading in the right direction. 
<P>
Irving Kristol, a few days later, in an eloquent article in the Wall 
Street Journal berating the excesses of modern secularists, then asks, 
What are the mistakes of the other side? There are several. "Whatever 
one's views on abortion, it is clear that public opinion, today and 
for the foreseeable future, will not accept its criminalization." He 
upbraids his fellow conservatives: "By permitting their passions to 
dominate the issue, by converting their commitment to a 'right to 
life' crusade rather than to policy, they have made the best the enemy 
of the good -- a common error of zealotry in politics."
<P>
4. NATIONAL REVIEW sees in the Emery article a "part of a continuing 
effort to revise the Republican platform. Last year conservatives 
William Kristol and George Weigel suggested in NATIONAL REVIEW that 
pro-lifers focus on more readily achievable objectives such as 
parental-consent laws or bans on third-trimester abortions. Pro-lifers 
could debate the prudence of this position within the context of 
shared objectives: a reduction in the number of abortions and legal 
recognition of the practice's injustice." 
<P>
But the editors make two points, one of them transcendent in 
character: "Miss Emery and Mr. Bennett would reach a different 
judgment on abortion, and the reason is plain to everyone but them: 
they evidently do not regard abortion as 'wrong' in the same sense 
that infanticide is wrong." And a most telling empirical political 
point: If the strategic design of the pro-lifers is to win the fight 
with progressive tactical strikes, they are entitled to ask, "Where is 
a comparable modesty or prudence on the other side? Where is the 
willingness, on the part of Senators Kennedy and Specter, to accept 
restraints even on a handful of abortions, such as the grisly 'partial 
birth' abortions? The fact of the matter is that Noemie Emery and 
William Bennett have no audience on the pro-choice side. The pro-
choicers will not concede even the slightest restriction on abortion, 
because any restriction implies its wrongness." 
<P>
Kremlinologists can divert themselves by reflecting that William 
Kristol was a trustee of NATIONAL REVIEW until he became the 
(founding) editor of The Standard, that he is the son of Irving 
Kristol, that William Bennett was for several years a Senior Editor of 
NATIONAL REVIEW, that Bennett -- and Kennedy! -- are both Catholics, 
that George Weigel is a theologically trained Catholic, that Ralph 
Reed and Bob Dole are Protestants, the Kristols Jewish: and, of 
course, all of them Republicans. Just one more example of hegemonic 
conservative thought.<p>

<h2>Black Racism Goes Largely Unchallenged </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 



 
"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color 
line," W.E.B. Du Bois predicted in 1900. Unfortunately, his words 
still ring true in 1996 but with a bitter irony. In 1900 blacks stood 
on one side of the color line as victims of racism. Today, increasing 
numbers of blacks have crossed over the line to become perpetrators of 
racism as well. And while we have become far more courageous in 
condemning and punishing racism when it is practiced by whites, black 
racism goes largely unchallenged. Witness the reactions to two 
murderous attacks by racists last month.
<p>
In the first incident, two white soldiers are accused of viciously 
murdering a black couple in Fayetteville, N.C., because the men hated 
blacks. The murder was front-page news across the country and led the 
evening network broadcasts. The Army, concerned the suspects might be 
part of an organized network of white supremacists, launched a full-
scale investigation to weed out any racist fringe groups.
<p>
The second incident took place just one day after the racially 
motivated murder of the black couple in North Carolina. A black man 
entered a white-owned store in Harlem, warning blacks to leave, before 
he opened fire on the mostly Hispanic and white employees and 
customers and then set the store ablaze. When the conflagration ended, 
eight people, including the gunman, were dead. The story generated 
only moderate news attention outside New York and little national 
soul-searching about the causes or prevalence of black racism. Only a 
small handful of national columnists deemed the racial aspects of the 
homicidal rampage worthy of specific condemnation, and most of these 
were black journalists.
<p>
If the Harlem murders were an isolated event, the reluctance of so 
many white opinion leaders to confront black racism might be 
understandable. But black-on-white hate crimes have increased 
dramatically. In one study by Klanwatch, a liberal civil rights group 
that monitors racist incidents, nearly half the racially motivated 
murders over three years were committed by blacks, who are only 12% of 
the population.
<p>
Media reticence to condemn black racism reflects an insidious double 
standard. White racism is rightly viewed as a moral failing of the 
individual and as a threat to both the peace and justice of society. 
But many in the media seem reluctant to gauge black racism in the same 
way.
<p>
For weeks before the attack on the white-owned Harlem store, 
demonstrators marched in front of the building, shouting racist and 
anti-Semitic remarks. According to the testimony of the Jewish store 
owner, who sought a restraining order against the demonstrators prior 
to the murders, protesters "made motions of striking a match and 
throwing it on the outside clothing displays or into the doorway of 
the store." Days before the actual arson, he warned prophetically: "At 
some point real matches will be thrown at me and my store. This is not 
an idle fear on my part."<p>     But in the heart of the media capital of 
the world - New York City - this story of vicious hate-mongering went 
unreported until after the fire. Is it imaginable that a similar story 
of white protesters making such threatening gestures outside a black-
owned establishment would be ignored by the media?
<p>
In some circles, blacks are presumed incapable of racism because they 
lack power. But racism is about hate, not power. It takes hate, not 
power, to shoot an innocent couple on a deserted street or set fire to 
a store full of frightened people.
<p>
And it takes considerable cowardice not to recognize hate comes in all 
colors.

<h2>'Dynamic' Newest Banned Word</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 

Bethesda, Md. - Warning: Radical feminists have added a new word to 
their lexicon of forbidden terms. "Dynamic" now joins "seminal," 
"mankind" and "hysterical" among other "sexist" expressions that 
feminists want to expunge from our vocabularies.
<P>
This most recent skirmish in the feminist language war erupted at 
Chico State University in California, where the philosophy department 
recently advertised for "a dynamic classroom teacher and program 
builder" to teach the "philosophy of feminism." The ad drew fire from 
a feminist English professor and the university's affirmative action 
director, who charged that the word "dynamic" described a "kinetic, 
dramatic style" most often associated with white males. University 
administrators, not wanting to offend, rewrote the ad, substituting 
"excellent" for "dynamic," but the controversy didn't end there. The 
local newspaper put the story on Page One, and even the usually 
liberal San Francisco Chronicle editorialized against adding "dynamic" 
to "the growing list of socially unacceptable words."
<P>
The whole episode might be amusing if it weren't part of a serious - 
and successful - propaganda campaign to change not only the way we 
talk but also the way we thingk. As George Orwell noted 50 years ago 
in his famous essay "Politics and the English Language". "If thought 
corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought." And corrupting 
thought is what radical feminism is all about.
<P>
Feminists fully understand their mission. "The political implications 
of language have made linguistic study imperative for feminists," 
intones the Women's Study Encyclopedia in an essay on "Feminism and 
Semiological Theory." For those uninitiated in contemporary academic 
jargon, semiotics is a theory of language that asserts that words are 
symbols representing not only the things they describe but, more 
importantly, the values of the dominant class within a culture. If you 
wnat to change the values of a culture, you must change its language. 
And feminists have been trying to change ours for a generation.
<P>
We've all but abandoned sex-specific terms in public usage. Firemen 
and policemen have disappeared, even though they account for 98% of 
fire department personnel and 84% of those in police departments. Miss 
and Mrs. have given way to the nondescript and dissonant Ms. Official 
Washington has banished its chairmen and spokesmen. And most editors 
would rather break grammar rules than offend feminists, substituting 
"they" for the generic "he" when a third person singular pronoun is 
required. (One copy editor actually suggested that I use the pronoun 
"it" when referring to a non-specific child.) Even "mother" and 
"father" are becomng endangered terms, replaced by the less 
descriptive "parent."
<P>
Sex itself is being quickly supplanted by "gender" - which in 
feministspeak refers to an arbitrary social construct. As the Women's 
Study Encyclopedia puts it: "To many, gender continues to be read as 
synonymous with sex." But not to radical feminists, for whom "the 
relation between sex and gender has becmoe the central question for 
contemporary feminist theory as a whole." The idea is to abolish 
differences between men and wom,en, even those rooted in nature. And 
the first step is to break down distinctions in language - to 
"deconstruct" language, in another favorite phrase from the jargon of 
the academic left.
<P>
Author and philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, whose book 
"Who Stole Feminism?" is a biting critique of radical feminists on 
campus, makes the distinction between what she calls "gender 
feminists" and "equity feminists." The former see themselves as 
victims of a culture totally dominated by men, and their objective is 
to transform that culture, using language as a tool to reconstruct 
society in their image.
<P>
"Equity feminists," on the other hand, simply want women to have equal 
legal rights with men and the same opportunities as men to make the 
most of their own individual talents. Unfortunately, the gender 
feminists have the upper hand in universities across the country, and 
their influence spills over into the broader culture day by day.

The attempt to neuter language, or to put certain words off limits 
because they ostensibly represent masculine traits, is an exercise in 
thought control. Totalitarianism didn't disappear with the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. It's alive and well on many American college 
campuses today.

<h2>Hillary Furor: Greed, Not Deception, At Issue</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> Linda  Chavez



 
 
The entire Washington press corps and scores of politicians 
seem obsessed the last few weeks with finding out whether Hillary 
Clinton is telling the truth. But deception isn't the heart of 
the scandals and controversies swirling around the first lady - 
greed is. The Clintons' greed, as well as that of their friends, 
is the root of the problems afflicting the first couple, from 
Whitewater, to Hillary's dubious commodity trades, to the firing 
of White House travel office personnel. This an old-fashioned 
story about graft and corruption - the kind that has been the 
undoing of many a politician. 
 <P>
The trouble began in 1978, when Bill Clinton was the poorly 
paid, young attorney general of Arkansas and Hillary was not yet 
the $ 125-an-hour partner in the successful Rose Law Firm. James 
McDougal, an Arkansas businessman with more chutzpah than 
scruples, approached the couple with an offer they couldn't 
refuse: Become business partners in a potentially lucrative land 
deal, and he'd make them rich. 
 <P>
The Clintons had no real money to invest - they didn't even 
own a home - but that didn't matter. McDougal was willing to give 
them a 50% share of 230 acres on the White River, to be purchased 
entirely with borrowed money from a bank willing to accept the 
partners' signatures as collateral for a $ 203,000 loan. (Try 
that with your local bank the next time you see property you'd 
like to own but can't afford.) 
 <P>
Although both Bill and Hillary graduated with honors from Yale 
Law School, they seem not to have questioned the legality, much 
less propriety, of accepting something for nothing. Nor did the 
Clintons trouble themselves about ethics as the land deal went 
sour, requiring more shady borrowing, and their business partner 
McDougal became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal that 
cost taxpayers billions. 
 <P>
Although Whitewater itself never produced the profits McDougal 
promised, it gave the Clintons some hefty tax write-offs as their 
incomes increased with Hillary's growing law practice. And 
McDougal even threw Hillary some legal business as well, a 
$2,000-per-month retainer he says the then-governor personally 
solicited (though Bill Clinton denies it). 
 <P>
And while Whitewater didn't become a cash cow, Hillary made a 
bundle in another bovine adventure: the cattle futures commodity 
market. The Clintons reaped a $ 100,000 profit on a $ 1,000 
investment, again with help from an Arkansas businessman, James 
Blair. As general counsel of Tyson's Foods, one of Arkansas' 
biggest employers and an industry regulated by the state, Blair 
did plenty of business with the state while he was fattening the 
Clintons' bank account. Neither the governor nor his 
attorney-wife questioned the lawfulness of letting Blair place 
trades on Hillary's behalf or pocketing the proceeds. 
 <P>
Even Travelgate boils down to greed - on the part of Clinton 
chums, if not the president and his wife. Although most of the 
attention has focused on whether Hillary Clinton ordered the 
firing of the White House travel office staff, there's much more 
to the story. An article by Byron York in the Jan. 22 issue of 
The Weekly Standard documents the attempt by a Clinton friend and 
his business associate to take over all of the federal 
government's non-military aircraft business, not just the 
chartered press travel run out of the White House. Had the flap 
not developed when the White House firings took place, this plan 
would have gone forward, netting millions of dollars in profits 
to Clinton's friends. 
 <P>
The Clintons may have railed against the Republicans' "decade 
of greed," but all the while they were trying to line their own - 
and their friends' - pockets.

<h2>Children Do Suffer Most From a Divorce </h2> 
<P> <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>
<br><p> 


As unusual as Michael Jackson's marriage to Lisa Marie Presley seemed 
in 1994, their impending divorce, announced last week, is all too 
commonplace. The superstar duo have become just one more statistic 
among the 1.2 million American couples who divorce each year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With no little Jacksons to suffer the consequence of their breakup and 
a prenuptual agreement to protect each party's property, the couple's 
split is hardly cause for any public concern.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the approximately 700,000 
marriages involving children that dissolve every year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These divorces are more than personal tragedies. They are a social 
problem with significant societal costs.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than one in two marriages in the United States now end in divorce 
- the highest rate in the world. And a majority of these divorces - 
about 60% - are among couples with children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For years while the divorce rate was skyrocketing, social scientists 
argued that children were largely unaffected by divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many even argued that children were better off being raised by a 
single parent than they were watching parents quarrel or remain in a 
loveless marriage.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But evidence to the contrary has mounted over the past two decades. 
Now there is little doubt - based on overwhelming research results - 
that, on average, children of divorce are worse off than those who 
grow up in intact families.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Children of divorce are more likely to be truant, to do poorly in 
school and to get in trouble with the law than children who grow up 
with both parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "California Children of Divorce Study," one of the most 
comprehensive of its kind to date, found that more than a third of 
children from divorced families experienced moderate or severe 
depression even five years after divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among adolescent women in the study, "almost all confronted issues of 
love, commitment, and marriage with anxiety, sometimes with very great 
concern about betrayal, abandonment, and not being loved," according 
to Judith Wallerstein, who analyzed the results of the study in her 
book Second Chances: Men, Women, and Children a Decade After Divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of these young women, she reports, resorted to short-term sexual 
relationships in response to their fears and anxieties.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barring physical or severe mental abuse, it is nearly always better 
for children in a family if their parents stay together.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until relatively recently, parents understood this and considered it 
an obligation on their part to remain together - at least until their 
children were grown.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1960, 91% of children lived with two parents. No more. A whole 
ethos of self-fulfillment and personal happiness has replaced the 
ethic of self-sacrifice and concern for the best interests of one's 
children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too many divorcing parents put their own desires and needs ahead of 
their children's and then rationalize their actions by claiming their 
children will be better off if their parents are happy.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For once it would be refreshing if those who do selfish things would 
simply own up to their behavior.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marriage is never an easy proposition. I have never known a successful 
marriage that did not, at some point, experience severe stress that 
could tear the marriage apart if the parties allowed it.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference between couples who remain married and those who 
divorce is not more love or fewer difficulties, but greater 
commitment.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who stay married often face identical problems with those who 
split up, but the former ride out the difficulties.

In many countries, divorce laws encourage couples in this process by 
placing lengthy waiting periods before a marriage can be dissolved 
unless special grounds exist, such as adultery or abuse.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most nations in western Europe, including most of the socially liberal 
countries in Scandinavia, require a minimum of a one-year wait before 
uncontested divorces are granted.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A number of states are considering stricter divorce legislation this 
year, including Iowa and Michigan.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After years of ignoring the devastating impact divorce has on 
children, it's time public policy took account of what's good for 
children, not just what's convenient for their parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divorce still hitting a million kids every year Divorces affect fewer 
children now than in 1980, but far more than in 1970:  <p>

<title>Chavez: Surprise: Punishment Actually Cuts Crime  -- 2/1/96</title>

<h2>
Surprise: Punishment Actually Cuts Crime 
</h2>
<p><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda  Chavez 
</a>

<P>  
The murder rate is dropping dramatically in cities across the country, 
but analysts disagree why. In New York, the murder rate dropped by 32% 
last year; Washington, D.C., experienced a 10% decline for the second 
year in a row. The pattern is repeating itself in cities large and 
small, and murder isn't the only serious crime that's down. Of the 
Justice Department's index of serious crimes, only larceny theft was 
up slightly (3%) in the first six months of 1995. A new study by the 
National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas suggests that putting 
more criminals behind bars at least partly explains why crime is 
finally going down - at least in Texas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, crime in Texas is now at its lowest point since 1973, and the 
murder rate is lower than at any time since 1966. Crime is falling 
most in big cities:  down 35% in Dallas and 29% in Houston between 
1991 and 1994, and the decline is  even greater for murder and motor 
vehicle theft - crimes that are almost always  reported and therefore 
most statistically reliable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The precipitous drop is no great mystery to Morgan O. Reynolds, author 
of the study and a Texas A&M professor of economics. "Punishment 
works. Incarceration works. It's that simple," he says. Reynolds 
points to a "prison-building binge"  that tripled the state's capacity 
over five years. Texas now has more prisoners  per capita than any 
state in the country. And while many liberals would rate this a 
dubious distinction, more prisoners means fewer criminals out 
terrorizing their fellow citizens. Reynolds estimates that the lower 
crime rate means 1,140  fewer Texans will be murdered this year than 
in 1991 and 450,000 fewer crimes committed against persons and 
property.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The major problem in the exploding violent crime rate in recent years 
has been the inability of law enforcement to ensure that convicted 
criminals remain behind bars for a significant length of time. Prison 
became a revolving door through which violent felons passed repeatedly 
in and out, with stays so short it sometimes seemed convicts were 
being given a respite from their life on the streets rather than 
punishment. Parole was used by many prison officials throughout the 
country as a means to reduce prison overcrowding, not because 
convicts' crimes or their behavior in prison justified early release.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Texas was no exception. In 1990, Texas prison officials approved 79% 
of all prisoners considered for parole, in large part because of a 
federal court order  to reduce crowding in state prisons (a fate 
shared by more than 40 other states). With a threefold increase in 
prison cells since then, however, Texas' parole approval rate fell to 
22% in 1994. And there is good reason to believe that longer prison 
terms reduce crime, not only by removing perpetrators temporarily from 
society but also by deterring others who are considering committing 
crimes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Reynolds notes, committing a crime is often a rational decision. 
Arrest rates are down in Texas, as in most other states, over the past 
three decades. The probability of being arrested for committing murder 
is down 21%, and down 22% for committing rape. With little chance of 
getting caught, criminals find the benefits of crime outweigh the 
costs, he says. Nonetheless, this calculus changes if the punishment 
increases dramatically - as it has in Texas. Expected prison time for 
convicted murderers is up 274% over the past three years, and up 152% 
for rape and 246% for aggravated assault.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most effective way to prevent crime is to make the 
punishment so  harsh and so certain that would-be criminals decide the 
risk isn't worth taking. Let the experts argue - Texas legislated 
those policies, and crime fell.

<h2>Author Fires Potshots While Hiding Identity
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda  Chavez </a>
<P>
 
Ever wonder why so many Americans are turned off by politics, 
politicians, journalists and nearly everything having to do with 
Washington? (Except maybe its monuments and museums?)

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maybe all the fuss generated by "Primary Colors" -- the new, 
anonymously written novel about the 1992 Clinton campaign -- provides 
a clue.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's the ultimate insider's tale about a world that few on the outside 
know or care about, and it's preoccupying a good deal of the nation's 
capital. The novel itself and the controversy it has generated are 
testaments to all that is petty, insular and creepy about political 
Washington.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using the techniques of a roman a clef (which means literally "novel 
with a key"), the story reads like a political edition of the game 
Trivial Pursuit.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story involves a young, ambitious governor of a small Southern 
state whose presidential campaign is plagued by scandals.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you don't know who Mandy Grunwald, Betsy Wright and Stanley 
Greenberg are (they're actual Clinton operatives), you'll probably get 
lost trying to decipher the book's elaborate cast of characters. Which 
seems to be the author's aim: Create cardboard-cutout characters 
immediately recognizable to Washington sophisticates but of little 
interest to the rest of the world, then hope the pundits create a 
large enough buzz to sell lots of books.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plan seems to be working. "Primary Colors" hits No. 1 this week on 
USA TODAY's best-seller list.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this might be harmless enough were it not for two insidious 
aspects of the book.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was written either by someone inside the Clinton operation or a 
reporter with access to intimate details of the campaign, and it 
contains every vicious, undubstantiated rumor ever circulated about 
Bill or Hillary Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Washington officials, pundits and the press corps are too busy trying 
to guess who wrote the novel to waste much indignation on the ethics, 
much less propriety, of the venture. But surely there is something 
wrong when either a former campaign worker or a journalist can make 
money anonymously peddling smarmy gossip about the president of the 
United States and his wife.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff loyalty is a virtue that has long since disappeared in 
Washington. Presidential aides no longer wait until their boss is out 
of office (much less dead) to write intimate tell-alls -- and 
Republican presidents fare no better than Democrates. But "Primary 
Colors" breaks new ground in the kiss-and-tell genre. By remaining 
anonymous, the author keeps his or her reputation intact -- at least 
temporarily -- while ravaging others'.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most disturbing possibility is that the book was written not by 
someone inside the campaign but by a journalist. The novel reeks of a 
strange, hybrid bias -- it exudes both admiration and contempt for the 
Clintons.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whoever wrote the book is a fan of the Clintons' politics but clearly 
not of their moral character. Journalists are entitled to their biases 
and opinions -- so long as they're stated up front. That's why 
newspapers have editorial and opinion pages. But journalists are not 
free to weave their prejudices into their reporting.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor should they be free to slander public figures through thinly 
veiled fiction while keeping their own identities secret.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I'm no fan of the Clintons, but they deserve better than this.

<title>Chavez: Self-Esteem's Dark Side Emerges -- 2/22/96</title>

<h2>
Self-Esteem's Dark Side Emerges 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>

<P>
As we squander money building students' egos, we feed crime. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We've heard it so often, none of us questions whether it's actually 
true: you've got to feel good about yourself in order to succeed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The crusade to improve self-esteem has invaded every sector of life -- 
public and private -- but nowhere more pervasively than education. 
School reformers have spent millions of dollars in the past two 
decades trying to raise the self-esteem of poor achievers. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But researchers now are questioning whether this money has been a good 
investment, since increases in self-esteem show little -- if any -- 
effect on actual achievement. And now a new study, published in the 
journal of the American Psychological Association, suggests raising 
self-esteem may actually be dangerous, especially among individuals 
whose inflated sense of self-worth does not comport with reality. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For at least a generation, it has been an axiom of U.S. education that 
children must have high self-esteem in order to perform well 
academically.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And U.S. students today measure higher than those from any other 
country on questions of self-esteem. Unfortunately, they don't do 
nearly as well on math or science or reading, lagging g far behind 
much of the industrial world in actual performance in these areas. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For critics of the self-esteem movement, such evidence suggests 
American schools have wasted a lot of money and effort that could have 
been spent more productively on basic skills and more rigorous 
academic content. But the increased emphasis on self-esteem that has 
permeated American education may be even more pernicious than most 
critics assumed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to three research psychologists who evaluated dozens of 
studies of violent behavior, high self-esteem is more often associated 
with violence than low self-esteem. The authors -- Roy F. Baumeister 
of Case Western Reserve University and Joseph M. Boden and Laura Smart 
of the University of Virginia -- acknowledge that their conclusions 
run counter to conventional wisdom that low self-esteem is the source 
of most anti-social behavior. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But their evidence for "the dark side of high self-esteem" is 
persuasive. The authors claim that "people turn aggressive when they 
receive feedback that contradicts their favorable views (of 
themselves). More to the point, it is mainly the people who refuse to 
lower their self-appraisals who become violent." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A teen who feels he hasn't received the respect he deserves -- in 
other words, he's been dissed -- is more likely to strike out than one 
who genuinely believes himself unworthy -- a sign of low self-esteem. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his co-authors cite dozens of studies of murder, rape, 
domestic abuse and even terrorism that show that violence occurs more 
often when a perpetrator with a high -- often inflated -- opinion of 
himself is challenged by someone he considers inferior. One study of 
more than 100 rapists, for example, confirms that rapists sometimes 
choose a particular victim in order "to disabuse her of her sense of 
superiority. That is, the woman gave the man the impression she 
thought she was better than he was and so he raped her as a way of 
proving her wrong." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most interesting example given of the correlation between 
high self-esteem and violent behavior involves racist violence. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nazism involved a whole ideology of racial superiority that justified 
violence against those deemed weak or inferior. Similarly, the Ku Klux 
Klan during its heyday was often most violent against two groups who 
challenged the notion of white supremacy: upwardly mobile blacks, and 
whites who helped blacks or treated them as equals. The authors note 
that one study of whites belonging to hate groups demonstrated that 
those who engaged in violent behavior actually were better educated 
and had higher career aspirations than non-violent members of such 
groups. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his colleagues suggest that efforts to raise self-
esteem actually may be making the problems of violence worse: "The 
societal pursuit of high self-esteem for everyone may literally end up 
doing considerable harm." Their conclusion should give all of us -- 
especially educators -- pause. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All those inflated teen-age egos may be contributing to an explosion 
in youth violence that has only begun.

<h2>
Castro Acts, Clinton Crumbles  
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">

</a>

<P>
President should call for full sanctions and threaten a military 
blockade and retaliatory strikes if necessary.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton faces a touch test of his foreign policy as he 
fashions a response to the downing Saturday of two U.S. civilian 
aircraft in international waters near Cuba. And, so far, he's in 
danger of flunking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Haitian or Bosnian lives were at stake over the past three years, 
Clinton didn't hesitate to threaten and ultimately to use force, 
sending thousands of troops to defend dubious U.S. interests. But the 
brutal attack on unarmed Americans (three of four fliers were U.S. 
citizens) last weekend elicited no such reolve.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best the president could muster in the hours after the attack was 
to send the Coast Guard to try to recover the bodies. And his 
announcement Monday that he would reinstate a ban on charter flights 
to Cuba doesn't go nearly far enough.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration's policy toward Cuba has been muddled from the 
beginning.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president would clearly like to normalize relations with Cuba and 
has been steadily moving in that direction since he took office. But 
Fidel Castro keeps throwing monkey wrenches in the deal. The attack on 
two U.S. planes is only the most recent - and most surprising - of his 
actions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro consistently has thumbed his nose at Clinton. In August 1994, 
Castro embarrassed the United States by allowing 30,000 Cubans to flee 
the island on rickety boats headed for the U.S. The president handled 
the crisis by detaining most of the refugees in camps outside the U.S. 
and repatriating those who would agree to return to Cuba. To do so, 
the president had to reverse the U.S. policy granting Cuban refugees 
automatic asylum that had been on the books for 30 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last fall, in the hopes of improved relations with Cuba, the 
administration lifted some restrictions on air flights and on goods 
and dollars that could be sent to the island by Americans. And, for 
the time being, money from relatives will continue to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most observers believed that the administration was moving toward 
lifting the 34-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba and would - in a 
second term - grant formal recognition to Cuba, which the United 
States has withheld for more than 35 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But Castro has rewarded the Clinton administration's overtures with 
increased belligerence.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro continues to rule Cuba with an iron fist, tolerating no open 
dissent and inflicting terrible deprivation on his own citizens in 
order to maintain a powerful military, even as the economy of the 
island crumbles. In recent weeks, he has resorted to rounding up 
dissidents and human rights activists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the past two weeks alone, Cuban state secret police have arrested, 
detained or searched the homes of 50 dissidents.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the downing of the two U.S. civilian planes will finally 
convince the president that he's headed down the wrong path.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro understands only one thing: power. Castro will escalate his 
violence if he thinks he can literally get away with murder, including 
killing Americans.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration ought to use this incident to totally revise its 
Cuba policy.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sanctions against Cuba ought to be fully reinstated and vigorously 
enforced. The president should warn Cuba in no uncertain terms that 
any repeat of the refugee blackmail Castro initiated in 1994 and 1980 
(when more than 100,000 Cuban refugees fled by boat to the U.S.) will 
be met with a military blockade. And any further military attacks on 
Americans will be dealt with in kind by retaliatory strikes by U.S. 
forces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president shouldn't expect much support from the international 
community on such a  course of action. It took hours of debate to get 
even a mild U.N. Security Council statement deploring Cuba's attack on 
the two planes. But Cuba is in America's back yard and Fidel Castro 
remains a threat, not only to his own people but also to ours. The 
next time Clinton thinks about deploying U.S. troops, maybe he should 
consider defending U.S. interests a little closer to home.

<h2>
Welfare Reform: Bill, Shame On You 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>
<p>
<i>Political ad promoting president as great reformer is just a fraud. </i>
<P>
BETHESDA, Md. -- The biggest case of welfare fraud in U.S. history is 
taking place right now -- and the perpetrator is Bill Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Harsh words? Yes, but the president and the Democratic National 
Committee deserve it for the dishonest political commercials they're 
now airing trumpeting Bill Clinton as the Great Welfare Reformer.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ads appear in 13 Midwestern and Western bellwether states where 
conservative Democrats traditionally determine presidential election 
outcomes. I saw them just last week in New Mexico, where they were 
showing several times a day.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Families destroyed. Children's dreams lost. The legacy of our present 
welfare system," intones the narrator over depressing pictures of 
poverty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The president's plan: Increase child support enforcement, reduce teen 
pregnancy. Work requirements for welfare recipients, strict time 
limits on welfare benefits. Teach values in our schools. No work, no 
welfare -- rescue children from the destructive welfare system," 
bellows the unseen narrator as the pictures change.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A worker punches a time clock, kids say the Pledge of Allegiance -- 
images of patriotism and bedrock family values flash across the 
screen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The ad ends with Clinton's last State of the Union address: "We can 
make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American 
people," he tells Congress.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the ad doesn't say is that Clinton has already vetoed two 
welfare-reform packages that would have accomplished everything the 
commercial claims the president wants.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In December, Congress passed both a comprehensive welfare bill and an 
even more ambitious welfare-reform package in the budget 
reconciliation bill. The first would have saved more than $ 58 billion 
over seven years, the second more than $ 81.5 billion during the same 
period. The president vetoed both, even though he offered no serious 
alternative himself.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the bills' provisions were tough work requirements. Adults on 
welfare would have to begin working within two years and would face a 
five-year lifetime limit on their welfare benefits.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the area of child-support enforcement, the bills created a central 
registry to track deadbeat parents nationwide and required states to 
suspend driver's licenses for those who failed to pay support.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To deter teen pregnancy, the bills allowed states to deny teen-agers 
welfare payments unless the young mothers agreed to supervised living 
arrangements.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also did some things not mentioned in the Clinton ads.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legislation proposed cutting off aid to drug users and alcoholics 
who now qualify for disability payments under the Supplemental 
Security Income program.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also proposed limiting aid available to new immigrants, a 
provision that simply puts teeth in existing immigration law, which 
requires that sponsors of immigrants bear financial responsibility for 
their charges for the first five years they live in the U.S.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans want welfare reform, and Clinton knows it. In 1992, he 
managed to hoodwink a plurality of the electorate into thinking he 
would "end welfare as we know it." Clinton's use of the welfare issue 
was calculated to win back voters the Democratic Party has been losing 
to Republicans over the last two decades. The campaign successfully 
targeted key states with high percentages of "Reagan Democrats" and 
ran ads very similar to those the DNC is pushing this year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the moment he was inaugurated, President Clinton quickly put 
welfare reform on the back burner while he attended to more pressing 
issues like gays in the military.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't until 1994 that the president even bothered to send up a 
welfare-reform package.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For Clinton now to try to regain the mantle of welfare reformer shows 
more than the usual political chutzpah. He's trying to defraud the 
American people in an election year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If the DNC's welfare-reform ad promoted a commercial product rather 
than the president of the United States, the Federal Trade Commission 
would yank it from the airwaves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the very least, the ad ought to bear the warning: Voters beware.

<h2> 
Culture Fails A Child -- and A Teacher 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html"> 
Linda Chavez 
</a> 
 
<P>   

BETHESDA, Md. -- She was a 45-year-old special education teacher, a   
wife and the mother of a 6-year-old boy. He was a troubled teen-ager   
who desperately wanted a gold Toyota Camry for his 17th birthday.   
Their paths crossed at a shopping center in Toms River, N.J., where   
the teacher drove her 1995 gold Camry to buy a sandwich on her way to   
a college exam.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That chance encounter ended both their lives. The teacher was buried   
last week. The boy sits in jail, awaiting trial for murder and   
carjacking. As tragic as this incident was, it wouldn't have attracted   
much attention were it not for one difference. The teacher, Kathleen   
Weinstein, surreptitiously recorded the last half-hour of her life,   
which she spent counseling, cajoling and pleading with the teen-ager.   
The recording led police to the boy, Michael LaSane.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unlike the 35,000 attempted or completed carjackings that take place   
each year, this one became a national story when bits of the   
transcript were printed in newspapers across the nation.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Most of the attention has focused on Weinstein, a remarkable woman   
right down to her last minutes on Earth. But it's her alleged   
assailant -- and the thousands like him -- we must begin to focus on.   
What is it that motivates a teen-ager to kill an innocent stranger?   
What can we do to prevent such horrors? Sure, we need tougher laws,   
more policemen and more prisons. But we also need to admit that   
something has gone very wrong with our culture when so many young   
people have no regard for human life and do not seem even to   
understand the difference between right and wrong.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Weinstein's alleged assailant doesn't quite fit our image of a killer.   
Yes, like 70% of young men who commit violent crimes, he comes from a   
single-parent household, and he lives in public housing, where crime   
is all too common. But his mother works in law enforcement, and his   
family is described by friends as God-fearing churchgoers. And while   
Michael had been in trouble with the police before, nothing about his   
record indicates he was capable of such cold-blooded violence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is known about Michael is that he was obsessed with owning a   
shiny new car. He talked about it incessantly to his friends,   
describing how he was saving to buy his dream. It is a fantasy that   
consumes most teen-agers, reinforced dozens of times a day by TV ads   
that equate owning a new car with success, physical attractiveness and   
even intelligence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it's not just cars; it's all manner of material things we're told   
we can't live without. The young are especially susceptible to such   
messages, particularly since so many young people have nothing -- no   
one -- countering such influences in their lives. Increasing numbers   
of fathers are missing altogether from their children's lives, and   
mothers are spending less and less time caring for their children.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One-third of American children are now born to single mothers, and   
half of all children will spend part of their childhoods without   
fathers. About 70% of mothers of young children now work outside the   
home and often are so tired when they come home there's no energy left   
over to provide the consistent discipline and moral education children   
need.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Schools no longer teach right from wrong, either. For decades,   
intellectuals have claimed there are no absolutes - everything is   
relative, governed by the circumstances.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In one young man's case, the situation was clear. He had to have a   
gold Camry. He bragged he was getting it for his birthday. In her last   
few minutes, Mrs. Weinstein couldn't teach lessons the whole culture   
had failed to teach this boy in a lifetime.

<h2> 
Hollywood Misses American Reality 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">

</a> 
 
<P>   
BETHESDA, Md. -- Sex sells. Hollywood is simply giving Americans what  
they want. That's the explanation entertainment executives and media 
critics have been giving for years to explain why sex saturates movies 
and TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But a new public opinion survey by U.S. News & World Report suggests 
they're wrong. Americans are fed up with the smutty fare the networks 
dish out. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine surveyed a random sample of 1,000 adults in March and 
reported the results in the April 15 issue. Overwhelmingly, 
respondents reported that they disapproved of what they see on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
More than 80% expressed concern about verbal references to sex, 
nudity, and premarital and extramarital sex on TV. And 75% were 
worried about portrayals of homosexual activity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And huge majorities said they believe that television portrayals of 
sex or sexual references actually affect behavior: 84% said such 
portrayals contributed to extramarital sex, 83% to casual sex, 90% to 
young people having sex, and 94% to violence against women. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Are Americans overreacting? Or is TV really raunchier these days? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine actually surveyed prime-time shows on the four major 
broadcast networks for one week. It found that half of all shows 
contained sexual acts or references to sex. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Another, more comprehensive study by media analysts Robert and Linda 
Lichter found a sex act or reference occurs once every four minutes on 
prime-time shows. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the sexual depictions are anything but responsible. Casual sex is 
the basic plot line of NBC's top-rated sitcom Friends, about a group 
of libidinous twentysomethings always on the make. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Recent episodes have depicted one-night stands, lesbian moms, 
homosexual marriage (with House Speaker Newt Gingrich's openly gay 
sister performing the ceremony) and intergenerational romance. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The latter plot involving the show's ingenue Monica (Courtny Cox) and 
Richard (played by Tom Selleck -- who ironically has been active in 
the traditional values movement) made much of Richard's quaint lack of 
sexual experience. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As a divorced man in his 40s, Richard admits he's slept with only two 
women, his wife and Monica. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While that makes him practically a freak as a TV character, it 
probably puts him in the same category as about two-thirds of men his 
age. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
According to the most comprehensive study of Americans' sexual 
behavior ever done, the National Health and Social Life Survey 
conducted in the early '90s, 67% of men Richard's age actually married 
their first sexual partner, and more than 65% of males remain faithful 
to their spouses while they are married. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But TV reflects neither reality nor viewers' preferences. What it does 
reflect is the values of its creators. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Although U.S. News didn't conduct a scientific survey of entertainment 
executives, it did mail out a questionnaire to more than 6,000 
Hollywood leaders, about 10% of whom responded. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the gap in attitudes between the TV executives and the public was 
huge. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In virtually every category, only a minority of the Hollywood elite 
who responded showed concern about actual sexual activities on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Less than one-third expressed concern about homosexual activity, 
compared with three-quarters of the public, for example, and half as 
many industry executives as the general public were upset by TV nudity 
or seminudity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Since these executives took the time to respond to the survey in the 
first place, their responses may actually overstate general Hollywood 
concerns about sex on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
After all, those who don't think there's a problem would be least 
likely to fill out the survey. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
So why not just turn off the TV set or change the channel? More and 
more Americans may be doing just that, which partially explains why 
the networks are losing audience share. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But that's not the total answer. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Hollywood isn't a society unto itself, and the values it helps create 
shape the world in which all of us live. It's hard to imagine even 
Hollywood executives wanting their own children to behave as 
promiscuously as the characters they create in prime time.

HEADLINE: Minimum wage: Bad idea GOP fears to fight 
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Republicans may as well run a white flag up the 
Capitol flagpole if the current debate over a minimum-wage hike is any 
indication of their resolve to retain congressional power this fall. 
The Republican leadership seems to have given up even trying to make 
the case against raising the minimum wage. The leaders know the 
Democrats' proposal to increase the federal minimum wage 20% over two 
years, to $ 5.15 per hour, is bad policy, but they're scared to death 
of the politics of the issue. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's why 24 moderate Republicans have already broken ranks with the 
leadership and offered their own -- higher -- minimum-wage bill. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But sacrificing policy to politics is usually a bad bargain, even in 
an election year. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's no question that raising the minimum wage is popular. Recent 
polls show that about 8 in 10 voters favor the proposed increase. Most 
people can't imagine living on the current $ 4.25 an hour minimum, 
much less supporting a family on such low wages. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And rightfully so, since so few workers actually do support themselves 
or families at minimum-wage jobs. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of the approximately 2 million workers -- out of a national workforce 
of nearly 140 million -- who earn $ 4.25 or less an hour, 53% are 
younger than 25 years of age. Most minimum-wage workers today are 
secondary earners who come from middle-class families, often students 
who work part time. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Almost as many current minimum-wage workers live in families earning 
more than $ 50,000 a year as live in poor households. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Of course, increasing the minimum by 90 cents an hour will enlarge the 
universe of minimum-wage workers, covering an additional 8 million 
workers who earn up to $ 5.15 an hour, many of whom are older and more 
likely to support families. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But it won't necessarily improve their economic opportunities. Most 
economists agree that raising the minimum wage will cost jobs; the 
only real question is how many. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has been touting a couple of studies 
that dispute decades of research in this area, most notably a study 
involving fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and California by 
Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger (who served for a 
while as Reich's chief economist). The Card/Krueger study purported to 
show that New Jersey's state minimum-wage hike to $ 5.05 per hour, one 
of the highest in the nation, did not lead to job losses. But the 
study now has been largely discounted by everyone but its authors and 
Reich. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The New Jersey findings were based on data obtained from carelessly 
worded telephone surveys and were subsequently disproved by other 
economists who examined actual payroll records in the state. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Nonetheless, most Republicans have been intimidated into silence. The 
best the leadership now hopes for is to attach the proposal to 
legislation Republicans want and Democrats don't, thereby either 
sinking the bill or exacting a price for its passage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Perhaps the most cynical political move of all, however, came from the 
24 maverick House Republicans who last week announced their own bill 
to increase the federal minimum wage to $ 5.25 an hour. Most of them 
come from high-wage states in the Northeast with tight labor markets 
where it is almost impossible to hire someone at the minimum wage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
These states have been losing jobs to lower-wage states in the South 
and West for years. 
 But if Congress increases the minimum wage nationally, these states 
won't be at such a competitive disadvantage. What these Republican 
legislators seem to be saying (if not in so many words) is that if 
their districts must lose jobs, why not share the pain? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Republicans have nothing to gain by backing a minimum-wage increase -- 
and a lot to lose. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Republicans cave on this issue, it will cost jobs -- including, 
no doubt, those of some Republican members of Congress who will have shown they lack the courage of their own convictions. 
<BR>

<h2>  
All Hail Shift From Racial Numbers Game  
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">  
Linda Chavez  
</a>  
  
<P>    
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Proponents of affirmative action and forced busing  
are complaining of an ominous shift away from support for civil  
rights. They point to recent court rulings and state and national  
efforts to bar preferences for minorities as proof the mood has turned  
ugly. A recent cover of Time even warned the country is headed "Back  
to segregation" on the eve of the 100th anniversary of Plessy vs.  
Ferguson, the Supreme Court's infamous 1896 "separate but equal"  
ruling.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
What's really going on is the repudiation of the racial numbers game  
invoked to end discrimination. Americans overwhelmingly support the  
right of minorities to attend the same schools and compete for the  
same jobs as whites. The National Opinion Research Center, which has  
been monitoring opinion on racial issues for more than 50 years,  
reports that 90% of Americans favor such rights.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
That doesn't mean they're willing to go along with schemes to bus  
schoolchildren or give hiring preferences to minorities to maintain  
some ideal "racial balance." Debates in Massachusetts and California  
illustrate the current mood.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For years, Massachusetts has been trying to enforce racial balance in  
the public schools. A 22-year-old state law declares any school with a  
minority enrollment that exceeds 50% is out of balance. Under the law,  
districts that "voluntarily" balance their schools' racial composition  
through busing or other methods receive a huge financial bonus. The  
state covers 90% of the cost of school construction for districts that  
comply, an incentive critics have called a virtual bribe.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Now, however, the state board of education is considering repealing  
the law. And the most vociferous proponent of repeal is Abigail  
Thernstrom, a soft-spoken political scientist with impeccable civil  
rights credentials.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
California, too, has been in the forefront of the racial numbers game,  
especially in higher education. A University of California medical  
school was the focus of the Supreme Court's famous 1978 Bakke  
decision, which barred outright admissions quotas by race but allowed  
schools to "take race into account" in order to promote "diversity."  
Last summer, however, the university's regents voted to prohibit any  
racial or ethnic preferences in admissions or hiring. And leading the  
charge was Ward Connerly, a black businessman who now heads the effort  
to enact a ban on all state preferences.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Neither move indicates the clock is being turned back on civil rights  
enforcement. What they do signify is an end to a fixation with racial  
balance as an end in itself. That obsession did little to improve the  
quality of education for black or white children or to improve the  
skills of minority workers.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In his book Forced Justice, David Armor points out that the gap  
between white and black educational achievement has been closing over  
the past few decades, but it has little to do with school  
desegregation. According to Armor's assessment of national data,  
"Gains for segregated black students are as large or larger than for  
desegregated blacks, and . . . blacks in disadvantaged urban  
communities gain as much as blacks in nondisadvantaged communities."  
Armor maintains that black students' achievement has much more to do  
with their parents' economic status than their classmates' color, just  
like whites.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Simply trying to balance numbers by race and ethnicity won't improve  
the quality of schools children attend or help them gain the skills  
necessary to compete later in life. But a shift away from numbers  
might actually force policymakers to deal with the true impediments to  
minority progress.

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">    
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
     
<P>       
 If Americans want big, fancy cars, they have to pay the price.     
 <p> 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Looking for someone to blame for today's high gas     
prices? Chances are the culprits aren't some oil executives in Houston     
or sheiks in Riyadh, but a lot closer to home.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Try looking in your own garage or your neighbor's. Minivans, sport     
utility vehicles and pickup trucks are fast replacing compacts as     
Americans' favorite vehicles. These bigger cars, plus higher speed     
limits, have driven down fuel efficiency and driven up demand.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
So, too, did last winter's bitter cold, which kept consumers burning     
more heating oil in their furnaces. Just last week, snow once again     
hit the Rocky Mountains and the Midwest, creating more home heating     
oil demand long past the usual season. And unless supply can keep pace     
with demand -- which is difficult in the short run for a product like     
gasoline -- the price goes up. It's as close to a fixed law of     
economics as there is.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But politicians can't very well blame their own constituents or Mother     
Nature for rising prices at the pumps, so they're playing politics --     
on both sides of the aisle. The Clinton administration announced plans     
to sell off part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This move is     
probably harmless, if ineffectual, since it will add a mere trickle     
into the consumers' supply, about 12 million barrels or less than two     
days' worth of gas for the nation's drivers.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But the administration didn't stop there. The Justice Department also     
announced it will investigate the oil companies for collusion and     
price-fixing. This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to win votes     
by peddling paranoia.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Meanwhile, the Republicans have been exploiting the gasoline pricing     
issue for their own purposes. They're using recent price hikes to     
justify repealing a tax they've been opposed to from its inception:     
the Clinton administration's 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax. Cutting     
taxes is a good thing, but no one should be under any illusion that     
repealing the gas tax will have any permanent effect on the price of     
gasoline.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
One of the biggest dangers in this political posturing is that it     
feeds the all-too-common misconception that government intervention in     
the economy can work to benefit consumers. It never happens that way.     
Even if the president or Congress could wave a magic wand and cut     
prices, government price controls lead to supply shortages. Would     
Americans really rather line up for hours at filling stations than pay     
a few cents more per gallon?     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
In fact, although prices have risen steeply recently -- 13% in three     
months -- gasoline is still a great bargain in the United States.     
Europeans and Asians pay four times as much for their gas as we do,     
which is why they drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. And the     
American Petroleum Institute says we are actually paying the lowest     
price per gallon, in constant dollars, since World War I.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But although we're paying less, we're using more gasoline than ever.     
We now live farther from work and shopping than we once did. And wives     
as well as husbands commute to work, often in separate cars from their     
spouses. All that adds up to more miles on the road.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Dr. Lee Shipper, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in     
California, estimated in The New York Times recently that U.S.     
vehicles traveled 7,900 miles per person in 1994, compared with 5,350     
in 1973. More fuel-efficient cars in recent years helped reduce the     
impact of these longer distances. But in 1994, bigger vehicles brought     
fuel efficiency down once again to 19.3 miles per gallon from a high     
of 20.2 in 1985.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Prices will probably decline somewhat in the weeks and months ahead as     
supply catches up with demand -- especially if Iraq re-enters the     
market, as it is expected to if Saddam Hussein agrees to terms imposed     
by the U=2EN. with U.S. backing.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But so long as Americans want the freedom to drive our own big, fancy     
vehicles long distances for work and play, we're going to have to pay     
the price.

<P>     
   
BETHESDA, Md. -- Has America embraced a "culture of death" as Pope   
John Paul II warned on a visit here in 1993?   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/GALLUP poll showing some 75% of Americans   
support so-called assisted suicide suggests the pope may be right.   
Most Americans who support "the right to die" -- including the   
ghoulish Dr. Jack Kevorkian, acquitted Tuesday of two counts of   
assisted suicide, and the judges in two recent appeals court cases in   
Washington and New York -- claim to be motivated by compassion. After   
all, they are only supporting people who want to end their own lives.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
But before the courts and the public get too enamored of this   
incipient movement, perhaps they ought to take a close look at what's   
happened in the Netherlands, the only Western nation that formally   
endorses the idea of physicians helping patients kill themselves.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch have nearly a quarter century of experience with physician-  
assisted suicide and euthanasia. In 1990 a Dutch government commission   
conducted a survey, which showed that euthanasia is far more widely   
practiced in the Netherlands than officials had believed and that it   
is most frequently administered without patients' consent.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
According to the report of the Dutch commission, 11,800 patients were   
euthanized in 1990 through active measures, most often by   
administering lethal drugs, and 5,941 of these were performed without   
the patient's consent. Only 400 patients opted for assisted suicide.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The commission also reported an additional 13,506 patients were denied   
"nonfutile medical treatment with intention to terminate life," a   
practice the Dutch call "euthanasia by omission" because it denies   
lifesaving treatment. And the great majority of these cases, 64%,   
involved persons who had given no prior consent to such a fate through   
a living will or other document.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Netherlands is a tiny country, with a population of only about 15   
million. To put these euthanasia figures in some perspective, a   
comparable euthanasia rate in the United States would result in nearly   
200,000 deaths from active measures and another 225,000 from   
euthanasia by omission.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Once embarked down the path of doctor-assisted suicide, that may be   
where we are headed.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch didn't start out to practice euthanasia so widely, but once   
doctors started killing patients rather than treating them, the slide   
into mass murder was relatively easy. A recent article by a Dutch   
physician, Richard Fenigsen, in the journal Issues in Law and Medicine   
explains why "Euthanasia is not just changing medicine; it is   
replacing medicine. This suppression of traditional medical thinking,   
medical working habits, and the medical way of reacting to events has   
an impact on both the emergency care and the long-term care of   
patients," he writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Fenigsen describes several case studies. In one teaching hospital,   
anesthetists stopped providing anesthesia for cardiac surgery   
involving Down's syndrome patients. In other cases, hospitals and   
doctors refused to apply simple, lifesaving measures to patients whose   
lives they determined were "unlivable."   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In one case, a physician did not administer insulin to a 6-year-old,   
mildly retarded boy who developed juvenile diabetes, thereby causing   
his death. In another, a doctor persuaded an elderly woman to stop   
taking medicine needed to treat an enlarged heart because she was   
living a "limited life" -- she depended on several medications, needed   
help cleaning her house, and could walk only a few blocks at a time.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In all, 65% of Dutch doctors believe that physicians may propose   
active euthanasia to patients who do not ask for it themselves,   
according to Dutch surveys.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
"Euthanasia has perceptibly affected the position of the individual in   
relation to society, society's very nature and purpose, the law, the   
government, the judicial system, the family, the expectations of older   
persons and the prospects of newborn infants, the practice of   
medicine, and the care of persons with disabilities," Fenigsen writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
What has happened in the Netherlands could easily happen here if we   
allow it.

<h2> 
Clinton Welfare Flip: At Least He Landed in Right Spot
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- He may not look like an Olympic gymnast, but Bill 
Clinton has proved he's a real master of the triple somersault with 
his latest move on welfare reform. The man who campaigned on the 
promise of ending welfare as we know it -- and then vetoed two 
welfare-reform bills which did just that -- has once again reversed 
himself.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On Saturday, the president announced he'll support a Wisconsin plan to 
abolish Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replace it 
with a mandatory work program.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet just months ago, the president and other administration officials 
excoriated Republicans in Congress as "radical" and "extremist" for 
proposing welfare reforms far more modest than Wisconsin's plan.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson's welfare reform, Wisconsin will 
eliminate traditional welfare and replace it with work. Women who 
apply for assistance in Wisconsin will receive job counseling and be 
expected to work in a regular job or in one subsidized by the state.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who have few skills or little work experience, the state 
will provide community-service jobs or places in "sheltered workshops" 
which will provide work activities consistent with recipients' 
abilities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These changes in state law require the administration's approval 
before they can take effect, however, which is why the president's 
endorsement is so crucial. And requiring welfare mothers to work is 
still controversial in some circles -- especially among Democrats.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Welfare-rights activists who oppose the Wisconsin reforms argue that 
children will suffer if their mothers are forced off welfare and into 
jobs unless the state provides a myriad of expensive services, 
including job training and child care.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And President Clinton cited the lack of sufficient money for training 
and child care in the congressional welfare-reform proposals when he 
vetoed them last winter.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But working mothers who have never been on welfare receive little, if 
any, help with subsidized day care for their children, much less 
government-financed employment training.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Does it really make sense to provide greater benefits to those who 
have shown less initiative and responsibility than we do to women who 
struggle to balance work and family duties?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some welfare advocates argue that mothers of young children 
shouldn't be forced to work at all. This argument might actually have 
carried some weight when most women stayed home to raise their 
children. Indeed, AFDC began in 1935 as a program to help women whose 
husbands had died or abandoned them, at a time when only about 8% of 
married women with children were in the labor force.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, 76% of married women with school-age children work, as 
do 62% of those with children under 6 years.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great irony is that a larger percentage of married than single 
moms work. Only 57% of single mothers are in the workforce, including 
only 52% of those with children under 6. For nonworking single moms, 
Uncle Sam is the main provider. And women who bear children out of 
wedlock are far more likely than divorced mothers to end up on welfare 
and to stay there for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, something has gone wrong with a system that makes it easier 
for a woman to stay home to raise her children if she doesn't marry 
the father than if she does.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least in Wisconsin that may no longer be the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It takes an election to get Bill Clinton to do the right thing. But 
for now, his latest welfare back flips have landed him in the right 
spot -- and he's likely to remain there at least for the rest of the

The trick for Republicans will be to use Clinton's Wisconsin decision

BETHESDA, Md. -- Remember when there were two political parties in the 
U.S.? One party favored big government, the other wanted to cut it. 
One party talked about social justice, the other party demanded law 
and order. One party defended the right to do your own thing, the 
other encouraged traditional values. No more. At least when it comes 
to political rhetoric, the era of liberalism is over.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's no accident that today's Democrats -- most notably Bill Clinton -
- sound a lot like staunch Republicans. The country has shifted to the 
right over the last four presidential elections and Democrats have had 
to move, too, at least rhetorically.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent Gallup poll shows Americans overwhelmingly support a 
conservative political agenda. Over 80% favor a balanced budget 
amendment, oppose racial preferences in schools and jobs, and endorse 
English as the official language. More than 70% support congressional 
term limits, sanction a constitutional amendment allowing school 
prayer and want to cut off welfare after two years unless recipients 
work. Similarly large majorities oppose legalizing homosexual 
marriages, favor school choice and want to ban partial-birth 
abortions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given these numbers, no candidate in his or her right mind would 
publicly endorse deficit spending, racial quotas, or expanding 
welfare. When it comes to driving the political agenda Republicans win 
hands down -- which is why President Clinton is spending his time 
honing a conservative image.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same man who pushed gays in the military now says he'll happily 
sign federal legislation to ban gay marriages.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who ignored welfare reform for his first two years in 
office, and then twice vetoed Republican welfare bills, now brags he's 
helped states to reform welfare on their own.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who appointed dozens of federal judges with a history of 
allowing criminals back on the streets never misses a photo 
opportunity to surround himself with police officers who put those 
criminals behind bars in the first place.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton, ersatz conservative, hopes voters will forget his deeds and 
remember only his rhetoric. So far, the polls indicate his plan is 
working=2E Bill Clinton has never been so popular.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this strategy carry him through the election? And will Clinton's 
latest tilt to the right convince Americans the Democratic Party 
represents the new conservatism? Not likely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most voters haven't even begun to concentrate on the election in the 
fall. They're too busy planning their kids' graduations and family 
vacations to focus on November.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When voters do start to focus in earnest -- probably not until the 
party conventions -- Democrats will have a hard time sustaining their 
new-found conservatism. Public employees, who make up the biggest 
block of delegates, will hardly turn the Democrat convention into a 
cut-government-spending rally.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association won't countenance discussion of 
school choice. And Jesse Jackson would never permit his party to roll 
back racial preferences.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Forget Democratic support for making English the official language. As 
for endorsing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, how 
would that make the 162 congressional Democrats who voted against it 
look?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact is, Democrats can't make good on Republican issues even when 
it's in their interest to do so. When it comes to acting, not talking, 
1996 won't be any different. Come November voters will choose 
Republican action over Democratic words.

<h2>The Coming Battle on Social Security</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
The continuing conflict over Medicare reform may be just a warm-up to 
the coming battle on Social Security.  Though few politicians want to 
talk about it, the Social Security system is anything but secure.  And 
if current demographic trends continue, those persons who are 25-50 
years-old today can forget about recouping their contributions into 
the system when they turn 65.
<P>
Social Security is one of the biggest give-away programs in the 
federal budget, yet the program remains almost universally popular and 
untouchable when it comes to budget-cutting.  Why?  Because most 
people -- both the elderly and younger workers -- have been sold a 
bill of goods.
<P>
Myth # 1. Social Security recipients are simply getting back in 
benefits what they and their employers put into the system in payroll 
taxes during their working lives.  
<p>
Actually, the average person retiring today will get back what he and 
his employers paid into the system within the first 4.5 years after 
retirement.  Since the average man will live 7.3  years after 
retirement age and the average woman 14 years, most beneficiaries will 
receive nearly 1.5 to 3 times what they contributed.
<p>
Myth # 2.  The Social Security Trust Fund operates like any other 
pension system, the money is put aside and invested to pay for future 
benefits.
<p>
Wrong.  In most private pension plans, the employer/employee 
contributions are saved and invested to provide  the actual benefits 
workers will receive from the plan.  But Social Security benefits are 
financed differently, on a pay-as-you-go system.  Benefits don't come 
from retirees' own contributions, but rather from the contributions of 
those who are still working.  
<p>
The so-called Trust Fund isn't really a separate fund at all, but a 
bookkeeping device.  And the money supposedly "in" the fund isn't 
invested but used by the government to pay for other government 
programs.  The fund supposedly "receives" long-term Treasury bonds in 
return for this "investment."  
<p>
In essence, the government borrows from itself and promises to pay it 
back at some later time.  But what that really means is that the 
government borrows from taxpayers, in this case future taxpayers, and 
most likely will pay it back by raising taxes down the line.
<p>
Myth # 3 Even if Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, the next 
generation will be willing to pay for the program that, after all, 
takes care of its own parents.
<p>
The problem is the next generation of retirees had fewer children than 
previous generations.  The current system depends on a pyramid 
financing scheme.  In order to pay for the present level of benefits, 
3 workers contribute payroll taxes to pay for 1 retiree's benefits.  
But the ratio of workers to retirees is actually shrinking slightly.  
When the baby-boomers retire, there will be only 2 workers per retiree 
available to pay taxes for the same benefits.  Something will have to 
give: either benefits will significantly drop or taxes will rise 
dramatically.
<p>
Myth # 4.  The elderly are the most vulnerable and poorest members of 
society who can least afford to have their government benefits 
trimmed.
<p>
Certainly there are many poor elderly people in the U.S.  But the 
economic condition of the elderly has actually improved dramatically 
over the last few decades, while that of children has declined at the 
same time.  There has been a large shift in wealth in recent years 
from the young and working aged to the elderly, and government 
programs have been chiefly responsible.  
<p>
Although those aged 65 or older are only 12.5% of the population, they 
receive more than one-third of all federal dollars in benefits, 
regardless of actual need.  Americans rail against welfare programs 
for poor women and their children -- especially Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children, which accounts for only about 1% of federal 
spending -- but never imagine that both Social Security and Medicare 
are really welfare programs for the elderly, including those who are 
wealthy and have no need of subsidies.
<p>
It's time Americans of all ages face up to the fact that current 
elderly programs will bankrupt America. Radically reforming Social 
Security is not only necessary, but just and fair.

<h2>As In Israel, We Need to Tone Down Rhetoric</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 


The murder of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an extreme 
Israeli nationalist should be a warning to all political groups that 
words have consequences. Since the signing of the first peace accord 
with the Palestinians in 1993, some opponents of the agreement have 
attacked Rabin in the most vicious and personal terms. Rabin was 
depicted as a traitor to his country, a murderer, even a Nazi SS 
officer.
<p>
Vilifying political opponents isn't unique to Israeli politics, nor 
are the dangers that go with such angry rhetoric. In recent months 
Democrats in Congress have called Republicans "worse than Hitler" and 
accused them of "practicing genocide with a smile." Meanwhile, 
Republicans have called Democrats "the enemy  of normal Americans," 
and the right-leaning National Rifle Association has portrayed federal 
law enforcement agents as jack-booted storm troopers.
<p>
The First Amendment gives us the right to call each other Nazis or 
enemies, but constitutional protection doesn't make it right. 
Responsible leaders have an obligation to refrain from engaging in 
such tactics and to discourage the behavior among their supporters. 
That doesn't mean we have to stifle political debate. The danger on 
any issue comes when the focus of criticism shifts from disparaging 
the policy to demonizing the policymakers. That dangerous game can 
have deadly consequences.
<p>
There seems to be a growing tendency to portray our political 
opponents not only as wrong but evil. When Democrats attack 
Republicans, they portray them as  callous and greedy, wanting to take 
food from the mouths of poor children to give money to the rich. 
Republicans engage in similar demonization, calling Democrats un-
American and immoral.
<p>
Politicians poison public debate when they turn policy differences 
into attacks on their opponents' character, ethics, patriotism and 
morality. What's more, they make legitimate compromise more difficult 
-- and public cynicism inevitable.
<p>
What will happen when the Democrats and Republicans agree on a budget 
-- as they must eventually? What will happen when the Congress reverts 
to Democratic control -- or a Republican occupies the White House? 
Will any of these events portend national disaster? Do they justify a 
revolution?
<p>
One of the saving graces of American politics has been its centrist 
nature. The ideological difference between Republicans and Democrats 
has never been as great as between the Conservative and Labor parties 
in England, not to mention as wide as the chasm that separates neo-
fascist and pro-communist groups in other European democracies.
<p>
Following Rabin's assassination, Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the 
opposition Likud Party in Israel and a critic of Rabin's peace plan, 
said the most important thing Israelis could do was to pull together 
as a nation and a people.
<p>
Americans face no crisis comparable to the Israelis' at the moment, 
but Netanyahu's advice could serve us well nonetheless. We've had our 
share of extremist individuals - on both the right and the left - who 
have engaged not only in assassinations but domestic terrorism.
<p>
Politicians in Israel, especially on the right, will be soul-searching 
to determine whether their words might have incited extremists in 
their midst to violence. We could do with some similar examination of 
conscience here at home.

<html><head><title>Chavez: Immigrants Make Gains in California
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>Immigrants Make Gains in California</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
 
Californians still have earthquakes, mudslides and fires to worry 
about, but they can breathe a little easier when it comes to another 
perennial source of anxiety: the state's 6 million immigrants.
<p>
A new study by the University of Southern California shows that the 
region's immigrants are rapidly moving into the social and economic 
mainstream despite fears they would be a huge burden.
<p>
The study, by USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning, details 
impressive gains in income, status and English proficiency among the 
largest immigrant groups, including Asians and Latinos who arrived in 
the 1970s.
<p>
Using census data from 1980 and 1990, the USC researchers found that 
Asian immigrants in Southern California who were between 25 to 34 
years old in 1980 had more than doubled their average income by 1990.
<p>
Nearly 70 percent became U.S. citizens in the same period. And more 
than half spoke English very well.
<p>
Immigrants of the same age from Europe and the Middle East made 
similar gains in income and even more spectacular gains in English 
proficiency, though only 51 percent became citizens.
<p>
Even Latino immigrants had made significant progress, improving their 
earnings by 27 percent.
<p>
Although relatively few Latinos who came to the U.S. as adults spoke 
English  very well (only 21 percent of those who were 25 to 34 in 
1980), 70 percent of those who immigrated as children were fully 
proficient in English by 1990.
<p>
But if California immigrants are doing so well, why have their fellow 
state residents turned sour on immigration?
<p>
 Nearly half of registered voters in the state - including 28 percent 
of Hispanic voters - believe there is no benefit whatsoever from 
immigration, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll.
<p>
And Californians aren't alone in their hostility to immigrants. Nearly 
two out of three Americans say immigrants are "a bad thing for this 
country" and will never assimilate.
<p>
The problem may have to do with more than simple prejudice.
<p>
With so many new immigrants coming to the United States now - about 
800,000 were admitted last year - it's difficult to measure their 
progress.
<p>
Simply comparing how all immigrants measure up on education, language, 
earnings and the like from 1980 to 1990 tells almost nothing about 
those immigrants who actually lived in the U.S. for that entire 10-
year period.
<p>
Why? Because the group measured in 1990 isn't composed of the same 
people as  the one measured in 1980.
<p>
The newer immigrants - by definition - haven't lived in the U.S. as 
long and  won't have had as much time to improve their status.
<p>
The USC researchers got around this problem by analyzing census data 
differently.
<p>
Instead of looking at all immigrants in 1980 and 1990, they broke up 
immigrants into groups based on their ethnic background, age and time 
of arrival.
<p>
The USC researchers then tracked these "cohorts" in the census of both 
1980 and 1990.
<p>
This allowed researchers to compare the same group 10 years apart.
<p>
The more accurate analysis can demonstrate what improvements similar 
groups of immigrants make in learning English, becoming citizens and 
increasing their incomes.
<p>
Too bad the USC study won't be widely read by those in or out of 
California.  It could be an important antidote to the anti-immigrant 
sentiment sweeping the country.
<p>
The USC data dispel many of the myths about immigrants: that they're 
stuck on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, that they can't or 
won't assimilate and that they'll never become Americans.
<p>
At the very least, the study should be required reading for members of 
Congress, who will soon vote on major legislation that could 
dramatically reduce immigration.

</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<hr>
<h2>The "Stern-ing" of America?</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

What does it say about the state of our popular culture that radio 
shock-jock Howard Stern can replace Colin Powell as the best-selling 
author in America?
<p>
Stern's book, Miss America, went to the top of the charts last week, 
selling more than nine copies for every one copy of the next best-
selling book on the list.
<p>
Stern's specialty is trash talk, and apparently there are thousands of 
garbage collectors out there who will pay $ 27.50 to wallow in the 
muck.
<p>
I ran into several hundred of them last week in Manhattan as they 
lined up in front of a bookstore to get autographed copies of Stern's 
rubbish. I must admit I was intrigued, even a little amused (Howard 
Stern fans can read?) - from a distance.
<p>
The taxi driver warned me when I gave him the address of my 
appointment that it was just down the street from Stern's book signing 
and traffic would be more than usually snarled. He suggested dropping 
me short of my destination since I'd have better luck walking the last 
block and a half.
<p>
The sight of police barricades on the sidewalk and a dozen or more 
blue uniforms persuaded me he was right. Besides, I was curious to see 
just who would stand in line for several hours in 30-degree weather to 
get Stern's autograph. The mostly male, youngish crowd - late teens to 
mid-30s - weren't content to wait quietly for their chance to meet 
their idol, who had promised to appear dressed in the same 
transvestite outfit that adorns the book's cover. Several shouted 
insults and obscenities at cars, pedestrians, police, anyone and 
anything in hearing distance. I suppose I shouldn't have been 
surprised, but the voices bellowing curses felt like a slap in the 
face. I can turn the dial when I hear Stern's foul mouth on the public 
airwaves. But for the few minutes I stood waiting to cross the street 
in front of Stern's fans I couldn't escape his cheap imitators.
<p>
Stern likes to fashion himself a libertarian (he ran, briefly, as the 
Libertarian Party candidate for governor of New York in 1994) pushing 
the envelope of free speech on the radio. He even manages to sneak in 
a few lines of "social commentary" in his 482-page book, striking a 
blow for morality by inveighing against Woody Allen's "low-life, 
amoral habits" and the hypocrisy of those parents who sent their 
prepubescent sons to spend the weekend with Michael Jackson, no 
questions asked.
<p>
And Stern proudly touts his 20-year marriage, describing himself as "a 
devoted husband and father." It's enough to make you wonder if his 
whole bit isn't a put-on.
<p>
But Stern is no satirist, a latter-day Jonathan Swift making "a modest 
proposal." He incites nastiness, crudity and effrontery. And his fans 
revel in outdoing their mentor. In his book, Stern describes one 
particularly vulgar protege who specializes in Stern's trademark prank 
phone calls. This social misfit delights in tormenting TV call-in show 
hosts, especially Mother Angelica, a Roman Catholic nun whose program 
appears on a religious cable station. Stern reproduces the transcript 
of two of these creepy calls in his book under the subheading "Jesus 
died for you," in bold print.
<p>
Stern has made millions with this trash. And the sales of his book 
suggest he'll make millions more. And it's not just Stern who's 
getting rich, but also the publishers and radio stations that give him 
access to his audience.
<p>
Infinity Broadcasting, which produces his radio show, has paid $ 1.7 
million in fines to the Federal Communications Commission for some of 
Stern's on-air antics, which violated FCC rules. They're not laying 
out that kind of money just because they believe in the First 
Amendment. The response to Stern needn't be censorship. Mother 
Angelica had the best answer. "You really need to examine your 
conscience," Stern quotes her saying to a Stern-inspired prank caller.
<p>
There's not much hope Stern or his fans will take Mother Angelica's 
advice. But maybe the rest of us can shame the media executives who 
give Stern a platform into examining theirs.

<h2>Murders Show Evil Can Exist Anywhere</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
  
Just last week in Illinois, Jacqueline Williams was accused of ripping 
an unborn baby from his murdered mother's womb.
<p>
Barely had the gruesome details faded from the headlines when two more 
ghastly stories appeared in which women were suspects in the horrific 
murders of their own children.
<p>
In Olathe, Kan., a 44-year-old doctor, Debora Green, was charged with 
setting fire to her own home and killing two of her three children. 
Green also is suspected of attempting to poison her estranged husband 
earlier this year, although charges have yet to be filed.
<p>
In New York, a 29-year-old woman, Awilda Lopez, was arrested for 
killing her  6-year-old daughter by hitting her in the head with a 
blunt object. Police who investigated the crime said the child bore 
numerous scars from cigarette burns and bruises over her whole body.
<p>
Who are these monster-women?
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich blamed the Illinois murders, which 
included not only the dead mother but also two of her other children, 
on the welfare state.
<p>
Welfare policy has created "a drug-addicted underclass with no sense 
of humanity, no sense of civilization and no sense of the rules of 
life," Gingrich  told a Republican governors meeting shortly after the 
bizarre murders and kidnapping were reported.
<p>
If only it were as simple as that.
<p>
Yes, welfare policy has led to growing social pathology in this 
society. Welfare rewards people for not working, frees men from the 
financial responsibility for their children and encourages women to 
remain unwed if they become pregnant.
<p>
And certainly both the Illinois and New York murders took place in an 
underclass environment.
<p>
Although not all the details are yet known in the Williams case, drugs 
probably played some role. And Awilda Lopez, who was indicted Tuesday, 
was clearly involved in drugs: Her daughter was born addicted to crack 
cocaine.
<p>
Women who commit crimes are even more likely than men to be regular 
drug users: 65% of female prison inmates compared with 62% of males 
are regular drug  users, and 36% of women vs. 31% of men were using 
drugs when they committed the  crimes for which they are incarcerated.
<p>
But the problems go far deeper than drugs, welfare and the underclass.
<p>
Dr. Green is a wealthy, well-educated woman living in small-town 
America. Susan Smith, who was convicted earlier this year of drowning 
her two sons after  claiming they'd been kidnapped, also came from a 
respected, middle-class family.
<p>
What is so horrifyingly inexplicable about the murders of the Green 
and Smith children is that they don't seem to have been committed by 
women driven crazy by drugs or poverty.
<p>
These were coldblooded, calculated murders by women who seemed to lead 
ordinary, even privileged, lives. It's the very familiarity of these 
women's experiences that makes so chilling the evil they perpetrated.
<p>
Stories of women who murder their own children have shocked and 
fascinated us for thousands of years. No figure in Greek mythology 
invokes more dread or loathing than Medea, who killed her own children 
to punish their father, Jason,  for his infidelity.
<p>
In Euripedes' play of the same name, Medea is described by Jason as a 
"hateful thing, you woman most utterly loathed by the gods and me and 
all the race of mankind."
<p>
Last year 538 children in the United States were killed by their 
parents (compared with 308 parents killed by their own children).
<p>
The Justice Department doesn't publish statistics showing how many 
mothers vs. fathers killed their children, although it is difficult to 
imagine that murders by mothers constituted more than a small fraction 
of the total. Difficult to imagine because there is no more horrible 
or unnatural crime than a mother taking the life of her own child.
<p>
Sometimes no amount of analysis or explanation or blame shifting will 
allow us to avoid looking evil straight in the face - even when it 
belongs to a mother.
<p>
What is truly frightening about these recent murders is that they 
demonstrate that evil can exist anywhere, including where it seems 
most unlikely. And it is  more difficult to root out evil than to 
change public policy.
<p>

<h2>Don't Underestimate Taxpayers' Intelligence </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

 
As budget negotiations near the crisis stage again next week, expect 
Democrats to demagogue on taxes as they have for the past three years. 
Although President Clinton was elected with a promise to enact a 
middle-class tax cut, he instead raised taxes in 1993. And now he and 
Democrats in Congress want Republicans to scale back the $ 245 billion 
tax cut included in their congressional budget package.
<P>
Democrats believe the key to a balanced budget is higher tax revenues, 
which they think government can magically control by manipulating tax 
rates. The theory is simple enough: Tax the rich at higher rates and 
the government will take in more revenues, which can then be used to 
pay for all those expensive government programs Democrats favor. The 
problem is, it never seems to work out  quite as intended.
<P>
A new study by Harvard Professors Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg 
demonstrates why.
<P>
In 1993, the Clinton tax increase raised marginal tax rates from 31% 
to 36% on incomes between $ 140,000 and $ 250,000 and to 39.6% on 
incomes above $ 250,000. Those tax increases should have produced $ 
19.3 billion in extra revenues if the affected taxpayers had not 
changed their earnings behavior. Instead, the hefty tax hikes produced 
less than half the expected extra revenues - $ 8.4 billion.
<P>
Democrats assume taxpayers are a docile lot. Raise their taxes and 
they'll willingly fork over the extra money to the IRS. In fact, 
taxpayers - rich and not so rich - usually resist government efforts 
to take more of their money by changing their behavior. The rich, in 
particular, have lots of options to avoid  paying more to the IRS, 
including cutting back on their work effort. President Reagan was fond 
of describing his response to the confiscatory marginal tax rate of 
90% that prevailed when he was an actor. He simply quit working when 
he earned enough to put him in the highest bracket. It wasn't worth 
making that next dollar if he only got to keep 10 cents.
<P>
The study shows many wealthy Americans responded to the Clinton tax 
increases the same way. They may have worked less, taken more time 
off, bought more expensive homes with higher mortgages (shielding more 
income with higher home mortgage interest deductions), or given more 
to charity (producing higher charitable tax deductions). By whatever 
means, those in the highest brackets reduced their taxable incomes by 
an estimated 7.8%.
<P>
Some wealthy taxpayers - including Hillary Rodham Clinton - also 
avoided paying the higher 1993 taxes by shifting some of their 
expected 1993 income to 1992. Ordinary workers don't have that luxury, 
but executives, lawyers and other high-income earners sometimes do. 
They can exercise stock options or take some of their future income in 
current year bonuses if they anticipate tax increases  in future 
years. Mrs. Clinton sheltered some of her earnings by taking a year-
end bonus in 1992, thus avoiding paying the higher 1993 taxes.
<P>
It seems never to occur to Democratic politicians that many wealthy 
people got that way by being smart about money. Allow them to keep 
more of what they earn and they'll earn more, in the process creating 
jobs through their investment. But tax them excessively and they will 
figure out ways to keep Uncle Sam from getting a larger share of their 
money. Even Mrs. Clinton found a  way around the 1993 tax increase, 
temporarily putting aside Democratic ideology  when it affected her 
own pocketbook. Maybe it's time Democrats stopped underestimating the 
intelligence of U.S. taxpayers.

<h2>Call it A Miracle </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Call it a miracle - or perhaps just the triumph of tolerance and 
common sense - but there seems to be far less controversy over 
religious displays on public property this holiday season than in 
recent years. Both creches and menorahs are on display - albeit with 
some restrictions - despite the hostility of the ACLU and other groups 
opposed to such exhibits. 
 <P>
In a computer database search of newspaper articles from around the 
country, I found only 59 stories appearing since Dec. 1 that even 
mentioned Nativity displays, and most of these were announcements of 
holiday celebrations and events. 
 <P>
Admittedly, the ACLU did try to silence "Silent Night" and recordings 
of other Christian hymns piped into a government building in Chicago 
this year. But a federal court decided last week that the group was 
off base (as usual) in claiming  a few carols played over a 
government-owned loudspeaker system were an "establishment of 
religion" forbidden by the First Amendment. 
 <P>
Since 1984, when the Supreme Court handed down its first decision 
involving the display of religious symbols on public property, cities 
and towns have been debating just how far they can go in allowing 
Nativity scenes, menorahs, crosses and other symbols depicting 
important religious events. The court's rules - which seem to change 
each season - now permit religious symbols as part of state-sponsored 
displays so long as secular symbols are also included. And last June, 
the court expanded its interpretation, in effect saying jurisdictions 
couldn't interfere with the right of religious groups to put up 
whatever symbols they chose if the jurisdiction gave non-religious 
groups the right to erect secular, political or other non-religious 
displays on public property. Cities and towns now have the choice of 
saying no to everyone or no one. 
 <P>
Sometimes it's hard to remember that the holidays weren't always so 
complicated. Like most Americans over 40, I can remember when religion 
was at the heart of civic celebrations during Christmas. Denver, where 
I grew up, was well known for its wonderful public and private 
Christmas displays. My father always arranged a special family outing 
for the occasion. He piled everyone into the car for an excursion that 
took us throughout the city. First, we headed downtown to 16th Street, 
where the streets and stores were decked out in ornaments and tinsel, 
then to the Civic Center, where the exhibit proclaiming "Joy to the 
World" and "Peace on Earth" lit up the December sky and filled the air 
with music. We usually ended our tour in the east Denver neighborhoods 
best known for their elaborately decorated homes, many with mangers 
and Wise Men adorning the front lawns. 
 <P>
It was on this part of the trip that I first learned about Hanukkah. 
Through some windows, I could see what appeared to be candelabra with 
only a few candles asymmetrically lit. I thought perhaps they were 
special Christmas lights, like the "luminarias" that decorated my 
native New Mexico. But my father explained to me that these were 
Jewish homes celebrating a different holiday altogether - Hanukkah. 
Later I learned that the holiday commemorates the rededication of the 
Temple in Jerusalem in 165 B.C. after the Maccabees' victory over the 
Syrians. 
 <P>
Today children in many cities can learn about the Hanukkah traditions 
in public displays. Members of the Lubavitch community of Hasidic Jews 
erect large outdoor menorahs in parks and other public places across 
the country. 
 <P>
Americans are among the most religious people in the world. The 
radical separationists - who believe the First Amendment requires that 
religion be driven from civic life - are fighting a losing battle. 
America was founded on the freedom of, not from, religion. And there 
is no better way to celebrate that freedom than to welcome all 
religions back into the public square this holiday season.

<h2>GOP Congress: '95 Something to Crow About</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Is the Republican revolution about to fizzle barely one year 
after it began? 
<P>
The Congress has produced no significant legislation. Extremists 
dominate the freshman class in the House. Republicans want to put poor 
children out on the streets and deprive elderly sick people of medical 
care in order to give tax breaks to the rich. The magnificent 
machinery of government has ground to a halt, not once but twice in as 
many months, causing chaos for millions of Americans. And the public 
has had enough. At least that's what the Clinton administration wants 
you to think - and the media has obligingly conveyed the message.
<P>
But before the Clintons order their favorite Arkansas champagne for 
the 1997 inaugural and House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt picks out 
new drapes for the Speaker's office, perhaps it's time to take a 
closer look at just what did happen in 1995.
<P>
The Congress of the United States actually produced a 3,000-page, 
detailed bill that will balance the budget in seven years.
<P>
Sure, the president vetoed it, but the feat is historic nonetheless. 
The Democrats couldn't come close to offering a balanced budget in 
their years at the helm - even when they controlled both the 
legislative and executive branches, as they did in the Clinton 
administration's first two years.
<P>
Republicans have taken on the first major entitlement programs - 
Medicare and Medicaid - putting principle before politics. For years, 
Republicans have been going after the small potatoes entitlements, 
such as AFDC and food stamps. These programs, while unpopular, make up 
only a small fraction of the federal budget, roughly 3%.
<P>
The really big money entitlements are Social Security and Medicare, 
which go mostly to the middle class, and Medicaid, which goes to the 
poor. These items account for more than one third of the entire 
federal budget.
<P>
Democrats have never been willing to even try to rein in these 
entitlements. But this year Republicans have risked their own re-
election in order to stop burying future generations in debt. For this 
Republicans - and especially the 73 House freshmen - have been labeled 
"extremists," not only by the president but by much of the media.
<P>
Republicans have permanently altered the terms of the debate on 
welfare. Even Democrats sound hardline about ending welfare dependency 
these days. No one argues for welfare rights' or defends welfare 
recipients who stay on the rolls year after year. And virtually 
everyone now agrees that the War on Poverty failed, not for lack of 
funds after more than $ 5 trillion spent in three decades, but because 
the programs themselves were misguided.
<P>
Democrats still cling to the demonstrably erroneous notion that 
expensive government training programs are necessary to get recipients 
off welfare and into jobs.      But when the president finally signs 
welfare reform legislation - as he must soon or face the consequences 
at the polls next year - it will bear a decidedly Republican stamp, 
devolving responsibility back to the states and giving states more 
leeway to limit dependency and discourage illegitimacy.
<P>
Republicans forced Congress to live by the same rules it cavalierly 
mandated for others and to stop accepting gifts and entertainment from 
lobbyists.
<P>
For years when Democrats controlled both Houses, Congress exempted 
itself from laws it insisted other employers obey: civil rights laws, 
health and safety laws, labor relations laws. In recent years, 
Republicans began drawing attention to this Democrat hypocrisy by 
offering amendments to make Congress subject to the same laws it 
applied to others - to no avail.
<P>
Republicans won their battle only when they won control of Congress. 
Suddenly even Democrats decided maybe no one should be above the law - 
not even Congress, now that they no longer controlled it.
<P>
The same thing happened with lobby reform. Democrats had no interest 
in lobby reform when they occupied the powerful committee 
chairmanships. But once they became backbenchers they were more than 
happy to jump on the Republican freshmen's lobby reform bandwagon.      
These Republicans accomplishments may not yet constitute a revolution. 
But they add up to the most significant legislative reforms in a 
decade - not bad for one year's effort.  
<P>

<title>du Pont:   Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts  -- 1/16/96
</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>



<center><i>January 16, 1996</i><hr>

<h2>
Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
"Fair is foul, and foul is fair." 
<P> 
Thus incant the three "weird sisters" usually referred to as witches - 
at the outset of Shakespeare's "MacBeth", as they set forth the 
proposition that what is good will be made bad and what is bad will be 
made good. 
 <P>
In like manner, three nationally syndicated columnists - Joan Beck, 
Molly Ivins and Jane Bryant Quinn - have recently stirred the pot, 
proclaiming a fair health care reform proposal foul and a foul one 
fair. 
 <P>
All three columnists attack the idea of Medical Savings Accounts 
(MSAs), particularly the Republican proposal to provide Medicare 
beneficiaries with an MSA option. 
 <P>
Currently, most people get their health insurance either through their 
employer, or from the federal government through Medicare and 
Medicaid.  In the past, most employers offered a health insurance 
policy with a deductible up front, and then people had to pay, say, 
20% of their medical bills up to a maximum amount. Increasingly, 
companies are moving to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or 
other types of managed care. 
 <P>
An MSA permits a third option.  A person may take the same money that 
is currently spent on that low-deductible policy or HMO and purchase a 
less-expensive, high-deductible health insurance policy, say, with a 
$3,000 deductible.  The money that is saved by purchasing that less 
expensive policy is then deposited by the employer in a Medical 
Savings Account and can be used during the year to pay smaller health 
care bills. Any unspent money in the account at the end of the year 
can be withdrawn or rolled over and grow with interest to be used for 
health care in the future. 
 <P>
In attacking MSAs, the three columnists quickly assert that fair is 
foul.  Joan Beck claims that "the idea of Medical Savings Accounts is 
largely an untried idea." 
 <P>
Not true.  Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), testifying recently before 
the House Subcommittee on Civil Service, said that there are some 
3,000 U.S. businesses that have adopted some form of MSA.  Abroad, in 
1984 the country of Singapore adopted a "Medisave" program  
as the primary means of paying for health care. Today, Singaporeans 
have access to the same technology as most European countries, with 
hospital stays equaling those of aggressive managed care firms in the 
U.S., but they are only spending 3.1% of their GDP (compared to about 
14% in the U.S.). 
 <P>
Jane Bryant Quinn thinks that only healthy and wealthy people would 
want an MSA, but   during the same congressional hearing, everyone 
testifying -- some of whom had implemented MSA plans for their own 
employees -- found that both the healthy and sick benefited 
financially from the plans.  The healthy benefited because they got to 
keep the unspent MSA balance at the end of the year, and the sick 
because they spent less money out of pocket, since their exposure was 
limited to the MSA amount.  Insurance paid 100% of the rest.  
 <P>
Molly Ivins thinks that Republican support of MSAs is the result of 
recent lobbying by special interest insurance companies looking to 
make money off selling the MSA plans.  But the MSA idea goes back to 
the mid-1980s; several think tanks and congressmen -- including those 
now in the Republican leadership -- have supported the idea for years.  
Further, most large insurance companies have opposed all MSA 
legislation for the very reason that it would encourage individuals to 
retain some of the money they had been giving to the insurance 
companies.  (As in "MacBeth", you know the world is topsy-turvy when 
Molly Ivins would rather people give their money to insurance 
companies than keep it themselves.) 
 <P>
All of the above columnists also think that foul is fair -- that MSAs 
would undermine the Medicare system.  Surely a system that is by 
everyone's count going bankrupt in seven years is already undermined.  
Medicare has been plagued with exploding costs and suffocating 
regulations for years. 
 <P>
MSAs are simply not a radical idea.  Indeed, most self-employed 
individuals who purchase a health insurance policy on their own -- and 
thus don't perceive the employer or government as providing a health 
insurance policy free -- usually choose a high-deductible policy and 
pay for smaller medical expenditures out of pocket.  All an MSA does 
is provide individuals or their employers with the opportunity -- not 
a requirement -- to put a limited amount of tax-free money in an 
account to pay those smaller medical bills. 
 <P>
Congressional Republicans are trying to fix and preserve Medicare by 
providing senior citizens with private sector options such as MSAs.  
By contrast, these columnists criticize the plan as threatening to an 
already bankrupt system.   
 <P>
Their solution is to stir the pot and chant:  "Double double toil and 
trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble."  It may be good theater, and 
even good liberal politics, but it won't help Americans get better 
health care.

<h2>Time For A New Tax System</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
The objective of the Tax Reform Commission appointed by Speaker 
Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole was, in the words of its chairman, 
Jack Kemp, "to tear apart the whole tax code...and draft...a dramatic 
reform." 
 <P>
As a member of the Commission, I believe the report we issued on 
January 17th completed this mission. 
 <P>
The tax code as it exists today is unjust and unfair. Its definitions 
are complex, its regulations often incomprehensible, and its 
enforcement ranges from lax to nasty.  It is a politicized method of 
unequally extracting income from people who have earned it and 
transferring it to people who haven't, but who the politicians in 
Congress think have a superior claim to it.  Sugar and ethanol 
producers, drug addicts who need federal dollars to support their 
habits, and pornographic arts programs come to mind. Congress simply 
uses the code to reward its friends, punish its enemies, and - of 
course - to get itself re-elected. 
 <P>
The income tax takes as much as 40% of what we earn each year, and 
half of anything left over when we die - the family farm, the small 
business we have built, or the savings we have worked so hard to 
accumulate.  Compliance takes 5.4 billion hours of our time, and if we 
disagree with the IRS, the burden of proof is on us - we are guilty 
until we prove ourselves innocent.  The IRS can search our property 
without a warrant and seize our assets without a trial. 
 <P>
One of the brutal byproducts of the tax code is stagnating incomes for 
individuals but galloping revenues for government.  Between 1973 and 
1993 annual income growth for middle class and low-income wage earners 
has remained flat.  In roughly the same period (1973-1995) government 
"take home pay" has increased 58% in real terms.  Family earnings have 
not risen, while the government's have increased 58%.  There's 
fairness for you. 
 <P>
The members of the Tax Reform Commission believe it is time to repeal 
this whole sorry mess and begin again.  A new tax system proposed by 
the Commission would be based upon three principles. 
 <P>
First, a generous personal exemption.  The Commission did not set a 
number, but for discussion  let's use $7,500 ($30,000 for a family of 
four) on which no income tax at all would be due. 
 <P>
Second, earnings above that amount would be taxed at a uniform, low 
rate, say, 19%.  (again, my hypothetical rate, not the Commission's.)  
All taxpayers would pay the same rate of tax, which is not only fair 
but presumably what the Constitution means by "equal protection of the 
laws."  The rate could only be increased by a two-thirds supermajority 
vote of each House of Congress. 
 <P>
Such a tax system would be progressive.  As the table shows, with a 
19% rate, the wealthy family of four would pay a higher percentage of 
its income in taxes than a middle-income family. 
 <P>
<pre>
	Income        	Taxable Income     Tax Due      Tax As a % of Income 
	$ 30,000           	$0               			0                   		0 
	45,000            	15,000        			2,850                 6.3% 
	60,000            	30,000        			5,700                 9.5% 
	120,000            	90,000       			17,100                14.3% 
 </pre>

<P>
The Commission's third principle is that income should be taxed only 
once.  This would make the employee's half of Social Security taxes 
deductible and eliminate the double taxation of investment income.  It 
would also eliminate death taxes and the alternative minimum tax. 
 <P>
The adoption of such a progressive, uniform tax rate system would 
cause an explosion of growth in the American economy, creating 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars of take-home pay.  The 
Hall-Rabushka flat-tax proposal was estimated to increase economic 
growth a full percentage point per year.  Although that increase may 
seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of the economy 
translates into 6 million jobs and two trillion dollars in real 
economic productivity over 8 years.  It would also increase government 
tax revenue by nearly $700 billion. 
 <P>
By discouraging investment, innovation, and the taking of risk, the 
current tax code is restraining the U.S. economy's growth rate to 
about 2.5% per year.  With a progressive flat tax, the economy could 
be growing 4%, or perhaps more, which would bring real increases in 
their quality of life to tens of millions of American families. 
 <P>
That is the goal of the Tax Reform Commission's proposal:  to increase 
jobs, growth, income, and the quality of life.  With our current tax 
code, these things are impossible.  With a progressive flat tax, they 
can be achieved.

<h2>The 1996 Election:  A Choice of Visions</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>  
 <p>

The football season and the State of the Union message are behind us.  
In another few weeks the election of 1996 will be upon us.  In these 
few days of calm before the Iowa caucus, we need to reflect upon the 
social and political transitions of our times and how they impact the 
November elections. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We live in a society that is being transformed by forces largely 
outside of our control.  We are caught in a transition from the old 
industrial, hierarchical, mass production society to the individualism 
of an Information Age. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, it is not our nation's first transition.  Historians tell 
us that there have been three American Republics.  The first stretched 
from the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 to the Civil War.  We 
might call that the Age of Federalism, a time of decentralized 
government power with a strong emphasis on individual responsibility. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Second Republic lasted until the Great Depression of the 1930s.  
It was a time of growing federal power and involvement in our lives.  
We might call it the Age of Government Expansion.  
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Third Republic was the political, governmental and social 
transformation created by the New Deal.  This one's easy to tag:  it 
was the Age of the Welfare State. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The beginning of the end of the New Deal era came with the election of 
Ronald Reagan in 1980.  But the actual end of liberalism came 14 years 
later -- after the collapse of communism as an organizing principle of 
society - when control of the U.S. House of Representatives passed 
into conservative hands. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the words of MIT professor Rudi Dornbusch:  "Statism has had its 
time on the stage.  Pervasive regulation, public-sector enterprises, a 
bloated welfare state with crushing tax burdens of those who work - 
and absurd levels of subsidies for those who don't - have failed as 
effective alternatives to decentralized decision-making...." 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the election of 1996 is not about Bob Dole or Bill Clinton, the 
elimination of the Commerce Department, or Haiti, Hooters or hand-gun 
control.  The election of 1996 is about a choice of visions to guide 
us in the Fourth Republic. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First is the choice between collective and individual decision-making.  
Will the government make decisions for you, or will you make your own 
decisions?  The resolution of this conflict will determine whether you 
or the government will invest your retirement savings, whether you or 
the  
government will decide which school your child attends, whether you or 
the government will decide which doctor you see. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare statist says it is better that government make these 
decisions for us; the advocates of liberty believe we are capable of 
making them for ourselves. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second choice is whether equality or freedom will be the core of 
our vision.  The liberal vision worries that if people are allowed to 
be free, they will become unequal, and that will be unfair.  So 
government must count outcomes by race, hue, gender, age, sexual 
preference, etc., and then enforce remedial policies to make sure that 
no group gains relative to any other. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conservative vision, by contrast, recognizes that whenever 
equality has been the driving force, freedom has been the first 
casualty.  The advocates of liberty believe the individual should be 
free to go as far as his or her efforts, talents and energy will 
allow, regardless of race, color or creed. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there is the choice of whether the state or the individual 
should be held responsible for moral conduct and the spiritual 
dimension of our lives.  The liberal vision sees the state as the 
repository of virtue and therefore responsible for morality.  When 
something goes wrong it is the fault of the state, not the individual, 
so the state must act.  Conversely, the conservative vision sees the 
individual as responsible for his or her own actions, and the sum of 
these actions sets society's moral course. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any transition the challenge for political leaders is not to stop 
it - they cannot - but to advance a vision for that transformation 
compatible with our constitutional traditions of liberty, justice, and 
limited government. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton's vision reflects the faith in government of the 
Third Republic.  His veto pen has struck down a balanced budget and a 
reform of welfare as we know it.  His top domestic priority is to 
ensure that the government is "never, ever" shut down again. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But by its very nature an accelerating flow of information is 
decentralizing, increasing individual power and choices.  It will 
transform not only our lives, but our government as well.  The 
conservative vision, anchored in the liberty established by the 
Founding Fathers in the First Republic, is the only one compatible 
with the individualism demanded by an information society. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Choosing between these competing visions for the Fourth Republic is 
what the 1996 election is all about.

<title>du Pont: The Republican Dilemma: Growth Or Green Eye Shades?

<h2>The Republican Dilemma: Growth Or Green Eye Shades?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont
</a>

<P>  
Sixteen months into the conservative revolution that swept the field 
in the 1994 elections, the liberals are winning the war. They lost the 
battle at the polls but they are winning the war in the trenches of 
the Congress and the sound bites of the evening news. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason is that the argument in Washington - and thus on the 
television - has been about the deficit and the cruel spending cuts 
the Republicans have enacted to reduce it.  When the Republicans 
propose reducing the rate of increase in spending for program A from 
9% per year to 7% (when the annual inflation rate is less than 3%), 
President Clinton brands them harsh and heartless. In due course 
people across America begin to believe it, and then such a modest 
reduction in future growth is thought to be "extreme," and "going too 
far too fast." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans shouldn't be surprised, for it comes with the territory. 
Being portrayed as mean spirited is the price to be paid for becoming 
the Green Eyeshade political party - that is, paying more attention to 
bookkeeping than to vision. When balancing the budget becomes your 
goal, and budget scoring becomes your god, you lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Once upon a time the Republicans were the party of growth.  Ronald 
Reagan ran and won on a program of 30% income tax rate cuts. It 
worked.  Eighteen million net new jobs were added to the economy, 
economic growth rates averaged nearly 4% per year after the tax rates 
kicked in, and federal tax revenues rose by 26% during President 
Reagan's two terms. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A growth policy would work again.  There is no way to reduce the 
deficit more efficiently and more painlessly than with a higher rate 
of economic growth.  And there is no way of reducing the need for 
welfare spending more rapidly and more permanently than by achieving 
higher incomes for everyone. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing 
the growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic 
growth is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases 
take home pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax 
receipts. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Such a policy should begin with enactment of the core pro-growth tax 
reduction programs of the Contract With America. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Cutting and indexing the capital gains tax would quickly stimulate 
growth by unlocking billions of dollars of assets. Expanding the use 
of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and repealing the Social 
Security benefits tax would increase growth, too.  Raising the amount 
that retirees can earn without loss of benefits would expand the 
supply of elderly workers, help employers meet their demands for 
skilled labor over the next decade and increase federal revenue. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Second, instead of pursuing deficit reduction as the primary goal of 
economic policy, Republicans should advocate a policy of aggressive 
deregulation to encourage economic growth.  Free farmers from acreage 
restrictions so they can grow more crops while phasing out subsidies, 
thus reducing spending. Deregulate communications to unleash high-tech 
growth.  Replace welfare programs with work to increase labor output 
at the lower end of the economic scale.  Allow parents to choose the 
best schools for their children to spur long range economic growth by 
improving the skills of the workforce.  Begin the transfer of 
retirement saving from the Social Security system to individually 
owned marketplace IRAs. They would grow both the retirement income of 
older Americans and the savings pool of the nation to fuel even more 
prosperity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Finally, pick up on the growth ideas of the Tax Reform Commission: 
repeal the existing tax code and replace it with a single-rate, 
progressive flat tax. The resulting  explosion of growth would create 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars in increased personal 
income.  The Hall-Rabuska flat tax proposal was estimated to increase 
economic growth a full percentage point per year. Although that 
increase may seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of 
the economy translates into six million jobs and two trillion dollars 
in real economic productivity over eight years.  It would also 
increase government tax revenue by nearly $700 billion, allowing 
Republicans spooked by the deficit to reduce it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
That is an economic program worth expending political blood and 
treasure to enact.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Let the liberals take the other side - that the tax reductions are 
growing the economy too fast, creating too many jobs, and giving 
people too much freedom and too much money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans can reply that Democratic proposals to reduce the economic 
growth rate from 4% to 3.5% are cruel and heartless. The evening news 
will be filled with shots of disappointed men and women who had been 
counting on putting a new roof on the house or their daughter through 
college. Congressional Budget Office scorers could be furloughed as 
non-essential employees.  And the deficit would go down.  And who 
knows, even the Green Eyeshade Republicans might be happy.

<title>du Pont: Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea  -- 2/8/96</title>

</i>

<h2>
Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
<i>Congress may soon make Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) the law of the 
land.  And even labor unions like the idea.   </i>
 

<P>
Medical Savings Accounts give people the opportunity to move from a 
conventional, low-deductible health insurance plan to one with a high 
deductible (say $2,000 to $3,000) and to put the premium savings in a 
medical  savings account.  Employees and their families pay all 
medical bills up to the deductible from their MSAs and out-of-pocket.  
Insurance then covers 100% of everything else. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political battle for MSAs has been long and hard, but even when 
the political battle is over, the fighting will continue.  That's 
because the real issue behind the MSA debate is who will control our 
health care dollars.  MSA supporters want individuals to control more 
of their health care dollars;  MSA opponents want someone other than 
the patient - a manager, "gatekeeper" or bureaucrat - to control those 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is becoming the ultimate in populist vs. elitist battles, and 
nowhere is that more evident than in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a 
suburb of Philadelphia. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
During 1995 contract negotiations between teachers at the Bucks County 
Technical School and officials of the Bucks County School Board, the 
issue of the high cost of health care became a topic for discussion.  
Members of the Bucks County Technical School  teachers union  had 
recently heard of Medical Savings Accounts and thought that by 
shifting to an MSA plan, both the teachers and the administration 
could benefit.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They learned that some 3,000 businesses have adopted some form of MSA 
plan.  The apparently universal experience is that MSA plans reduce 
employers' health insurance expenditures over time and permit 
employees to benefit financially by managing their health care dollars 
wisely.  A win-win situation for everyone involved. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ed Moffit, who teaches air-conditioning and refrigeration technology 
for the school and is president of the teachers' union, optimistically 
presented the idea to the Board.  After all, the money employees spend 
for health insurance ultimately belongs to the employee.  He thought 
the Board would be delighted that a union was proposing a free-market 
solution to their health care dilemma.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He was wrong. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Board's solution to restraining health care spending was to move 
the teachers out of their fee-for-service policy and into a managed 
care plan, lowering the Board's cost and pocketing the difference.  
Unwilling to let a managed care plan make choices for them, union 
members opposed the school's solution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The battle thickened.  Moffit and the union publicly asked the school 
Board to release information about the union members' health care 
costs.  Finally it did, and now pressure is building for MSAs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What the Bucks County Technical School Education Association has 
learned is what union members and employees across the country are 
learning - MSAs make sense.  For example:  
<BR> 
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994, the United Mine Workers adopted an MSA-type proposal by 
providing members with a $1,000 deductible policy and writing them a 
check for $1,000 at the beginning of the year. 
<br>
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;City employees in  Jersey City, New Jersey, get an $1,800 MSA 
contribution to a family plan and a $2,000 deductible - and the 
average MSA refund was about $1,000 at the end of the first year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Union members often have the most comprehensive health insurance plans 
in the country, often costing well above the national average of about 
$5,000 for a family plan.  As a result, union members who choose a 
less expensive catastrophic plan can have a significant amount of 
money left over to deposit in their MSA, and most would have a nice 
bonus waiting for them at the end of the year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But as the Bucks County experience makes clear, management often 
mistakenly  thinks it knows best.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For example, in recent testimony before Congress, John N. Sturdivant, 
president of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, 
which represents 700,000 federal and District of Columbia employees, 
declared that "people are willing to accept limitations on their 
choice of providers in exchange for more comprehensive benefits and 
lower out-of-pocket costs."  Translation: Mr. Sturdivant wants your 
choices limited if it will save a little money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And, he added, "Under MSAs . . .consumers would delay treatment until 
it was absolutely necessary."  Translation: You can't be trusted with 
the money because you're too stupid to make good health care decisions 
for yourself.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Condescension, whether practiced by management or union leaders, is a 
poor substitute for individual empowerment.  There is no reason to 
think that the Bucks County School Board or John Sturdivant or anyone 
else besides you and your physician should make decisions about your 
health care.  Medical Savings Accounts will give you that opportunity.

<h2>
Prospecting the Federal Government: How Buchanan Found Gold In Alaska
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>

Pat Buchanan is running hard and strong, perplexing all the pundits in 
the process.  His issues, mostly trade, immigration and abortion, 
appear to be resonating with a sizable block of voters.  But, there's 
a broader message here - Pat is tapping into a rich vein of distrust 
and disgust with the national government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Consider the first caucus he won, in what would have seemed the 
unlikely jurisdiction of Alaska.  Unlikely, that is, until we consider 
Alaska's treatment at the hands of the federal government during its 
almost four decades of statehood.  It's a treatment that makes the 
state fertile ground for a candidate seeking to harvest people's 
growing frustrations with the intrusiveness of Washington. 
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In 1958, the citizens of the Alaskan territory voted by a margin of 
more than 5 to 1 to accept Washington's offer of statehood. The 
proclamation signed by President Eisenhower on January 3, 1959 made 
Alaska our 49th state, guaranteeing it "equal footing" with the other 
48 states. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, that's not the way it turned out.  Instead, Alaskans have 
witnessed one attempt after another - some successful, some not - on 
the part of the federal government to change elements of the original 
statehood "contract." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As part of Alaska's statehood, it was agreed that the federal 
government would be entitled to 10% of any oil revenues arising from 
federal lands.  Yet, in 1964, the federal government unsuccessfully 
tried to increase its share to 75% of oil revenues from the Kenai 
Peninsula. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While it was always expected that the federal government would own and 
manage vast acreage within their state, many Alaskans no doubt felt 
shocked and betrayed in 1980, when President Carter signed the Alaska 
National Interest Lands Act.  The Act gave to the federal government 
much of the state's most valuable acreage, or acreage that blocked 
usage of valuable acreage in private and state hands. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Commonwealth North, a group of prominent Alaskans, notes the federal 
intrusiveness that arises from the large size and unfortunate (from 
Alaska's viewpoint) placement of federal land ownership within Alaska, 
noting there are actually 54 different ruling "governors" that have a 
say over land usage.  These include park superintendents, wildlife 
refuge superintendents, etc. that rule over different federal land 
units within Alaska.  Sadly for Alaska's citizens, these authorities 
are appointed in Washington, and have no reason to answer to the 
people of Alaska.  Predictably, their rule can be capricious and 
inconsistent. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The prohibitions against developing some federal land, or even using 
it to get from private or state-owned land to deep water ports and 
other elements of business infrastructure, make it impossible to 
accomplish much economic development.  This especially hurts Alaska's 
attempts to shift its economy away from its dependence on oil. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, even when Alaskans can work with the land, their hands are often 
tied.  For example, the natural markets for oil extracted from 
Alaska's North Slope would be nations on the Pacific Rim, including 
Japan.  Yet, until very recently, federal law prohibited Alaska from 
exporting this oil to Japan, which resulted in Alaskan oil passing 
through the Panama Canal on the way to a Gulf port, while oil from 
Mexico headed in the other direction on its way to the Pacific Rim. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Washington's attempts at environmental micro-management  have also 
severely impacted Alaska.  74% of Alaska's non-mountainous land area 
falls under the definition of wetlands, and so is managed in 
Washington.  So are fisheries and timber.  Alaska's everyday life is a 
series of David and Goliath-like clashes with a distant national 
government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Our federal government seems to have broken its promises to Alaska - 
to have told its biggest lies to our biggest state.  Since statehood, 
Alaska has suffered from laws that were passed and administered by 
people sitting in Washington, people who were either unaware, or 
didn't care, how those laws would affect the people in Alaska.  And, 
this has been done with the usual Washington arrogance that it knows 
better than the people of Alaska what is good for them and their 
state.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
No wonder Pat Buchanan won the Alaska caucuses.  And, while it remains 
to be seen if his win was the first step toward the presidential 
nomination, or just the start of a good month that ended after New 
Hampshire, there is one real concern that we should address.  If 
Washington treats Alaska, a state that sits 5000 miles away and is 
primarily wilderness, so shabbily, just think what it's doing to the 
rest of us.

<title>du Pont: Reviving The Growth Agenda -- 3/28/96</title>

<h2>
Reviving The Growth Agenda
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>

<P>
The campaigns of Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan resonated with voters 
this primary season  because they were the only two candidates running 
who directly addressed the problem of economic growth.  Inside the 
Beltway everything seems fine - and why not?  Bill Clinton has created 
lots of employment for policy wonks, with his everchanging agenda of 
plans to nationalize health care, raise taxes, and pay people to 
become "volunteers."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But out in the real world things are not so rosy. The latest 
government data confirm what voters see: the economy is flat;  there 
is little economic growth.  In the fourth quarter, real GDP grew less 
than 1 percent.  In all of 1995 the economy only grew about 2 percent 
- down sharply from the 3.5 percent rate registered in 1994.  In fact, 
during the three years of Clinton's presidency, growth has only 
averaged about 2.6 percent per year.  The Clinton Administration would 
have us believe that two and a half percent annual growth is fine, 
maybe the best we can do.  In fact, the administration warns against 
efforts to raise the growth rate because it would be inflationary.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not so long ago we did a lot better.  Real  growth averaged 3.4 
percent per year for eight years of the Reagan administration - 
including the effects of a deep recession.  If we leave out the 
recession and look only at the last six years of the Reagan 
Administration, real GDP growth averaged 4.5 percent per year.  And 
this was accomplished while inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 1980 
to just 1.1 percent in 1986.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So the lesson of the 1980s is that it is possible to have faster 
growth - well above the two and a half percent rate that Clinton's 
economists tell us is the best we can do - without inflation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How did Reagan do it?  He did it by reducing the burden of government.  
Taxes were cut, the growth of spending was scaled back, and the burden 
of regulation was slashed.  Taxes fell from 19.6 percent of GDP in 
1980 to 18.9 percent in 1988.  Outlays fell from 22.3 percent to 22.1 
percent over the same period.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But perhaps even more important was Reagan's assault on federal 
regulation.  According to Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester 
Institute of Technology, the cost of federal regulation fell from 11.3 
percent of GDP in 1980 to 8.1 percent in 1988.  In other words, the 
reduction in the burden of regulation during the Reagan years was far 
greater than the reduction in the fiscal burden.  Since 1988, 
unfortunately, the burden of regulation has risen again and is now 
back to 9 percent of GDP, according to Prof. Hopkins.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why are Republicans so reluctant to defend the overwhelming 
economic success of the Reagan years?  Many have bought the liberal 
line that growth was bought "on credit" with higher deficits, and that 
Reagan's tax cuts were a giveaway to the rich that only increased 
income inequality.  This started with President Bush, who always 
seemed somewhat embarrassed by Reagan - it is hard to know how else to 
interpret the "kinder and gentler" line in his inaugural address. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The consequence is, as economist Paul Craig Roberts points out, that 
Republicans have handicapped themselves in addressing the growth issue 
because they neither understand the Reagan record nor are willing to 
defend it with enthusiasm.  Moderate Republicans have become so 
obsessed with the budget deficit that they are incapable of looking at 
tax cuts except as a loss of revenue. In spite of the Reagan growth 
record, lower taxes only  equal higher deficits in their limited, 
accountant's mentality.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To be sure, the House and Senate have voted to cut the capital gains 
tax and scale back regulation.  But at the first sign of resistance 
from the Clinton Administration, Republicans  backed off.  Apparently, 
in their heart of hearts, many agree that cutting the capital gains 
tax only enriches the rich, and that more government regulation is 
necessary to protect the environment, schools, and various economic 
constituencies.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Into this self-created Republican vacuum stepped Pat Buchanan and 
Steve Forbes.  Buchanan's message of isolation and trade protection  
is a false vision, and a counterproductive approach to economic 
malaise.  But Pat offered solutions, and  it is a political fact of 
life that even bad ideas will beat no ideas every time.  Steve's ideas 
of hope, growth, and opportunity were much stronger, and offer a way 
out of the current Republican malaise.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growing the economy - creating jobs, new businesses and opportunities 
- is neither impossible nor dangerous.  President Kennedy did it with 
tax cuts.  President Reagan did it with tax cuts, slower spending 
growth, and deregulation.   It worked twice and it will work again - 
if Republicans will just do it.

 </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>Thursday, April 4, 1996 </i><h2> The Failure of Protectionism 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont </a><P>

 

 
The Great Wall of China dates from the Ming dynasty (1368-
1644), but successive invasions from the North proved that 
it had no more military utility than the "impregnable" 
Maginot Line did for the French in 1940.  Gunpowder and 
artillery long ago had rendered castle walls useless too.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure of walls to provide military security has not 
discouraged a tough-talking Pat Buchanan from centering his 
presidential campaign around trade walls to enhance our 
economic security.  Unfortunately, economic walls make no 
more sense in the modern world than do castle walls for 
military protection.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Logic rejects protectionism, for a wider choice of goods at 
varying  prices benefits consumers.  Experience has backed 
up the logic.  The 1930s, of course, are exhibit A.  To save 
jobs, two Republicans, Representative Willis C. Hawley of 
Oregon and Senator Reed Smoot of Utah, crafted a bill to 
raise a massive tax wall around the U.S. economy.  Signed 
into law in 1930 by another Republican, President Herbert C. 
Hoover, foreign trade plummeted, handsomely aided by the 
retaliatory tax burdens erected by other governments.  The 
ensuing mass unemployment and desperation throughout the 
industrial world led to dictators and semi-dictators, who, 
in turn, took the steps from trade war to actual war.  
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Learning this lesson, 1945's victorious allies were 
determined to work to reduce tariffs and eliminate other 
barriers to international cooperation.  The much-denounced 
GATT, or General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, was the 
primary means chosen to promote open international trade.  
To be sure, multilateral agreements have blemishes and raise 
sovereignty issues, but there is no gain saying that GATT has 
worked.  World trade has been kept relatively open and now 
tops $4 trillion per year in merchandise alone, not to 
mention an enormous daily volume in services, investments 
and financial transactions across national borders.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not that economic logic and facts are likely to deter a 
bellicose Pat Buchanan.  It is easy to arouse tribal 
resentment, but a wall around U.S. business is the last way 
in the world to appease Americans' longing for a better 
life.  Protecting companies from competition will not make 
us rich.  On the contrary, open trading, both foreign and 
domestic, is the key to wealth.  We should make trade 
easier, not harder.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protection may work in a distorted way in the short run, 
holding a few visible jobs in companies that would otherwise 
"rightsize" or disappear.  But it cannot work in the long 
run to boost jobs and wages.  Protectionism rewards the 
inefficient and penalizes the efficient.  As economist 
Ludwig von Mises put it, "The history of mankind is a long 
record of obstacles placed in the way of the more efficient 
for the benefit of the less efficient."  A few politically 
visible jobs are protected by interference at the cost of 
many better-paying jobs destroyed elsewhere. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the longer run, government protection fails to create 
jobs and prosperity in the most protected industries.  Take 
the maritime industry, for example.  Once a great seafaring 
nation, the United States became much less competitive 
during the 20th century.  Heavily subsidized and unionized, 
our domestic maritime trade is completely reserved to 
American-built, American-owned and American-crewed vessels.  
The consequence has been high-priced monopoly service 
between U.S. ports, costing consumers higher prices for 
goods and, yes, costing U.S. sailors their jobs. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How has the maritime industry fared under its 75-year 
protected monopoly created by the Jones Act of 1920?   In 
1950, the U.S. flag fleet consisted of a thousand ships; a 
half-century of subsidy later, there are less than 200.  In 
1950, U.S. flag vessels carried 43% of America's foreign 
trade; today they carry less than 4%.  In 1950, 57,000 
Americans had jobs in our merchant fleet; today less than 
9,000 go  to sea in U.S. flag ships.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A 1991 International Trade Commission study put the 
inefficiency costs of the Jones Act at $3.6 billion to $9.8 
billion annually. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protectionism simply cannot work.  Technologies and 
industries rise and fall, expand and contract, come and go.  
The reasons are diverse but foreign competition is  one of 
the minor factors in our huge, global-size economy.  
Economic change is an asset, not a liability, as new 
technologies and cost reductions bring wider consumer 
choice.  We have nothing to fear from better or cheaper 
foreign products.    
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Centuries ago, the English King Canute stood at the water's 
edge and forbade the tide to come in.  He was no more 
successful than America can be in trying to keep out foreign 
goods and services in the age of the Internet and global 
economics.  The daily ebb and flow of the tides is central 
to global ecology, just as trade is to a global economy.

<h2>   
The Forbes Legacy   
 </h2>

One great strength of the American political system - and one that no   
doubt baffles foreigners - is the way it brings people who are enemies   
one day  together as allies the next.  Just recently we saw Phil   
Gramm,  Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes attacking Bob Dole in  Iowa   
and New Hampshire. But just a  few weeks later, Gramm, Alexander and   
Forbes all dropped out of the race and endorsed him.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The flip side of this phenomenon is that Dole has suddenly  found   
merit in ideas put forward by his previous opponents.  Just a few   
short weeks ago, on March 4, Dole had  nothing good to say about the   
Forbes flat tax.  While campaigning in New York in advance of that   
state's primary, Dole strenuously  attacked the flat tax for   
eliminating deductions for mortgage  interest and charitable   
deductions, and for increasing the deficit. But now, Dole has   
apparently decided that the flat tax is not  a bad idea after all.  As   
the New York Times put it, "Mr. Dole is  now talking about a flat tax   
proposal of his own, something his  aides hint he would have announced   
sooner if Mr. Forbes had not  grabbed the issue first."   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

While to some, such behavior may prove the fecklessness of American   
politicians, in truth it is an essential strength of  our system.    
Good ideas are not banished from the political  process just because   
they had the bad luck to be promoted by a  losing candidate.  On the   
contrary, like flowers in the desert, they bloom again and again.  In   
fact, competition for ideas  generally works the same way as   
competition for goods in the  marketplace.  The best tend to prevail   
despite adversity.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The fact is that ideas often win by losing. Norman Thomas, the   
Socialist candidate for  president in the 1930s, was one of the most   
unsuccessful  candidates in history, yet virtually all of his   
proposals - higher taxes, old age pensions, public power and flood   
control, and unemployment insurance - were ultimately adopted by the   
Democratic Party and enacted into law.   On the conservative side,   
Barry Goldwater's losing campaign in  1964 was equally "successful",   
although not until his ideas were adopted after the election of    
Ronald Reagan 16 years later.      
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

My own experience in the 1988 campaign proves the point.  My proposal   
for school choice, opposed by Bush, Dole, Kemp and, of course, all the   
Democrats, is now Republican policy, and is even being enacted in some   
communities and states across the country.  Similarly, a market-based   
alternative to Social Security, ridiculed as a "nutty" idea, has,   
thanks to Steve Forbes, become a mainstream economic issue.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes will find similar vindication.  Although widely dismissed   
as an iconoclastic, unimportant candidate, many of his ideas - like   
the  flat tax that Bob Dole is already moving toward endorsing - will   
be around for a long time to come   
  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 
Although the flat tax was Forbes' most visible idea, it was  not his   
only idea.  He also spoke eloquently about the need to make the dollar   
as good as gold,  about ending political careerism with term limits,   
and about  privatizing Social Security.  Indeed, the very fact that he   
was not vilified for suggesting the latter idea, as Barry Goldwater    
was, may be the most important development of the 1996 campaign.  As   
Sherlock Holmes once observed, the significant event was the dog that   
didn't bark.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Social Security has long been known as the "third rail" of  American   
politics because every politician who ever suggested  privatization   
suffered the same fate as those who touch the  electrified third rail   
of a subway.  But times are changing.  Because of demographics there   
are fewer people every year who get a good deal out of Social Security   
and more  who have little expectation of receiving anything.  As a   
result,  even the American Association of Retired Persons is said to   
be  sympathetic to some option that would allow younger workers to set   
aside some of their payroll taxes in a private savings account.  The   
Social Security Advisory Council is expected to make a similar   
recommendation in a few weeks.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes may never run for president again and his run  this year   
may never warrant more than a footnote in history, but if Bob Dole -   
or even Bill Clinton - proposes a flat tax next year, or if  Congress   
moves toward some kind of private alternative to Social  Security,   
Forbes will deserve some of the credit.  For if nothing  else, his was   
a campaign about ideas.     
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

And as Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act."

<title>du Pont: A New Medicare: A Better Deal for the Elderly -- 4/28/96</title>

<h2>A New Medicare: <br>A Better Deal for the Elderly
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>








<P>

<P>




<P>
Medicare, the government health care program for older 
Americans, currently serves 32 million people and costs about $180 
billion a year.  Medicare recipients pay $19 billion in premiums and the 
rest comes from a federal payroll tax.
<P>
Often the health care provided isn't very good. One reason is that 
the government pays doctors and hospitals providing the care only about 
70% of its cost, so doctors don't want to serve Medicare patients. As a 
result, there are longer waits for care, and sometimes a lack of care. So 
health care is being rationed to some of the elderly.
<P>
The quality of care may be lower, too, since hospitals and doctors 
are paid the same fee regardless of the quality of care provided.  For 
example, if a doctor is paid a fixed amount to implant a pacemaker, why 
not implant the cheapest one available and pocket the difference?
<P> 
 Finally, new medical technology is slow to be approved by the 
Medicare bureaucracy, so the elderly often get "old medicine."
<P>
 Even with all these efforts to limit costs, Medicare is proving to 
be very, very expensive.  According to the Clinton administration and 
Medicare Trustees, Medicare as it now operates will run out of money in 
less than seven years.
<P>
  By 2000, under current budget projections, Medicare will spend 
almost $250 billion, about 13% of the entire federal budget.  The deficit 
in Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and the general revenue 
contribution to Medicare Part B (insurance for physicians' fees and other 
expenses) will be adding almost $150 billion to the total federal deficit.  
<P>
 Financial problems will quickly grow worse after that.  By the 
time those entering the workforce today retire, the Medicare payroll tax 
will need to be three to seven times higher than now.  The annual 
premiums paid by the elderly will be about $4,400 to $8,600 per couple 
instead of today's $1,000.
<P>	
 It doesn't have to be that way.  One simple and popular reform 
proposal offers a solution:  allowing the elderly the choice of substituting 
a Medical Savings Account and private insurance for their current 
Medicare coverage.
<P>
 Under one version of this proposal, Medicare beneficiaries 
would have the right to receive 95% of average Medicare spending per 
beneficiary and put it into a Medical Savings Account (MSA).  Retirees 
could also contribute the funds they must currently pay for Medicare 
premiums, supplemental Medigap insurance, and out-of-pocket health 
expenses.
<P>
  For the average retiree, these would total close to $9,000 next 
year.  The retiree would use part of these funds to purchase catastrophic 
insurance covering all expenses over a high deductible (say $2,000 or 
$3,000).  The retiree would have at least $2,000-$3,000 remaining in the 
account, which would then be used to pay expenses below the deductible, 
including HMO or other private health care insurance coverage if they 
prefer.  Any unspent MSA funds could then be withdrawn at the end of 
the year for any purpose, or saved for future medical expenses.
<P>
 With MSAs, the quality of elderly health care would quickly 
begin to improve.   Patients would be free to choose the doctors and 
hospitals that would provide the quality health care they prefer.  The 
elderly who exercised the MSAs would also have complete catastrophic 
coverage, which Medicare does not provide.  Medicare coverage runs out 
after a certain number of days of hospital care, and other benefits are 
similarly limited.  But with an MSA, the elderly can buy a catastrophic 
policy that pays all costs over their chosen deductible.
<P>
 Most important, since people would effectively be spending 
their own funds out of the MSAs for non-catastrophic health care, they 
would have excellent incentives to eliminate waste and inefficiency and 
control their own costs.  Since doctors and hospitals would be receiving 
100% payment for their services instead of 70% under today's Medicare, 
they in turn would compete to reduce costs to attract elderly patients 
trying to conserve their MSA funds.  The result would be lower costs for 
Medicare.
<P>
 Several private sector employers have already adopted MSAs 
for their workers and achieved dramatic cost savings of 30%-40% and 
more as a result.  To the extent Medicare beneficiaries chose MSAs, 
much of this cost savings would likely be achieved for Medicare as well.  
This would greatly help to reduce the burden of Medicare on the federal 
budget and its contribution to the overall deficit.  It would also help to 
solve the long term Medicare financing crisis. And since the individual 
gets 95% of average Medicare spending, the government saves an 
additional 5%, or more than $5 billion per year.	
<P>
  This proposal provides overwhelming benefits to the elderly, 
and would be enormously popular.  Yet, all of this can be achieved while 
actually saving the government substantial funds, and helping to solve the 
program's long term financing crisis.  Such a combination of advantages 
should be irresistible to policymakers.

<h2>V-E Day Reflections
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










 <P>
 





Omaha Beach Cemetery, V-E Day - Beneath a clear blue sky and endless 
rows of white marble crosses lie ten thousand of the boys who set out 
to win the war. 
 <P>
They fought their way onto the continent on D-Day, and then across it 
to the Rhine and victory.  They secured the beaches and the peace for 
us, giving up their chance to live life into their old age.  On V-E 
Day, 1945, a million cheering Brits gave thanks for their bravery, 
joining  hands to sing God Save the Queen to Winston Churchill and 
Queen Elizabeth, who stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. 
 <P>
For millions of people, though, V-E Day was not the end of anything.  
For Poles and Czechs and Eastern Europeans, it was neither the end, 
nor even the beginning of the end, of tyranny.  It was only the 
beginning of Stalin's occupation now that Hitler's was finished.  And 
this more brutal oppression would last 44 years instead of six. 
 <P>
Oscar Lindner, an Estonian refugee, survived both.  "The only 
difference between the Germans and the Russians," he explains, "was 
that Nazis come for people during the day; Communists deport people in 
the middle of the night." 
 <P>
How ironic it is that President Clinton was neither in England nor 
France on V-E Day, but in Moscow.  The Russians, of course, have much 
to celebrate 50 years after the end of their Great Patriotic War, from 
survival of the 900 day siege of Leningrad, to the hand-to-hand battle 
in the factories and sewers of Stalingrad, which won the war and saved 
the Motherland.  But they have just as much to atone for:  the 
massacre at Katyn of the Polish officer corps, the enslavement of half 
of Europe and the crushing of freedom in Hungary in 1956 and 
Czechoslovakia in 1968. 
 <P>
So V-E Day was not the end of the anguish.  The horror of Auschwitz 
was yet to be comprehended and some 40 years of communist oppression 
lay ahead. 
 <P>
But the end of European combat began to lift an enormous weight from 
minds and hearts of Americans.  Even for those too young to fight (I 
was 10 on V-E Day), the relief was real, for the war had been with us 
for most of our young lives.   
 <P>
War bulletins, ration coupons and black-out curtains had punctuated 
our days.  Around our supper table we learned about Pearl Harbor, U-
boats, D-Day and the Seigfreid Line.  My uncle, a private in 
Eisenhower's army, was somewhere in Europe.  But where?  Near a place 
called Bastogne, it turned out, where he grabbed a butcher's cleaver 
(which he fortunately never had to use) as he turned out to meet the 
Germans pouring through the Bulge. 
 <P>
Our understanding was sharpened by the media as well, by the movies, 
newsreels, and radio.  Ingrid Bergman in the swirling mists of 
Casablanca taught us devotion to a cause; so did John Wayne in fighter 
planes and foxholes.  The endless parade of Nazi officers assuring us 
they had ways of making us talk impressed our young minds with the 
terror of the police state, while Pathe News showed us Kamikaze 
fanaticism.  Over the BBC, Winston Churchill and the Battle of Britain 
inspired us:  "never have so many owed so much to so few...this was 
their finest hour!"  Vera Lynn's haunting "I'll be seeing you..." 
reminded us that sometimes the ending would not be happy, and The Best 
Years of Our Lives brought home all the tragedies of war.  
 <P>
World War II had taught us two lasting lessons:  through effort, good 
could triumph over evil, and that our entire nation could unite to 
meet a challenge.  We shared a common determination -- "the war 
effort" --  and a clear understanding of what evil was. 
 <P>
The final lesson is how quickly that clarity faded.  The further the 
war slips from memory, the more blurred our distinction between good 
and evil has become.  In 1945, no one was for the Nazis.  By 1950,  
lots of people questioned whether South Korea even mattered.  And by 
the time of Vietnam, Jane Fonda, our universities, and our media were 
on the other side.  The tyranny of the left became acceptable only 
twenty years after we had fought a great war to destroy tyrannies of 
the right. 
 <P>
The boys buried above the cliffs of Omaha Beach would never have 
understood that.  Their cause was to free the world from the evil of 
oppression.  Its clarity is engraved in the stone of their Memorial 
Chapel:   "Remember the glory of their spirit." 
 <P>
Remember, too, that in their glory they each gave up the chance to be 
what we are today. 
 
<P>

<h2>Crimson Tide and SDI
 </h2>

 <P>
 






Crimson Tide is a sizzling movie, two hours of high tech, high tension 
confrontation wrapped around a post-Cold War terrorist scenario.  The 
film's tension is created by the need to fire a pre-emptive strike 
from a U. S. submarine in time to destroy rogue Russian missiles being 
fueled for an imminent launch.  But the real drama lies in the issues 
raised about America's security in the post-Cold War era.  
 
The film is fiction, so it doesn't bother to tell us that destruction 
on the launch pad is the only way to kill the Russian nukes.  But in 
the real world it's true:  once a missile is launched, the United 
States is unable to shoot it down.  We can pray for our family or 
friends who in a few minutes will be incinerated.  But we must suffer 
the missile's impact on Washington, Los Angeles, or wherever, because 
we have not built a missile defense system to protect us against 
incoming ICBMs. 
 <P>
We have the technology to build one.  A decade of Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) research has developed the Patriot anti-missile 
missile, for example.  As we saw in the Middle East, the Patriot gives 
us the ability to protect small regions of civilians and soldiers from 
missile attack.  Further, our shipboard AEGIS missile system is a 
workable defender of our naval fleet. 
 <P>
What we lack is the will.  For years, the Congress has gutted funding 
for SDI research and national missile defense, until today's funding 
levels are less than one-third of a decade ago.  Now the Clinton 
administration is negotiating with the shadow of the former Soviet 
Union to be sure we never build a national missile defense. 
 <P>
So we sleep defenseless against a single terrorist missile.  Think for 
a moment about a rogue band of international terrorists operating in 
some remote corner of  Iran -- or Iraq, or in the mountains of North 
Korea, or in the Crimson Tide scenario in rebel Russia on the 
Kamchatka Peninsula.  How does the United States respond if such a 
group were to launch a missile towards our country?  We could, of 
course, retaliate and obliterate their nation, killing millions of 
innocent people.  But what do terrorists care about that?  How much of 
a deterrent would that be to a band of kamikaze extremists willing to 
destroy an American city? 
 <P>
Over a decade ago, when the idea of SDI was first proposed by the 
Reagan Administration, it was derided by liberals as a science fiction 
fantasy, an expensive and impractical dream.  Democratic Congresses 
and weak Presidents bought that argument, so today we have no missile 
defense. 
 <P>
Indeed, our nation has no better means of protecting its people today 
than it did back in the fifties and sixties, the days when American 
school children practiced hiding under their desks during air raid 
drills.  That is inexcusable.  The only reason there is not more of an 
outcry demanding construction of an anti-missile defense shield is 
because many people think it already exists.  In a survey conducted by 
the Coalition to Defend America, almost 60% of the respondents thought 
the "U.S. could destroy a ballistic missile" before it "could hit and 
do damage."  When the respondents were told no such capability exists, 
over 75% said they thought deployment of such a capability should be a 
priority for our nation. 
 <P>
It would not be an expensive priority.  A recent study conducted for 
the Heritage Foundation by former civilian and government military 
experts concluded that for just $2-3 billion over the next five years, 
our nation could adapt existing AEGIS technology to provide an 
effective missile defense for our nation. 
 <P>
As former President Ronald Reagan said in 1993, ten years after he 
launched our nation's SDI effort, "now more than ever, it is vital 
that the United States not back down from its efforts to develop and 
deploy strategic defenses.  It is technologically feasible, 
strategically necessary and morally imperative."  Frank Gaffney, Jr., 
the former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration 
and currently head of The Center for Security Policy, notes the lack 
of such defenses is "our people's most serious strategic 
vulnerability." 
 <P>
For those who have not yet seen Crimson Tide, I won't give away the 
ending.  But, if  we ever do find a half-a-dozen ICBMs streaking 
towards America, we know our nation would be defenseless against them.  
That's a sad ending.  And Hollywood wouldn't even be around to film 
the sequel.

<h2>Washington's New 
Math
 </h2>

</center><hr>
<p>







A decade ago as Governor of Delaware, I was trying to persuade the legislature to enact a bill granting lower tax rates to banks that moved business operations into our state.  Some liberal legislators objected to the tax incentive, arguing that the state would be taxing banks too little and the bankers would be making too much.<p> 
 "Look," I said, "today we get zero taxes from a bank that isn't here.  If one comes, we get the taxes and all the jobs it creates.  The banks will benefit and so will the state."<p>
 A similar argument currently rages in Washington about lowering capital gains tax rates.  Cut the tax rate, the liberals argue, and the government will tax too little and the wealthy will benefit too 
much.<p>
 Remember that capital gains - the increase in value of stocks or other assets - are only taxed if the asset is sold.  Obviously, affluent people have more assets than nonaffluent people.  But like the bank 
that isn't here, if they don't sell the asset, the government doesn't realize any tax revenue.  But if the prospective tax on the capital gain is lowered, some people who otherwise would have held onto their 
asset will decide to sell it.  The seller will reap his reward and capital gains tax revenue will increase.  So both the seller and the government will benefit.<p>
 Or so you might think.  But in the make-believe world of Washington arithmetic, the government will be scored as losing money.  The reason is that Washington's revenue estimators - the "scorekeepers" you read about - use what amounts to two sets of books.  On the one hand, they agree that the government will get a certain amount of additional revenue in the short run.  But the way they calculate the amount of gain would tax anyone's patience.  If someone doesn't sell an asset because they would have had to pay $10,000 in taxes, but does sell it when the tax is reduced to $7,000, the revenue estimators consider it a $3,000 revenue loss rather than a $7,000 revenue gain.  So a tax rate reduction that results in more dollars flowing to the Treasury is said to be a revenue loss - or, as the scorekeepers put it, a "tax benefit" to the seller.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. <p>
 Following this line of reasoning, if a retail store with goods that cost $500,000 and were priced at $1 million sold them for $750,000, the result would be not a $250,000 profit but a $250,000 loss.  And by 
Washington arithmetic, the sale would be unfair because it benefited the customers. <p>
 That's what the liberals argue in denouncing the tax cuts enacted by the House of Representatives - they are unfair because they benefit the wealthy.  As Bruce Bartlett, the former Treasury Department 
official who is now a Senior Fellow with the NCPA, has noted, things are not quite what they seem here.  The wealthy do hold more assets - or they wouldn't be wealthy - but 74% of the taxpayers who benefit from a capital gains tax cut have incomes of less than $75,000.  Indeed, when all the tax cut provisions of the House bill have taken effect, 65% of the benefits will go to taxpayers with incomes below $75,000, even though they pay only 49% of all federal taxes.  A bonanza for the wealthy?  Not exactly.<p>
Consider another example, the "draconian budget cuts" the liberals charge the Republicans are going to make in Medicare.  Under both the House and Senate versions of the budget, Medicare spending is 
scheduled to increase - by an average of 7% in each of the next five years. <p>
So how can an increase be a drastic cut?  By the same "Washington arithmetic" that makes tax revenue increases net losses to the Treasury.<p>
 Washington arithmetic uses a strange accounting system called "current services baseline budgets."  A current services baseline budget assumes that you will keep doing everything you do now exactly the same next year, and that in addition because of inflation and increased use of Medicare, next year's costs will rise as much as this year's.  That amount then becomes the "baseline" and any spending less than the baseline is a "cut" in the budget.  So a 7% increase in Medicare spending, compared to a 12% baseline budget, comes out as a 5% spending cut. What keeps all this from being hilarious is that the people who think this way have control of huge amounts of real money - our  money.  The truth is Washington arithmetic is designed to ensure that taxes are never cut and spending is never lowered. No wonder so much of the public lacks faith in the Congress.<p>
 Even the Delaware liberals who argued against the bank bill in the 1980s now admit it was a good thing.  Bank franchise taxes yielded $3 million in revenue the year before the bill was passed.  Last year, because a great many new businesses had moved to Delaware, revenues approached $100 million. <p>
Not bad.  Of course by Washington arithmetic, Delaware suffered a $97 million loss. <p>

<title>The End of Quotas Just in Time</title>

<h2>The End of Quotas Just in Time
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>

President Clinton's  "full-throated" (Washington Post) and "near- evangelical" (New York Times) endorsement of affirmative action has set liberal hearts a flutter.
<p>
The University of California's Regents' vote to end race-based admission, hiring, and contracting set Rev. Jesse Jackson ablaze.
<p>
Over at the Judicial branch of government, cooler heads are prevailing. The U.S. Supreme Court has applied the brakes to affirmative action, questioning the constitutional validity of programs that guarantee jobs or contracts on the basis of race.  "Equal protection of the law is a personal right, not a group right," wrote Justice O'Connor.
<p>
Just in time, too, because for two decades government quotameisters have been cutting a broad swath through individual rights.
<p>
For example, the Pentagon sent out word that "special permission will be required for the promotion of all white men without disabilities."  The U.S. Forest Service, desperate to meet its goals for minority firefighters, earlier this year said in a job posting that it would only consider applicants "who do not meet standards."
<p>
Navy Secretary John Dalton has issued a policy that henceforth Naval officers will be commissioned "in a percentage approximately equal to the racial make-up of the populace."  Navy flight standards also seem to have been bent to meet quotas for women fighter pilots.
<p>
Nondiscrimination in hiring, promoting and in awarding government contracts is both right and a right.  But in practice, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been turned on its head by those charged with enforcing it.  Instead of trying to wipe out discrimination, they have mandated it.  The legislation that Senator Hubert Humphrey assured us could never be used to impose quotas has become a quota statute.
<p>
Affirmative action has become a zero-sum game in which gains for one group can only be made at the expense of other groups.  Setting aside a construction contract for one minority group takes opportunity away from others.  When the University of California at Berkeley sets different admission standards for Asian-American students (the policy the Regents just voted down) because too large a percentage of them would be admitted if only grades and test scores were used, Asians are disadvantaged and blacks gain.
<p>
Quotas also undermine the very minorities they are supposed to help.  In a recent issue of The New Democrat, Carol M. Swain, a black professor of politics and public policy at Princeton University, blamed affirmative action for promoting a "helpless victim" mentality that undermines self- respect and initiative.  She wrote:  "It says in effect that you, as a woman or minority, are less capable than a white male and will need special preference in order to compete successfully in a world dominated by white males."
<p>
As a result, a black or Hispanic or woman who is hired or is promoted to a position of responsibility has to overcome the suspicion on the part of others that he or she wouldn't be there except for a quota.  The resulting self-doubt can become an additional handicap in achieving success.
<p>
Justice Clarence Thomas, addressing school busing in the Kansas City desegregation case, was blunt:  "It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior.  This position [that racial imbalances are unconstitutional] appears to rest upon the idea that any school that is black is inferior, and that blacks cannot succeed without the benefit of the company of whites."
<p>
Quotas are also an easy way out.  Quotameisters just calculate that the local population is 12% black, 7% Hispanic and 1% Asian-American, and demand that the makeup of everybody's workforce reflect those percentages.  Then businesses don't have to worry about searching for talented people, or recruiting them, or looking for human potential and helping to develop it.  That takes work.  It's much easier just to hire by the numbers.
<p>
Thus we have incidents like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Chicago office spending seven years unsuccessfully  suing a Korean-owned janitorial service because more than 5% of its workforce was Korean and 95% of the Chicago labor pool was not.
<p>
Trying to end racial or sexual discrimination by giving preferences to one group at the expense of another is like trying to level a table.  If you cut too much off one leg, you have to cut off the others to even things out. And if you make a mistake, you can always trim a little more here or there.  But soon the table is useless.
<p>
So far, there is no indication that the government is going after National Basketball Association teams because they have such a high percentage of black (or tall) players.  Nor does anyone seem to be investigating why seven of the ten best lifetime batting averages of all time belong to left- handed hitters.  Maybe Justice O'Connor spoke just in time.

<h2>A Program in Need of a Crisis
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
When the politicians in Washington suddenly discover a new issue, do you ever wonder about the facts?  You should, because sometimes the facts contradict what the politicians are saying.
<p>
Remember "Alar"?  It turned out there was no apple pesticide problem - the politicians made up the scare.
<p>
Likewise, the Congress mandated $4 billion a year in acid rain mitigation, even though the most comprehensive environmental study in history concluded there was "no evidence of a general or unusual decline of forest in the United States or Canada due to acid rain." And the problem of global warming, according to the Washington Post, "appears to be heading toward solution before [researchers] can find any solid evidence that serious harm was or is being done."
<p>
This summer saw another example of the facts contradicting the politicians:  children's vaccinations.
<p>
In 1993, right in the middle of the great health care debate when President Clinton was trying to scare everyone (with some success) into believing the country's health care system had imploded, the president proposed and the Congress passed a costly new program that would  create an elaborate new distribution system to provide vaccines free of  charge to poor children, the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC).
<p>
Never mind that about half of all childhood vaccines were already being provided free through public health clinics.  The Clintons - and I use the plural intentionally - needed to persuade people that a health care crisis had arisen.  The president pointed to a measles epidemic between 1989 and 1991 that took the lives of more than 100 children in the United States.  And he argued that the reason many children weren't vaccinated was the cost - drug companies were pursuing "profits at the expense of our children."
<p>
But the facts tell a very different story.  In May 1994, for example, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a study of measles immunization of 2-year-olds in Mississippi during the time of the outbreak.
<p>
What did the researchers find out about this rural southern state with a large black population and below-average incomes?  First, that the statewide measles immunization rate of 2-year-olds was 87% (ranging from 79% to 97% according to the geographical district).  While 87% isn't perfect, it's far from being a crisis justifying a $500 million federal vaccination program.
<p>
Moreover, immunization rates were "similar for white and black children in each health district and for the state as a whole."  So there is no racial discrimination problem.
<p>
But what about the poor, rural population? They're the ones who have to drive the farthest to get the immunizations, so doesn't a large rural population point to the need for the president's new distribution scheme? No, because "the level of vaccine coverage was significantly higher in districts with lower population densities (i.e., rural) and those with higher per capita incomes," according to the report.
<p>
So who's left?  Lower-income people living in urban areas - those most likely to have access to public clinics where free vaccines have always been available.
<p>
But the most significant finding of the JAMA study is this:  half of those measles cases contracted during the outbreak in Mississippi "occurred in unimmunized children too young to receive the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine."  (Emphasis added)  It's pretty difficult to blame those "greedy" drug companies for the fact that many children were too young to get the vaccine.
<p>
Now, two years after the VFC's inception, comes a General Accounting Office (GAO) report finding that the VFC's newly created distribution scheme, meant to make the vaccines more accessible to poor children, is not working.   For example, 14 states were prohibited by state law from distributing free vaccines to private physicians, the software needed to process orders was defective, and the Centers for Disease Control could not ensure that the program would serve only entitled children.  Of seven  major implementation tasks considered by the GAO, six  "remained incomplete and problematic."
<p>
Most significant, the GAO found the cost of vaccines had never been a major barrier to immunizations.  A different 1994 JAMA study, done prior to the GAO report, had come to a similar conclusion.  It found that the "provision of free vaccine alone will not guarantee adequate immunization of poor urban children."
<p>
The truth is that the administration created and promoted the VFC program from political necessity rather than medical necessity.  As with his grander attempt to restructure the entire health care system, President Clinton needed to impart a crisis atmosphere, and he succeeded -- for a time, anyway.  Now that the crisis mentality and his health care plan have died, so should the VFC program.

<title>SCHOOL REFORM: WILL NEW JERSEY EVER LEARN?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><i>Thursday, August 17, 1995 </i>
<hr>



<h2>School Reform: Will New Jersey Ever Learn?
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
For the third time in half a dozen years, the state of New Jersey has 
seized control of a local school district.  This time the victims are 
the 48,000 students of the Newark school system, who are about to 
receive a civics lesson they will likely never forget.  They are going 
to learn what it's like to be dumped out of the frying pan of one 
failed education bureaucracy, only to fall into the fire of another. 
<p> 
There is no question that the Newark school system deserves a failing 
grade.  Only one-fourth of its students were able to pass the 1993 
high school proficiency test on their first try.  The district's 
classrooms had fallen into disrepair.  Student attendance was poor.  A 
1994 report, prepared by the state, blasted Newark school officials 
for "dereliction of duty."  The highly critical report spoke of 
students in rat-infested schools, while administrators sat in 
"comfortable offices" and had "important-sounding titles."   
<p> 
Change was obviously needed, but why do New Jersey officials believe 
that shifting control to a larger, more distant state bureaucracy is 
the right kind of change?  They have it exactly the wrong way around:  
effective school reform involves moving decisions about educating 
students closer to the classroom, not further away.  Replacing one 
bureaucracy with another will not work. 
<p> 
New Jersey officials do not have to look very far to see that this is 
so.  In the last six years, New Jersey state education officials have 
also taken control of the schools in Jersey City and Paterson.  When 
Bret Schundler became Jersey City's Mayor in 1992, its schools had 
been under state control for three years, and they continue under 
state control today.  Mayor Schundler states he is "convinced the 
takeovers are doomed to failure and can actually make matters worse."  
He notes "there has been no innovation in Paterson, no innovation in 
Jersey City, and there will probably be none in Newark." 
 <p>
A study of the Jersey City schools, conducted last year, concluded 
that the "district remains below standard in four out of five high 
schools in writing and mathematics."  Results in the district's 
elementary schools for reading and mathematics were also 
"unacceptable."  In certain areas, performance actually deteriorated 
under state control. 
 <p>
So, if state control does not work, what does?  The answer is to give 
control to teachers and parents, so teachers can teach and parents can 
choose the teachers they want for their children. 
<p> 
Suppose that six years ago, instead of commandeering their school 
system, New Jersey had allowed the parents of Jersey City to send 
their children to the school of their choice - public or private, near 
or far?  Parents could have chosen the school best suited to each of 
their children.  Newly formed charter schools might have sprung up; 
private schools might have expanded their enrollment.  Existing public 
schools would have improved to attract more students. 
 <p>
Most important, the children of Jersey City would have immediately 
begun receiving a better education.  As it worked out, Jersey City's 
30,000 students are not receiving an education today any better than 
the one the state replaced six years ago. 
 <p>
Choice and charter schools are no longer new ideas.  They are being 
tried and evaluated across the country.  In New York, East Harlem 
District No. 4 is legendary for the significant student improvement 
that occurred when teachers and parents were empowered to design and 
choose the education approach they wanted. 
 <p>
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an increasing number of low-income children 
are in the fifth year of a school choice program, and test scores are 
rising, although so far only slightly.  More importantly, student 
satisfaction has improved, as has parental satisfaction and 
involvement, and not surprisingly, student attendance and discipline.  
These all contribute to a learning-friendly environment that is bound 
to increase test scores even more in the future. 
 <p>
The truth is that education bureaucracies, whether the Newark school 
board, the New Jersey Department of Education, or the U. S. Department 
of Education, are simply not customer-focused.  They act like the 
monopolies they are, focusing on what is best for them. 
 <p>
The failure of these bureaucracies should be obvious to all.  SAT 
scores have fallen precipitously over the last two decades, and the 
number of students scoring 600 and above on the Verbal SATs has 
dropped 35%.  American students rank 13th in the world on math and 
science tests.  Only 26% of the fourth graders in America can actually 
read at the fourth grade level. 
 <p>
What the education bureaucrats in New Jersey and thousands of 
education departments across the country have yet to learn is that 
time and technology have passed them by.  They are industrial-age 
dinosaurs in an information-driven society, attempting to deliver 
mass-produced education to children who need individualized attention. 
 <p>
Their educational model must be replaced with the energy and 
initiative of schools free to innovate and parents empowered to do 
what is best for each of their children.

<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<title>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly -- du Pont</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

 
The House Republicans have proposed a major revision to Medicare that, if enacted, will provide greatly improved health care for America's senior citizens.   <p>
 
The proposal accomplishes this by shifting power and control over Medicare and its funds away from the government, the hospitals, and the doctors to the elderly themselves.  As a result of this power to the people approach, the elderly will now enjoy the same freedom others have to choose a broad range of private health care plans instead of being forced to participate in the government Medicare system.    <p>
 
Under the House Republicans' plan, the elderly would each have the freedom to take their share of funds out of Medicare and use it to buy any of the full range of private alternatives for their health coverage.  HMOs or managed care will be one option; others  include Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), traditional fee-for-service insurers, preferred provider networks, provider service networks (where doctors and hospitals in an area organize to provide health coverage directly), and plans offered by associations such as AARP, or unions, or employers.  The elderly would each be perfectly free to stay in the current Medicare system if they prefer, foregoing the private options entirely. <p>
 
The amounts that can be withdrawn from Medicare for these private 
options would average about $5,000 per year to start and would be 
allowed to grow no faster than specified in the federal budget.  <p>
 
Both experience and actuarial studies show that for these amounts many 
plans can provide better benefits than Medicare.  For example, 
Milliman & Robertson, the nation's top actuarial firm, recently 
completed a study for the National Center for Policy Analysis in 
Dallas showing that with these funds retirees could buy an MSA with 
full fee-for-service insurance covering all expenses over $3,000 per 
year, with $1,500 left in the MSA to pay for expenses below the 
deductible.  Or they could buy an MSA that provides managed care for 
all expenses over $3,000, with $2,100 left in the MSA. <p>
 
Such MSA plans would provide better benefits than Medicare in at least 
five ways: <p>
 
First, the MSA provides complete catastrophic coverage for all 
expenses over $3,000, while Medicare does not.  Medicare coverage runs 
out after various caps and limitations. <p>
 
Second, the fee-for-service MSA provides a cap on out-of-pocket 
spending for covered medical expenses of $1,500 per year (the 
difference between the $3,000 deductible and the $1,500 in the MSA) or 
$900 if the managed care option is chosen.  Medicare has no cap on 
out-of-pocket expenses; the elderly can be liable for  thousands of 
dollars in medical expenses. That is why 70% of the elderly will pay 
almost $1,200 next year on average for private insurance to supplement 
Medicare.  With the MSA, the elderly can keep that $1,200 per year or 
use it to reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses. <p>
 
Third, the funds in the MSA can be used for health care expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs or eyeglasses. <p>
 
Fourth, unspent funds in the MSA at the end of the year would belong 
to the retiree, and could be saved for future expenses, or withdrawn 
for any purpose, subject to certain minimum balance requirements in 
the House Republicans' bill.  This allows the elderly to share 
directly in the reward for controlling health costs. <p>
 
Finally, MSAs would not be subject to the payment and reimbursement 
limitations of Medicare, or the outdated limitations on what new 
services and treatments the program covers.  These limitations and 
controls are reducing access to care and quality of care under 
Medicare, effectively rationing health care for the elderly. <p>
 
HMOs and other managed care options will be able to provide better 
benefits than Medicare as well.  They will likely add catastrophic 
coverage and prescription drugs to the package offered to the elderly 
for the funds they can withdraw from Medicare each year. <p>
 
Furthermore, the House Republicans' proposal does not increase costs 
appreciably for most older Americans.  There is no increase in 
Medicare deductibles and co-payments, and Medicare premiums (except 
for the very wealthiest Americans) would actually remain at their 
current level of about 31% of the costs of Part B. <p>
 
Best of all, the House Republicans' reform plan actually increases the 
freedom of the elderly to choose their own doctors.  Since private 
plan doctors would not be subject to the Medicare payment limitations, 
doctors  would not be discouraged from providing services to the 
elderly, and so there would be a wider choice of physicians.  <p>
 
Millions of elderly Americans are worried about the future of 
Medicare.  This new approach not only lays those fears to rest, it 
opens vast new health care options for all senior citizens.<p>

<title>du Pont--REPUBLICAN BAD NEWS BEARS ARE ON THE PROWL </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>Republican Bad News Bears Are On The Prowl </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
  
 

 
 
My grandmother told me that bad news comes in threes.  Over a 
lifetime, I've concluded that she was right.  This especially came to 
mind last week, as I read in the papers three pieces of bad news that 
could torpedo the Gingrich Republican revolution of 1994. 
                       <P>
First item - Senator Trent Lott (R-Miss.) seems to have slipped a new 
subsidy for the maritime industry into an appropriations bill.  It's 
only $46 million - what difference can that make to a $1.58 trillion 
government?  But it continues one of those catastrophic subsidy 
concepts that has so characterized liberal thinking for the last 50 
years. 
             <P>
The idea that the government can somehow hold back the tide of 
competition in international shipping has been liberal dogma for 
decades.  There is the Jones Act, for example, which according to our 
International Trade Commission, costs the taxpayers $10 billion a 
year.  The Maritime Operating Differential Subsidy, according to the 
General Accounting Office, costs hundreds of millions more.  And all 
the while America's merchant fleet is dwindling, priced out of the 
market by the very subsidies that are supposed to be rescuing it. 
                                                                                   <P>
Even President Clinton once proposed that the subsidies  be ended.  So 
did Vice President Gore, in a study that said their elimination could 
"spur the country's economic growth by $3 billion annually." 
                                                                         <P>
Well, they may have been kidding.  But we didn't think the 
conservative Republicans were.  
                                                             <P>
Second, I'm struck by the similarity of another Republican effort - 
this time led by the senior governor in America, Republican Terry 
Branstad of Iowa.  Using the wiles and power of the Republican 
constituency of farm belt America, Governor Branstad evidently 
persuaded the leaders of the smaller government revolution to 
reinstate a $1.8 billion (over seven years) subsidy to the ethanol 
industry. 
                                                 <P>
The House Ways and Means Committee had proposed reducing the ethanol 
tax exemption from 54 cents a gallon to (gasp!) 51 cents.  Governor 
Branstad proclaimed Iowa's future imperiled!  The ethanol industry 
will be destroyed, said the lobbyists. 
                                      <P>
I saw how smoothly Governor Branstad sweet-talked the Congresspeople, 
and how quickly they bought the argument that a 6% decrease in a 
single subsidy could destroy the nation's 28th largest state with a 
$56 billion economy.  Then the alacrity with which the Republican 
leadership caved on the issue made me wonder whether the Republican 
Revolution of 1994 could ever succeed. 
                       <P>
If America's third party -- the Gingrich conservatives elected in the 
sweep of 1994 -- as contrasted with the Senate Republicans and the 
liberal Democrats -- was in favor of this enormous and unnecessary 
subsidy, who would ever be for eliminating it?    
       <P>
Then, as if to round out my grandmother's truism, there was an article 
that a group of  Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee were 
turning into marshmallows on the subject of tax cuts.  The word is 
that they want to cut taxes a lot less than $245 billion over seven 
years because they have lost their nerve about the spending cuts that 
would be needed to balance the budget.  Never mind that the Senate had 
negotiated the House down from $345 billion in tax cuts and then 
agreed to the $245 number.  These Republican Senators now wanted to 
renege. 
      <P>
The backsliders - John Chafee of Rhode Island, Orrin Hatch of Utah, 
Alan Simpson of Wyoming, Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Alfonse 
D'Amato of New York - prowled the Senate like Republican bad news 
bears.  They appear to have been seized by Beltway madness,  the 
insidious affliction that has driven federal spending up more than 31% 
in real terms since 1981.  These Senators have evidently decided that 
it's politically easier for them to let the government keep on 
spending than it is to let Americans keep their own money.  The 
liberal Democrats seem to have found some unexpected allies. 
                                               <P>
For the moment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Dole seem to have threatened the recalcitrant six into line - a 
line that will probably hold through Senate Finance Committee votes.  
But many opportunities to undermine the tax cuts of 1995 remain - in 
floor amendments, the conference with the House, and final passage 
under threat of a Clinton veto. 
                               <P>
I should be optimistic, but I can't shake my grandmother's wisdom:  
bad things do come in threes.  First, more maritime subsidies.  Then 
more ethanol subsidies.  And, finally, the same old "keep on spending, 
business as usual" syndrome.  And all approved by the very 
conservatives we put into power to clean up the mess. 
<P> 
If, as some polls suggest, the new Congress is slipping from favor 
with the general public, could it be because the general public sees 
too much of the old business as usual in the Capitol? 
           <P>

<title>du Pont--HELPING THE POOR:  WASHINGTON WELFARE FOR PRIVATE CHARITIES </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center><i>October 26, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>Helping the Poor:  Washington Welfare for Private Charities</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
   
  
What would you think of a doctor who prescribed the same treatment to  
every sick person he treated, whether the patient had a cold or lung  
cancer?  Yet, isn't that the way we handle welfare today?  The fourth- 
generation welfare mother, the educated person temporarily on hard  
times, the drug addict, the man who is simply incapable of holding a  
job - they're all treated pretty much the same by federal welfare  
policy. 
<p> 
But they aren't the same.  They're more than case numbers; they are  
people,  individuals.  Not surprisingly, a comprehensive study by Mary  
Jo Bane and David Ellwood of Harvard University found that poor people  
are just as diverse as nonpoor people.  They have diverse reasons for  
being poor and respond to diverse incentives. 
 <p>
So just as in medicine, the better the provider knows the recipient,  
the more likely that welfare funds will be spent in a way that  
benefits both the individual and the community.  Giving block grants  
to the states to handle their own welfare programs is a step in the  
right direction, but it only transfers welfare responsibility from a  
federal bureaucrat to a state bureaucrat.  A much more fundamental  
change is needed.  We must break free of the idea that only government  
- at whatever level, federal, state or local - holds the answer to  
social problems.  Generally it's not so.  It certainly isn't so in the  
case of welfare. 
 <p>
Thirty years of experience and scholarly studies confirm that the  
current welfare system discourages work and encourages dependency,  
single motherhood and the breakup of families.  People may complain  
about the monetary cost, but the real cost is the social and   
psychological cost in lives damaged or destroyed, children deprived of  
opportunity, increased crime and violence, and the creation of a  
permanent underclass of people with no hope.   
 <p>
Where welfare is concerned, there is already a better answer than  
government programs.  There is mounting evidence that private  
charities do a better job of getting aid to those who need it most,  
encouraging self-sufficiency and self-reliance, strengthening the  
family unit, and using resources efficiently. 
 <p>
Private charitable efforts are not insignificant:   In 1991, private  
charities provided more than $100 billion in cash and $76 billion in  
volunteered time for health, education, and welfare.   
 <p>
The best private charities believe that most people can and should  
support themselves and their families.  They tailor aid accordingly.   
They get aid to those who need it most and provide help without  
encouraging dependency.  They encourage or require aid recipients to  
contribute labor to the charity itself.  One might say private  
charities take just the opposite approach from government welfare:   
whereas it often takes a long time to get on government welfare rolls,  
it is easy to stay on.  Conversely, it is easy to get aid from a  
private charity, but hard to keep getting it. 
 <p>
Government programs spent about $350 billion on means-tested welfare  
programs last year - the federal share being about $240 billion.   
Instead of talking about reducing welfare spending, why not channel  
these funds to the private charities or local government programs that  
do the best job of helping the poor?  Instead of sending these  
billions to Washington, let each taxpayer decide which anti-poverty  
effort to support.  Here's one way this could work: 
 <p>
Create a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for individual contributions to  
anti-poverty programs operated either by state or local governments or  
by private sector charities.  That is, for every dollar individuals  
give to such programs, up to say $3,000 - which is about what the  
median household now pays in federal income taxes - they could take a  
dollar off their tax bills.  One estimate is that this could move a  
large portion of the $240 billion the federal government is spending  
now to private charities and state and local governments. 
 <p>
Only one person in three believes they get good value for tax dollars  
spent on social welfare programs.  But three out of four contributors  
to private charities feel their contributions are put to good use.   
So, almost everybody who pays income tax would actively think about  
the best way to provide charitable services to needy people, and would  
be likely to pay close attention to how the private charity - or the  
local or state government if that's what that taxpayer chose - is  
using the money.  After all, the poverty programs would now be run by  
people in your own home town. 
 <p>
It was early in this century when doctors first understood enough  
about medicine to begin customizing medical treatment to fit the  
patient's needs.  It would be fitting if we could end the century with  
the same kind of progress in welfare for the poor.

<h2>Public School Choice and Racial Balance</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a>
</center> <P>
 <hr><p>
If you thought the Congressional elections of 1994 marked the end of 
liberalism and a new era of conservative government, look at what the 
education establishment is doing to school choice back home.  A 
current example comes from Delaware, where the State Board of 
Education has blunted a new public school choice law by insisting it 
comply with racial quotas.   
 <p>
In Delaware, all the traditional school improvements advocated by the 
education establishment and the teachers unions have been tried:  
smaller classes, higher teachers salaries, earlier education and, of 
course, spending more money.  Meanwhile, SAT scores have dropped 19 
points in 10 years, the National Assessment of Educational Progress 
test scores for math showed Delaware students 28th in the nation, and 
the state now has the highest percentage in the nation (20%) of 
students attending private schools. 
 <p>
But suddenly last summer two events created a surge of hope for 
Delaware parents.  Governor Thomas R. Carper signed a public school 
choice bill in July and a few weeks later Federal District Court Judge 
Sue L. Robinson lifted the controversial busing order that for 17 
years had decreed that a school's racial balance was more important 
than excellence, student achievement, or the individual needs of a 
child. 
 <p>
Now parents would be able to choose the public school (space 
permitting) their children would attend in September, 1996.  Freedom, 
opportunity and optimism were in the summer air. 
 <p>
But it was a false dawn.  On October 19th, just 66 days after Judge 
Robinson lifted the busing order, the empire struck back.  The State 
Board of Education and its top management strongly endorsed local 
school district policies subjugating school choice to racial quotas. 
 <p>
The "new freedom and opportunity" provided by choice, said State Board 
President Paul R. Fine, "must not be at the cost of diversity in our 
public schools."  Read that again, slowly.  Individual freedom and 
educational opportunity are subservient to something called 
"diversity," as defined by state government. 
 <p>
Such policies are the core of welfare state liberalism:  the 
government will decide just how much freedom and opportunity your 
children will be allowed, but in no case will it be so much as to 
upset the policies of the state.  A federal court ends busing to 
achieve racial balance in our schools?  Not to worry, it will be 
reinstated by order of the educational bureaucracy.  For above all, in 
Mr. Fine's words, "schools...must mirror the public they serve." 
 <p>
So much for scholarship.  So much for individual freedom.  And so much 
for the Constitution, which uses the word diversity not at all but 
speaks volumes about liberty and the unalienable right to pursue 
opportunity. 
 <p>
Several  school districts, including the state's largest, have already 
adopted policies that will deny a student's choice of school if it 
would upset the racial balance of the school.  So a de facto quota is 
now in place:  no whites may transfer into school A; or no more than a 
certain number of blacks will be allowed into school B.  Delaware's 
school assignment policies have regressed a full century, once again 
allocating students based upon the color of their skin. 
 <p>
Most disturbing, though, is the reasoning of the State Board.  The 
1977 District Court busing order, as mistaken as it was, prohibited 
the state from assigning pupils to schools in racially disparate 
numbers.  The Delaware State Board's policy forbids children from 
choosing to attend schools in a way that will result in racial 
disparity within them. 
 <p>
Over the years, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the assignment of 
children to school by race was first permitted (Plessy v. Ferguson, 
1896); then forbidden (Brown v. Board of Education , 1954); and now 
constitutionally required (Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg, 1971).  But 
these decisions all addressed the question of government assignment of 
children to schools.  The Delaware Board of Education has carried the 
policy a step further.  Now individuals may not choose to act in a way 
that does not "mirror" society. 
 <p>
It is not a new idea, of course. Soviet Russia and Communist China 
governed societies based upon the principle that the individual was 
subservient to the state. 
 <p>
But it is an interesting idea, particularly viewed in juxtaposition 
with Thomas Jefferson's view that "all men are created equal" and 
"endowed by their creator" (not the government) "with certain 
unalienable rights" (that is, unalienable by the government),  
"including the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  
If memory serves, our Constitution was based upon Mr. Jefferson's 
vision.   
 <p>
Nevertheless, the educational bureaucracy grinds on, limiting 
students' pursuit of opportunity just when it should be adopting a 
more enlightened policy. 
 <p>
Why should government recoil from a straightforward policy with which 
every parent agrees:   no child will be denied admission to the school 
of their choice because of the color of their skin?

<title>du Pont--One Jobs Program That Works</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>One Jobs Program That Works</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>

Last week's District of Columbia appropriations bill contained a 
startling education innovation.  It mandates the establishment of a 
nonprofit corporation governed by the private sector to train and 
place non-college-bound students in jobs. 
<p> 
If, as President Reagan said, "The best social program devised is a 
job,"  then those without jobs or who lack skills that employers want 
need some help to acquire those skills to connect them to the 
workplace. 
 <p>
Both the House and the Senate have recently passed bills resulting in 
a sweeping reform of the federal job training system.  Between 80 and 
125 programs will be consolidated, depending on the final conference 
actions, and overall funding cuts will be between 15% and 25%.    
 <p>
If the conservative revolution in Washington is to succeed, no one 
must be left behind.  One low-cost, high-return way to accomplish this 
is to implement well constructed, economical training in communities 
where jobs are available.  That is the thrust of the two bills in 
Congress - devolving authority, flexibility, and decisions to the 
state and local level - and requiring important private-sector 
involvement in how the funds should be spent. 
 <p>
But the innovation in the District of Columbia may turn out to be the 
most significant step of all. 
 <p>
It is of particular interest to me, because it is based upon an idea I 
developed in my prior life as a governor.  I used the powers states 
had then to devise a better way to train young people for work in the 
real world.  Our idea worked then, and it can be a model for what will 
work now. 
 <p>
"Jobs for Delaware Graduates" (JDG) was created in 1978 as a non-
profit partnership to prepare, counsel, and place high school seniors 
in career jobs.  I committed myself to serve as chair, and challenged 
some of the state's most important business, government, education, 
community and labor leaders to join me in taking personal 
responsibility for the program.  In turn, we hired a staff that would 
each be held personally accountable for helping a group of 35 to 40 of 
our state's most at-risk young people move successfully from school to 
work. 
 <p>
In the very first year, truly impressive results were achieved in the 
test high schools.  Costs were less than one-third that of similar 
programs - including the provision of  nine months' assistance after 
students left school to assure successful placement and performance in 
the private sector. 
 <p>
It was so successful that a number of foundations and government 
agencies helped test the program in four other states.  "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG) was then created to help bring Delaware's 
success story throughout the country. 
 <p>
Today, I am pleased to report that a majority of states now have the 
JAG program - the largest organization of its kind. 
 <p>
What makes it work?  Why do 90% of these at-risk young people graduate 
from school?  Why is it that within nine months 80% are either on the 
job, in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or 
training?  Why is it that JAG shows a 30% improvement in employment?  
Why is it so cost-effective - at $1,200 per participant, less than 
one-third the cost of the national average of similar programs? 
 <p>
Because there is private sector oversight and responsibility, real 
accountability of people to achieve results, and the fact that young 
people themselves must meet the employability requirements of 
businesses and take responsibility for themselves and their lives.  
Governors like Chuck Robb (VA), Kit Bond (MO), and Lamar Alexander 
(TN) joined me in testing and leading the organization.  To date, the 
JAG organization has helped 175,000 young people. 
 <p>
JAG can demonstrate that young people more than repay the cost of 
their participation in the program in taxes paid alone.  Heaven only 
knows how much they would have cost if they hadn't completed school, 
hadn't gotten a job, had gotten on welfare or into trouble with the 
law -- or worse. 
 <p>
Training, counseling, and job placement services can work, if they are 
run by the private sector, involve communities, and demand results.  
 <p>
That is why Speaker Gingrich is so enthusiastic about the value of 
training as part of the welfare reform bill the House has passed.  
That is why so many of us conservatives have found ourselves 
supporting bottomline, low-cost ways to make sure that we don't leave 
any of our young people behind - each gets a decent chance to complete 
school and get a good job upon graduating.  And that is why the 
Speaker and Labor Secretary Robert Reich will keynote the 
organization's 14th anniversary celebration this month. 
 <p>
Supporting America's young people, conserving the cost of social 
programs and protecting the base of our taxpayers in the future are 
good, sound, conservative principles.  In "Jobs for America's 
Graduates," they work in practice.

<title>du Pont-- Bringing Medical Advances to Patients Sooner

<h2> Bringing Medical Advances to Patients Sooner 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Some 70 Americans will die today because the Food and Drug 
Administration doesn't allow existing medical technology to be used to 
save their lives. 
 <p>
If the FDA approves a product that eventually causes a problem in the 
marketplace, it gets into trouble.  But if the product isn't available 
in the United States and isn't generally known to exist, the FDA 
doesn't get into trouble even if thousands of people die for lack of 
it. 
 <p>
Thus there was no outcry even though 119,000 people died of 
hypertension or heart disease during an eight-year wait for beta 
blockers to be approved.  Or when more than 2,000 died from heart 
disease during three years of waiting for Mevacor.  Or when 3,500 died 
of kidney cancer during the three-year wait for Interleukin-2. 
 <p>
The procedures for bringing new products to use in the United States 
are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world.  In 
the 1960s it took six years for the FDA to approve a new drug.  Now it 
takes almost 16 years, even with the recently heralded reduction in 
the time required for final review to just over a year and a half. 
 <p>
It's time to help the elderly and the ill by bringing drugs and 
medical devices to market more quickly.  The Progress & Freedom 
Foundation has a proposal to do it.  It would separate the development 
and product review process from the FDA's role of enforcing mandated 
safety and effectiveness standards. 
 <p>
The FDA would license private entities called Drug or Device 
Certifying Bodies (DCBs), which drug or device manufacturers would 
retain to oversee their product's development.  Since manufacturers 
could choose among DCBs, they could compete to produce a lower-cost, 
faster, and higher quality process for drug and device development and 
review. 
 <p>
More important, the FDA would have 90 days to approve a positive 
recommendation by a DCB.  If it did not act, the use of the drug or 
device would be allowed.  This would be far different from now, when 
the FDA raises hurdle after hurdle, requires more and more tests, 
never saying yes, but rarely daring to just say no.  The current 
bureaucratic gridlock would be broken, so that more effective 
treatments can get to the ill. 
 <p>
There's no reason private entities should not be used to review a drug 
application.  Private entities already perform all functions involved 
in this process except the final approval step.  Currently, the FDA 
requires sponsors of new drugs to obtain approval to begin clinical 
trials, and then continues to oversee the sponsor's clinical program 
through regular reports and other mechanisms.  After the clinical 
studies are completed, sponsors apply for FDA approval.  The FDA does 
no testing, but only reviews the data collected through clinical 
trials. The FDA would review the DCB's analysis of the data, and could 
veto approval if it found the new drug unsafe or ineffective. 
 <p>
The approval process for medical devices needs to be changed, too.  
Currently, if a device is not substantially equivalent to one already 
on the market, it must go through a complex clinical trial process 
even if it's a simple device that carries little or no risk.  The 
breast examination pad, for example, is two pieces of plastic with a 
layer of silicone in between.  It has no moving parts, is non-toxic, 
and in use does not invade the body.  But it is illegal in the United 
States because there is no analogous product on the market.  So years 
of testing loom while women whose lives could be saved by it are 
forbidden to use it. 
 <p>
Finally, there is the question of liability.  Where the treatment of 
patients with serious medical problems is involved, there are going to 
be adverse outcomes from the use of drugs and even death on occasion, 
no matter how responsible the manufacturer and how strict the 
regulation.  U.S. companies are not permitted to defend themselves 
from lawsuits simply by pleading that they have complied with 
regulations.  As a result, manufacturers of some pharmaceuticals have 
simply quit making them.  Here, we might look to Europe, where 
regulatory standards protect the patient, but a company is free of 
tort liability if it can show that the state of scientific and 
technical knowledge when the product went into circulation was not 
such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered. 
 <p>
The FDA was designed for the 1930s and is bureaucratically incapable 
of handling the exploding technological advances of medicine in the 
1990s.  We must change the current system for bringing medical 
products to the marketplace so that our citizens will receive the full 
benefits of the dramatic scientific discoveries and medical 
breakthroughs our nation's vast research establishment is producing. 
 
And they need those benefits while they are still alive.

<title>du Pont--  Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">



<center><i>November 29, 1995</i><hr>

<h2> Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>

</center><hr>  

 <p>
 
Most people would agree that if prisoners learned a skill while they 
were in jail they could more easily get a job when they got out, and 
that an ex-prisoner with a job is less likely to commit another crime.  
Since nearly one-half of people released from prison return to prison 
within three years, job skills could mean a significant decline in the 
crime rate. 
 <P>
The problem is that most productive prison work - other than food or 
laundry work within the prison itself - is against the law. 
 <P>
In 1936, Congress banned convict labor on federal contracts exceeding 
$10,000 in value.  In 1940 the Ashurst-Sumners Act made it a federal 
crime to transport convict-made goods in interstate commerce.  And 
many state legislatures have enacted laws to prohibit the sale of 
convict-made goods within their borders.  States like New York 
compromised and adopted the "state-use" system, which permitted 
convicts to manufacture goods for sale to governmental agencies only, 
which provides a very limited market for the fruits of convict labor. 
 <P>
These statutes were a form of protectionism - to protect providers of 
goods and services in the free market from having to compete with 
convict labor.  Small businesses and labor unions view such 
competition as unfair, and have successfully prevented relaxation of 
the statutes.  When Congress tried to change the laws in 1979, the 
best it could do was allow prisoner work if they are paid the 
prevailing wage, labor union officials approve, local labor is 
unaffected, and no local unemployment is produced.  These criteria are 
nearly impossible to meet, so a mere 1,660 prisoners, out of one 
million, were working under these waivers in 1994.  
 <P>
It was not always this way.  In the last century, prisons earned a 
major part of their daily cost by leasing convict labor to private 
employers.  In 1885, three-fourths of prison inmates were involved in 
productive labor, the majority working for private employers under 
contract and leasing arrangements.  By the 1930s only 44% worked, and 
nearly all worked for state industries rather than for private 
employers.  A 1990 Census found that only 11% of prisoners worked in 
prison manufacturing or farming, down from 16% in 1984.  If part-time 
work in laundry and food services is included, only about half of 
prisoners work. <P>
 
Many prisoners are eager to work, if only to relieve the tedium of 
prison life.  But more important is that the work is good for society 
in the long run because it reduces crime.  A 1983-87 Federal Post-
Release Employment Project study confirmed that employed prisoners do 
better than others without jobs.  Prisoners who work have fewer 
disciplinary problems in prison and lower rates of re-arrest; they are 
more likely to get a full-time job; more likely to quit their job in 
favor of a better-paying job; and less likely to have their 
supervision revoked for a parole violation or new crime.  In the words 
of Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association, 
"It's a matter of public safety:  inmates who have worked in prison, 
and gained new skills have a significantly better chance of not 
returning to crime and prison...." <P>
 
The only disadvantages of more work opportunities for prisoners are 
the feared competitive effects on local labor markets.  But the 
government's first responsibility is to citizens, not to narrow 
interest groups.  New production benefits all Americans.  It raises 
the demand for their services and creates new goods for purchase.  
Competition is the strength of our economic system,  not a wrong to be 
righted, so our policies should be breaking down, not erecting, 
barriers to work - especially when the work will make the streets 
safer for the rest of us. 
 <P>
Allowing prisoners to work makes sense.  Begin by repealing state and 
federal limitations on inmate pay.  Let responsible private businesses 
competitively bid for the use of prison labor.  Let prisons "profit" 
from accepting these contracts.  Provide monetary incentives to 
prisons and their wardens for leading their institutions to self-
sufficiency. <P>
 
It won't be easy for the private-sector bidders, because prison labor 
is not easy to use.  Difficulties include security problems, lack of 
skills and good work habits, remote prison locations, and poor worker 
productivity.  At least at the beginning, the market value of prisoner 
labor will be very low and the quality of their work poor.  But both 
will improve as skills improve. 
 <P>
Across the country a million prisoners are serving time in jail.  Each 
month, 40,000 of them are released under mandatory supervision, on 
parole, or at the conclusion of their sentences.  Our streets would be 
safer and the crime rate lower if these men had a skill, a job, and 
the beginning of a future.

<title>du Pont--  The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">



<center><i>December 6, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>Should America replace its current income tax with a flat tax, a 
single, low-rate tax - say 19% - applied to ALL income above a 
personal exemption of, say, $36,000 for a family of four? 
 <P>
Yes, said the conservative team led by William F. Buckley, Jr. and 
former Democratic Governor Jerry Brown of California in a two-hour 
Firing Line debate taped at Texas Christian University.  Absolutely 
not, replied the liberals, captained by former U. S. Senator George 
McGovern and MIT economist Lester Thurow.  (Before reading on, you 
should know that I was a member of the conservative team.) The debate 
will be aired on PBS the week of December 18th. 
 <P>
The case for the flat tax is based upon three ideas:  it is fairer for 
all to pay the same rate; it will spur growth to create millions of 
jobs and billions of dollars in personal income, and the current 
income tax is grossly unfair, riddled with loopholes and preferences. 
 <P>
A flat tax will be fairer because everyone will pay it.  It will be 
progressive but not penalize effort, and all the special loopholes 
will be gone.  It will be simple enough for most people to fill out on 
a postcard. 
 <P>
As for growth, the National Center for Policy Analysis calculated that 
the flat tax proposed by Governor Brown in 1992 would create 2 million 
new jobs in two years and increase the Gross National Product by 10% 
by the year 2000. 
 <P>
Finally, few will disagree that our current tax system is 
fundamentally flawed and grossly unfair.  The government takes one-
third of what the average person earns each year (more if you are 
successful) and confiscates one-half of whatever is left when we die - 
the family farm, the small business we have built, or the savings we 
have worked so hard to accumulate. 
 <P>
Worse, the Congress opens and closes loopholes every year to reward 
its friends, punish its enemies, and, most important of all, to make 
sure its members are re-elected.  There have been 4,000 changes to the 
tax code since the last "reform" was enacted in 1986.  Our politicized 
tax code takes varying amounts of money from people who have earned 
it, and transfers it to people who haven't, but who the Congress 
thinks have a superior claim to it. 
<P> 
So who is for replacing this mess with a flat tax?  Well, the 
Washington Post:  "the ideal income tax is a flat percentage of all 
income above a threshold of $10,000."  President Clinton's chief of 
staff, Leon Panetta, introduced a flat tax bill as a member of 
Congress in 1982.  And 57% of the TCU students who expressed an 
opinion in a poll conducted prior to the debate favored a flat tax. 
 <P>
And who is against it?  Presumably Republican President Teddy 
Roosevelt, who helped enact the progressive income tax in 1913.  And 
Karl Marx, who initially popularized "a heavy graduated income tax" to 
redistribute income. 
 <P>
But most passionately, Lester Thurow, who confessed in a defining 
moment in the debate that if HE were writing the tax code it would 
contain a progressive consumption tax with top rates "way over 100%" 
so that the wealthy  would find it prohibitively expensive to buy the 
things they buy. "You couldn't have," he said, turning to Bill 
Buckley, "your boat."  
 <P>
Professor Thurow chose an interesting example, for the luxury tax on 
yachts - a mere 10%, not the 100%-plus he proposed - enacted by the 
liberals in 1990 to punish the rich nearly destroyed the U.S. boat-
building industry.  Those punished by the luxury tax (which also 
applied to aircraft and jewelry) turned out to be not the wealthy, but 
the thousands of working people thrown out of work and the taxpayers 
forced to pay $24 million in unemployment benefits to them.  And the 
luxury tax only collected $17 million.  So much for the Thurow theory 
of economics. 
 <P>
But the debate was more than sound and fury.  Senator McGovern came 
around to the view that the double taxation of company earnings was 
wrong.  And liberal economics writer Robert Kuttner conceded under 
fire that if a tax system raised the incomes of all but the wealthiest 
taxpayers 10%, and the wealthiest by 20%, it would still be a good 
thing.  Of course, he denied it could ever happen. 
 <P>
But no one on the left could satisfactorily answer Bill Buckley's 
opening question:  Why should a cab driver working 60 hours a week be 
punished for his extra effort by paying a higher tax rate than his 
neighbor who drove his hack only 40 hours?   
 <P>
Nor could they explain how the current tax system differed from what 
the American patriots listed in the Declaration of Independence as one 
of their grievances against the British King:   He has "sent hither 
swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance." 
 <P>
That sounds an awful lot like the IRS.

<title>du Pont--  A Christmas Carol

<h2>
A Christmas Carol
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
It's not long until Christmas, a very special time for all families.  
In Washington, Christmas is a very special time, too.  The president 
has lit the national Christmas tree.  And lobbyists are beginning to 
think about what kinds of presents they would like to receive this 
year. 
 <P>
I've been rattling some of the packages under the national Christmas 
tree trying to guess what some companies and organizations could be 
getting. 
 <P>
Here's a nice present.  Let's see - it's from the Department of 
Agriculture's Market Promotion Program.  You know, a recent study from 
the Cato Institute pointed out that this department of the government 
spends $110 million a year underwriting the cost of promoting American 
products abroad. 
<P>
Let's see what's inside.  Well, there's $2.9 million to Pillsbury to 
advertise its muffins and pies in foreign countries.  Here's another 
$10 million to promote Sunkist oranges.  And look - $465,000 to 
advertise McDonald's Chicken McNuggets abroad.  That's so thoughtful.  
One of the great things about Christmas is the ability to help someone 
in need.  Without government help, how would McDonald's ever find 
half-a-million dollars to advertise its McNuggets?  
<P> 
The Cato Institute study also points out that:  "Martin Marietta 
Corporation charged the Pentagon $263,000 for a Smokey Robinson 
concert, $20,000 for the purchase of golf balls and $7,500 for a 1993 
office Christmas party.  Ecology and Environment, Inc., of Lancaster, 
New York, spent $243,000 of funds designated for environmental clean-
up on 'employee morale' and $37,000 on tennis lessons, bike races, 
golf tournaments and other entertainment."  As they say in Hollywood:  
That's entertainment! 
 <P>
The Cato Institute estimates that there are more than 125 government 
programs that subsidize private business.  In fiscal year 1995, more 
than $85 billion of taxpayers' money was spent on these programs.  
Now, let's see what else is here.  Oh, here's a big one.  The card 
says this one goes to the sugar industry.  Now isn't that nice:  $1.4 
billion in price supports.  I know the sugar industry will appreciate 
Congress' thoughtfulness--especially the 33 largest cane plantations 
which will receive more than $1 million each. 
 <P>
Of course, there are the gifts that keep on giving, too:  dairy price 
supports, which keep the price of milk much higher than it otherwise 
would be so that the dairy industry will profit.  Then there are gifts 
called "marketing orders" - regulations that govern how many oranges, 
almonds and other products can be grown. 
 <P>
Then there's President Clinton's Christmas shopping list--a few items 
he put in his latest budget.  For example, $333 million for the New 
Generation of Vehicles program, or the "Clean Car Initiative," which 
the White House says will "ensure the global competitiveness of the 
U.S. automobile industry."  That would be GM, Ford, and Chrysler, who 
collectively made nearly $10 billion in profits last year.  I guess a 
gift from the government of another $333 million would still be 
appreciated. 
 <P>
Of course, the suggestion of eliminating or even just slowing this 
government spending spree can result in people calling you a modern 
day Scrooge.  That association obviously misses two important points:  
First, nobody wants to hurt the Tiny Tims of this country; just the 
opposite.  Those who are trying to cut all of these presents to 
wealthy corporations are doing so precisely because they want to make 
sure there is enough for the Tiny Tims. 
 <P>
Second, associating budget-cutting with Scrooge implies that the 
federal government - like Scrooge - has a lot of money that it 
selfishly doesn't want to part with.  But the federal government 
doesn't have a surplus of money lying around.  That debt is the Ghost 
of Christmas Past.  Congress has often been generous in the past, so 
lobbyists continue to press for more presents.  And because we are 
moving into an election year, the congressional spirit of generosity 
towards big businesses can be stronger than usual. 
 <P>
For most of us, Christmas is about sharing, especially with those who 
have the least.  For Washington, Christmas can also be about sharing - 
sharing our tax dollars with those who have the most.  Of course, it's 
easy to be generous with other people's money - especially when its 
the next generation's.  And that's where the Ghost of Christmas Future 
comes in.  No nation will long prosper by stealing from its children.  
If the Congress is serious about cutting the growth in federal 
spending so that we don't leave future generations of American 
overwhelmed with debt, it must cut back on its corporate Yule Tide 
generosity. 
<P> 
Otherwise, how in the "Dickens" are we going to get federal spending 
under control?

<title>du Pont:   Maintaining the Value of the Dollar -- 12/22/95
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>



<center><i>December 20, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>
Maintaining the Value of the Dollar
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power "to 
coin money [and] regulate the value thereof." 
 <P>
Nowhere does the Constitution tell Congress how much money to coin, 
how it should be valued, or how the government should regulate these 
matters.  In 1913, the Congress gave the power to decide those issues 
to the Federal Reserve, which quickly became - and still remains - the 
most powerful economic institution in the nation. 
 <P>
As our nation's central bank, the Fed decides how much money will be 
available in our banking system to make loans.  So in addition to 
controlling the money supply, it largely controls short-term interest 
rates.  With control over the money supply and interest rates, the Fed 
then has enormous influence over real economic growth, unemployment, 
and inflation in our economy.    
 <P>
Most people know little - and care less - about monetary aggregates, 
discount rates, and other technical Fed issues.  But every American 
understands that a primary responsibility of the government is to 
maintain the value of our money.  A government that intentionally (or 
even unintentionally) erodes the value of earnings and savings is 
undermining current prosperity and the future prospects of its 
citizens.  Along with establishing justice, ensuring domestic 
tranquillity and providing for the common defense - to quote the 
preamble to the Constitution - sound money,  a dollar "as good as 
gold," is the ranking economic priority of the nation. 
 <P>
The trouble is, that's not what the law says.  The Employment Act of 
1946, as amended by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, legally sets 
"full employment" as the primary goal of Federal Reserve policy.  This 
law requires the Fed to stimulate the economy with lower interest 
rates and the coining of more money whenever the unemployment rate 
rises.   
 <P>
Of course these two actions can quickly lead to higher inflation,  
which devalues our money.  Nevertheless,  whenever unemployment rises, 
even when inflation is already too high, the Fed is legally required 
to stimulate the economy.  So inflation ratchets higher and higher, 
until a recession occurs and moderates the inflation.  
 <P>
Such economic cycles roll through our economy much as weather fronts 
roll across the country.  But unlike storms, economic cycles build 
upon each other.  History has often seen that both at the trough of 
each new recession and at the peak of each cycle of expansion, 
inflation and unemployment were higher than they had been the time 
before.   
 <P>
So there is a "catch 22" in which higher inflation leads to higher 
unemployment.  Then under the Humphrey-Hawkins rule, the higher 
unemployment requires additional Fed stimulus, which in turn leads to 
even higher inflation.  These kind of cycles and pressures hinder the 
Fed's long run ability to maintain the value of our money.  As long as 
the Humphrey-Hawkins law remains unchanged, the value of our savings 
remains at risk. 
 <P>
Right now inflation is under control, and unemployment is low, so the 
Fed faces no dilemma.  But sooner or later the Fed will again face 
that hard choice of whether to obey the law and temporarily reduce 
unemployment at the cost of higher inflation, or violate the law and 
stick with price stability.  The Fed should not have to face such a 
choice.   
 <P>
Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) and Congressman Jim Saxton (R-NJ), who co-
chair Congress's Joint Economic Committee, have introduced legislation 
to end the Feds dilemma of choosing between full employment and low 
inflation. They would do so by repealing the Humphrey-Hawkins Act and 
replacing it with the Economic Growth and Price Stability Act. 
 <P>
This new legislation would change the Fed's policy mandate by 
establishing price stability as its primary mission.  It would no 
longer be required to stimulate the economy to create full employment, 
and could concentrate all its efforts on maintaining the value of the 
dollar by controlling inflation. 
 <P>
Mack and Saxton believe that in the long run, maintaining price 
stability is the best thing the Fed can do to keep unemployment down 
and encourage real growth in the economy, which in turn will create 
more jobs.  Thus, ironically, getting rid of the full employment 
Humphrey-Hawkins requirement is actually the best way to achieve full 
employment. 
 <P>
 
Maintaining the value of our money must be the Fed's first 
responsibility, and Congress should say so by law.

<h2>Spiritual Renewal</h2></center><P> 

[Today's the first day of the new year -- the perfect time to examine our 
personal weaknesses and the shortcomings of our society, and resolve to 
fix what needs fixing.]
<p>
In an essay published in the November issue of Hillsdale College's 
monthly journal, Imprimis, former Education Secretary William Bennett 
says that the last 30 years have been a period of cultural decline for 
America. During the last three decades, he says, "there was a 560 percent 
increase in violent crime; more than a 400 percent increase in illegitimate 
births; a quadrupling in divorces; a tripling of the percentage of children 
living in single-parent homes: more than a 200 percent increase in the 
teenage suicide rate; and a drop of 75 points in the average SAT scores of 
high school students." When it comes to social pathology, America sets 
the global pace. "We are at, or near, the top in rates of abortions, 
divorces, and unwed births," says Bennett. "We lead the industrialized 
world in murder, rape, and violent crime. And in elementary and 
secondary education, we are at, or near, the bottom in achievement 
scores."<p>

There are other, harder-to-measure "signs of decay." Bennett suggests 
that "there is a coarseness, a callousness, a cynicism. a banality, and a 
vulgarity to our time" and laments in particular the deleterious effect on 
children. "We live in a culture which at times seems almost dedicated to 
the corruption of the young, to assuring the loss of their innocence before 
their time," he says. Where are the protesters? Why doesn't anyone do 
anything? "We have become inured to the cultural rot that is setting in," 
concludes Bennett. "People are experiencing atrocity overload, losing 
their capacity for shock, disgust, and outrage."
<p>
Bennett insists that "the real crisis of our time is spiritual." He says that 
"our desires are turned toward the wrong things. And only when we turn 
them toward the right things -- toward enduring, noble, spiritual things -- 
will things get better." That's going to be rather difficult as long as there 
persists "a disturbing reluctance in our time to talk seriously about 
matters spiritual and religious." Bennett says that, "when millions of 
people stop believing in God, or when their belief is so attenuated as to 
be belief in name only, enormous public consequences follow. And when 
this is accompanied by an aversion to spiritual language by the political 
and intellectual class, the public consequences are even greater."
<p>
William Bennett recommends four steps toward "spiritual renewal." The 
first is to recognize the "intrinsic limits to what the state can do, 
particularly when it comes to imparting virtue, and forming and forging 
character, and providing peace to souls." The second is to reinvest public 
policy with "our deepest beliefs." The third is to "recover a sense of the 
fundamental purpose of education," which is moral instruction. Last, says 
Bennett, "we need to return religion to its proper place" in society -- no 
matter how much it may disconcert those who flee from faith.

<h2>Vincent Foster</h2></center><P> 

[More than two years after it occurred, the death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster continues to raise troubling questions.]
<p>
The body of White House Counsel Vincent Foster was discovered in Fort 
Marcy Park across the Potomac River from Washington DC, at 6 p.m. on 
July 20, 1993. The U.S. Park Police found a pistol in Foster's hand and 
quickly ruled the death a suicide. Nevertheless, a poll conducted by Time 
magazine and CNN two years later revealed that 65 percent of Americans 
do not accept the official verdict in the case.
<p>
Government investigators have ignored evidence suggesting that Foster's 
body was dumped in Fort Marcy Park, and that he may not have taken his 
own life. The suspicious nature of Foster's death, and his connection to 
the Whitewater and Travelgate scandals, make this one of the biggest 
news stories of the 1990s. Yet, only one reporter in America is 
investigating the Foster death on a full time basis. Christopher Ruddy 
began his probe as an investigative reporter for the New York Post in 
1993 . Now associated with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Ruddy 
continues his one-man crusade to find out what really happened to "the 
highest ranking federal official in more than 30 years [to die] under very 
suspicious circumstances."
<p>
Ruddy summarizes the many inconsistencies in the case in a new report 
available from the nonprofit Western Journalism Center entitled Vincent 
Foster: The Ruddy Investigation. Ruddy points out that a confidential 
Secret Service memo written on the night of Foster's death stated that 
"U.S. Park Police discovered the body of Vincent Foster in his car." He 
says a senior Park Police investigator admitted that she and her 
colleagues reached a verdict of suicide "prior to going up and looking at 
the body."
<p>
Three handwriting experts have declared Foster's so called suicide note a 
forgery. "A note torn into 28 pieces, leaving no fingerprints and said to 
have been written by Foster, was found almost a week after his death," 
says Ruddy, but it lacks the contents typical of a suicide note -- no 
mention of death, no farewell to loved ones, and so on. The lack of an 
accounting for Foster's whereabouts during the last five hours of his life 
is also problematic, says Ruddy, noting that "no one came forward to 
claim they had seen him alive at the park or even around Washington, 
that fateful afternoon."<p>

The suicide scene itself was atypical. Foster's body was neatly arranged. 
"The fired bullet was never found. No one heard the fatal shot," says 
Ruddy. "Trace analysis of Foster's shoes at the FBI lab found not a speck 
of soil on his shoes or clothing despite a 700-foot-plus trek through the 
heavily wooded park."
<p>
All Ruddy wants is straight answers to some simple questions. "If Foster 
didn't shoot himself . . . who did? Where? How did he really die? These 
are the questions investigators should have asked," says Ruddy. "Their 
answers lead to other, logical questions about the strong evidence that the 
body was moved to the park."

<h2>Terrorism</h2></center><P> 

[The threat to American security posed by Libyan and Iranian terrorists 
doesn't seem to loom as large today as it did in the early 1980s, but the 
threat remains.]
<p>
Former FBI agent Ray Wannall says that Iran and Libya have held 
grudges against the United States since at least the early 1980s. "Their 
terroristic threats against the U.S. were intensified following our raid on 
Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya in 1986, the accidental shooting down of an 
Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf in 1988, and the U.S. downing of two 
Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean the following year."
<p>
Wannall recalls that early in 1985 Muammar Qaddafi urged black 
American servicemen to leave the military and form a separate army 
because the United States "must be destroyed." In a 40-minute satellite 
address from Libya to a Nation of Islam convention in Chicago, Qaddafi 
declared: "This country must be destroyed. They refuse to accept you as 
American citizens. This means you are obliged to create a separate and 
independent state." Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, 
endorsed the Libyan dictator's remarks, saying, "Brother Qaddafi is a 
man the world does not understand."
<p>
In that 1985 speech, Qaddafi incited Farrakhan's followers to 
insurrection. "You have the force, you have the soldiers," said Qaddafi. 
"We are ready to give you arms, because your cause is just. We are with 
you. Don't worry. You have to trust us. We will fight together shoulder 
by shoulder. The final victory will be soon." Though claiming to have 
declined the offer of arms, Farrakhan did accept a $5 million interest-free 
loan from Qaddafi, ostensibly to underwrite a commercial enterprise to 
help black Americans create financial independence.
<p>
The Washington Times reported in 1985 that a radical Islamic 
infrastructure of terror has been established across the U.S., consisting of 
safehouses, weapons, ammunition, money, and systems to provide 
medical and legal aid, false identity papers, and transportation. Followers 
of Qaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini man this network, ready to 
spring into action when the word comes. Appearing before Congress the 
following year, FBI Director William Webster warned that three-fourths 
of the 2,000 Libyan students in the U.S. were financed by the Libyan 
government and could constitute a terrorist threat.
<p>
Former FBI Executive Assistant Director Oliver Revell warned earlier 
this year that it is likely that a radical Islamic fundamentalist 
infrastructure has been firmly established in our country. The radical 
fundamentalists "support such organizations as Hezbollah, Hamas, and 
the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which are directly involved in terrorism and 
violently oppose the Israeli-PLO initiative," says Revell. "These 
organizations are aided and supported by Iran, including its diplomatic 
establishments and intelligence services, which makes them even more 
dangerous."<p>

Ray Wannall says the Iranians and the Libyans "have not tempered their 
threats in recent years. Nor has Louis Farrakhan given any sign of 
rejecting Qaddafi's avowed friendship and support. Jihad, the holy war 
waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty, is still being fought."

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[Medical Savings Accounts are an idea whose time has come. By 
returning control over medical choices to the individual, MSAs should 
rein in the spiraling costs of health care.]
<p>
Peter Ferrara of the National Center for Policy Analysis says that "health 
care costs are out of control" because the wrong people are paying the 
bills. The patients, the ones receiving medical care, do not generally pay 
their own bills. The bills are paid, for the most part, by third parties -- 
employers, insurance companies, or the government. The average 
American pays only one-fifth of his own health care costs. "Someone else 
pays the rest," says Ferrara, and that third-party payment system is what 
is driving up health care costs. Americans simply have no personal 
incentive for monitoring the costs of their health care and shopping 
around for less expensive alternatives.
<p>
The solution is simple: Take control over health care away from third 
parties and give it back to the people who are using it. Give them a 
personal, financial incentive for keeping costs down. Ferrara says it is 
only human nature for people to be careless, even extravagant shoppers 
"if we are spending someone else's money." And it's only natural for 
doctors and other health care providers to encourage us to take advantage 
of extra tests and procedures -- just to be on the safe side -- "if they know 
that we are not paying the bills." But Americans spend their own money 
in every other marketplace, and they make wiser decisions when they do 
so. Why, then, is the marketplace of medical care different from all the 
others?
<p>
1996 looks to be the year that Congress begins restoring economic sanity 
to our health care system. The Archer-Jacobs bill will encourage 
individuals and their employers to make tax-free deposits into Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs), which employees can draw on to cover 
ordinary health expenses. MSAs will let Americans choose the care they 
want and spend their health care dollars as they see fit, thereby providing 
a huge incentive to keep health costs down.
<p>
With Medical Savings Accounts, employees would be spending their own 
money for non-catastrophic health care. As a result, Peter Ferrara says, 
"they would have excellent financial incentives to control the cost of such 
care. They would seek to avoid unnecessary care, look for quality plus 
value in doctors and hospitals, and consider whether the services were 
worth the prices." Medical Savings Accounts would have other benefits 
too, such as reduced administrative costs.
<p>
If Americans switch to Medical Savings Accounts in large numbers, 
health care spending will decline dramatically. MSAs will give 
consumers more choices and more control in health care decisions. These 
accounts will be portable too, not linked to continued employment at a 
specific location. MSA funds can be applied to any type of health care, 
and are not subject to the approval of insurers or health maintenance 
organizations. Medical Savings Accounts will harness the power of our 
remarkable free-enterprise system to make American medical care 
affordable again.<p>

<h2>"No-Win Situation" in Bosnia </h2></center><P> 
 
[Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer says that sending U.S.  
troops to Bosnia is a "serious mistake" and a "no-win situation."]  
  <P>
In a recent issue of The Weekly Standard, Charles Krauthammer argues  
that U.S. involvement in Bosnia will have one of two unacceptable  
outcomes. Either it will end in "a humiliating retreat . . . after some  
incident involving a major loss of American life and cries from the  
Congress and the American people for withdrawal. Or, more likely, we  
will persevere, indeed escalate our involvement, send more troops to  
protect existing troops and be caught in a long-term, static, and defensive  
deployment with painful losses, ambiguous rules of engagement,  
escalating friction among NATO allies . . . and no way out."  
  <P>
Krauthammer says American troops are going into Bosnia with "no  
definable objective, no identifiable enemy, no exit strategy." Being the  
"sole remaining superpower" and having the "finest, most powerful  
military" do not obligate the United States to be the world's peacekeeper.  
"It is decidedly not the role of a superpower to place itself between the  
combatants in a civil war of marginal importance to the world balance of  
power . . . among unreconciled parties who have already shown a  
propensity for killing and kidnapping peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"Peacekeeping is the job of small countries with no particular interest in  
the outcome of a conflict," says Krauthammer. "It is far harder for a  
superpower to remain neutral, and even harder to be perceived as neutral,  
in most conflicts. And, in the Bosnian war, in particular, the United States  
has been decidedly not neutral. We have made our sympathies with the  
Bosnian Muslim side abundantly clear in our declarations, in our use of  
air power, and indeed in our promises to arm the Bosnian government  
even as we act as peacekeepers."  
  <P>
"If the combatants in Bosnia are serious about ending the fighting and  
accepting roughly the distribution of territory and roughly the balance of  
power now on the ground, then they should do it and enforce it  
themselves," says Krauthammer. "If they are not, then there is no peace to  
keep. And between such antagonists is no place to interpose American  
troops."  
  <P>
Krauthammer concedes that "reneging" on the promise to deploy troops  
"would be a blow to NATO," but contends that "following through and  
actually sending the troops would be worse." He describes as "nonsense"  
the argument that "we must intervene in Bosnia because of the  
continuing, indeed intensifying, threat the war poses to European  
stability." He says "the war is in fact contracting" and that the great  
nations of Europe have no reason to make war "over the control of this  
cursed, tragic piece of land." While acknowledging that American  
credibility is damaged "whenever the United States makes a commitment  
and then reneges on it," Krauthammer insists that the blame belongs to  
"the administration that made that foolish promise without proper  
reflection." Congress, on the other hand, should be applauded for "trying  
to avert the consequences of that ill-considered promise."

<center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 9, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> Dole on NAFTA</h2></center><P> 
 [The efforts of Senator Bob Dole to distance himself from the North 
American Free Trade Agreement could signal a historic shift in U.S. trade 
policy.] 
 <P>
"The callous behavior of Bill Clinton and his trade allies in Congress in 
bulldozing the GATT and NAFTA treaties through in the face of the 
overwhelming opposition of the American people set the stage for the 
current counterrevolution on the trade front," says William Gill of the 
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. The seeds of that 
counterrevolution "were first sewn in 1990," says Gill, with publication 
of a book called Trade Wars Against America. That book persuaded Pat 
Buchanan and other conservative leaders that so-called free trade is "a 
destructive aberration that goes against the Constitution -- and the 
protectionist policy of George Washington and the other Founders -- the 
policy that built America." 
 <P>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, intends to 
keep publicizing the defects of free trade "until public opinion finally 
forces the government to repudiate this insane policy that is strangling 
America." As casualties of our country's self-defeating trade policy, Gill 
cites the nearly 80,000 mid-level managers to be laid off by AT&T, the 
12,000 bank employees made redundant by the pending merger of 
Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, the 1800 millworkers left stranded 
by the shutdown of Bethlehem Steel, and the 3200 textile workers let 
loose by Fruit of the Loom. 
 <P>
"Nowhere has the frenzy to cut jobs been more apparent than in the 
nation's once invincible defense industries," says Gill, noting that 
1,300,000 defense workers have lost their jobs since 1988, and 700,000 
more will be let go in the next two years. "Although most of these two 
million jobs will have disappeared because of cuts in the federal budget, a 
significant number can be traced to trade," says Gill. "Billions of dollars 
have been spent by the armed services on foreign products, many of them 
high-tech items invented in America and once made here before 
production was shipped overseas." As if that weren't bad enough, "it has 
become fashionable for U.S. defense companies to enter into joint 
ventures with foreign firms and governments in the production of some 
of our most sophisticated weaponry." Venture partners such as Japan 
have sold the technology acquired in this manner to our enemies. 
 <P>
Pat Buchanan has made protectionism the cornerstone of his bid for the 
Republican presidential nomination, and the-public's favorable response 
to that theme has not escaped the notice of front-running Republican 
presidential candidate Bob Dole. Last November, Dole expressed 
"significant disappointment" with the results of NAFTA, warned his 
colleagues in the Senate that America is "choking on new agreements," 
and called for a "cooling-off period" on trade pacts. "If Bob Dole sticks to 
his new guns on trade, and if he gets the Republican nomination in 1996, 
he will outflank Bill Clinton on an issue that now has most Americans up 
in arms against it," says Gill.

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  Abolish Education Department -- 1/10/96</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 10, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Abolish the Department of Education</h2></center><P> 
[Abolishing the Department of Education would curb the federal 
government's baleful influence on public schools and save as much as 
$70 billion a year in taxpayers' money.] 
 
 <P>
Early in the 1976 presidential elections, the National Education 
Association threw its important support behind a relatively unknown 
candidate named Jimmy Carter. The NEA endorsement gave visibility to 
the obscure, one-term Georgia governor, adding momentum to his 
ultimately-successful campaign. The endorsement came with a price, 
however, one that President Carter gladly paid. The establishment of the 
federal Department of Education was the quid pro quo that the National 
Education Association received for the push it provided to the political 
presumptions of a pandering peanut farmer. 
 <P>
Of course, the federal government was meddling in education long before 
then, but the creation of a separate cabinet-level department has greatly 
exacerbated the problem. Congress now appropriates $70 billion per year 
for what it calls education. Roughly half of this amount goes to the 
administration of 244 separate programs in the Department of Education. 
The rest is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 overlapping 
programs. There are more than 90 separate federal preschool and child 
care programs, administered by eleven different agencies and 20 different 
offices. There are 86 separate federal teacher training programs, 
administered by nine different departments. There are at least 46 separate 
federal youth development programs, administered by eight different 
agencies. None of these programs is necessary, and most of them are 
redundant. 
 <P>
The Federal Government's 30-year experiment with education funding 
has failed miserably. Illiteracy has reached epidemic proportions, and 
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have dropped so dramatically that the 
Educational Testing Service is now adding nearly 100 points to every 
score to conceal this embarrassing decline. Abolishing the Department of 
Education will not adversely affect our public schools, which flourished 
before the department was created and will survive its termination. 
Federal spending in public schools is only about six percent of their total 
budget, and precious little of it supports legitimate academic pursuits. 
Layoffs of superfluous administrative personnel could easily offset a six-
percent downsizing. 
 <P>
Establishing a federal Department of Education may have worked 
wonders for the National Education Association, but it has done nothing 
positive for America's public schools. In fact, it has had an entirely 
deleterious effect, further weakening local control and adding costly 
government regulations at the expense of academic curricula. The fact 
that it hasn't worked is a good judgment for abolishing the Department of 
Education, but the best argument of all is that the Department is simply 
unconstitutional. The U.S. Constitution  makes no mention of education, 
and provides no authority for the federal government to meddle in local 
schools. The federal government has inserted itself into numerous areas 
beyond its constitutional jurisdiction, and it's time for Americans to insist 
that it return to its proper concerns. Eliminating the Department of 
Education would be a good start.

Duplantier</a> <br>
January 11, 1996<br></i><hr><h2> MSAs Could Save Medicare</h2></center><P> 
[Employees at the Golden Rule Insurance Company in Indianapolis are 
staunch supporters of the proposed Medicare reform called the Medical 
Savings Account. That's because all 1200 employees already have MSAs] 
 
 <P>
The Golden Rule Insurance Company is America's leading writer of 
individual health policies, with 800,000 policyholders and nearly $800 
million in annual revenue. Golden Rule is also the nation's number-one 
promoter of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), having signed 
up nearly 1000 companies for its MSA group plan. The company is so 
keen on Medical Savings Accounts that it even established an MSA 
group plan for its own employees two years ago, says reporter Bob Jones 
in a recent issue of World magazine. "Golden Rule Chairman Pat Rooney 
has made it his mission to show that MSAs actually work." 
 <P>
Jones explains the logic behind MSAs: "Health care costs will be 
controlled only when people start spending their own money instead of 
the insurance company's. To accomplish this, Medicare would offer 
seniors a new, high-deductible policy. The higher deductible means lower 
premiums; the savings are deposited to an account from which 
individuals can pay- for medical bills that fall below the deductible. 
When expenses in any year exceed the deductible," Jones continues, "the 
catastrophic insurance kicks in, paying 100 percent of remaining bills 
(instead of the 80 percent now covered by Medicare)." 
 <P>
If an individual spends less than his deductible, whatever remains in his 
MSA is "rolled over into a tax-free annuity that can be used to pay future 
medical bills or provide long-term care. This system," Jones says, 
"provides an incentive for seniors to become smart health care 
consumers, costs them no more than the current system, and at the same 
time offers more flexibility and greater benefits." 
 <P>
Under proposed Medicare reforms, "MSAs would be tax deductible like 
IRAs, making them enormously attractive not only to private businesses, 
but also to the millions of self-employed. Even without that tax 
exemption," says Jones, "MSAs have been hugely successful at a few 
pioneering companies like Golden Rule [where] health care costs 
dropped 40 percent the first year that MSAs were implemented." Medical 
Savings Accounts are even more popular among employees, says Jones, 
citing a 1994 study that found a satisfaction level of 98 percent. MSAs 
have even encouraged Golden Rule employees to take better care of 
themselves. "More than a quarter of employees are taking advantage of 
some medical service they never used before, simply because the money 
is there and they can choose how to spend it without having to worry that 
it won't be covered under their policy," says Jones. 
 <P>
The current Medicare trust fund surplus of $130 billion is expected to 
dwindle to zero in seven years. "By 2004," says Jones, "Medicare will 
face a deficit of more than $100 billion." Medical Savings Accounts are 
just what the doctor ordered to avert that grim prospect.

Duplantier</a> <br>January 12, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Judicial Usurpation</h2></center><P> 
 
[By extending rights to illegal aliens, federal judges undermine the value 
of American citizenship and de-legitimize self-government.]
<P>
Washington Times columnist Paul Craig Roberts warns that self-
government may be "a thing of the past" in America. He cites a federal 
judge's recent order blocking implementation of California's Proposition 
187, which received 59 percent of the votes cast in a statewide election in 
1994. "The judge," says Roberts, "ruled that the right of illegal aliens to 
publicly-provided benefits, such as education and welfare, exceeded the 
right of citizens to utilize the democratic process to limit or curtail their 
financial obligations to people illegally residing in our country."
<P>
The judge's ruling is just the most recent example of judicial usurpation 
in what has become "a frontal assault on citizenship and the exercise of 
self-rule," says Roberts. "It demeans citizenship by eliminating any 
difference between the claims of citizens and illegal aliens to taxpayer-
provided benefits. And it destroys self-rule by denying citizens the right 
to limit their taxpaying responsibilities through the exercise of the 
democratic process."
<P>
Judges have been undermining citizenship and self-rule for decades. 
Roberts cites a 1982 Supreme Court decision in which five of the nine 
justices "decided that the State of Texas could not restrict the use of its 
limited resources to educate only lawful residents. The court's cavalier 
disregard of the rights of U.S. citizens was not based on any law or legal 
precedent," says Roberts. "It rested entirely on the subjective feelings of 
five justices that it was good social policy for taxpayers to be made to 
finance public education for illegal aliens."
<P>
Roberts notes that Chief Justice Warren Burger and the three other 
dissenting justices "criticized their brethren for violating the separation of 
powers by assuming a policymaking role. The Constitution, they said, 
does not vest the court with 'the authority to strike down laws because 
they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy."' That's exactly 
what the High Court did and got away with, however, thereby 
demonstrating "how readily blackrobed social engineers substitute their 
own policy predilections for the will of the people."
<P>
Judicial decisions "based on feelings and not law" are unworthy of our 
respect, says Roberts. "If Americans are to be ruled by sociology, we 
have no need of law schools. There is nothing in a legal background to 
give jurists guidance on the 'correct' social policy," and every judge who 
oversteps himself in this manner should be swiftly censured. "The 
elevation of social engineering above law and self-rule has dire 
implications," says Roberts, noting that it may now be plausible for 
illegal aliens to resist deportation by claiming the rights of citizenship. 
This much is clear: no republic can survive without respect for the rule of 
law. When the personal agendas of powerful men replace objective 
standards, when emotion usurps reason, our God-given rights cease to be 
secure and we can no longer rely on the truth and the law to defend

<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 15, 1996
<br></i><hr><h2>Long-Term Commitment in Bosnia </h2></center><P>

[Will American troops return from Bosnia in 12 months or less -- or will 
they still be there 20 years from now?] 
 <P>
John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation warns that "there are very serious 
questions that need to be answered about the political viability of the 
[Bosnian peace] accord and the effectiveness of the American military 
intervention to implement it." For starters, how realistic is a Bosnian state 
composed of "two separate political entities -- the Bosnian Muslim/Croat 
Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic"? For such a state to be viable, 
says Hillen, "the two separate entities will have to show the most 
extraordinary goodwill and cooperation toward each other, qualities that 
have never been in evidence in Bosnia." Hillen contends that "the accord 
does not address fundamental issues of sovereignty and ethnic self-
determination. Instead, it freezes those unresolved issues in place and 
offers up an elaborate power-sharing agreement for a Bosnian central 
government." 
 <P>
The Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation itself is pretty fragile. "There is 
considerable doubt about the solidarity of this alliance," says Hillen. 
Local support for the peace accord is also tenuous. "All three Bosnian 
Serbs present-at the- Dayton peace talks refused to sign the peace accord, 
and Bosnian Serb leaders denounced the accord within hours of its 
initialing." Among the issues left unsettled by the accord was the question 
of "how to integrate the two (or possibly three) rival armies into one that 
would serve the foreign policies of the central government." With such 
considerations in mind, Hillen concludes that "the United States will 
incur some form of continuing security obligation to Bosnia" far beyond 
its one-year commitment. 
 <P>
"There are also serious questions about the military feasibility of NATO's 
Implementation Force," says John Hillen of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives" have yet to 
be identified. The Bosnian peace implementation plan "strips any 
advantage from American ground forces and places U.S. troops in a 
passive and reactive posture." Despite President Clinton's assertions of a 
limited deployment, "the peace accord opens the door for NATO 
peacekeepers to perform many nation-building activities such as ensuring 
the free movement and resettlement of refugees, aiding humanitarian 
workers, resolving boundary disputes, creating secure conditions for free 
elections, and responding to violence against civilians." 
 <P>
The continuing expansion of peacekeeping duties -- and the perception 
that early withdrawal of U.S. troops could jeopardize the NATO mission 
-- would seem to dictate an extended American presence. "European 
allies have universally condemned President Clinton's proposed timetable 
for American forces in Bosnia," says John Hillen. "President Chirac of 
France has predicted an armed NATO presence that could last up to 20 
years." Clinton knows that the American public would never agree in 
advance to such "a protracted and costly intervention in an area of 
marginal strategic interest," but is counting on our reluctant support for 
his fait accompli. "Once the prestige, blood, and treasure of the United 
States are engaged," the Europeans hope that "the U.S. will have to see 
the intervention through to its conclusion."

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>January 16, 1996<br></i><hr><h2>Foster Facts</h2></center>
<P> 

[There 's something shy about the 1993 death of White House Counsel 
Vincent Foster. Could he have known too much about the scandals 
dogging the President?]
<P>
Investigative reporter Christopher Ruddy has identified numerous 
inconsistencies in the official investigations of Vincent Foster's so-called 
suicide. First, there was no suicide note. Then there was a suicide note, 
only it didn't actually mention suicide or bid farewell to family members. 
The 28 torn pieces of the note were found in a briefcase that had been 
searched at least once already, the note had no fingerprints on it, and 
three handwriting experts have declared it a forgery.
<P>
The condition of the body was odd, to say the least. Ruddy says two 
paramedics observed that the slain White House official appeared to be 
"ready for the coffin,'' with arms and legs neatly arranged and head facing 
straight up. There was less blood than might be expected "from a gunshot 
wound to a living person's head." There was no trace of soil on Foster's 
shoes, as there surely would have been had he walked through dense 
brush to the secluded spot where his-body was found. The FBI found 
carpet fibers all over Foster's clothing, but never bothered to determine 
where or why it had come into contact with carpeting.
<P>
The gun was found in Foster's hand, a rarity for suicides. Nevertheless, 
there were no fingerprints on the weapon, says Ruddy. Although Foster 
supposedly shot himself in the mouth, there was "no visible blood 
splatter" on the gun, the recoil did not "chip or damage teeth," and no 
gunpowder was found on his tongue. No one heard the fatal shot, and the 
fired bullet was "never found, despite exhaustive searches."
<P>
Ruddy says Park Police did not "bother to interview park neighbors or 
regular visitors." They failed to "take statements from all persons found 
in the park." They misrepresented the statement of at least one witness. 
They failed to seal Foster's office and "gave away key crime scene 
evidence, such as his beeper and papers, within hours of his death." They 
neglected to have the gun tested "until one week after" the death was 
ruled a suicide. All of the 35-millimeter crime scene photos have 
disappeared, as have seven Polaroids taken at the scene by a Park Police 
officer. The X-rays mentioned in the autopsy report are also missing.
<P>
During the first official investigation of the Foster death, a witness who 
discovered the body was allegedly badgered by- the FBI "to alter his 
testimony on critical issues." Ruddy says another witness charges that the 
FBI lied in claiming he "could not identify a man he saw in the park." 
Investigators simply ignored the statements of other witnesses "who said 
two men, not Foster, were in and around his car just before the body was 
found." The lead prosecutor in the second official probe "resigned after 
being thwarted" in his efforts to conduct a comprehensive investigation. 
Somebody pretty powerful must not want us to know what really 
happened to Vincent Foster.

Duplantier</a> 
<br>
January 17, 1996<br></i><hr><h2>Musical Madness</h2>
</center>
<P>
["Popular musical messages contribute to an increasingly violent and 
morally bankrupt society. "]
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Focus on the Family 
research manager Robert Waliszewski argues that "musical messages are 
capable of planting dangerous ideas in the minds of young people or 
fueling those which already exist." He provides samples of some of the 
more offensive rap and heavy-metal lyrics and cites documented accounts 
of the violent crimes they've inspired. Although there is much evidence 
that "a strong correlation exists between a steady diet of mayhem and the 
urge to act on it," Waliszewski concedes that "no one knows what the 
cumulative effect will be when a young person consumes a steady diet of 
violent music."
<P>
Musically inspired sexual assaults and murders are just the tip of the 
iceberg. "For every teenager who makes the 6 o'clock news by carrying 
out an act of violence, there are thousands more whose values are being 
fashioned subtly through disturbing musical messages," says 
Waliszewski. "They're learning that demeaning women is not only 
acceptable, but [even] preferable to treating women with respect. They're 
hearing accounts that glorify serial killers and praise drive-by shootings. 
They're being bombarded with the messages that parents and other 
authorities are not worthy of respect; that life revolves around drugs, 
money, and perverse forms of sexual activity -- to be obtained by force, if 
necessary."
<P>
The content of contemporary music is qualitatively different from that of 
even the recent past. "Three decades ago, not one popular song 
encouraged robbery, rape, murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle 
disputes," says Waliszewski. "In today's popular music, all these themes 
can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo. Unfortunately, America's 
streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect this fact. What's more, 
since violent lyrics are a relatively new phenomenon, no one knows the 
results of raising a generation on this type of musical diet. In addition, 
teenagers have greater access to (and are listening to) far more music than 
they have in past generations." Waliszewski notes that, by the end of high 
school, the average teenager has listened to more than 10,000 hours of 
rock music.
<P>
Violent crime increased by over 500 percent during the three decades 
ending in 1990. There may be a host of factors contributing to this social 
pathology, but "violence in the media" is certainly one of them. "Music 
industry insiders often shirk responsibility by saying their music reflects 
society but does not impact it," Waliszewski observes. "Some music 
industry insiders have argued that, as performers and 'actors on the stage,' 
musicians cannot be held responsible for their fans' criminal behavior. 
Their anti-social messages are not to be taken seriously because...they 
don't actually mean what they say."  Such claims are disingenuous at best. 
Whether they know what they're doing or not, the purveyors of this 
madness should be held accountable for the damage they've done to an 
entire generation of young Americans.

<h2>Filth on Film</h2></center><P>

["By the time the average child leaves elementary school, he will have 
witnessed 8,000 murders and i00, 000 other acts of violence on TV."]
<P>
"TV, if used for responsible purposes, can have a positive impact," says 
Focus on the Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "Yet, 
positive television is only a small portion of what America is watching. 
For many, the 'education' received from televised programming can have 
a detrimental effect." Waliszewski cites a 1993 report by the American 
Psychological Association that declared emphatically that "higher levels 
of viewing violence on television are correlated with increased 
acceptance of aggressive attitudes and increased aggressive behavior." 
Surveys of prison inmates imprisoned for violent crimes reveal that as 
many as a third "reported having consciously imitated criminal 
techniques learned from television pro ,rams."
<P>
In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in Us: The Frightening 
Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth, Waliszewski argues 
that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence, and sexualized 
violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its early pioneers," 
adding that "public sentiment would not have embraced the likes of The 
Playboy Channel, MTV, Spice, HBO and Showtime." But ugliness and 
depravity are pervasive on television today, and "TV talk shows are just 
the tip of the iceberg. With its offering of offensive sitcoms, cartoons, 
made-for-TV-movies, film releases and graphic news footage, television 
has sunk to new lows."
<P>
Waliszewski warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to 
those being taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message 
to believe." Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem 
to suggest that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the 
lion's share of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most 
impressionable years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average 
American child graduates [from] high school, he or she will have spent 
nearly 20,000 hours in front of a television" -- nearly twice the amount of 
time spent in school.
<P>
Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood. 
Waliszewski laments the passing of the Production Code, which 
discouraged directors from giving in to their baser instincts. "Since the 
days of silent movies, the power of a motion picture, with its potential to 
negatively impact society, has not gone unnoticed. For that reason, 
industry pioneers drafted a self-regulatory code of ethics in 1930 that 
governed the content of movies," prohibiting films that undermined the 
sanctity of home and marriage, disparaged the clergy, blasphemed, or in 
any way lowered the standards of viewers. That code has long since been 
abandoned.
<P>
Waliszewski concedes that "films do not 'cause' anyone to commit 
destructive acts. However, they can, and do, shape the values of the 
watchers." He notes that films like Natural Born Killers and Menace II 
Society have encouraged numerous impressionable viewers to imitate the 
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there. 
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a 
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws 
and lawkeepers."

["Industry executives claim there is no conclusive evidence  
demonstrating that video game violence affects young people." Recent  
research, however, show that claim is false.] 
 <P>
"In 1990, the National Coalition on Television Violence found that nine  
of 12 research studies on the impact of violent video games on children  
and adolescents reported harmful effects," says Jerry Melchisedeck of  
Focus on the Family. In a new report called Bringing Out the Worst in  
Us: The Frightening Truth About Violence, the Media, and Our Youth,  
Melchisedeck cites research identifying "a short-term relationship  
between playing violent games and increased aggressive behavior in  
younger children." Other research suggests that "the ill effects of video  
games are worse than those of TV because children actively control the  
violence rather than passively view it. In other words, the more children  
practice violent acts, the more likely they are to perform violent acts." 
 <P>
Jerry Melchisedeck says one researcher "reported that 40 out of 47 top  
video games he surveyed centered on violence, and 13 of those contained  
subthemes that emphasized the idea of women as victims." That same  
researcher "concluded that there are no gray areas in the behavior of  
game characters, and that players are rarely required to reflect or make  
contextual judgments." The manufacturers and distributors of violent  
video games resort to the usual dodge to justify their poisonous products.  
They insist they're only giving the customers what they want. "If  
consumer demand is the industry's guiding principle," says Melchisedeck,  
"then the future of video and computer gaming holds products that are  
progressively violent and realistically three-dimensional." 
 <P>
The demand for increasing levels of "realism," if you can call it that, has  
ominous implications. Video games now outsell Hollywood films, and  
that has movie moguls murmuring. Hollywood's getting in on the action,  
developing "interactive" movies that allow gamers gorged on two- 
dimensional gore to immerse themselves in cinematic savagery. 
 <P>
The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only non- 
educational diversion available to them. Electronic mail is another. E- 
mail allows for the uncensored global transfer of words; sound; artistic,  
photographic, and videographic images; and computer software.  
Pornographers and pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse  
possibilities. 
 <P>
"Like the public library, the Internet provides access to volumes of up-to- 
date facts and data," says Jerry Melchisedeck. "Millions use it in the same  
manner as previous generations have referenced hardbound  
encyclopedias. For some, however, the Internet is a means of propagating  
their obscene, often violent, inclinations under the guise of First  
Amendment freedom. Access to this disturbing fare is as easy as a click  
of a button." Melchisedeck warns that "parents must not look to the  
government to protect their children. They must take an active role in  
monitoring the types of information" that the Internet delivers directly  
into their homes.

February 4, 1996
<br></i>

<h2>Idahoans Lead Health Care Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Can you name the two most progressive communities in America? When it comes to innovative approaches to health care, Jersey City, New Jersey and Ada County, Idaho are true trailblazers. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
In 1994, Jersey City, New Jersey became the first local government in 
America to offer its employees the health insurance option of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs). Fewer than 200 of the city's nearly 3,000 
employees signed on at the outset, but even that small number saved Jersey 
City $21,000 in insurance premiums in the first three months that the plan 
was in use. In 1995, Ada County, Idaho followed suit with an MSA-based 
health insurance plan that County Commissioner Gary Glenn says was 
"designed to provide Ada County employees significantly enhanced health 
insurance coverage at a significantly reduced cost to the taxpayer." 
Roughly 170 out of 900 Ada County employees agreed to switch to MSAs, 
saving taxpayers $87,000 a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Providing enhanced coverage at a reduced cost may sound like "voodoo 
economics," but the explanation is simple. MSA plans pay 100 percent of a 
policyholder's health care expenses, but rely on a high deductible to keep 
costs down. The high-deductible policies are much cheaper than traditional 
low-deductible plans. Part of the money saved goes into Medical Savings 
Accounts set up for employees. Workers use the MSAs to pay their minor 
medical bills until they reach the deductible. Because policyholders get to 
keep whatever funds are left in their MSAs at the end of the year, they 
have a strong incentive to dicker with their doctors, to take better care 
of themselves, and to forgo unnecessary tests and treatment. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
An editorial in the Idaho Statesmen last summer described Medical Savings 
Accounts as "a great way to save money, promote lower overall health-care 
costs, and make consumers a more active and equal partner in the health 
equation." An MSA plan "can save money because it encourages workers to 
shop around. Bargain hunters can motivate hospitals and doctors to 
compete," said the newspaper. "As long as medical providers and insurance 
companies are running the show, consumers have little control over cost and 
little incentive to worry about it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ada County Commissioner Gary Glenn thinks the Medical Savings Account is 
"the wave of the future" and takes pride in his county's status as "the 
second public employer in the nation to try this option." An MSA plan "puts 
the patient in charge," says Glenn, who insists that "Americans are as 
capable of making decisions about health care as they are about every other 
product and service they buy." Everyone's a winner with MSAs. "Taxpayers 
win because they will have to pay less to cover their public employees," 
says Glenn. "Employees win because they have the freedom to make their own 
healthcare decisions and maybe save some money in the process. And the 
country wins because it will bring down the cost of health care in 
general."

<h2>Why America Must Cut Immigration </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>"Immigration has been, and can continue to be, in the national interest -- 
if properly regulated." </i></blockquote>
<P> 
The United States issues 675,000 immigrant visas a year. Senator Alan 
Simpson of Wyoming thinks that's far too many. As chairman of the Senate 
Subcommittee on Immigration, Simpson has proposed cutting the number to 
540,000, a 20 percent reduction. "The first and most important reason [for 
reducing immigration] is that the American people desire it," says Simpson. 
If Congress fails to take the initiative on this matter, he argues, "the 
people in the states and local communities of this country will most surely 
take it into their own hands to make the badly needed changes." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason the American people want a reduction in immigration is "to allow 
the historically high flow of immigrants who have entered in the past 
several years to assimilate, to learn English . . . and to become 
integrated into the American economy." Simpson says that Americans "want 
criminal aliens swiftly expelled from this country. They want assurances 
that immigrants will not become a burden on the public welfare system. They 
want to know that American workers, particularly workers and students just 
entering the job market, will have a fair chance at the jobs offered by 
American employers -- and that wages of U.S. workers will not be undercut 
by foreign workers overjoyed to receive a fraction of what Americans earn." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With regard to the immigration of family members, Simpson argues that 
"those opportunities should be reserved for the 'nuclear family' of 
citizens and permanent residents." He argues that "our present policy of 
giving preference to more distant family members . . . leads to the entry 
of in-laws of in-laws and persons who have only the most distant kinship 
relationship to the original immigrants -- or even none at all." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Simpson believes that it is in the national interest to "restrict 
the immigration of unskilled workers, those who would directly compete with 
American workers entering the job market as a result of new limitations on 
the use of public assistance." He contends that "responsible immigration 
reform must also consider the more than one-third of a million Americans" 
who lost their jobs in the past year. "Of particular concern," he says, 
"are Americans who are laid off only to see their former jobs lawfully 
performed by temporary foreign workers.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Senator Alan Simpson's proposed legislation to revise immigration policy is 
based on the following common-sense principles: "Persons who are here 
illegally, particularly criminal aliens, should be quickly removed from the 
country through the reform of our detention and deportation process -- and 
while here should not be able to either work or obtain most forms of public 
assistance. Persons seeking to come legally should be swiftly united with 
their close family members in this country or . . . expeditiously and 
effectively screened so that they may take the jobs for which no qualified 
American is available. Finally, the overall number of immigrants should be 
reduced for at least five years."

<title>Duplantier: Feminists Ignore Successful Women  -- 2/8/96</title>

<h2>Feminists Ignore Successful Women </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>More than six million American women own their own businesses. Yet, for 
some strange reason, you'll never hear a feminist trumpeting these 
triumphs. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
Feminists seem determined to "wave aside the achievements of the individual 
for the collectivist utopia of group success," says Elizabeth Larson in a 
recent issue of The Freeman, a monthly journal published by the Foundation 
for Economic Education. Larson argues that such feminist-supported policies 
as affirmative action are actually detrimental to women. "The American 
working woman pays a high price for the position or promotion she receives 
from affirmative action," says Larson, and that price is "the unspoken 
assumption that she was not the 'best man' for the job." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular instance or not, the 
fact remains that affirmative action tends to make the qualifications of 
all women seem suspect -- with sad, but certain consequences. "Resentment 
against an individual case of hiring by quota ferments into resentment 
against all members of the privileged group," says Larson. Although 
affirmative action is supposed to remedy the effects of discrimination, in 
reality it only perpetuates it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Supporters of affirmative action for women play fast and loose with their 
figures. The so-called wage gap between men and women is "neither as wide 
nor as unbridgeable as it is portrayed," notes Larson. "Once you stop 
lumping all women of all ages in all fields together and using that 
resulting dollar figure as representative of the average American working 
woman, the gap narrows. Comparing the wages of women and men of the same 
age, with similar experience, training, and years of uninterrupted time in 
their field yields a much more optimistic picture of how women fare today." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson says "the gaps that do still exist are likely due to the fewer 
continuous years women have been in the workforce. Women who have never 
interrupted their careers for any reason now earn at least 98 percent as 
much as their male counterparts." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Larson contends that "many feminists labor under assumptions about the 
workplace and the meaning of success that are both unreasonable and 
unrealistic. They seem to believe that making an attempt at her job in and 
of itself guarantees a woman success." It's not that easy, says Larson. 
"Just because a woman wants to be the first female CEO of her company does 
not mean she is entitled to the position, or that if she fails to make it 
that far up the corporate ladder it is someone else's fault. Luck, drive, 
brains, connections, education, and, yes, good looks, can all play a part 
in the promotions any worker -- male, or female -- receives." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are many women who have "genuine, free-market success stories to 
tell," but you won't hear about them from feminists, because that would 
undercut their campaign for government intervention. "An eagerness to rely 
on the government," says Elizabeth Larson, "betrays a lack of confidence in 
women's abilities to achieve financial and personal independence."

<h2>Property Rights Are Under Attack!</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Do Americans really own anything anymore, or is everything we possess just 
on loan to us from the federal government? </i></blockquote>
<P> 
"Mass confiscation [of personal property] has become politically 
fashionable," reports James Bovard in a recent issue of The Freeman, the 
monthly journal of the Foundation for Economic Education. "Politicians and 
the courts have created an overwhelming presumption in favor of the 
government's right to seize control over private land, private homes, 
boats, and cars, and even the cash in people's wallets." Bovard warns that 
government's power to seize private property "directly subjugates citizens 
to the capricious will" of public officials. And those officials don't need 
much of a pretext to justify their actions. Bovard says, "Thousands of 
American citizens are being stripped of their property on the basis of 
rumors and unsubstantiated assertions made by the government's confidential 
informants." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is this the American way? Whatever happened to personal property rights and 
the presumption of innocence? How did we get to this state of affairs? 
"Beginning in 1970, Congress enacted legislation to permit government to 
seize property of Mafia organizations and big-time drug smugglers," 
explains Bovard. More forfeiture laws were enacted as the years went on, 
with the result that "federal agents can now seize private property under 
more than 200 different statutes. From 1985 to 1991, the number of federal 
seizures of property under asset forfeiture laws increased by 1500 
percent." Federal officials lost interest in crime lords and drug kingpins. 
"Unfortunately, the more forfeiture laws legislatures enacted, the less 
attention police seem to pay to major criminals," says Bovard. Today, the 
vast majority of citizens forfeiting their property to the federal 
government under drug laws "are never formally charged with any crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Bovard asserts that nowadays "the mere suspicion of a government official 
is sufficient proof to nullify all claims that a citizen legitimately owns 
his property." He notes that "forfeiture laws are turning some federal 
agents into the modern-day equivalent of horse thieves. Ranchers are being 
victimized by seizures based on allegations of violations of environmental 
laws." By confiscating the vehicles that ranchers use to earn their 
livelihood, federal agents effectively put them out of business. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to the Justice Department's 1992 annual report on asset seizures, 
"No property may be seized unless the government has probable cause to 
believe that it is subject to forfeiture." That sounds good in theory, says 
Bovard, but that's not the way it works. "In reality, government officials 
are seizing people's property based solely on 'hearsay' -- rumor and gossip 
-- from anonymous informants." Bovard considers it more than likely that 
some policemen have "invented anonymous informants to give them a pretext 
to take private property they covet." The old double standard comes into 
play here with a vengeance. "While government agents can use hearsay 
evidence to justify a seizure," says Bovard, "property owners are usually 
prohibited from offering hearsay evidence to support their claims."

<title>Duplantier: Welfare Makes The Problem Worse  -- 2/13/96</title>

<h2>Welfare Makes The Problem Worse</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>Welfare spending in New York City has exacerbated the Big Apple's 
monumental social problems. What's the solution? Surely not more spending!</i></blockquote>
<P> 

"Over the last 30 years, New York City and State have devoted an increasing 
share of their revenues to the most dysfunctional members of society," 
writes Heather MacDonald in the Winter issue of the Manhattan Institute's 
City Journal, "and now social service spending constitutes the largest 
share of both city and state budgets. Yet, as spending grew, so did the 
social problems that spending was supposed to solve." A reasonable person 
might have concluded that throwing more money at the problems would 
probably do more harm than good. The official response, however, was quite 
the opposite. "The government," notes MacDonald, "responding by adding more 
programs." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Heather MacDonald concludes that "New York City's enormous commitment to 
social welfare spending has not stemmed social breakdown." If anything, it 
has made matters worse. "Social service spending has sucked out of the 
private economy capital that could have been used to create jobs, the best 
mechanism for ending poverty," says MacDonald. "But, in response to 
inner-city poverty, welfare advocates call for further social service 
spending, thereby accelerating the flight of business from the city." In 
addition to stifling job creation, welfare programs also discourage the 
formation of traditional families -- which are also a time-tested means of 
overcoming poverty. "The two-parent family is all but extinct in some 
neighborhoods, rendered superfluous by welfare's subsidy for illegitimacy," 
says MacDonald. "The resulting increase in juvenile delinquency, truancy, 
and teen pregnancy brings in more social services, which in turn further 
erode the incentives for personal responsibility." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Social service programs "reward dysfunctional behavior and subordinate the 
well-being of children to dubious ideology," says MacDonald. "Families 
create sound individuals by imposing discipline and moral values on 
children. Even if a government program could do this, these programs do 
not; for years, imposing values has been anathema to social workers, who 
studiously avoid making judgments about the 'life-style choices' of their 
clients." MacDonald argues that social workers confuse "moral deficit with 
material need." The more irresponsible a person is, the more financial 
assistance he receives. "Just as the birth of illegitimate children 
provides the mother with an income, so will deplorable child-rearing bring 
her a benefit." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
These perverse incentives are the direct result of "contemporary social 
worker's refusal to make moral judgments," says Heather MacDonald. "Rather 
than taking children or adults away from destructive environments, the 
reigning service ethic dictates that they remain 'in the community' and 'in 
the family' for treatment." Such wishful thinking ignores the fact that 
"usually there is no real community to go back to. Treating a juvenile 
delinquent in the war-torn environment that produced him does not look like 
a recipe for success." MacDonald argues that, when social workers respond 
to "unsustainable ways of life" as though they were "short-term crises," 
their efforts are doomed to failure.

<title>Duplantier: Implications Of The VMI Court Case -- 2/15/96</title>

<h2>Implications Of The VMI Court Case </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>A Supreme Court decision favoring Attorney General Janet Reno's Justice 
Department in the VMI sex-discrimination case could open up a can of worms. </i></blockquote>
<P> 
For the past 20 years, the Supreme Court has treated sex-discrimination 
cases differently from race-discrimination cases. In race cases, the Court 
applies "strict scrutiny," under the assumption that racial classifications 
are inherently "suspect" and unconstitutional (except, of course, when 
affirmative action is involved). Up till now, the Court has not considered 
gender discrimination to be inherently suspect and has applied what it 
calls "intermediate scrutiny" to cases of this nature. This standard seems 
to have worked well, and there is no evidence that this approach is either 
unworkable or unjust. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As part of its effort to force the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) to 
open its doors to women, the Justice Department under Attorney General 
Janet Reno has asked the Supreme Court to add sex to its list of "suspect 
classes," thereby requiring the Court to apply "strict scrutiny" when 
considering cases involving charges of sex discrimination. Applying strict 
scrutiny to the VMI case would lead not only to the sexual integration of 
VMI, but to the sexual integration of all single-sex colleges. The fact 
that most single-sex colleges are women's colleges poses a dilemma for 
feminists and other politically-correct types. Many have no problem 
advocating the forced integration of men's colleges, but recognize that 
applying such a policy even-handedly would mean the elimination of 
women-only colleges as well. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A Court ruling that strict scrutiny must be applied in gender cases would 
invite lawsuits against every public and private institution in America 
that makes distinctions between men and women. The effect on U.S. Armed 
Forces would be revolutionary. Our military services now provide separate 
facilities for men and women. This would be a no-no under strict scrutiny. 
The strength and endurance standards for men and women in the military are 
now substantially different. How could this be justified under strict 
scrutiny? Leave and discharge policies are different for men and women, 
recognizing pregnancy as a circumstance to be given special consideration. 
Military regulations regarding clothing and personal appearance are 
different for the two sexes. Such distinctions would not be tolerated in an 
irrational world of coercive uniformity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about women's athletic programs at co-ed schools and colleges? Would 
they have to be merged with the men's programs? Would an equal number of 
boys and girls be required for every team? Would they have to share locker 
rooms and showers? Every such consideration raises the specter of a 
thousand lawsuits. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Supreme Court decides to apply strict scrutiny in sex-discrimination 
cases, what will the impact be on homosexual issues such as military 
service, same-sex marriage, and adoption? Will prohibitions against 
government funding of abortion be considered sexist? We would not have to 
ask such questions if the Supreme Court could be trusted to resist the 
temptation of judicial activism.

<h2>Defense Bill Veto</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>President Clinton has demonstrated his commitment to "peacemaking" 
in Bosnia. At the same time, however, he has rejected efforts to provide 
for the defense of the United States.</blockquote></i>

<P>
The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in 
the internal affairs of foreign nations. It does, however, have the 
constitutional responsibility to defend our own country against foreign 
attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.

The federal government has no constitutional authority to intervene in

attack. Nevertheless, as 1995 drew to a close, President Clinton 
committed our government to an unconstitutional intervention in Bosnia 
and then vetoed a bill that would have provided a much-needed missile 
defense for America.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1996 defense authorization bill vetoed by Clinton represented "a 
serious effort to end America's present, absolute vulnerability to missile 
attack," says Frank Gaffney of the Coalition to Defend America. The bill 
would have required that the entire United States be protected against 
missile attack by the year 2003. Clinton's objection to the bill was that it 
would have put American policy "on a collision course with the ABM 
Treaty." That's what it would have done, all right, and it's about time we 
abrogated an outmoded, ill-advised treaty with a country that no longer 
exists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Bipartisan majorities on Capitol Hill recognize that the time has come 
for the American people to be protected against missile attacks from all 
quarters by deployed defensive systems," says Gaffney. "Mr. Clinton, on 
the other hand, believes the American people should not be protected by 
such systems, lest a 1972 treaty that effectively prohibits their 
deployment be jeopardized." This difference of opinion as to whether 
America should be defended or "deliberately left vulnerable, and perhaps 
exposed, to missile attack" could be a defining issue in the 1996 
presidential campaign.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gaffney points out that vetoes of defense authorization bills helped 
decide two previous presidential contests. In 1978, President Jimmy 
Carter vetoed the Pentagon's fiscal 1979 authorization legislation 
because he thought it provided too much money for defense and because 
he objected to several of the projects it authorized. "Ronald Reagan was 
able to use this veto as a prime example of the differences between his 
determination to rebuild America's military and Mr. Carter's refusal to 
do so," recalls Gaffney. Giving that veto symbolic value contributed 
greatly to Reagan's election.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Then, in 1988, President Reagan vetoed the fiscal 1989 defense 
authorization bill on the grounds that it did not provide sufficient 
resources for defense and in particular for anti-missile systems," says 
Gaffney. "This action once again showcased differences between 
Democrats (who then controlled Congress) and Republicans on security 
policy, contributing to the sound drubbing Vice President George Bush 
gave Michael Dukakis in the '88 election."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Clinton's veto of the 1996 defense authorization bill could help 
decide the outcome of the 1996 presidential election, says Gaffney, 
provided the Republican candidates "make the most of it by clearly 
establishing that, if elected, one of their first orders of business will be the prompt deployment of U.S. missile defenses."

<title>Duplantier: MARDI GRAS -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>Mardi Gras</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Today is Mardi Gras in New Orleans. As tractors tow the papier-mache 
and crepe-covered floats of the Rex parade down oak-lined St. Charles 
Avenue to Canal Street, parade-goers of all ages will shout their 
traditional plea to the trinket-laden riders: "Throw me something, 
Mister!"
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone's a beggar on Carnival Day in New Orleans, pandering for 
handouts that come in the form of cast-metal doubloons, strings of 
multicolored beads, and oversized plastic cigars, toothbrushes and other 
oddities. It's a day of self-indulgence, and it's all in fun, but it takes 
hundreds of well-trained policemen, posted at every corner of the six-
mile parade route, to keep the merriment from getting out of hand. As 
much as New Orleanians love their Mardi Gras, you'd be hardpressed to 
find anyone who isn't glad to see it end on Ash Wednesday, the 
beginning of Lent.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine people hanging out in the streets all year long waiting for 
someone to toss them a few freebies, having nothing better to do in the 
meantime other than look for ways to get into trouble. A single day of 
community-wide excess may serve as a relief valve for the pressures that 
build up during the year, but socially-sanctioned self-indulgence on a 
continuing basis makes no sense at all. Yet, that's just what we have with 
our federal welfare system.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation argues that welfare "reduces 
work effort and promotes illegitimacy and poverty-prone single-parent 
families." The government dole is "extremely efficient at replacing self-
sufficiency with dependence, but relatively ineffective in raising incomes 
and eliminating poverty." Welfare is especially detrimental to children -- 
increasing the dropout rate and the unwed pregnancy and delinquency 
rates, and reducing longterm earning potential.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Foreign aid is nothing more than international welfare -- a global, year-
long Carnival -- and the effects are just as harmful. "Not only has the 
U.S. foreign aid program failed to promote economic growth in less 
developed countries, but many recipient countries are worse off because 
of it," say Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, also of the Heritage 
Foundation. They argue that, "instead of helping poor countries lift 
themselves out of poverty, aid often impedes their economic growth 
while damaging their fragile economies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe it's time the federal government took a tip from the City of New 
Orleans. If the politicians in Washington are determined to continue 
offering handouts and encouraging self-destructive behavior, let them 
confine this madness to a single day of the year. Let all the recipients of 
government largesse -- from individual entitlements to corporate 
subsidies to foreign aid -- gather in Washington for an annual one-day 
blowout. Let them jockey for position along the streets of the nation's 
capital as they wait for costumed congressmen to roll past on decorated 
floats. Let them all scream "Throw me something, Mister!" at the top of 
their lungs and fight among themselves for the goodies tossed their way. 
Then they can go home and behave themselves for the rest of the year.

<h2>Crime Decline</h2>


<i><blockquote>
It's an article of faith among liberals that prison sentences are no 
deterrent to criminal behavior, but statistics prove that would-be 
lawbreakers do consider the likelihood of punishment before resorting to 
crime.</blockquote></i>

<P>
Attorney Bruce Fein reports that "punishing and stigmatizing criminals 
is working. Violent crime is tumbling as prison populations swell, chain 
gangs are returning for serious offenders, three-time felons confront 
mandatory life sentences, juveniles are treated as adults for the 
commission of murderous crimes, shame is a growing feature of novel 
punishments, and parole is falling into disrepute."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's the good news, says Fein, in a recent Washington Times editorial. 
"The bad news is that the mass media and so-called penal experts are 
generally displaying fierce resistance to the good news." They don't want 
to relinquish their moral superiority. They can't bear to admit that the 
soft-hearted and fuzzy-headed policies they supported for so many years 
were monumental failures. They refuse to concede that common sense 
really does work. Fein says these superior beings are infatuated with 
rehabilitation programs and committed to fighting "the alleged 'root' 
causes of crime, i.e., poverty, unemployment, malparenting, ill 
education, and discrimination." Ideology keeps them from 
"acknowledging the obvious" and forces them to resort to 
"unconstructive whining" over get-tough policies.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bruce Fein concedes that "violent crime remains intolerably high." But 
the recent decline is "a welcome relief" from the skyrocketing rates of the 
1960s and 1970s. "During those Great Society decades, treatment and 
rehabilitation were [misrepresented] as inexpensive and enlightened 
answers to crime, and criminal behavior was generally blamed on 
societal ills or psychiatric ailments." Fein contends that these misguided 
notions led to lighter sentences for convicted felons, and that such 
leniency served only to embolden the criminally inclined. Gradually, this 
sentimentalized view of the criminal as victim infected the general 
population, undermining the "cultural deterrence of crime" as manifested 
by "ostracism or community debasement of criminals for choosing evil." 
Fein says that such social penalties have a tremendous impact on crime 
and cites Japan as a nation where they continue to be used effectively.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But stiff sentences and societal condemnation are making a comeback. 
"Unforgiving prison terms for felons work to reduce crime because an 
enormous proportion is attributable to recidivism," says Fein. Needless to 
say, repeat offenders commit no crimes while incarcerated. The longer 
they stay in prison, the fewer crimes they commit. Holding criminals 
responsible for their own behavior is back in style. Fading fast is the idea 
that criminals "deserved indulgence and sympathy because their 
depravity was engendered by societal wrongs or imperfections, or the 
happenstance of environmental factors."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fein argues that the "community devastation wrought by such imbecility 
concentrated the minds of ordinary citizens, legislatures, and judges 
wonderfully. No longer are criminals viewed as victims of fate," he says, 
"but as evil creatures who have chosen to indulge their anti-social vices 
and passions; they should be shamed and disgraced."

<h2>Love Canal</h2>


<i><blockquote>
At a recent press conference announcing that the Occidental Chemical 
Corporation had agreed to pay $129 million to clean up toxic waste at 
Love Canal, Attorney General Janet Reno observed that it was only fair 
to expect people to clean up their own mess. She neglected to mention, 
however, that government played a major role in creating this particular 
mess.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Everyone knows that Occidental's predecessor company, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics, buried toxic waste at Love Canal more than 40 
years ago. What they don't know, says Michael Fumento of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, is that "Hooker tried desperately to 
convince the city of Niagara Falls (where Love Canal is located) not to 
build on the site." Citing a 1981 article in Reason magazine, Furnento 
recounts how the Niagara Falls school board "applied massive pressure 
to obtain the land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health 
hazards. Finally, Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar 
bill. It insisted, though, that the land . . . was under no circumstances to 
be excavated."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Niagara Falls ignored that stipulation. "Instead, the city decided to build 
a housing development on the site.... Then it sold the plots to 
unsuspecting home buyers." The fact is that Hooker did not endanger the 
public when it dumped its waste in an undeveloped area. "It was the 
city's choice to bring people" to that location, says Fumento. "The bad 
guy wasn't the big faceless corporation; it was your friendly city 
government."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento notes that "nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmental reporter for the 
local paper began a series of articles telling the people that they were 
sitting on a toxic waste site." Then a feeding frenzy began. "The media 
descended on the town and relayed to the outside world every sneeze, 
every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love Canal 
residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by toxic waste." 
Bureaucrats and politicians saw an opportunity to grandstand. "The EPA 
and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost. Ultimately, tens of millions of dollars were spent evacuating the 
residents."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fumento reports that subsequent studies by state and federal agencies 
"found that Love Canal residents had no more illnesses than would be 
expected in any other area of similar size." Attorney General Janet Reno 
neglected to mention this at the news conference, possibly because more 
than $100 million of the Occidental settlement is going to be 
Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund, which was created in the 
wake of Love Canal hysteria. EPA Administrator Carol Browner used 
the occasion to warn that "Congress is attempting to roll back the 
environmental health protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
That contention is easily refuted, says Fumento. "Since there was never 
any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously Superfund brought no 
protection there."

<h2>Space Academy</h2>


<i><blockquote>
Some day in the not too distant future, you may get to watch your child 
or grandchild graduate from the U.S. Space Academy. On that proud 
day, you can both thank Lt. General Daniel Graham for making that 
opportunity possible.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
Lt. General Daniel Graham had become convinced towards the end of 
his life that U.S. space policy "needed fundamental overhaul. Space had 
become a ravenous consumer of resources when it should have become a 
source of national wealth and a bastion of national security," he 
lamented in his autobiography, Confessions of a Cold Warrior Graham 
recognized that new and emerging technology could "make the 
taxpayers' space investments provide a substantial return," if only the 
government could be persuaded to "open space to the general public and 
the private sector." Advances in technology had "removed the principal 
constraints on the pursuit of practical goals in space, and enabled both 
commercial and government programs that would be well-supported by 
the public."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The commercial exploitation of space is no longer just a dream. If 
Americans want to capitalize on the boundless possibilities, however, we 
must plan accordingly. "No U.S. space policy, however well-formulated, 
can bear fruit without attention to the people who will be called upon to 
carry out the policy," General Graham warned. "Space efforts require a 
constant input of bright and properly educated young people into those 
sectors of government, industry and commerce that deal with space."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Graham knew that generating "enthusiasm for space among young 
people" would be simple enough. "They want to be a part of the grand 
adventure of space activity," he observed. "But, beyond getting them 
excited, we have little advice to give them about how to realize their 
dreams except to advise excelling in one or another hard-science 
discipline." Graham's visionary solution was "a Space Academy along 
the lines of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy where young 
Americans, and perhaps youngsters from other lands, could be steeped in 
the disciplines pertinent to space. They could be graduated with a 
bachelor's degree in space science, ready for employment in the 
aerospace industry, commercial space enterprises, or government civil 
and military space programs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
General Graham envisioned a comprehensive program of space 
scholarship, including disciplines such as "space medicine, space law, 
space diplomacy, space construction, and space literature." He saw "no 
difficulty whatever in establishing a space-oriented curriculum for the 
cadets of a Space Academy meeting all necessary criteria for the 
granting of degrees." He also knew that "the standards for entry into 
such an academy could be set very high and still not accommodate all 
young people who would apply and qualify. A student body with 
computer literacy, technical aptitude, physical fitness and high personal 
standards would be easily assembled, as well as a competent, highly 
motivated faculty." General Graham predicted that "graduates of such a 
Space Academy would be in great demand, and the aspirations of young 
people interested in a career in space-related activity could be channeled 
effectively."

<h2>Organized Crime</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The face of organized crime in America is dramatically changing. " 
The challenge is to defend ourselves against it without giving up the 
freedoms we hold dear.

</blockquote></i>

<P>
"In the 1980s, the government began cracking down on organized 
crime," reports Robert McGarvey in the February issue of the American 
Legion magazine. The results were nothing short of spectacular. 
"Nowadays, the chiefs of the American Mafia . . . are languishing in 
prison, leaving the organizations they left behind in disarray." Their 
sudden departure created an equal employment opportunity for other 
minority gangsters, however, and "literally dozens of ethnic crime 
groups have emerged to fill the void." McGarvey reports that 
"Colombian drug barons earn billions of dollars annually in the United 
States. Japanese gangsters . . . claim a mounting presence in Hawaii, 
along with scattered outposts on the West Coast. Various Mexican 
criminals . . . wreak havoc in U.S. border states."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most menacing of all are the Triad gang of Hong Kong and the so-called 
Russian Mafia. "The Triads' business is heroin," says McGarvey. "Some 
60 percent of the drugs entering the United States are traced to Triad 
sources, primarily Burmese poppy fields that have long been controlled 
by Chinese criminals." The Triads have not neglected to diversify, 
however. Their other interests, according to McGarvey, include 
"extortion, prostitution, international car theft, and their much-
publicized involvement in alien smuggling," the latter netting them more 
than $3 billion a year. McGarvey warns that "the Triads are building 
alliances with U.S. street gangs," whose teenaged members "represent a 
sizable, often coldblooded army that will take on even the most vicious 
jobs."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Russian Mafia, composed of former KGB officers and various gulag 
graduates, "now ranks as one of law enforcement's top priorities," says 
McGarvey. A deputy assistant FBI director recently told Congress that 
the Russian Mafia may soon be "the principal organized crime group in 
the United States." He warns that its members are extremely violent and 
have already linked up with Italian and Colombian comrades in crime. 
The FBI's New York bureau chief reports that he has "transferred agents 
and other scarce resources out of traditional organized crime 
investigations and foreign counterintelligence to concentrate on Russian 
crime."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey asserts that "America's new Russian gangsters also rank as 
perhaps the nation's most versatile criminals." He says that "the most 
fearsome aspect of the Russian Mafia is its access to the ill-guarded 
military warehouses of the old USSR. This makes the 'Moscow mob' 
instant leaders on the international arms black market, where they sell 
everything from automatic weapons to rocket launchers. Russian thugs 
even are alleged to be dealing in weapons-grade radioactive materiel."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
McGarvey worries that "U.S. law enforcement currently is ill-equipped 
to battle groups like the Triads and the Russian Mafia." We should be 
concerned about the damage to our society from "corruption, violence, 
and wholesale theft," but we should never sacrifice our democratic 
freedoms in the fight against internal enemies.

<title>Duplantier: UNION TACTICS -- 2/27/96</title>

<h2>Union Tactics</h2>


<i><blockquote>
"The purpose of all cartels is to raise prices above competitive levels and 
to redistribute income from consumers to cartel members. When unions 
successfully raise the price of labor above free-market levels, much of the 
employers' higher labor costs are passed on to consumers."
</blockquote></i>

<P>
Trade unions have often been described as "cartels of workers which 
collude to push their wages above free-market levels," observes Thomas 
DiLorenzo in a recent issue of The Freeman, the monthly journal of the 
Foundation for Economic Education. "Competition and the entry of new 
(and lower-priced) competitors are the bane of all cartels." That's why 
unions strive "to block competition from nonunion workers through 
special-interest legislation and regulation, and by committing acts of 
violence and intimidation against nonunion workers."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Warehouse clubs, hypermarkets, and nonunion chains make grocery 
union organizers see red. The avowed objective of these organizers is "to 
either raise the prices of nonunion grocery stores or drive those stores 
into bankruptcy." DiLorenzo observes that "driving one's competitors out 
of business may be good for aspiring monopolists, but is bad for 
consumers and those workers" whose companies are targeted for 
destruction. "Low-income Americans will be hurt the most, as they 
always are when prices rise." With their typically low profit margins, 
grocery chains are especially vulnerable to "union harassment 
campaigns."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The preferred tactic among grocery union organizers is pressuring a 
company "to accept a union without ever permitting its employees to vote 
on whether or not they want a union," says DiLorenzo. "This is a stark 
admission that, at least in the grocery industry, unionization cannot 
succeed if employees are allowed to vote on whether or not they want a 
union. Extortion has replaced organizing." Unable to win a fair election, 
union organizers "intimidate and threaten to extort employers until they 
sign a contract with the union without holding a union certification 
election."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
DiLorenzo contends that the "flexible labor relations" essential to a 
company's efficiency are "rarely -- if ever -- found in unionized firms. 
Rigid job descriptions and restrictive work practices ratchet up costs and 
prices at unionized grocery chains, all to the detriment of the consumer. 
These higher costs and prices also threaten the job security of unionized 
employees who work for uncompetitive businesses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The American workplace is "awash in regulations, most of which are 
impossible for mere humans to understand, let alone comply with." 
Unions have "taken advantage of this fact to impose regulatory costs on 
nonunion firms." DiLorenzo says that "regulation is so out of control that 
any business person in America, at any one time, is most certainly 
'guilty' of noncompliance with at least some regulations." He charges 
that unions "use regulation as a tool for extorting 'concessions' from 
nonunion employers, [including] recognition of the union without a 
representation election." DiLorenzo concludes that "deregulation of labor 
relations -- and of the economy in general -- is sorely needed if the 
American economy is to prosper."

<h2>Demise of the Home Economy
</h2>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The industrial revolution created material prosperity in America, but in 
the process it also destroyed the traditional household economy. Did we 
lose more than we gained?
</I></blockquote>
<P>

"Before 1840, the vast majority of Americans -- over 90 percent -- lived 
on farms or in small villages: the life of the cottage," observes Allan 
Carlson of the Rockford Institute in the February issue of The Family in 
America. "While many adults had a specialized trade, most households 
aimed at -- and commonly achieved -- self-sufficiency in food, clothing, 
and other essentials." Children were an integral part of this home-based 
economy. "By age five, children were active participants in the work of 
the household, as were elderly or unmarried kin. Husbands and wives 
were bound together in a partnership of home-centered work," notes 
Carlson. "Family loyalties rested not only on love and emotional 
companionship, but also on need: wife and husband, child and parent 
were intertwined."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Carlson contends that this traditional home-based economy "began to 
change, about 1840, as industrialists harnessed the logic of the division 
of labor to the steam engine and to finance capital. The results included 
a considerable increase in productive efficiency; an accelerated output of 
goods such as wheels, shoes, and clothing; and a sharp lowering of their 
costs relative to the work of cobblers, tailors, smiths, and other displaced 
craftsmen. Decentralized, small, family-held enterprises gave way to 
large, centralized, joint-stock, limited-liability firms."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most important, this dramatic change was what made high taxes 
and Big Government possible. "Although families could now purchase 
an array of cheaper consumer goods, the price this new freedom exacted 
was the surrender of productive family functions such as candlemaking, 
food processing, and weaving to the industrial sphere. It also meant 
moving the family production of goods, normally uncounted, into a cash 
nexus, where it would be counted and transformed into profit (and, later, 
into taxes as well)." Carlson charges that "the immediate interest of 
employers lay in keeping wages low and the pool of potential workers 
large. Wives, husbands, and children competed against each other in the 
sale of their labor, driving wages downward, to the level of individual 
subsistence."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stifling of the productivity of the home had drastic ramifications. "In 
this new order, the home became separated from the factory and the 
office, a revolutionary shift in living patterns. People now worked in one 
place . . . and slept in another," Carlson observes. "With mothers and 
fathers pulled out of the 'cottage,' the care of children became a social 
question; again, something altogether new in human affairs. Time for 
tending the cottage garden or the family cow disappeared, and families 
were forced to enter the market to buy all of their food. In general terms, 
the ownership of productive property such as land and tools gave way to 
a reliance on cash wages and factory-produced goods. Economic loyalties 
were no longer rooted in family relationships, but increasingly owed to 
the employing firm."

<h2>
Revival of the Home Economy
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>More than a million American children are now schooled at home. If 
present trends continue, homeschooling may one day become the 
preferred method of education in America, as it was before 1840.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>

The modern social-welfare state arose in the hundred years between 
1840 and 1940, assuming "nurturing functions that had throughout 
human history belonged to the family. The first and most important of 
these was education," writes Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute in 
the February issue of The Family in America. "Beginning in the 1840s, 
in the same time and place as early industrialization, the common school 
movement, backed by compulsory education laws, took children out of 
the home for moral and practical training."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The social-welfare state soon "captured other family functions as well," 
says Carlson. "Reform schools, the 'child saving' movement, the 
juvenile-justice system, and the vast child abuse and neglect apparatus 
all grew." Even child labor laws "further expanded the modern state's 
socialization of children's time." State-funded pension programs "erased 
other basic features of the family economy: security between the 
generations and care of the ill and infirm. Until modern times, grown 
children and other relatives provided security and support to elderly 
persons, particularly the indigent and the invalid. Adults bore an 
obligation, moral as well as social and legal, to care for their own; they 
also knew that their security might depend someday on the children they 
had reared and on the example they had set in giving care to their own 
parents. New systems of state pensions and health insurance shattered 
these security bonds between the generations of a family."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Allan Carlson contends that the growing homeschooling movement 
began in the 1970s as a reaction to "specific events -- federal efforts to 
regulate public and parochial education, Supreme Court decisions 
blessing the sexual revolution, the breakdown of discipline and standards 
in local schools, the appearance of books . . . encouraging a radical break 
with existing patterns of learning." These events, he says, "inspired a 
critical mass of pioneers to bring their children home. They soon 
discovered that, indeed, there's no place like home for the education of 
their children. These pioneer families also found that the nature of their 
family relationships changed, almost overnight. No longer mere 
consumers sharing the same roof and television set, they had become 
members of a learning enterprise who needed each other and who 
profited -- morally and practically -- from each other."


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The pioneers of homeschooling made other pleasant discoveries. "Most 
of these families began to find ways to bring other functions home as 
well -- gardening, food preservation, or a family business -- and they 
tasted the satisfactions of an independence unknown to several American 
generations." Carlson argues that homeschooling "is the most promising 
effort at family institutional reconstruction undertaken in America 
during the last 150 years. The family, born to and naturally residing in 
the symbolic 'cottage,' then uprooted and ravaged by factory and state, 
has found a path back to its true home."

<h2>
Origins of the Income Tax 
</h2>


<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>

We've heard a lot of talk in recent months 
about the many benefits of 
the flat-rate income tax, but we rarely hear anything about the marvelous 
federal income tax we used to have -- none at all!

</I></BLOCKQUOTE><p>



In 1862, the year preceding his famous Emancipation Proclamation, 
President Abraham Lincoln inaugurated America's first income tax law, 
styling it an "excise tax" to circumvent the prohibition against direct 
taxation found in Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. 
Within two years he had opted for a graduated income tax, summarily 
rejecting the principle of equality under the law which had prevailed in 
America until that time. It was only as a temporary measure that 
Lincoln's income tax achieved passage. Despite efforts to extend it, the 
tax lapsed in 1872, two years after its prescribed expiration. But the 
appetite of politicians and their bosses for an unlimited source of revenue 
and power had been whetted, and the freedom that Americans had 
enjoyed for less than a century would soon be imperiled again.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt sought unsuccessfully to have 
Congress enact an income tax law. In the first year of the administration 
that followed, however, President William Howard Taft acquiesced in 
the passage of a tariff bill with a rider providing for the taxation of 
corporation incomes. He also agreed to a resolution calling for a 
constitutional amendment to establish an income tax. On February 
3,1913, the State Department certified 38 states as having ratified the 
amendment. Only 36 of the 48 states then in the union were needed for 
ratification, but in recent years scholars have discovered evidence that no 
more than 27 states ratified the amendment in the prescribed manner. 
Properly ratified or not, the Sixteenth Amendment has had the full force 
of law for more than 80 years now. Indeed, this assault on the very 
liberties that the Constitution was designed to safeguard has been 
enforced more zealously than any law, constitutional or statutory, in all 
of American history.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Sixteenth Amendment empowered the federal government "to lay 
and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without 
apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any 
census or enumeration." It also had the effect of diminishing at least 
three of the rights guaranteed by previous amendments to the 
Constitution: the right to due process in the Fifth Amendment; the right 
of the States and the people to retain all powers not expressly delegated 
to the Federal Government in the Tenth Amendment, and the right to be 
free from involuntary servitude, as protected by the Thirteenth 
Amendment.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Flat tax advocates abound nowadays, but it's hard to find any supporters 
of the tax system our Founding Fathers devised. Why is that? Could it be 
that powerful groups in our society have a vested interest in maintaining 
the peculiar institution of the income tax?

<title>Duplantier: "Conservative" Clinton  -- 03/04/96</title>

<h2>
Conservative Clinton
</h2>

<P>  
<blockquote><i>"The era of big government is over. We know big government does not have all the answers. There is not a program for every problem."</i></blockquote> 
<P>
  
Who was that man who gave the 1996 State of the Union address? He  
looked like Bill Clinton, but he sounded like Ronald Reagan -- until he got  
down to particulars. Then the New Democrat turned back into an Old  
Democrat, and we found out that the era of big government isn't over after  
all, but just playing possum. President Clinton thinks that big government  
still has all the answers, and a program for every problem. Unfortunately,  
the answers are wrong, and the programs just make the problems worse. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton still wants to socialize the health care industry -- the  
biggest big-government power grab in decades! In a fit of false  
compassion, he would force actuaries to ignore the hard reality of risk and  
insure the uninsurable, thereby bankrupting yet another vital American  
industry. The President wants to expand federal authority by calling for  
"community partnerships with local police forces" and the investigation of  
local gangs by federal agencies. He declared that "we must end the deadly  
scourge of domestic violence." But whom did he mean by we? Big  
government, of course. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The President insisted that "every classroom in America must be connected  
to the information superhighway, with computers, good software, and well- 
trained teachers." But who's going to do the connecting? And who's going  
to pay for this "technology initiative"? Why, a "national partnership," of  
course. That's another pretext for federal intervention in areas reserved to  
the states by our U.S. Constitution! Clinton wants local schools to adopt  
"national standards," but the federal government has neither the authority  
to establish such standards, nor the integrity to resist politicizing them.  
Clinton called for more federal spending for his national service program,  
cash grants to top high school graduates, expansion of the student loan  
program, and a so-called "GI Bill for America's Workers." That doesn't  
sound like cutting back big government. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



President Clinton also called for more taxpayer spending for "drug  
education," even though the $2 billion of federal funds squandered so far  
have had no measurable impact on drug abuse. He asserted that all schools  
should teach "character education: good values and good citizenship." Will  
the federal government establish national character standards, too? Will  
these standards be as far removed from right reason and reality as were the  
outrageous U.S. History Standards? Doesn't Bill Clinton know that the best  
way to teach values is by example? The President even went so far as to  
recommend uniforms for schoolchildren. The era of big government is  
clearly not over when the nation's chief executive officer is preoccupied  
with such local concerns. 
 

 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



No, the era of big government is not over yet, but the era of defending it  
certainly is. Bill Clinton's desperate bid to recast himself as a conservative  
is a tacit admission that liberalism is philosophically bankrupt.

<h2> Reading Experts Speak Out 
</h2>


<P><blockquote><i> When the Massachusetts Commissioner of Education invited public  
comment on proposed curriculum reforms for state schools, he did not  
anticipate a critique from 40 of the nation's top linguistic experts. 
</i></blockquote><P> 

Last July, Massachusetts Commissioner of Education Dr. Robert Antonucci  
received a letter signed by 40 linguistic experts, expressing their dismay  
that the state's new standards for the teaching of reading in public schools  
give an uncritical endorsement to the Whole Language method. In a cover  
letter, linguistics professor David Pesetsky and neurologist Dr. Janis  
Melvold identified themselves and their 38 co-signers as "experts on  
language and reading" hailing from "seven Massachusetts institutions,"  
their ranks including "three members of the National Academy of  
Sciences, four presidents of the Linguistic Society of America, three  
directors of major research training programs, and the authors of two of the  
leading books on language for the general public." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold pointed out that the Whole Language approach is  
"widely blamed for serious declines in reading achievement" in other  
states, and speculated that "the recent decline in Massachusetts could be  
connected to the increased use of Whole Language methodology." They  
warned that the proposed new standards "point in exactly the wrong  
direction -- away from a curriculum that takes linguistic realities into  
account, and towards methods that have failed elsewhere." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Pesetsky and Melvold offered Dr. Antonucci a brief introduction to reading  
theory. "Written language is a way of notating speech," they explained in  
their letter to the education commissioner. "To become a skilled reader, a  
learner must master this notation system, learning how the sounds and oral  
gestures of language correspond to letters and letter groups." In other  
words, a mastery of phonics is "fundamental to reading." The state's  
proposed new standards, however, downplay the importance of phonics,  
encourage unproven "strategies" such as guessing, and reject systematic  
instruction. In this respect, they "closely mirror the popular but  
increasingly criticized approach known as 'Whole Language.'"

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The accompanying letter, signed by all 40 linguistic experts, challenged  
the "scientifically unfounded views of language" that characterize the new  
standards for reading instruction. These nationally recognized "experts on  
language and reading" charged that "the common-sense view of reading as  
the decoding of notated speech" was being rejected in favor of "a surprising  
view of reading as directly 'constructing meaning." "The importance of  
'decoding' was being played down in favor of strategies such as contextual  
guessing." Such an approach ignores "the most important property of  
written English," the alphabet! 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
The experts insisted that "the view of language research" manifested in the  
proposed reforms "is inaccurate." They expressed their dismay that the  
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in setting school standards, would  
"presume to legislate an erroneous view of how human language works, a  
view that runs counter to most of the major scientific results of more than  
100 years of linguistics and psycholinguistics. We are even more  
concerned," they added, "that uninformed thinking about language should  
lie at the heart of a 'standards' document for Massachusetts schools."

<h2>
Broadcasting for Freedom
</h2>



<P>  <blockquote><i>

 
The Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were  
instrumental in the collapse of Communism in Europe. So, why aren't we  
broadcasting the blessings of  liberty to the Communist countries of East  
Asia? 
 

</i></blockquote><P>


Lech Walensa and other veterans of the fight against Communist  
oppression in Eastern Europe have testified to the tremendous contribution  
that Radio Free Europe made to their struggle. Radio Free Europe's impact  
on the rise of the Solidarity union in Poland "cannot even be described,"  
said Walensa in a 1989 interview. "Would there be earth without the sun?"  
he asked rhetorically. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
"Broadcasting can be one of the most effective and economical components  
of America's diplomatic and military efforts," says James Tyson, president  
of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. The $350 million currently  
allotted for the U.S. government's foreign broadcasting effort is a small  
fraction of the $250 billion annual defense budget. Ironically, the Voice of  
America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty were so effective in  
bringing the message of freedom to the captive nations of the world that  
many of our elected of officials have concluded that they are no longer  
necessary. "Following the collapse of communism in Europe, Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty have been drastically downsized," says Tyson.  
The rush to cut back on such effective programs may prove to have been  
premature, especially if the resurgence of hardliners in Russia continues  
unchecked. "It is unfortunate," he says, "that Radio Liberty is becoming  
ineffective" just as Russia may be slipping back into dictatorship. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Even if the situation in Russia does stabilize, there will still be 1.4 billion  
people suffering under brutal Communist governments in China, North  
Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Tyson argues that our broadcasting  
efforts should be focused on the Far East. "China is the largest and most  
dangerous nation in the world today," he observes. "More than a million  
people are confined in its slave labor camps. With its massive increase in  
arms -- including long-range missiles and atomic, chemical, and biological  
weapons -- the regime represents a threat to all its neighbors." Tyson says  
recent emigres report a growing hunger among the common people in  
China for accurate news about what is really going on in their own  
country. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



 
A proposal to establish a Radio Free Asia broadcasting service was under  
consideration for several years, says Tyson, who served in 1992 on the  
Presidential Commission on Broadcasting to Asia. But it wasn't until 1995  
that Congress finally appropriated $10 million in start-up funds. Tyson  
contends that Radio Free Asia is "one of the most cost-effective policies we  
could follow," and estimates that an annual budget of $30 million would be  
sufficient to sustain the service. This would be money well spent. "If Radio  
Free Asia could accelerate the democratization of China as Radio Free  
Europe and Radio Liberty did in the Soviet bloc," says Tyson, "it would  
result in huge savings in our defense budget."

<h2>
Religion in America
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i> Millions of Americans are enjoying better health and happier lives than  
they ever imagined, and you can too, once you know the secret. </i></blockquote>
<P> 

Are you suffering from high blood pressure? Does someone in your family  
show signs of depression or substance abuse? Has the fire gone out of your  
married life? Don't despair. Now there's a fast, safe, and simple way to  
overcome these problems -- and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. Sound  
too good to be true? Well, it's not.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


 
Patrick Fagan of the Heritage Foundation reveals that going to church is  
the secret to better health and a happier life. In a new report called Why  
Religion Matters, Fagan argues that religious practice "strengthens  
individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. It significantly  
affects educational and job attainment and reduces the incidence of such  
major social problems as out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol  
addiction, crime, and delinquency." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
Research indicates that church attendance and good cheer go together.  
"Happiness is greater and psychological stress is lower for those who  
attend religious services regularly," notes Fagan. Less stress means better  
health, of course, but the benefits don't stop there. Church attendance also  
leads to happier, longer-lasting marriages. "Regular church attendance is  
the critical factor in marital stability," says Fagan. Even among those who  
have separated from their partners, "reconciliation rates are higher among  
regular church attendees." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But wait, there's more. "One of the most powerful of all factors in  
preventing out-of-wedlock births is the regular practice of religious belief,  
[which] sharply reduces the incidence of premarital intercourse. The  
reverse is also true," says Fagan. "The absence of religious practice  
accompanies sexual permissiveness and premarital sex." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Still not convinced? What if we told you that "alcohol abuse is 300 percent  
higher among those who do not attend church"? It's true. Not only that, but  
"alcoholics with a religious background or strong religious beliefs are  
much more likely to seek help and treatment." What about suicide? "The  
practice of religion reduces the rate of suicide," says Fagan, more  
effectively than anything else. "Those who attend church frequently are  
four times less likely to commit suicide than those who never attend."  
Church attendance also reduces the incidence of depression, before it can  
lead to suicide. Adolescents are particularly at risk for depression, but they  
"tend to experience fewer anxieties of growing up if they are religious." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




Patrick Fagan concludes that "regular religious practice is both an  
individual and social good. It is a powerful answer to many of our most  
significant social problems." Going to church is "good for individuals,  
families, states, and the nation. It improves health, learning, economic  
well-being, self-control, self-esteem, and empathy. It reduces the incidence  
of social pathologies, such as out-of-wedlock births, crime, delinquency,  
drug and alcohol addiction, health problems, anxieties, and prejudices."  
So, don't delay. Take advantage of this amazing opportunity now. For a  
happier, healthier life, go to church regularly.

<h2>The Future of Education

</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>    
The political correctness movement has captured America's universities, and the NEA dominates our    
public school system. But students won't have to learn in lock step much longer, because the technological    
revolution will soon make these institutions of indoctrination obsolete.</i></blockquote>
<p>    
    
Years ago, many Americans got their education from correspondence courses. Now, an enterprising outfit    
in Springfield, Virginia has updated the concept for the '90s. The Teaching Company offers more than 60    
college-level courses on audio and video cassettes. One of their more popular offerings is a 70-part series    
of 45-minute lectures entitled The Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition. Two well-known    
and respected scholars from prestigious Ivy League universities deliver most of the lectures, with four    
other "superstar teachers" supplying the balance. "The result," according to a full-page advertisement in a    
popular weekly magazine, "is a definitive survey of Western thought by an all-star teaching team with no    
equal in lecturing skill at any single college campus anywhere in the world."    



  



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


  
What could be better than access to "an all-star teaching team" on videocassettes at a fraction of the cost    
of college tuition? How about a give-and-take between you and a noted scholar in the privacy of your own    
home? That's available now, too -- thanks to Bob Jones University and something called the Live    
Interactive Network Classroom, or LINC for short. The Live Interactive Network Classroom can be in    
your living room or in a traditional schoolroom -- or in any other private or public facility. No matter    
where you are, you'll receive daily satellite transmissions from a teacher in a television studio -- a teacher    
you can see and hear and speak to, as can any other student anywhere in the country who happens to be    
participating in the same class.



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


     
    
Who's the intended target of this satellite schooling service? Surely not the nation's elite. "The wealthy    
will always be able to afford the best private education," writes syndicated columnist Cal Thomas. In a    
recent column describing the Live Interactive Network Classroom, Thomas argues that LINC "can free the    
middle class, and especially the poor, from their bondage to government schools. As an all-in-one    
resource, it can maintain the highest standards in foreign languages, math, and science, as well as    
advanced subjects, such as physics, that are not always available in private education." Cal Thomas    
predicts that LINC "could eventually allow all parents the freedom to choose what they believe is best for    
their children, at a reasonable price, and without the indoctrination that passes for education in the current    
intellectually and spiritually closed system" that all taxpayers must subsidize whether they want to or not. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

   
    
If the Teaching Company and the Live Interactive Network Classroom developed by Bob Jones University    
are any indication of what education will be like in the future, American students have every reason to    
rejoice. American educators, on the other hand, had better start looking for new jobs.

<h2>
Free Trade Follies
</h2>

<blockquote><i>
Did you think that the breakup of the Soviet Union and the liberation of the  
Captive Nations of Europe had tolled the death knell  for socialism? Well,  
one trade expert predicts that international treaties such as NAFTA and  
GATT will ultimately destroy the middle classes throughout the world and  
lead to a resurgence of the welfare state. 
 </blockquote></i>

<P>  

The World Trade Organization, created by the General Agreement on  
Tariffs and Trade, is now in operation. Its first major act was to order the  
United States to change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face  
sanctions by the international community. The governments of Venezuela  
and Brazil had appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the  
U.S. to accept their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental  
standards. Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations  
regarding gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation"  
trade sanctions. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This ruling is an omen of things to come, predicts William Gill of the  
American Coalition for Competitive Trade. Gill and his group were the  
first to warn that the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as  
NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as  
GATT) "were the first big steps toward a world government that would rob  
America of our cherished independence as a nation." NAFTA and GATT  
threaten our prosperity as well as our sovereignty. Gill says nine million  
jobs "have been lost in the corporate downsizing" of the 1990s, one million  
of which are "directly attributable to NAFTA." 
 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The damage doesn't end there. NAFTA "and other free trade efforts to  
erase all national borders" have unleashed an invasion of illegal drugs and  
illegal aliens into the United States. Infectious diseases are also entering  
our country at increasing rates. "The death rate from this invidious source  
rose . . .58 percent between 1980 and 1992," observes Gill, who describes  
this 12-year period as an "era when trade tore down virtually all the  
traditional defenses of our borders." 
 




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ironically, NAFTA has not done our neighbors south of the border any  
good either. Gill reports that "the middle class in Mexico is being wiped  
out, joining the hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmers driven off their  
land by NAFTA in the tragic trek downhill into abysmal poverty and  
despair." He warns that "free trade is sowing the seeds of revolution"  
throughout the world. "There have already been uprisings in Mexico and  
violent strikes in France," Gill observes, and this is only the beginning. He  
predicts that the unrest will rise, resulting in "a worldwide resurgence of  
socialism as the chaos caused by open borders forces governments into  
restoring and expanding welfare programs for the poor." The American  
Coalition for Competitive Trade intends to keep publicizing the defects of  
NAFTA and GATT and other free trade follies until public opinion finally  
forces our government to repudiate what William Gill calls an "insane  
policy that is strangling America."

<h2>
Whole Language Supporter Recants
</h2>
<Blockquote><i>

If a child hasn't learned to read by the end of the first grade, he's been  
cheated, and the odds are that he'11 never achieve his true potential.</blockquote></i>

<P>   
Bill Honig was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California  
from 1983 to 1993. During that decade, he presided over a school system  
that threw out many of the proven pedagogical approaches of the past. The  
test scores for California's public school students plummeted as a direct  
result of this ill-advised change in direction. That's the bad news. The good  
news is that Bill Honig learned from this needless disaster, and maybe his  
testimony will help keep other superintendents of education from making  
the same mistake. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bill Honig has written a book called Teaching Our Children to Read. In it,  
he emphasizes that educators must ensure that all schoolchildren are  
"reading beginning books by mid-first grade" and be prepared to resort to  
"organized intervention" for those who aren't. Children who are not  
beginning to read by this point, says Honig, "almost never recover." To  
read successfully, children must learn how to break words into their  
smallest "sound chunks. " In other words, they must master phonics. Honig  
argues that "the amount of time a student is engaged in phonics instruction  
is highly predictive of subsequent reading achievement." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The former state superintendent of education does not acknowledge his  
own mistake in allowing the destructive Whole Language method to  
become entrenched in state schools during his tenure. Nevertheless, he  
asserts emphatically that children will learn to read only if they are taught  
to sound out the syllables of the English language and put them together  
like building blocks -- not by using pictures to guess at words, as  
recommended by Whole Language advocates. Honig explains that "bad  
habits of guessing" make learning to read much more difficult, and argues  
that "beginning readers who rely too heavily on contextual clues, such as  
pictures or the connection of other words in the passage, are distracted  
from looking at the letters in a word and connecting those letter patterns to  
words in their minds."<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Honig's rejection of the Whole Language approach should have  
tremendous impact on his colleagues throughout the country because of the  
prestigious position Honig once held in California. Unfortunately, the  
ineffective Whole Language approach to reading has driven phonics out of  
most of our nation's school systems. Honig reports that "very few  
instructional programs currently in use provide children with materials  
designed specifically to connect with systematic and sequenced skills  
development. In some cases," he says, "state, county, district, or university  
leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills components and  
discourage phonics teaching." Maybe Bill Honig's new book will persuade  
some of these ideologues to take an honest look at the damage they're  
doing with the Whole Language approach. Maybe some of them will  
resolve to teach America's schoolchildren how to read the right way --  
using the proven method of systematic phonics.

<h2>
Self-Reliance
</h2><blockquote><i>

If displaced workers spent as much time looking for new jobs as they do complaining about having lost  
their old ones, they'd find themselves employed again much faster. 

</blockquote></i>
<P> 
Bill Prince was merchandising director for Frito-Lay in Dallas from 1959 to 1966, a period during which  
sales skyrocketed from $50 million a year to $325 million. When Frito-Lay merged with Pepsi Cola,  
however, Bill resigned to start his own food company. Despite an enormous personal investment of time,  
money, and his own considerable experience, the company failed, and Bill was obliged to start all over  
again. 
 

 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
It wasn't the first time he'd been in that predicament, nor would it be the last. Much like Sisyphus, the  
character in Greek mythology whose fate it was forever to roll a giant rock up a steep hill only to have it  
roll down again every time he reached the top, Bill knew from personal experience that life is a series of  
challenges. Whether you succeed or fail in any given challenge, there's always another giant rock waiting  
to be rolled up another steep hill. 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill Prince worked ceaselessly throughout his life, in a wide variety of occupations. Over the course of a  
50-year career, he was never unemployed for more than a month at a time. "Some of the time, my income  
was in the top five percent, but not always," Bill recalls, "because I took any job I could get when I needed  
work." 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bill notes that in recent years many companies have had to downsize in order to survive. This trend has  
been accompanied by increasing numbers of people "complaining about those mean, nasty, uncaring  
corporations and businesses who fire good and loyal workers." Bill wonders if these carpers and grousers  
"really believe" that a company has a lifetime obligation to anyone it hires, "no matter what kind of  
problems the company may have in the future?" He marvels at the attitude so prevalent among displaced  
workers that the government should "do something to save them." They obviously don't understand that  
government intervention is the main reason their jobs have evaporated. Why can't they see, as Bill so  
clearly does, that, "if government had not been passing all those business-busting laws and writing  
harassing, anti-business regulations, they might still have their jobs?" 
 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Whatever happened to individual initiative and enterprise?" Bill asks. "And why do people turn to  
government like they are asking for manna from heaven?" Bill insists that middle-aged managers thrown  
back into the job market have no one but themselves to blame if they prefer to remain idle rather than  
accept a job they consider beneath them. "Maybe the reason many downsized people are downsized is  
because they simply no longer have the drive, ambition, and creative ability to withstand competition from  
younger, hungrier people," he speculates in the February issue of a monthly newsletter called Bill's  
Soapbox -- written, edited, and published by Bill Prince himself, at the ripe young age of 74!

<h2>
Myths About Crime
</h2>
<blockquote><i>
  
False ideas can have tragic consequences, say two respected criminologists, who argue that false ideas   
about crime have made the crime problem worse.  
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<P>  
 
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers,   
lobbyists, journalists, and judges has perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in   
the United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly   
Myths About Crime and Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice: The   
Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and DiIulio argue that "the consequences of these false   
ideas have been quite tragic indeed." They've made it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and they've   
concentrated crime "in economically distressed inner-city neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators   
of these areas to repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most enduring myths about crime in the United States is that it is caused by poverty. Logan and   
DiIulio report that many academic criminologists believe the myth that "capitalism produces pockets of   
poverty, inequality, and unemployment, which then foster crime. The solution [according to this view] is   
government intervention to provide jobs, stimulate the economy, and reduce poverty and other social ills."   
The truth, as it turns out, is quite the opposite. Poverty does not cause crime; crime, on the other hand,   
does cause poverty.  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Logan and DiIulio note that "inner city areas where crime is rampant have tremendous potential for   
economic growth, given their infrastructure of railways, highways, electric power, water systems, and   
large supply of available labor. There is every reason for these areas to be wealthy," they say, "and, indeed,   
many of them have been rich in the past. But crime takes a terrible toll on physical, fiscal, and human   
capital, making it difficult to accumulate wealth and break out of the cycle of poverty. Criminals steal and   
destroy property, drive away customers and investors, reduce property values, and depreciate the quality of   
life in a neighborhood. Businesses close and working families move away, leaving behind a vacuum of   
opportunity." Inner cities need "physical protection and security" to make them viable again; instead, they   
get "economic intervention."  
  


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;



Another myth about crime in the United States is that prisons are filled with "petty offenders who should   
not be there." Logan and DiIulio say it isn't so. They cite data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics   
showing that "U.S. prison populations consist overwhelmingly of violent and repeat offenders."  
  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A third myth concerns the physical conditions within our nation's prisons. "There are two popular and   
competing images of American prisons," report Logan and Dilulio. "In one image, all or most prisons are   
hell holes. In the other image, all or most prisons are country clubs. Each image fits some prisons," they   
concede. "But the vast majority of prisons in the U.S. today are neither hell holes nor country clubs." They   
are what they're supposed to be: an effective means for isolating and punishing the criminal element.

<h2>
The Point of Punishment
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Most Americans believe that our criminal justice system works pretty well,  
and that punishments meted out to criminals generally fit the crime. Some  
liberal critics, however, hold a very different view of crime and  
punishment. 
</blockquote></i>
<P>


Some sophisticated liberals believe that "America is an oppressive, racist  
society, and prisons are a none-too-subtle way of subjugating the nation's  
poor and minority populations," say criminologists Charles Logan and  
John Dilulio. In an essay titled "Ten Deadly Myths About Crime and  
Punishment in the U.S.," published in a new book called Criminal Justice:  
The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility, Logan and Dilulio insist  
that "there is simply no empirical evidence to support the view that  
African-Americans, or the members of other racial and ethnic minorities in  
the U.S., are far more likely than whites" to suffer the legal consequences  
of criminal actions. Differences in conviction rates and sentencing, they  
say, are determined by "such mundane factors as the amount of evidence  
against a defendant, and whether or not a credible eyewitness testified." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Logan and Ditulio also rebut the common misconception that our prisons  
are "prohibitively expensive." They contend that "it is morally myopic, and  
conceptually and empirically moronic, to argue that public money spent on  
prisons and prisoners is public money wasted." They concede that, "if the  
typical offender committed only one petty property crime per year, then  
paying thousands and thousands of dollars to keep him confined would be  
a bad social investment. But, if he committed a dozen serious property or  
violent crimes each year, then the social benefits of keeping him  
imprisoned might well exceed the social costs of not doing so." Logan and  
DiIulio cite one study that calculated a "social cost" of $430,000 per year  
for a felon left at large -- roughly twenty times what it costs to keep him  
incarcerated. That figure may be overstated, but the fact remains that it is  
far less expensive for society to imprison a felon than to let him roam free. 



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  
The biggest myth or misconception of all, say Logan and DiIulio, is that  
"punishment itself is inherently wrong. It is largely because they are  
opposed to punishment generally and to imprisonment in particular that  
many people argue so strongly that we must address the root causes of  
crime, that our criminal justice system discriminates, that we are overly  
punitive and haven't considered alternatives, that prisons are too costly and  
overcrowded, and that we must look to the courts for reform." Logan and  
DiIulio see punishment as a positive good, however, one that "affirms  
important moral and cultural values. Legal punishment," they insist, "is a  
legitimate and . . . even a noble aspect of our culture." 
 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
  

Logan and DiIulio reject "the false dichotomy between punishment and  
'humanitarianism."' They argue that punishment, properly and fairly  
applied, is essential to the treatment of people "as human beings, rather  
than as objects. Punishment," they say, "is an affirmation of the autonomy,  
responsibility, and dignity of the individual."

<h2>New-Contract With America</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"How has a nation conceived in liberty and opposition to tyranny arrived    
at a point today where citizens are more fearful of their own government    
threatening their rights than they are of any other government?" A    
firebrand freshman Congressman answers his own question.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
"Americans deeply believe in the principles of America, but they don't    
see [those principles] reflected in their government," observes freshman    
Republican Representative Sam Brownback of Kansas in the March issue    
of Policy Review. ''Americans believe in freedom, democracy, moral    
values, family, community, and free markets," says Brownback. "Yet    
their government seizes their rights without their consent. Government    
has become their master, not their servant. " Brownback is a staunch    
proponent of the three R's: Reducing, Reforming, and Returning. He says    
we should reduce the size of the federal government, reform Congress,    
and return to "the basic values that built the country: work and family    
and the recognition of a higher moral authority."   
  <p>
In a frenzy of false compassion, our once-limited government "now tries    
to do all things for all people," Brownback observes, arguing that it fails miserably in this task. "We have discovered, by spending trillions of
dollars and taking rights and freedoms away from individuals, that    
government cannot solve all of our problems." The American people    
believe, and rightly so, that "they can handle most of their problems    
better than the federal government can."   
<p>   
If we return to our original principles of limited government, "then our    
nation, our economy, our liberties, and our social fiber will grow    
stronger than we have seen for a generation," predicts Brownback. The    
Congressman from Kansas contends that Americans must "look first to    
themselves and to each other for help," rather than rely on their elected 
representatives. He calls for the restoration of "the master-servant    
relationship between the people and the government," acknowledging    
that many of his colleagues need to be reminded that they hold the    
subordinate position. They also need to be reminded that the powers of    
the federal government are strictly limited by our Constitution.    
Observing that there is "no constitutional basis" for most of the federal 
government's current activities, Brownback argues that it is time to "re-   
limit our federal government so it can perform its proper functions well, 
and leave to the people and the states those functions which the federal    
government was never intended to perform."   
<p>   
Brownback calls for "a new Contract with America -- one that passes    
laws, not merely proposes them." Brownback's Contract would reduce    
federal spending "from 22 percent of our Gross Domestic Product to 15    
percent or less," restrict the tax code to the raising of revenue and    
"remove all social engineering" from it, cut the number of cabinet    
agencies from 14 to no more than nine "and restrict their regulatory    
powers under constitutional principles," require the citation of "precise  constitutional authority" for all proposed legislation, and eliminate all
government interference in private charity. Sounds like a pretty good    
contract. Where do we sign?

Your children cannot legally buy obscene rap music albums at a record

at your local library.

<P>     
  
Imagine your 12-year-old child coming home from the public library    
with a CD or cassette tape of 2 Live Crew's vulgar rap album As Nasty    
As They Wanna Be. Do you think it's impossible? Do you think no    
publicly-funded library would purchase music glorifying the rape and    
mutilation of women? Do you think no responsible librarian would    
release such material to children? Think again.   
<p>   
Public libraries all over America have multiple copies of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be and other violent and salacious recordings. They    
routinely loan these materials to children without the knowledge or    
permission of their parents. It's their policy to do that.   
<p>   
In the February issue of the Education Reporter, longtime teacher Helen    
Chaffee Biehle describes how she recently discovered that the public    
libraries she's loved all her life are no longer child-friendly forums for    
fact-finding and fantasizing. Having read in her local newspaper that a    
12-year-old boy had indeed been allowed to check out 2 Live Crew's    
filthy tape from one of the county libraries, Mrs. Biehle decided to call    
the library director herself and find out how this terrible mistake had    
occurred. She discovered that it was no mistake.   
<p>   
The library director was "completely calm and utterly unapologetic,"    
Mrs. Biehle recalls. Following the guidelines of the American Library    
Association's Intellectual Freedom Manual as regards the handling of    
complaints, the director offered three lines of defense. The first was an    
appeal to diversity. "Neither you nor I might approve of As Nasty As    
They Wanna Be," she conceded, "but we serve a diverse population."    
Then there was the philosophical dodge. "Not to buy the tape would be    
making a moral judgment," she said. "We can't do that." The ultimate    
defense, however, was an American Library Association document called    
the Library Bill of Rights, which has absolutely no legal standing but    
purports to prohibit "censorship" on the basis of age.   
 <p>  
The great irony, of course, is that the guardians of intellectual freedom at    
the American Library Association are anything but tolerant when it    
comes to considering the opinions of others. It's not diversity that they    
believe in, but perversity. They make moral judgments -- or should we    
say, immoral judgments -- all the time. Censorship is the very essence of    
their profession. They decide which books, records, and videotapes will    
be made available to library patrons, and they routinely screen out    
materials that contradict their biases. Woe betide the independent-minded    
librarian who dares to defy them by respecting the values and opinions of    
the taxpayers who make their jobs possible. "The acceptance of moral    
responsibility for children in the library is now called 'unprofessional,"'    
notes Helen Chaffee Biehle; "making a responsible moral judgment about    
materials purchased for the library is called 'elitist,' and the librarian who    
is brave enough to do either is labeled a 'censor.'"

<h2>Terrorism Bill</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
If the House of Representatives passes the so-called "anti-terrorism" bill    
now under consideration, American citizens will experience "a profound    
loss of liberty, for no real gain in their security. "  
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
   
 
<p>   
"It is astounding to see the 1 04th Congress move to expand the power    
and intrusiveness of the federal government,'' says David Kopel of the    
Cato Institute. "These are the same Republicans sent to Congress to    
reduce the federal government's erosion of individual rights."    
Nevertheless, many of these avowed opponents of Big Government are    
supporting a bill that Kopel says would "turn Uncle Sam into Big    
Brother."   
 <p>  
The House version of the proposed legislation would authorize federal    
agents to pry into the personal affairs of any American citizen, says    
Kopel, "without first obtaining a court order, and without even a    
suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity." Such    
invasions of privacy would be just the beginning, for the bill also "gives    
the president the power to label a group a 'terrorist organization' and    
make it a federal felony to support the legal activities of that group." The    
Justice Department's unsuccessful effort to prove the existence of a    
criminal conspiracy among pro-life organizations is a clear indication of    
what sort of groups are likely to be targeted as "terrorists."   
<p>   
It gets worse. Kopel notes that "illegal wiretaps would be admissible in    
court, as long as the wiretapping federal official was acting in 'good    
faith.'" How can the victim of an inquisition prove that his persecutor    
acted in bad faith? He can't. That's the point. The bill also contains "gun    
control legislation that could never pass this Congress on its own merits,"    
says Kopel. "Currently it is illegal to sell someone a firearm if you know    
it will be used in a crime. This bill would apply a five-year sentence to    
cases in which the seller allegedly 'should' have known that the gun    
would be used in a crime." Standard background checks will no longer    
suffice, it seems. Will gun dealers now have to obtain psychological    
profiles of all potential customers? Will they be expected to detect that    
cliche of murder mysteries, the homicidal gleam in the eye?   
<p>   
Do you think that American legislators could never endorse warrantless    
searches, illegal wiretaps, presumption of guilt, detention without trial,    
unseen witnesses, or secret testimony? Alas, they already have, in the    
anti-terrorism bill pending in Congress. The Senate bill is worse; it    
demonstrates even less regard for our constitutionally-protected liberties.    
The Senate version of the bill, says David Kopel, "contains a number of    
seriously disturbing and dangerous provisions," including military    
involvement in local law enforcement, digital wiretapping capabilities,    
the reclassification of apolitical crimes as terrorism, and increased    
funding for the storm troopers at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and    
Firearms. Is the threat of terrorism really so great that we should give up    
many of our hard-won liberties to protect against it? Most Americans    
would not be happy with the result.

<h2>Kit Carson Scouts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"To be an enemy of the United States can be dangerous, " Senator 
Daniel  Patrick Moynihan once quipped. "To be an ally can be fatal. "
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
 
They were called the Kit Carson Scouts, these daring young Vietnamese  
men recruited into the U.S. Army and Marine Corps to guide our combat  
units into enemy territory. They served us faithfully, and we abandoned  
them. 
<p>
Many of the Kit Carson Scouts were former members of the Viet Cong  
who had seen the evils of communism and turned against it, says James  
Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of Freedom. Others were  
recruited from border villages because of their familiarity with the terrain  
occupied by the communists. Nearly 7,000 Kit Carson Scouts were  
recruited during the Vietnam War, and 4,000 of these courageous soldiers  
were still actively serving when American forces pulled out in 1975.  
"Since then," says Tyson, "the U.S. has done nothing to help these men  
get out of Vietnam safely." 
<p>
What's become of our faithful allies? No one knows for sure. What's  
worse, no one seems to care. "After the fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese  
communists started a campaign to round up all members of the South  
Vietnamese government and armed forces, or those who had worked for  
the Americans," reports Tyson. "Most were killed or thrown into deadly  
're-education camps.' The Kit Carson Scouts were a primary target. The  
communists put a bounty on them, so that many neighbors in their  
villages turned them in. Two thousand are believed to have been  
executed." 
<p>
Half of the Kit Carson Scouts, our former allies, may have been  
slaughtered because we made no provision for their deliverance. What  
about the other half? "Another 2000 are estimated to have survived  
undetected," says Tyson. "These men have faced deadly danger ever  
since and need our help. Many may still be in Vietnam, but some may be  
among the flood of refugees who have succeeded in getting out of the 
country, by risking their lives at sea or through other means." Getting out  
is one thing; staying out is another. Tyson concedes that "thousands of  
Vietnamese have been settled in the U.S. and other countries since the  
war. But 70,000 still languish in refugee camps in the neighboring  
countries of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Hong Kong." 
<p>
Repatriation means certain death for the Kit Carson Scouts. Nevertheless,  
those who have made it to the refugee camps must prove that they are  
"political" refugees, with the right to be resettled in other countries. Mere  
"economic" refugees, whose concerns about their personal safety in their  
native land are considered unwarranted, do not qualify for asylum. "The 
Kit Carson Scouts have an air-tight case as 'political' refugees, since they  
were employed by the U.S. military," says Tyson. "But our government 
has failed to do anything, either to help them escape from Vietnam or to  
assist those who have gotten out in being properly classified."

<title>Duplantier:  MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS  -- 3/22/96</title>

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Health care spending today is more than twenty times what it was in    
1965. The primary reason for that dramatic increase is the third-party    
payment system. 
</i></blockquote>
<p>   
Research analyst Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in    
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania argues that "people are never as careful in    
spending someone else's money as they are in spending their own." This    
simple fact of human nature is what's behind the spiraling cost of health    
care in America. "Between 1965 and 1995, total annual spending on    
health care in the U.S. rose from $41.6 billion to $938.3 billion in    
constant dollars," reports Barwick. "This dramatic increase in health care    
spending coincided with a sharp rise in third-party payment." The    
Pennsylvania researcher estimates that "79 cents of every dollar used to    
purchase health care is paid by someone other than the person receiving    
treatment."   
<p>   
Barwick sees a direct link "between rising health care costs and the    
increase in third-party payment." He argues that there is little incentive    
for economizing "when people only have to pay 21 cents to get a dollar's    
worth of coverage." When patients don't care how much a particular    
medicine or treatment will cost, "physicians and other medical    
professionals will have little reason to seek the most cost-effective ways    
to provide quality care."   
<p>   
The solution, Barwick believes, is Medical Savings Accounts (known as    
an MSAs), which provide "the individual consumer with the resources    
needed to pay directly for ordinary health care expenditures, together    
with the incentive to do so responsibly." Barwick describes MSAs as    
"tax-free accounts into which individuals may deposit money to be used    
to pay for everyday health care needs. Typically," he says, "MSAs are    
combined with a catastrophic insurance policy which covers all health    
care expenses beyond a high fixed deductible."   
<p>   
Barwick argues that "MSAs provide health care consumers with a strong    
incentive to conserve resources, since the consumer gets to keep whatever    
cost-savings he is able to achieve. By encouraging frugality among    
consumers, MSAs would also provide incentive to physicians and other    
health care professionals to utilize the most costeffective means of    
providing quality care." Barwick notes that other proposed health care    
reforms "seek to regulate patients, physicians, and hospitals more heavily,    
resulting in restrictions on the freedom of the patient to choose a    
physician and [the freedom] of the physician to select the type of    
treatment to be used. In contrast, MSAs leave these choices where they    
belong: in the hands of individual health care recipients and their    
physicians."   
<p>   
In addition to providing patients and doctors with an incentive to save,    
MSAs would reduce administrative costs, which account for as much as    
25 percent of health care spending. They would also reduce out-of-pocket    
expenses for "the vast majority of health care recipients." And they would    
solve the portability problem by allowing employees to "take any unspent    
MSA funds with them when leaving a job."

<h2>Union Electioneering</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The AFL-CIO recently announced that it plans to spend $35 million to   
influence the outcome of this year's elections. That's seven times what the   
labor federation normally spends on national elections!
</i></blockquote>
<P>     
  
  
 
  

<p>  
"After decades of declining political influence, labor unions have pledged   
to multiply their election efforts this year with a $35 million war chest,"   
says Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The first real test of   
organized labor's new activism -- Oregon's special election for a United   
States Senate seat -- resulted in a narrow victory for the candidate heavily   
backed by big labor. Similar efforts can be expected in numerous House   
and Senate races this fall." After all, new AFL-CIO President John   
Sweeney won election to his post late last year by "pledging more active   
organization drives to help increase the union rolls in America and   
promising vocal political campaigns to promote the union movement's   
liberal agenda."  
<p>  
The AFL-CIO made more than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more   
than 350,000 pieces of mail on behalf of the Democratic candidate in the   
special election in Oregon to fill the Senate seat vacated by Bob   
Packwood. "The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining forces   
with at least 11 individual unions, it was able to mount a considerable   
presence in this one targeted race," observes Griffin. "The considerable   
firepower mustered by these organizations resulted in more than $   
183,000 in political action committee donations to the Democratic   
candidate."  
<p>  
Griffin emphasizes that "impact is not measured in direct PAC spending   
alone. Phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and grassroots   
organizing are all significant activities that labor used in Oregon and can   
be expected to use throughout this year to promote favored political   
candidates. Many of these activities can be funded out of forced dues. In   
Oregon, these efforts were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more   
than direct, reported expenditures."  
<p>  
Griffin predicts that "the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations will   
continue to invest heavily in campaign activity" during the course of this   
election year, and concedes that they have every right to do so.   
"Unfortunately," he says, "much of this politicking will be funded   
through mandatory worker dues, and much is unreported and unregulated   
by federal election laws." Griffin argues that it is unjust for union   
members to be "compelled to surrender their own pay . . . to finance   
political activity to which they may well object." He urges Members of   
Congress, in addressing campaign finance reform, to consider "whether it   
is fair to force every union member to pay for the ideological warfare of   
union officials.'' Reform legislation, says Griffin, should stipulate that   
"only voluntary contributions are used for politics."  
<p>  
Organized labor promises to be a major player in the 1996 elections.   
While conceding that unions should be "as free as other organizations to   
pursue their political goals," Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation   
insists that "the coercive nature of union funding, and the regulatory   
advantages unions enjoy, are unjust and unfair."

<h2>World Trade Organization</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The World Trade Organization's recent ruling against the United States

The World Trade Organization's recent ruling against the United States     
is a taste of things to come -- unless American voters can persuade their     
Congressmen to abrogate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade     
and say no to the New World Order.    
<p>    
The jig is up. The internationalists have jumped the gun. They've shown     
their hand too soon. And now their legislative lackeys in the U.S.     
Congress are obliged, in the middle of an election year, to defend the     
indefensible. Having sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the     
sovereignty of the United States, they must now figure out a way to     
justify their support for a treaty that undermines both -- or resign     
themselves to humiliating defeats in November.    
<p>    
Congress ratified the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as     
GATT) during its lame-duck session in December 1994. That treaty     
established the World Trade Organization ( known as WTO) and gave it     
the power to settle trade disputes among signatory nations. Well, lo and     
behold, the WTO, in its first major decision, has ruled against the United     
States! The Members of Congress who ratified the treaty knew that such     
an outcome was a distinct possibility. It was widely predicted at the time.     
Nevertheless, they willingly voted to subject the economic, social, and     
legislative decisions of American citizens to the whims of an international     
tribunal.    
<p>    
What that international tribunal did was to order the United States to     
change its rules on the quality of imported gasoline or face sanctions     
against U.S. industries. The governments of Venezuela and Brazil had     
appealed to the World Trade Organization to compel the U.S. to accept     
their gasoline, which does not meet U.S. environmental standards.     
Congress will now have to revise our Clean Air Act regulations regarding     
gasoline emissions or U.S. industries will face "cross-retaliation" trade     
sanctions. Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela     
or Brazil, there is no direct way to exact revenge on U.S. petroleum     
interests. So, in the name of "free trade," the WTO will probably order     
trade sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to     
the gasoline industry or the EPA regulations.    
<p> 
Now, Democrats and Republicans both have egg on their faces. President     
Clinton promised his liberal supporters in 1994 that the WTO would     
never undercut our environmental regulations. The Republican leadership     
in Congress promised their conservative backers that American     
sovereignty would not be endangered by the agreement. Well, it turns out     
they were both mistaken, or less than candid.    
<p>    
William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade considers     
the recent WTO ruling truly ominous. Gill and his group tried to warn     
Members of Congress that the North American Free Trade Agreement     
and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade "were the first big steps     
toward a world government that would rob America of our cherished     
independence as a nation." But our elected representatives just wouldn't     
listen. By the time November 5th rolls around, they may wish they had.

<h2>UN Tax</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The proposal for a global tax to finance the operations of the United   
Nations went over like a lead balloon among average Americans. Many   
of our so-called leaders support the idea, however, seeing it as a   
necessary step on the road to a New World Order.  
</i></blockquote>
<P>         
United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali thinks the UN   
could be a lot more effective if the world body did not have to answer to   
any of its member nations. If it had its own means of support, and its own   
army, then Boutros-Ghali and his fellow internationalists could give   
orders instead of taking them. The idea makes perfect sense to power-  
hungry globalists, who simply can't understand why it doesn't appeal to   
the citizens of nations expected to sacrifice their sovereignty.  
<p>  
Boutros-Ghali wants to finance the nearly bankrupt United Nations by   
imposing a global tax on foreign exchange transactions. A mere half-of-  
one-percent tax on these transactions would generate an astounding $1.5   
trillion. The Secretary General is willing to consider alternative means of   
raising revenue, of course, such as taxes on international travel, fossil   
fuels, international arms sales, and so on. The important thing is to   
establish an independent revenue source. "It is time to seriously address   
the need for a United Nations that can operate on a secure and steady   
financial foundation," said Boutros-Ghali when he floated his unpopular   
proposal. "I'm sure we will win in the end, and that we will obtain from   
the international community [an understanding] that we need to have our   
own income."  
<p>  
The international community may understand Boutros-Ghali's objectives,   
but so does the average American citizen, and he wants no part of it. "The   
ability to control territory and command an army, like the ability to tax,   
represents the exercise of sovereign power," observes Thomas Sheehy of   
the Heritage Foundation. "The UN should never have this power; it   
would be a usurpation of the constitutional rights of the American people.   
These rights are protected by the U.S. government, not the UN. The UN   
does not represent the interests of Americans; it represents the interests of   
its 185 member states, many of which are undemocratic and repressive."  
<p>  
Sheehy denies that the UN suffers from "a lack of funding. In fact," he   
says, "UN spending has been mushrooming, and that is the real problem."   
Still, the UN wants more. "In September 1996, the UN Working Group   
on Finances will submit a report on financing to the UN General   
Assembly," observes Sheehy. "This report may very well recommend a   
UN tax scheme." Sheehy notes that legislation has been introduced in   
both houses of the U.S. Congress to prohibit U.S. compliance with UN   
efforts to implement a tax. He argues that "the last thing the UN needs is   
more money and less accountability." The real question, however, is what   
America needs: We need leaders who will respect and protect our nation's   
sovereignty. The best way to do that is by withdrawing from the United   
Nations and expelling this would-be world government from our shores.

<h2>Michael New </h2>
 
<P>
<blockquote><i>
The United Nations wants to be a truly autonomous world government,  
but first it needs to have its own authority, and its own military  
force. U.S. Army Specialist Michael New's refusal to don the UN  
uniform was a challenge that could not be ignored.
</i></blockquote>
<p> 
The court martial and conviction of U.S. Army Specialist Michael New  
for refusing to wear the UN uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping"  
mission to Macedonia was a necessary step on the road to the New World  
Order. Had New not been punished, the other 550 servicemen in his unit  
might have had second thoughts about donning UN helmets, trading their  
U.S. identification cards for UN I.D. cards, and marching off to  
Macedonia to serve as pawns in a conflict of no consequence to America.  
How would the UN ever put together an army of its own if every soldier  
in the world insisted on maintaining allegiance to his homeland? 
<p> 
To justify the order regarding the wearing of UN uniforms, Specialist  
New's commanding officer made vague references to the following  
phrases: "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN  
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security  
Council Resolutions." But Specialist New was not convinced. He argued  
that the order to alter his uniform violated U.S. Army regulations against  
wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, medal, or uniform. "I am  
not a UN soldier," New protested. "I am an American soldier." 
<p> 
The Army was in "a difficult position," remarks Dennis Cuddy, former  
professor of U.S. history at the University of North Carolina, and the  
author of a popular pamphlet on the New World Order. If the UN insignia  
on his uniform would have no effect on Michael New's status as an  
American soldier, then why was it so important for him to wear it? If the  
insignia merely identifies a UN operation, then why didn't American  
soldiers serving in Korea wear UN emblems on their uniforms? Why all  
the fuss about a silly little emblem? Cuddy argues that obscuring the  
national identities of troops participating in a UN peacekeeping mission  
and forcing them all to sport UN insignia indicates "a change of  
command or authority." Once the United Nations has troops that it can  
truly call its own, it will have become what its founders wanted it to be --  
"a de facto world government." 
<p> 
"Michael New is an American hero," proclaims Congressman Roscoe  
Bartlett of Maryland. "A twice decorated soldier, Michael New took the  
extraordinary step of jeopardizing a brilliant military career to defend our  
Constitution." Now, if only our Congressmen will show such courage.  
Bartlett and more than 60 of his colleagues are co-sponsoring a bill that  
would make it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services  
to wear insignia, indicia, or headgear affirming allegiance to, or  
affiliation with, the United Nations. But why stop there? Why not take  
the one step that really would prevent American soldiers from being  
transferred to the command of an international force? Why not withdraw  
from the United Nations altogether, while we still can?

<h2>Family vs. "Village"</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
First Lady Hillary Clinton and her friends tell us that it takes a village to    
raise a child, but to them "village" is just a code word for Big Brother    
government. 
</i></blockquote>
<P>  
It's a nice sounding proverb: It takes a village to raise a child. But what    
does it really mean? What does Hillary Clinton have in mind when she    
speaks of a "village"? How does she propose to "raise a child"? Do these    
terms mean the same thing to her that they do to the rest of us? Former    
Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Services Kay James contends    
that the First Lady's interpretation of this traditional African proverb is    
anything but traditional.    
<p>    
"Three fundamental problems arise with the use of this proverb," writes    
Mrs. James in the February issue of Imprimis, the monthly journal of    
Hillsdale College. "First, children do not belong to the village or to the    
community or to the government. They belong to parents, and the village    
exists as a resource for these families." The second problem is that the    
village -- the small, closely-knit community many of us grew up in -- "no    
longer exists." The third problem is that liberals think they can replace    
the village of days gone by with "big government."    
<p>    
Mrs. James considers it ironic that "the more our families disintegrate, the    
more violence explodes in our homes and on our streets, the more our    
schools fail the grade, the more this old proverb is repeated." Invoking    
proverbs like a mantra will not change the fact that the village "has been    
utterly and completely destroyed." Mrs. James argues that, "rather than    
work to rebuild the village, we have instead taken the broken bricks of    
families, the mortar of cultural institutions, and the steel of houses of    
worship and used them to build up Town Hall." This, of course, is the    
worst thing we could have done, for our growing dependence on big    
government "has robbed us of the drive so necessary to sustain and    
strengthen the institutions of the village."    
<p>    
Hillary Clinton and like-minded liberals can sing the praises of the    
village, but that doesn't alter the fact that it was their policies that    
destroyed it. "Liberal theology has undermined our faith and destroyed    
the traditional role of churches," declares Mrs. James. "Liberal education    
policies have ravaged our public schools. Liberal social policies have    
sabotaged our families. Liberal public policies have fostered welfare    
dependency encouraged promiscuous behavior, and empowered criminals    
instead of citizens."    
<p>    
Mrs. James contends that Americans today know "the full cost of ceding    
our responsibilities to the federal government." We know that "the    
government cannot be our parents, cannot teach our children about    
responsibility and character, cannot regulate individual behavior, and    
cannot create entrepreneurial opportunities." We know that "the real    
solutions are not political," and that "real change must still come from the    
transformed hearts and souls of individuals."

<h2>
Education Reform
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
According to a national opinion poll conducted by USA Today in 
January, the quality of education in our country is the number-one 
concern for most Americans.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The quality of education in America is declining because "power in 
educational public policy rests with the producers, not the consumers," 
says Charles Greenawalt of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "Public education should serve the public 
interest and be accountable for its performance, but this is not the case." 
The education establishment "possesses near-monopoly control of this 
area of public policy." Greenawalt argues that the primary objective of 
this establishment is "not to improve and strengthen their performance, 
but to preserve itself, its clout, the status quo, and the resources at its 
disposal. This status quo is facilitated by complex layers of local, state, 
and federal regulations that apply to the schools and are implemented by 
overstaffed and generally unresponsive school district bureaucracies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt calls for "major shifts of authority and control over resources 
from producers to consumers and from experts to civilians. This means 
giving parents, taxpayers, elected officials, and community leaders far 
greater say over what schools need to accomplish, how the schools will 
be held accountable for this task, and how children and schools will be 
matched with one another." One way to do this is by "breaking vast 
school systems into smaller and more manageable units," says 
Greenawalt. "Consolidation in many areas has gone too far [resulting in] 
numerous school districts that are too large . . . to educate students 
effectively."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For our educational system to be successful again, there must be 
reasonable standards of performance for students and teachers, genuine 
competition among the schools, and a renewed sense of professionalism 
among educators. Standards must "spell out in clear, unambiguous terms 
what students should learn and be able to do before they graduate," says 
Greenawalt. For standards to be effective, there must be "reliable and 
accurate assessments of student and school performance vis-a-vis those 
standards [which presupposes] trustworthy information about student 
performance [and] accountability mechanisms that will invoke 
meaningful consequences for all school personnel."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Noting that "children differ substantially in learning styles, temperament, 
and personal preference," Greenawalt argues that, "rather than attempting 
to standardize all schools, the state should welcome and promote 
educational diversity or pluralism. Let schools compete with one another 
based on their distinctive programs." According to Greenawalt, "School 
choice is an essential element for any comprehensive educational reform 
that is to be meaningful and long-lived. Families must be able to select 
their children's schools from a broad and varied array of choices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Greenawalt says that teachers need to start thinking of themselves as 
individuals again. "Uniform salary schedules that treat everyone alike, 
regardless of performance, have no place in a true profession," he argues. 
"Likewise, the ability to strike and the presence of lifetime tenure are also 
antithetical to true professionalism. Schools must be operated for the 
benefit of their consumers -- the students -- not their producers."

<h2>
Conservation Economics
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
If environmental activists really cared about preserving endangered 
species, they wouldn't let an ideological commitment to socialism stand 
in the way.
</blockquote></i>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Since 1970, conservationists have painted a dismal picture of an 
increasing struggle for survival of wildlife, with one species after another 
being pushed to the brink of extinction," says Robert J. Smith of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Why are some species disappearing 
and others thriving?" Smith argues that "the problem of overexploitation 
or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather 
than private ownership." In the January issue of his organization's 
monthly newsletter, "UpDate," Smith distinguishes between "two totally 
different forms of property rights and ownership: public, communal, or 
open-access common property vs. private property. Wherever we have 
public ownership we find overuse, waste, and extinction; but private 
ownership results in sustained-yield use and preservation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Wildlife problems resulting from public ownership have been "especially 
prevalent in America," says Smith, but less so in other parts of the world. 
"In Europe, native wildlife often belongs to private landowners or is 
managed under a combination of private and public property. Some 
European countries have fewer problems of overexploitation of wildlife, 
regardless of population pressures and economic and political systems." 
There's a lesson to be learned here, says Smith.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An example of "how private ownership can successfully preserve wildlife 
is found on game ranches, hunting preserves, safari parks, and animal and 
bird farms." Smith contends that "these game ranches produce many 
positive results. Many of the animals they stock are rapidly disappearing 
in their native countries because of pressures resulting from a rapidly 
expanding human population. Indeed, some of the more spectacular and 
most sought-after big-game mammals may now have healthier and more 
stable populations on game ranches than in their native countries."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reluctance of conservationists to embrace private ownership of 
wildlife is one of the biggest threats to the preservation of endangered 
species. "If the profits gained by giving hunters access to exotic game can 
provide the economic incentive for landowners to manage the animals on 
a sustained-yield basis, some species will be saved," says Smith. He notes 
that "the protection provided at some of the parks, preserves, and gardens 
has actually produced a glut of some animals. There have been well-
publicized efforts by some preserves to return their surplus animals to 
Africa." Smith predicts that "in the future the developing countries will 
be restocked with their native fauna from specimens now thriving on 
game ranches and preserves."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservationists need to overcome their slavish devotion to big 
government. "The problems of environmental degradation, 
overexploitation of natural resources, and depletion of wildlife all derive 
from their existence as common property resources," says Robert J. 
Smith. "Wherever we have exclusive private ownership, whether it is 
organized around a profit-seeking or nonprofit undertaking, there are 
incentives for the private owners to preserve the resource. Self-interest 
drives private property owners to careful management of their resource."

<h2>
Troubled by the Issues
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
When it comes to covering political campaigns, the members of the 
media have a way of focusing on the personalities of the candidates and 
ignoring the issues. Maybe it's because they don't want us to think about 
what's really at stake.
</blockquote></i>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What are the issues in the 1996 Presidential election? The deployment of 
American troops to Bosnia is one. The court-martial of Army Specialist 
Michael New for refusing to wear the United Nations uniform is another. 
The UN itself is a big issue -- the funding of it, its so-called peacemaking 
efforts, its impact on U.S. sovereignty. Serious voters want to know if our 
next President will acknowledge that America has no strategic interest in 
Bosnia and bring our troops home. Will he make amends to Michael New 
and take steps to ensure that no U.S. soldier is ever again subjected to 
foreign command? Will he oppose independent taxing authority for the 
UN? Will he oppose U.S. funding for UN military ventures? Will he 
oppose treaties -- like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child -- that threaten U.S. 
sovereignty?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about NAFTA, GATT, and the World Trade Organization? The 
Mexican bailout? Illegal immigration and multilingualism? These are 
issues of major concern to many Americans. Will our next President 
acknowledge the real impact of so-called free-trade treaties on our 
economy? Will the jobs of American workers mean more to him than the 
bad investments of New York banks? Will he cut off all taxpayer benefits 
to illegal aliens and support a moratorium on legal immigration until the 
problem of illegals can be addressed? Will he endorse English as our 
official language and withdraw support for bilingual programs that retard 
the assimilation of immigrants?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about education and crime-fighting? Presidential candidates like to 
talk about these issues, even though both are properly handled at the local 
level. Will our next President acknowledge state supremacy in these 
matters? Will he terminate the unconstitutional federal intervention in 
education by abolishing the Department of Education and repealing 
Goals 2000? Will he condemn the killings carried out by federal agents at 
Ruby Ridge and Waco, and make sure that Americans are never again 
terrorized by their own government? Will he oppose legislation -- like the 
so-called anti-terrorism bill -- that would authorize federal agents to 
violate the constitutionally-protected liberties of Americans? Will he 
oppose the government's taking of private lands for bogus environmental 
reasons?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where does he stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? What's his position on taxpayer handouts to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? Does he 
support or reject affirmative action quotas and set-asides? These are just 
some of the issues that the press passes over as it plays up personalities, 
polls, and party platitudes. But serious voters know what the issues are, 
and they want a candidate who will address them.

<h2>
ENVIRONMENTALISM
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"By the end of the 1980s, environmental bills accounted for nearly one-
fifth of bills presented to Congress and almost one-quarter of those 
enacted into law."
</blockquote></i>
<P>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                            
"The government's environmental activism has been costly," writes 
Jonathan Adler of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. "The 
Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that Americans spend 
well over $150 billion per year complying with environmental 
regulations." In a new book called Environmentalism at the Crossroads, 
published by the Capital Research Center, Adler argues that businesses 
trying to absorb the costs of compliance "are likely to pass on the cost to 
consumers by raising the price of their products. And, when they are 
confronted by the uncertainties of statutory interpretation and the 
regulatory enforcement of environmental law, they may decide to slow 
the development and application of new technologies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The cost of environmental regulation continues to increase, even as more 
and more Americans are questioning its effectiveness, "particularly in the 
area of risk reduction." Adler contends that "attempting to improve 
environmental quality in one area can hurt the environment in other 
areas." Even worse, regulations can sometimes have an effect quite the 
opposite of what was intended, as has happened with the Endangered 
Species Act. Adler notes that "landowners lose the right to use their land 
as they see fit when an endangered animal is discovered on it. 
Landowners cannot build or enlarge their homes, plant crops, or cut down 
trees. Rather than protect wildlife, the Endangered Species Act punishes 
landowners, in effect, for creating or maintaining a species habitat. The 
Act creates disincentives for protecting endangered species," says Adler, 
with the result that "landowners who find an endangered species on their 
property may well decide to destroy it and its habitat before it's 
discovered by federal authorities."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adler asserts that "many policy experts and the public now recognize the 
failings of much environmental policy." Nevertheless, he says, 
"Washington's environmental lobbies are unyielding." They know that 
regulatory reform is needed to establish accurate methods of risk 
assessment, proscribe unfunded mandates, and protect private property 
rights, but they refuse to admit it. Rather than harness the time-tested 
incentives of the free enterprise system in the service of their mission, 
they remain blindly committed to government intervention. "Washington 
environmental lobbyists steadfastly oppose risk assessment, relief from 
unfunded mandates, and greater protection of property," Adler observes. 
"Environmentalists do not see that the public's interest in economic 
common sense and fairness is compatible with support for a clean 
environment."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without meaningful reform, however, regulators will continue to target 
risks that have "public relations or political value," in the process 
spending "millions of dollars that do comparatively little to improve 
public health and environmental quality." They will continue to impose 
unfunded mandates on state and local governments, with the result that 
"local priorities must be subordinated to Washington's dictates." And they 
will continue to issue environmental regulations that "override private 
land-use decisions," thereby violating the "takings clause" of the Fifth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

<h2>
Environmental Myths
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
"Mainstream thinking asserts that we must sacrifice at least some of our 
prosperity in order to protect the environment, " observes a noted 
economist. "Fortunately, this mainstream thinking is wrong."
</blockquote></i>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We can have both a growing economy and an improving environment," 
declares John Semmens of the Laissez-Faire Institute in Chandler, 
Arizona. In an article entitled "Prosperity Without Pollution," in the 
March issue of "The Freeman," Semmens suggests that "a growing 
economy may well provide the very means needed to improve the 
environment. 'Sacrifice' may not only be unnecessary; it may be 
counterproductive."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Semmens cites several "erroneous premises" of mainstream 
environmental thinking that pose obstacles not only to prosperity but to 
environmental improvement as well. One false premise is the idea that 
anything "natural" is better than anything "artificial." Civilization itself is 
artificial, Semmens observes, but far superior to the state of nature. The 
"artificial" laws and technology of civilization allow us "to lead lives that 
are less violent, painful, and precarious than would be natural. 
'Environmentalism' itself is an artifact of civilization. The abundance 
generated by our technologically advanced civilization allows people to 
contemplate more than just survival."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The idea that resources are finite is another false premise. Things do not 
even become "resources" until humans find a use for them and thereby 
give them value. The scarcity of any given resource is simply a challenge 
to be overcome. "The high prices of scarce resources stimulate the search 
for better or cheaper alternatives for meeting the same human wants," 
says Semmens. "So, in the final analysis, it is not the 'finiteness' of any 
substance that is critical. The critical factor is the scope of the human 
imagination. This scope seems to be getting broader. The accelerating 
pace of technological advancement should give us confidence that, 
barring the implementation of oppressive government meddling, we are 
not likely to run short of intellectual resources in the foreseeable future."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The so-called population bomb is another fallacy. "It is not population, 
per se, that could pose a problem for humanity, but the political and 
social institutions that affect human behavior," says Semmens. "In this 
regard, the paternalistic welfare state is a serious problem. Government 
programs that entitle people to consume without their having to produce 
turns them into drones and parasites." The danger here is that "the burden 
of the parasitic portion of the population may overwhelm the output 
capacity of the productive portion."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The biggest fallacy of all is the idea that big government is the answer to 
environmental problems, real or imagined. "Government lacks adequate 
information on the subjective values of individuals, on the world's 
continuously changing circumstances, and on what the future might 
bring," says Semmens. "Further, government lacks sufficient incentives 
to avoid mistakes. The burdens of its errors fall on others. Its failures 
serve as a rationale for further meddling." Semmens insists that 
"prosperity and a cleaner environment" depend on "human creativity," 
which cannot flourish in a society stifled by government control.

<h2>
Constitution Not Outmoded
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
It's a familiar refrain. The Constitution, we're told, was designed for an 
18th-century agrarian society, not for the complex, technological world 
we live in today.
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The Constitution is based on three timeless truths," wrote Jackson 
Pemberton in an essay published in "The Freeman" during our 
bicentennial year. "First, it is founded on the fact that it is necessary, in a 
society, that the citizen must either control himself by his own moral 
self-discipline, or he must be restrained so that he cannot abuse his 
liberty. Second, it is the nature of man to seek recognition, then 
influence, and then power in his relationships to his fellows. Third, it is 
the nature of man to work untiringly for himself when he is confident in 
the usefulness of his effort. Those are the footings of the Constitution, 
and there is nothing there that is either 18th century or agrarian!"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In his essay, recently reprinted by the Foundation for Economic 
Education in a collection called The Foundations of American 
Constitutional Government, Pemberton argued that the Constitution was 
founded "upon an exquisite recognition of the dual disposition of man, 
his propensity for good and his capacity for evil." The objective of the 
Founding Fathers was "to place the forces of human nature in a 
framework which would cause those forces to lift man, to protect and 
release his conscience, his will, his talents, and his noble desires, and at 
the same time would discourage and punish him in his vices."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers knew that, if Americans should ever "turn from 
morality and good religion, they would also turn from liberty," wrote 
Pemberton, "for, if man is to be free, he must control himself." For that 
reason, they strove to make sure that "religion should be thoroughly 
protected and even encouraged." They did not intend for "any particular 
religion to have the advantage over another, but that the citizens' rights 
to complete liberty of private and public belief and practice should in no 
way be infringed."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers, Pemberton explained, "set up the plan of 
government so that its powers were restricted, separated, and dispersed 
throughout the states in order to defeat the tendency of men to 
consolidate power and ordain themselves rulers over the people." They 
then applied "the checks and balances to set each branch of government 
as a watchman over the other two, and gave each certain prerogatives so 
as to place the ambition of self-aggrandizing men in opposition to the 
ambition of other similar men."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers recognized that "man is most inclined to produce 
an abundance when his property rights are held inviolate," wrote 
Pemberton. "Man, by nature, will strive with great energy and 
innovation to improve himself . . . so long as he has confidence that he 
will be allowed to enjoy the fruits of his labors." The Founding Fathers 
disdained "excessive taxation and regulation," because they knew that 
"the freest economies were the greatest source of plenty. "

<title>Duplantier: Creeping Socialism -- 4/12/96</title>

<h2>
Creeping Socialism
</h2>



<P><blockquote><i>  
Socialism is based on "a simple assumption: that certain people know 
better what is best for all other creatures, and that such people possess the 
right to enforce their 'enlightened ' beliefs because they shall lead the rest 
of us to a 'perfect' world."
</blockquote></i>




<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When they drafted the U.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers "created a 
framework which sought to limit secular laws, rules, and regulations to 
the necessary minimum," notes Balint Vazsonyi in an essay titled "The 
Battle for America's Soul," published in the Winter issue of a journal 
called "Common Sense." "They recognized that the fewer the rules, the 
broader the potential agreement. Broad agreement, in turn, results in less 
strife. Less strife leaves people free to create and accomplish. The fewer 
obstacles placed in the path of individuals, the less energy wasted in 
trying to overcome them."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, individual opportunity has given way to group 
entitlement. "Instead of increased productivity, efforts are always directed 
toward increasing demands. These demands are for unearned 
participation in, and distributions from, the accomplishments of those 
who produce the nation's goods," says Vazsonyi. What results is "a 
downward spiral. With incentives shrinking, less and less is produced; 
consequently, there is less and less to distribute. This, in a nutshell, is 
why welfare states invariably increase poverty."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why don't Americans recognize creeping socialism for what it is? 
Socialism "persuades its intended victims that it has people's best interest 
in mind, that it seeks peace, justice, and equality, that it is motivated by 
caring and compassion. Its ability to camouflage true intent and adapt to a 
specific scenario is matchless," says Vazsonyi. It doesn't prohibit free 
speech; it establishes a "politically correct vocabulary." It doesn't impede 
individual opportunity; it promotes "affirmative action." It doesn't 
confiscate private property; it protects "the environment "
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The evidence of creeping socialism is all around us. "The Constitution 
does not provide for group rights," says Vazsonyi. "Yet, a steadily 
growing number of groups is being granted an increasing number of 
rights. Defense, for which the Constitution does provide, has been 
surrounded by an atmosphere of derision and hostility; the effectiveness 
of our armed forces is being diminished through inappropriate use." The 
executive and judicial branches of our federal government have usurped 
legislative power. Laws defining so-called "hate crimes" have narrowed 
the boundaries of free speech. Environmental regulations have 
circumscribed private property rights.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Education used to be based on the best available information, the 
consensus of generations, and rewards designed to extract the best effort 
from all participants," observes Vazsonyi. "Currently, information is 
being replaced by propaganda, consensus by the whim and din of activist 
groups, best effort by primitive egalitarianism." Americans are no longer 
judged by their abilities, but by membership in favored classes. Our 
traditional standards of morality "are being displaced by doctrines which 
do not even recognize the existence of values; the spirit of voluntarism is 
being choked by coercion." Sadly, says Vazsonyi, all these symptoms of 
creeping socialism are endorsed by American liberals.

Do you ever wonder where your federal income taxes go? Billions go to 
programs that subsidize special interest groups lobbying the government 
to increase spending! Consider the implications of that vicious circle 
when you file your 1040 today.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used to 
subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest groups," reports Charles Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward bigger government, more spending,
and increased regulation. Every American is forced to finance this system 
that allows well-connected Washington-based groups to use taxpayer 
funds to advance political causes to which many Americans object."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AmeriCorps received $427 million from American taxpayers in 1995. 
Griffin claims that "several AmeriCorps programs have engaged in 
advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense of the taxpayers," and 
in violation of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. 
Also in 1995, the Legal Services Corporation funneled $400 million of 
our money to private groups that "engage in political and lobbying 
activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal services needed by the 
poor." Griffin describes the Legal Services Corporation as "the legal 
pillar of the welfare state," litigating and lobbying to expand the number 
of welfare recipients and drive up costs by "hundreds of billions of 
dollars."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly $200 million was allocated for Title X Family Planning in 1995. 
"Despite the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive 
to large numbers of Americans," observes Griffin, "this high-profile 
political organization receives a substantial portion of its revenue each 
year" from programs administered under Title X. The National 
Endowment for the Humanities used the $180 million it received in 1995 
to promote "a liberal political and ideological agenda," says Griffin. 
"Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant in the 
National Endowment's most prominent current project, the so-called 
National Conversation. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment 
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council on 
Aging, the American Bar Association, and the American Library 
Association."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The $75 million allocated to the Market Promotion Program in 1995 for 
developing "commercial export markets for U.S. agricultural 
commodities" wound up in the hands of "some of the largest and most 
vocal special interests in the country," Griffin charges. Recipients of 
Market Promotion Program grants "opposed bipartisan efforts to reform 
farm subsidies. They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate 
[the Market Protection Program] outright, and they also fought reforms 
designed to decrease taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large 
corporate farms. Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were 
subsidized unwittingly by the American taxpayer."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Griffin insists that "government funding of political activism is 
indefensible. Yet, hundreds of groups now receive government grants 
which are used, and used effectively, to subsidize their political 
activities." The question is, why do we put up with this outrage?

<h2>
COST OF REGULATIONS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Federal regulations raise the cost of the goods and services we purchase 
by $400 billion annually. In other words, federal regulations cost the 
average American family $4, 000 per year!
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 
2,000 inspectors across the country," reports John Hood of the Heritage 
Foundation. But those 2,000 snoops will inspect fewer than 10 percent of 
the six million workplaces in America, and are not likely to have any 
beneficial impact even at those locations. OSHA's workplace safety 
crusade "has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector 
initiatives," says Hood. OSHA has "little value to add to the worker 
safety picture. But its costs -- measured in lower productivity and wages, 
as well as higher prices and taxes -- are significant."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gary Becker of the Hoover Institution explains the impact of minimum 
wage hikes. "Higher labor costs reduce employment," he says. "A higher 
minimum will further reduce the employment opportunities of workers 
with few skills." In other words, teenagers, high school dropouts, and 
other low-skilled workers will lose their jobs if "their productivity is not 
high enough to justify the cost to employers." When workers lose their 
jobs, they stop paying taxes and start receiving unemployment or welfare 
benefits.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Richard Lesher of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce describes the 
Americans with Disabilities Act as "yet another weapon in the hands of 
disgruntled employees with personal axes to grind." Besides the cost of 
nuisance lawsuits, there is "the expense of retrofitting tens of thousands 
of workplaces and public facilities with wheelchair ramps, elevators, 
toilet stalls, and other special provisions to accommodate people with a 
wide variety of handicaps," says Lesher. "Together with the soaring cost 
of litigation, the Americans with Disabilities Act is proving to be a major 
expense for both public and private enterprises."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. Government banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 
1978, and an international treaty phased out their use entirely in all 
industrial nations at the end of 1995. Jane Shaw and Richard Stroup of 
the Political Economy Research Center say these drastic actions are the 
result of hysteria, not scientific documentation. They argue that it's 
foolish for our federal government to prohibit the production of the 
nontoxic CFCs "used in millions of automobiles and refrigerators" when 
the available alternatives are "more costly, more corrosive to cooling 
systems, less dependable, and less manageable. Some even appear to be 
less safe." The benefits of halting CFC production are negligible, but the 
costs are likely to be extraordinarily high.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Just as our forefathers rebelled against 'taxation without representation,' 
today, private property owners are revolting over 'confiscation without 
compensation,'" says Congressman Billy Tauzin, author of the Private 
Property Owners Bill of Rights. "Clearly, the federal government has 
become our master rather than our servant," says Tauzin. "But American 
property owners . . . are fighting back."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are just a few examples of the regulatory abuses financed by our 
taxes.

<h2>
BIG GOVERNMENT THREATENS RIGHTS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The Federal Government compels us to fork over fully one-third of our 
income, and it uses that money to infringe on the civil liberties protected 
by our Bill of Rights.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects our right to 
practice our religious faith freely; and yet, the Supreme Court has often 
invoked this amendment to justify decisions restricting our freedom of 
religion. The nation's highest Court has prohibited the teaching of 
religion in public schools, as well as the recitation of prayers and the 
reading of the Bible.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Second Amendment protects the right of the individual to own and 
make use of guns. Liberal politicians view gun ownership as an 
interference with the expansion of federal power, which of course it is, 
for an armed citizenry is much more difficult to subjugate than one 
without weapons. Those who don't like the Second Amendment exploit 
every public tragedy involving firearms as propaganda for tighter 
restrictions on their use.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Our right to privacy, protected by the Third and Fourth Amendments, is 
also under attack. The Federal Government seems determined to increase 
its control over all of us by prying into our daily lives. Tax collectors and 
regulatory agents have been snooping on us for years; and now, in the 
name of combating terrorism, the President demands wiretapping 
privileges for federal agents to investigate any suspected felony. There 
are 1,300 federal felonies. You could be guilty of one right now without 
even knowing it.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Fifth Amendment not only protects us against double jeopardy and 
self-incrimination; it also prohibits the confiscation of our property by the 
Federal Government without proper compensation. Yet, today, 
Americans frequently find their property devalued by governmental 
edicts restricting the use of it -- or even taken from them altogether in the 
interest of some putative public good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Sixth Amendment guarantees our right to a trial by jury in a criminal 
case. How juries are selected and instructed, however, often determines 
how effective they are. Unfortunately, jurors are routinely screened on 
the basis of their philosophical or religious beliefs, and those who show 
any propensity for questioning the evidence in the case or the validity of 
the law are usually dismissed posthaste. The Seventh Amendment 
protects our right to a trial by jury in a civil suit, but the growth of 
regulatory agencies has enabled unelected bureaucrats to bypass that 
safeguard -- and instead act as prosecutor, judge, and jury. There are over 
13 million federal bureaucrats meddling in the daily affairs of American 
citizens.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some federal judges and regulatory agents simply disregard the Eighth 
Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable fines and punishments. Some 
also ignore the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, which stipulate that the 
people and the States reserve to themselves all rights not expressly 
granted to the Federal Government. One thing is clear: If Americans want 
to retain the liberties protected by our Bill of Rights, we'd better make our 
voices heard.

<h2>
UNCHANGING TRUTHS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The best protection against the designs of demagogues, do-gooders, and 
other self-styled reformers is a  firm grasp of eternal verities.
</blockquote></i>
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Greek philosopher Aristotle argued that the sovereignty of the law 
must supersede the sovereignty of the ruler. The law is a higher authority 
than the ruler because it; proceeds from a higher authority. "He who 
commands that law should rule [commands] that God and reason alone 
should rule," said Aristotle. Democracies inevitably decline when they 
cease to respect this higher authority and place the interests of any one 
group above the common good.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The English philosopher John Locke went to great lengths to distinguish 
liberty from license and to demonstrate that the law is the liberator, not 
the oppressor, of man: "Law, in its true notion, is not so much the 
limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent agent to his proper 
interest, and prescribes no farther than is for the general good of those 
under that law." Locke argued that "the end of the law is not to abolish or 
restrain but to preserve and enlarge freedom," though he emphasized that 
freedom is not "a liberty for every man to do what he [pleases]."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder," observed the French economist 
Frederic Bastiat. No matter how noble the justification, once the premise 
is accepted that a government can expropriate the wealth of some of its 
citizens and dispense it to others, theft has been legalized, and the signal 
has been sent that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the greatest 
evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as the 
ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon argued that all forms of 
government enshrine one or the other of "two different and opposing 
fundamental principles -- individualism and collectivism. By 
individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is carried to a 
maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism a man's 
least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses no 
initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results: "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
American patriot John T. Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop 
apologizing for our capitalist society." We should take no more steps 
down the road to socialism, he said, and turn out of office any politician 
who tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out "that we are in a 
social war, and that we must fight it as such." He said we should "put an 
end to the orgy of spending that is rapidly bankrupting the nation," quit 
letting bureaucrats plan our economy, and instead let "our free system of 
private enterprise operate at its fullest capacity."

<h2>
GAMBLING
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Gaming fever has been sweeping the country for nearly 10 years now -- 
long enough for its true impact to be measured.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It starts with a state lottery, the proceeds pledged to education or some 
such worthy cause. Then the gambling boats roll up the river, supposedly 
regulated to lessen their mischief. At last, the land-based casinos appear, 
promising an economic renaissance for distressed communities. But it 
soon becomes apparent that legalized gambling is not the golden-egg-
laying goose it was claimed to be. The proceeds from the lottery are 
never as high as hoped for, and the worthy cause that was supposed to 
benefit often finds its annual appropriation from the state legislature 
reduced by a like amount. The riverboats, discovering all kinds of 
unanticipated navigational hazards, ultimately drop their anchors 
permanently. The land-based casinos usurp the patronage of local 
retailers and burden city coffers with the cost of vices generated by 
gaming.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Casino gambling has been sold as the answer to economic problems 
everywhere it has been tried. But casinos serve as a gigantic sump, 
sucking sales from surrounding businesses," asserts Blake Hurst in the 
April issue of The American Enterprise magazine. "People who spend 
money at a casino can't spend it at [local restaurants], or the ballpark, or 
the amusement park. Gambling cannibalizes existing businesses, and the 
overall economic benefit to the economy is nil."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic impact is actually negative, when the cost of social vices 
encouraged by gambling is factored in. One expert cited by Hurst 
"estimates that the average gambler with a problem has from $53,000 to 
$92,000 in gambling-related debt." Another authority on the subject 
reports that "the societal costs imposed by each problem gambler are over 
$13,000, with some estimates running as high as $52,000 annually." A 
survey of wanton wagerers "found that 75 percent of pathological 
gamblers have committed a felony to support their habit." According to 
Gamblers Anonymous, there are as many as 10 million problem gamblers 
in America.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The economic case against gambling is clear," says Hurst. "Gambling 
doesn't create economic wealth, but rather transfers wealth from existing 
businesses to those lucky or influential enough to receive gambling 
monopolies from the state. Gambling increases political corruption and 
crime, and is a strikingly regressive means of raising revenue." That, 
believe it or not, is just the beginning of what's wrong with legalized 
gambling.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps most damaging is the misleading message that legalized 
gambling sends to the citizenry, especially the young. "When the state 
removes the stigma from gambling by promoting it as a way to help 
education, people who have never gambled develop the habit. 
Governments may not be able to control vice, but surely they ought not to 
encourage it," says Blake Hurst. "When governments present riverboat 
casinos as economic development, they diminish those who build farms 
and factories. When states spend millions urging their citizens to play the 
lottery, they devalue the efforts of those who work hard and invest 
wisely."

<title>Duplantier: TAIWAN -- 4/22/96</title></head>

<h2>
TAIWAN
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The missile tests and naval exercises that China conducted in March 
were meant to intimidate the people of Taiwan, and certainly 
accomplished that objective. But they may have had another, unintended 
impact: reminding the rest of the world that the People's Republic is not 
to be trusted.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On Taiwan, the people enjoy freedom of speech, freedom to choose their 
politicians, and the freedom to engage in a market economy," says Robert 
Morris, chairman and president of America's Future, the producer of this 
broadcast. "On the mainland, in the People's Republic of China, people 
are repressed politically and economically by a brutal communist 
dictatorship. Any dissension results in jail." The dramatically superior 
living conditions of the free Chinese on Taiwan are a daily affront to the 
mainland communists.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's missile testing exercise amounted to a de facto blockade of the 
sea and air lanes leading to Taiwan, which derives 40 percent of its gross 
domestic product from exports. Shipping had to be diverted from the 
country's two major ports, and air flights had to be re-routed. The 
psychological impact was even greater. The Taiwanese stock market has 
fallen 625 points since China's first series of threatening missile tests in 
July 1995, dropping 62 points in one day after the second series of tests 
was announced in March. "There have been shows of force before," says 
Morris, "but not in recent history has anything so directly affected 
Taiwan's commerce and its people."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Taiwan is an "unlikely success story," observes Morris. "Isolated off the 
south coast of China, the 19,000-square-mile island has blossomed into a 
free and vigorous country. It had become by 1990 the world's 13th-
largest trading nation. During the postwar period, its economy grew more 
rapidly than that of any other nation -- an annual average of over eight 
percent." Morris reports that Taiwan's west coast "is covered with all the 
trappings of a successful industrialized nation. Everywhere new suburbs 
have sprung up, linked by modern highways. Rice farms, dating back 
hundreds of years, now sit next to new, modern factories that ship 
products worldwide."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Morris says Taiwan's 21 million people "increasingly enjoy a lifestyle 
similar to those in the West. Its per capita annual income of $11,000 
ranks it among the world's top 25 nations, and stands in sharp contrast to 
the mainland average of $370." But the freedom and prosperity of 
Taiwan are "threatened by the hostile People's Republic of China, with a 
nuclear arsenal and the world's largest armed force. The communists 
maintain unbendingly that Taiwan is no more than a breakaway province, 
arguing that the free Chinese must acknowledge Beijing's sovereignty 
and submit to 'peaceful unification.'"
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Morris of America's Future recommends that the United States 
"increase arms sales to Taiwan and help the free Chinese create a modern 
defense system." He says the United States "should also expand 
economic and trade cooperation, and encourage other nations to accept 
Taiwan into the world community."

<h2>
CHINESE BANDITS
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
The communists in China may have nothing but contempt for the 
democratic values of the West, but that doesn't stop them from lusting 
after the prosperity that only a free society can attain.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China long to get their hands on the wealth of Hong 
Kong and Taiwan. They don't seem to understand how that wealth was 
created, or how quickly it would evaporate under communist control. Nor 
do they realize that China itself could be equally prosperous, if they 
would only allow their people the freedom to enjoy the fruits of their own 
labor.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The communists in China also covet the wealth of the United States. 
Since they're not willing to take the steps necessary to create such wealth 
in their own country, however, they've decided to steal ours. The Chinese 
government is actively pirating products and technology patented, 
copyrighted, and trademarked in America. The Chinese have stolen 
computer programs, pharmaceutical products, agricultural chemicals, 
musical recordings, videos, automotive designs, and other intellectual 
properties created by, and rightfully belonging to, American citizens and 
businesses.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These works of genius are a tribute to the remarkable potential of our 
free-enterprise system. They are the envy of the world, and a mainstay of 
our economy. They are, of course, available for sale to China. And China 
is certainly welcome to compete fairly with us by creating similar 
products on its own. That would involve hard work, however, and a 
liberalization of the Chinese economy that might prove dangerous for the 
slave masters in Beijing. So, instead, China simply copies American 
products illegally. Chinese factories churn out counterfeit CDs, videos, 
and computer programs by the thousands every day, selling their bootleg 
booty around the world.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These Chinese bandits are undermining the markets of American 
manufacturers to the tune of $1 billion per year. That's how much their 
piracy of U.S. intellectual property is estimated to cost our economy in 
lost exports. Lost exports mean lost jobs, in this case as many as 20,000. 
Unfortunately, American businessmen anxious to tap into the vast 
Chinese market are playing right into the hands of these conniving 
thieves. The experience of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation is just 
one example of how Chinese communists deceive American businessmen 
in order to steal U.S. technology and equipment. By pretending to be in 
the market for a fleet of passenger planes, the Chinese were able to 
negotiate rock-bottom prices on the items that they really wanted -- U.S. 
equipment that would enable them to augment their military capabilities. 
Once they had that equipment in hand, they canceled the order for planes.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year, U.S. negotiators persuaded the Chinese to sign yet another 
agreement promising to put an end to their piracy. Getting them to sign 
was easy. Getting them to honor the agreement is another thing. U.S. 
officials keep threatening to impose trade sanctions, but the Chinese don't 
take them seriously, and go right on stealing.

<h2>
REP. SMITH ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
During hearings last May on the coercive population control program 
that Communist China has conducted for at least two decades, the 
chairman of a House Subcommittee posed the question. Should such a 
monstrous abuse of human rights affect our relations with that barbaric 
country?
</blockquote></i>

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Christopher Smith, chairman of the House Subcommittee 
on International Operations and Human Rights, began his opening 
remarks by noting that Communist China "routinely compels women to 
abort their 'unauthorized' unborn children. The usual method," he 
observed, "is intense 'persuasion' using all of the economic, social, and 
psychological tools a totalitarian State has at its disposal. When these 
methods fail, the woman is taken physically to the abortion mill. Forced 
abortions are often performed very late in pregnancy, even in the ninth 
month." The final indignity is forced sterilization for the woman or her 
husband.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Forced abortion was properly considered a crime against humanity at the 
Nuremberg war crimes tribunal," Congressman Smith continued. "It is 
employed regularly with chilling effectiveness and unbearable pain upon 
women in the People's Republic of China. Women in China are required 
to obtain a birth coupon before conceiving a child. Chinese women are 
hounded by the population control police and even their menstrual cycles 
are publicly monitored as one means of ensuring compliance. "
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressman Smith reported that the communist government in China 
has recently "issued a new law on eugenics which is now taking effect 
and which nationalizes discrimination against the handicapped. In a move 
that is eerily reminiscent of Nazi Germany, the Communist Chinese 
Government is implementing forced abortion against handicapped 
children and forced sterilization against parents who simply do not 
measure up in the eyes of the State. Despite all of this," said Smith, "the 
United Nations Population Fund continues to provide funds, materiel, 
people [and the] shield of respectability that the Chinese program so 
desperately wants."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Smith chastised the head of the UN Population Fund for insisting that 
China's birth control program is voluntary. "This is unmitigated nonsense 
and a big lie," said the congressman. "Degrading a few men, women, and 
children may be of no great matter for the Chinese communist regime, 
which has long regarded homicide and torture as among the basic tools of 
statecraft," conceded Smith, but that doesn't explain the willingness of 
Westerners to overlook -- or even facilitate -- such abuses. "So the most 
shocking thing about forced abortions and sterilization in China is not 
that they happen," said Smith, "but that otherwise humane societies such 
as the United States might forcibly return people who have managed to 
escape from them."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is exactly what our current government has done. "The Clinton 
administration, which campaigned on a human rights platform that was 
justly critical of some of the refugee policies of its predecessors," said 
Smith, "quickly reversed course and began mass forcible repatriations of 
people who had escaped from China." The President has thus made the 
American people a party to the slaughter of innocents in China.

<h2>
CHINA VS. CHILDREN
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
Thousands of children will die in communist China's state-run 
orphanages this year, and it won't be any accident.

</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A former research specialist with the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 
"Chinese orphans are given sleeping pills instead of food, tied to cribs 
and chairs, left unchanged when soiled, denied medical care, and allowed 
to die of neglect." John Aird, author of a new book called "Slaughter of 
the Innocents: Coercive Birth Control in China," charges that "as many as 
90 percent of the children admitted to some institutions die there." That's 
because "China's leaders consider these children 'surplus' population. 
They try to prevent their birth by forced abortion." Chinese mothers-to-be 
who refuse to submit to government-mandated abortions are fined, 
beaten, imprisoned, and deprived of their homes and property. Even if 
they manage to deliver their babies alive, the newborns are still in danger. 
Writing in the April issue of The American Enterprise magazine, Aird 
asserts that Chinese doctors "work under orders by the authorities to kill 
all babies born without government permission."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More than 14 million abortions will be performed in communist China 
this year, and American taxpayers will pay for many of them. The U.S. 
Government contributes to the United Nations Fund for Population 
Activities, which supports China's coercive birth control program. "When 
the coercion in the program became undeniable in 1993, statements of 
protest were issued by the Clinton administration," notes Aird. "Yet 
President Clinton then went on to restore U.S. funding," which the 
Reagan administration had suspended in 1985.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Strong words followed by weak actions sending a contrary signal have 
become the standard response of the Clinton administration to human 
rights offenses in China," observes Aird. Why aren't Americans 
protesting our government's support for China's murderous methods of 
undermining maternity? Aird speculates that "the unsubstantiated but 
widely held belief in a world population crisis has dulled public outrage 
over violations of reproductive freedom in China." He also suggests that 
"business interests intent on seeking profits by investing in China's 
booming economy do not want to risk strained relations with China over 
its human rights violations."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whatever the reason, the American people have not sufficiently 
publicized their repugnance for these policies, and the indifference of our 
government has been interpreted as a tacit endorsement of Chinese 
methods. "China's rulers apparently now feel free to expand tyrannical 
practices not only in birth control but also in the treatment of political 
dissidents," observes Aird, and we are in part to blame. "Although 
Chinese leaders say publicly that foreign criticism of China's human 
rights record . . . will not be accepted, China has in practice shown itself 
to be extremely sensitive to determined criticism backed by potential 
actions."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aird argues that the U.S. should "amend our immigration laws to 
recognize persecution under compulsory family planning programs as a 
basis for granting asylum. And we should withhold all funding from the 
United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the International Planned 
Parenthood Federation, and any other organization that provides 
assistance to China's harsh birth control program."

<h2>
MOSHER ON CHINA
</h2>

<P><blockquote><i>  
It's almost too bizarre to be believed, but reports of fetal cannibalism in 
communist China have been confirmed.
</blockquote></i>


<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The rumors circulated for months, and the decent Americans who heard 
them fervently hoped that they were fabricated. Then, documentation 
appeared, and reputable religious and conservative publications had no 
choice but to file their disturbing news reports. The mainstream media 
have yet to acknowledge the unpleasant reality, but even they will not be 
able to ignore it forever.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In an interview published in the January issue of the Rutherford Institute's 
monthly journal, the executive director of Human Life International's 
Population Research Institute confirms that aborted fetuses are consumed 
for health purposes in China and blames the communist government in 
Beijing for making this revolting practice possible. With as many as 14 
million abortions performed in China in a single year, "there's an ample 
supply of aborted fetuses," says Steven Mosher. Noting that the Chinese 
government is "an avowedly atheistic one which regards human beings 
only as highly evolved apes," Mosher argues that the utilitarian mindset 
inculcated in the Chinese people by their government is what "gives rise 
to fetal consumption."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Don't say it can't happen here, because it can. American society is also 
infected with utilitarianism, and the symptoms of this morally bankrupt 
philosophy are all around us. Mosher warns that "there's very little going 
on in China that isn't happening to one degree or another in the United 
States." The Chinese perform late-term abortions, and so do we. The 
Chinese forcibly sterilize women of child-bearing age, and the practice of 
tying tubes without asking is not unheard-of in American hospitals. The 
Chinese use "surplus" babies for cruel experiments, and we use fetal 
tissue from "surplus" babies for our own sickening scientific studies.
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In China," observes Mosher, "the use of ultrasound technology to detect 
defects in the unborn child is very common, and many fetuses are aborted 
for the sole reason that they happen to be female. But in the United States 
it's not illegal to abort children for reasons of gender, and it's quite 
common to abort children because a test has revealed a possible 
chromosomal defect."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China's war on its own children will eventually spread to its elderly. 
Noting that "the population of China is aging more rapidly than any 
human population in the history of the world," as a direct result of its 
coercive birth control program, Mosher predicts that "China's future will 
involve a massive campaign of euthanasia." In fact, the elderly are 
already being denied medical treatment in Chinese hospitals "on the 
ground that treating them is not cost-effective."
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mosher warns that China's self-consuming culture represents "one 
possible future of the United States." He notes that "there is a certain 
element of the radical environmentalist movement which believes that the 
population of the United States . . . should be reduced by half." If we 
don't make a convincing case for life, they may get their wish.

<title>Duplantier: Flat Tax -- 4/29/96</title>

<br></i>

<h2>Flat Tax </h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
"Americans are tired of our oppressive tax code and they want a new 
system. But to get there, they need an honest and open debate. They're 
not getting it from the politicians and the media."
</i></blockquote>


<P> 
Having recognized that they could no longer ignore the subject of the 
flat tax, the mainstream media have recently resorted to their second-
favorite tactic: misrepresenting the issue. They claim that the flat 
tax will hurt homeowners by eliminating the deduction for mortgage 
interest. They suggest that the flat tax will send philanthropy into a 
free fall by eliminating the deduction for charitable giving. They say 
that the flat tax isn't even a tax cut -- and, if it is, well, then, 
it's a tax cut that favors the rich! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Congressman Dick Armey of Texas thinks it's time to set the record 
straight on the flat tax. The House Majority Leader insists that, no 
matter what the media may say, the flat tax is indeed a tax cut: "With 
a flat tax the middle class will pay less in taxes, their wages will 
increase, and they will keep more of what they earn to save and invest 
in their families." If that's not a tax cut, what is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media attempt to foment class envy, but that doesn't change the 
fact that the flat tax does indeed tax investment income. "What it 
doesn't do," says Armey, "is tax it twice." Businesses will continue 
to pay taxes under a flat tax system. Since corporate income taxes are 
paid, ultimately, by investors, the current tax on investment income 
is actually a second tax on the same income. "Under a flat tax," says 
Armey, "all income, including investment income, is taxed once and 
only once." Why should investors be required, as they are now, to pay 
tax on income that's already been taxed? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media resort to scare tactics to unnerve the middle-class 
mortgage-holder, but the fact remains that "the flat tax is good for 
homeowners." Armey argues that the flat tax will "lower interest 
rates, reduce mortgage payments, and put more money in the pockets of 
working Americans." Lower rates, lower payments, more money left over 
-- how can that be bad? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The media cynically assume that deductibility drives donations, but 
Armey argues that "the flat tax will not reduce charitable giving. 
Americans don't consult their tax tables and accountants before 
helping their neighbors in need. As our family incomes increase, so 
too will our generosity." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It doesn't matter what the mainstream media say, because the flat tax 
is an idea whose time has come. Congressman Dick Armey maintains that 
the flat tax is "bigger than any politician. It's bigger than any 
political party. And it's bigger than the Washington establishment. It 
belongs to the American people." Armey argues that "class-warfare 
rhetoric" and "narrow, special-interest propaganda" will only delay 
the day of reckoning. "The American people," he says, "deserve an 
open, honest debate on tax reform. Right now."

<h2>Michael New</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The case of Army Specialist Michael New is a lot more complicated 
than it looks. It involves considerably more than the mere question of 
a soldier disobeying a commanding officer.
</i></blockquote>


<P> 
"The case of Michael New appears simple at first glance," says 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland. "A soldier disobeys a direct 
order and is court-martialed, convicted, and given a bad conduct 
discharge." There's a lot more to it than that, however. "Michael New 
is the first American soldier prosecuted for declining to wear the 
uniform and badge of another government," observes Congressman 
Bartlett. "What is at stake is nothing less than whether we are a 
nation ruled by men, or one ruled by laws."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Bartlett points out that Michael New is a decorated soldier who 
previously served in a United Nations peacekeeping mission. He 
participated in "Operation Southern Watch" in Kuwait in 1993 -- albeit 
"under an American commander wearing his American uniform." Bartlett 
notes that Michael New also agreed to go to Macedonia, as commanded, 
"but questioned his additional orders to wear a United Nations uniform 
including a blue beret and shoulder patch, to rely solely upon a 
United Nations identification card, and to serve under the overall 
command of a foreign officer." New concluded that these orders would 
unlawfully "transfer his allegiance to the United Nations."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As it happens, quite a few of our Congressmen agree with Michael New 
that these orders were illegal. Roscoe Bartlett addresses the issues 
one by one. First, the uniform: "Altering the Army Battle Dress 
Uniform with any foreign badge is prohibited under Army uniform 
regulations." Second, the UN I.D. card: "No American soldier, prior to 
the Macedonia mission, had ever been required to carry and rely upon a 
UN identity card." Third, the question of foreign command: "The 
president as commander-in-chief does not have the authority to deploy 
American soldiers to serve under foreign command."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A number of Congressmen also believe that the mission itself is 
unlawful. The deployment of U.S. troops to Macedonia was "authorized 
and always explicitly defined as a 'Chapter VII' peace enforcement 
operation under the UN Charter," observes Bartlett. "American military 
participation in Chapter VII UN Operations always requires prior 
congressional approval under Section 6 of the United Nations 
Participation Act and under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution." 
Bartlett concludes that "Mr. Clinton's order to deploy American combat 
troops to Macedonia beginning in July 1993 was illegal and 
inconsistent with U.S. statutes and the Constitution."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Roscoe Bartlett believes that "Americans should be grateful for 
Michael New's moral courage to obey his conscience and our 
Constitution." The Congressman has introduced a resolution in the 
House of Representatives called "The American Hero Restoration Act," 
which urges President Clinton to overturn the conviction of Michael 
New and "restore his place of honor in our military." Bartlett says 
it's time to affirm that "American soldiers enlist in our all-
volunteer military to fight for and defend the United States, not the 
United Nations."

<title>Duplantier:  Environmental Phobias  -- 5/1/96</title>

<h2>Environmental Phobias</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
What do radon, second-hand smoke, global warming, and the hole in the 
ozone layer all have in common? Just this: The danger they pose has 
been greatly exaggerated in order to justify some unnecessary 
government action.
</i></blockquote>


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"During 1995, scare stories about a future catastrophic greenhouse 
warming gained much momentum, while at the same time the evidence for 
such warming became weaker and weaker," observes Fred Singer of the 
Science and Environmental Policy Project in a recent Washington Times 
editorial. Those scare stories, unfortunately, provide seemingly 
justification for the Global Climate Treaty. The UN-sponsored 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year approved two 
summary reports that "convey the impression of impending doom and 
provide a spur for hasty and ill-advised action to cut the use of 
energy fuels." The reports created this misleading impression, says 
Singer, by "withholding crucial information (such as that the data 
show a warming rate of zero!)."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Singer points out that 1995 was also the year in which "the production 
of CFCs and other useful chemicals was banned -- in the mistaken 
belief that this policy would avert an epidemic of skin cancer. 
Scientific evidence does not support this hasty action," he says. 
"There is no data to indicate that ultraviolet radiation reaching the 
earth's surface is increasing by even a few percent -- as might be 
expected if the ozone layer were thinning."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In November of last year, the Congressional Research Service released 
a report that reviewed published studies of the effects of "second-
hand" smoke. The report, says Singer, "found no support" for the 
Environmental Protection Agency's 1992 classification of second-hand 
smoke as a "Class A carcinogen" in the workplace. The risk of lung 
cancer posed by second-hand smoke was not statistically significant, 
it turns out, so the EPA simply redefined "statistical significance." 
Singer charges that the EPA "distorted science to establish a 
correlation and suggest a causation that cannot be proven with the 
data at hand."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Also in 1995, evidence was published demonstrating that low levels of 
radioactivity pose no health threat to humans. Ironically, says 
Singer, "the EPA is stirring up more fears just as we learn that 
naturally occurring radon is a very minor risk for lung cancer."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, is the earth getting warmer? No, but this is the excuse used to 
restrict access to energy. Is the ozone layer developing a hole? No, 
but this mythic menace sufficed to prohibit the production of CFCs. Is 
second-hand smoke a statistically significant carcinogen? No, but 
trumped-up findings to that effect could have led to mandated smoking 
bans in workplaces everywhere. Is radon the "number one environmental 
health hazard"? No, but EPA scare tactics will likely make radon 
mitigation a multi-billion-dollar industry. Fred Singer of the Science 
and Environmental Policy Project points out that "environmental 
regulation is now costing the nation more than $150 billion per year." 
That's a cost we can ill afford, especially for imaginary dangers.

<h2>Government Bureaucracy</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Few American taxpayers noticed much difference when thousands of 
government workers were declared nonessential and told to stay home 
until the federal budget crisis could be resolved. The only question 
was, how did so many unnecessary employees ever land a civil service 
job in the first place?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 In a recent editorial in the Washington Times, Gordon Jones of the 
Association of Concerned Taxpayers records the candid observations of 
one federal government employee regarding the low levels of 
productivity among his coworkers. "A large percentage of federal 
workers hurt rather than help get the work done," claims the 
exasperated civil servant, who for obvious reasons prefers to remain 
nameless. (We'll call him J.B., short for Jaundiced Bureaucrat.) J.B. 
complains that the worst one-third of the federal work force "actually 
drains energy and production from the efforts of their colleagues." 
Clearly, it would be better to pay such people to stay home; but, if 
that's the case, why pay them at all?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The worst offenders were probably born that way, but there's something 
about working for the government that devitalizes even the most 
competent and conscientious civil servant. "Most federal workers did 
not start this way," says J.B. "Most walked in the door on their first 
day of federal service with a strong work ethic and an optimistic 
vision of serving their fellow citizens." Eventually, however, "the 
dysfunctional work environment takes its toll. First they lose their 
optimism, and then many lose their work ethic. Why? Because they 
observe many nonproductive troublemakers going undisciplined, and 
hardworking individuals going unrewarded. They learn that the 
personnel policies and processes encourage frivolous grievances and 
insupportable accusations. They learn that, in most cases, it is more 
helpful to your federal career to maintain the status quo."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where are the managers, the persons responsible for motivating the 
work force and assessing individual performance? They're there, all 
right, but they're not doing their jobs. "The word 'management' is 
often used in the federal service by people who do not seem to 
understand what it means," observes J.B. "Individuals selected for 
their political connections instead of their management ability fill 
critical decision-making positions." Such persons are "guided by a 
perspective that demands a short-term 'fix' rather than a longer-term 
solution." The yes men they surround themselves with are happy to 
validate this self-serving approach.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may come as a surprise that many of the idlers feeding at the 
public trough in Washington feel themselves strangely put upon. 
Despite all evidence to the contrary, they're convinced that they're 
underpaid, compared to private-sector employees, and overworked. J.B. 
dismisses these complaints. "An amazing number of federal employees," 
he insists, "could not qualify for jobs in the private sector that 
paid anywhere near our current salaries." With 10 weeks' worth of 
vacation, holidays, and sick leave each year -- and precious little 
expected from him when he does show up at the office -- J.B. confesses 
that he is anything but underpaid and overworked.

<h2>College Education</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
The National Association of Scholars has just published a devastating 
report on the dumbing down of 50 top undergraduate colleges and 
universities in America.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comparing the years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993, the National 
Association of Scholars concludes that students at our country's elite 
institutions of higher learning no longer receive a comprehensive 
liberal-arts education. The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that provide the historical, 
cultural, political and scientific basics of our society.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses plummeted from an average of 10 in 
1914 to fewer than three in 1993. Students are rarely required now to 
take basic survey courses in key disciplines. Few of today's courses 
require prerequisites, thereby diminishing the cumulative impact of a 
college education. In 1914, universities offered an average of only 23 
courses per institution that did not require a prerequisite course; 
today, the number is 582. Only 12 percent of universities now require 
a thesis or comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree. As 
late as 1964, more than half of universities did.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Few colleges teach writing or mathematics any more, a fact that is 
evidenced by the appalling number of graduates who can neither draft a 
coherent memo nor keep a basic ledger. In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; today, it's 
only 36 percent. In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; now, only 12 percent do. As late 
as 1964, more than 70 percent of the institutions required at least 
one course in the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 
34 percent. In 1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required 
history; now only one of the 50 schools has a required history course. 
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the institutions in 
1914; today, not one of the "best" institutions has a literature 
requirement.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has quintupled since 1914. That quantity, unfortunately, 
does not translate into quality. The majority of these additional 
courses feature arcane subjects of interest, and profit, only to the 
dilettantes who offer them. Many courses don't even offer college-
level material, but seek instead to remedy the many deficiencies of 
the average high school education. Sometimes these courses are called 
"remedial," but the institutions prefer euphemisms such as "second 
tier" and "sub-freshman." Unheard of prior to 1939, today such make-up 
courses are offered in 70 percent of the elite universities, and most 
of them award college credit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Association of Scholars concludes that our best colleges 
and universities now turn out graduates who are painfully ignorant of 
western civilization and heritage. They do not learn the highlights of 
our history, they do not understand the implications of our political 
and economic systems, and they cannot appreciate our literary and 
artistic legacies. Because our colleges have failed us, we now risk 
losing the common bond that unites us as Americans.

<h2>Free Trade</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Absolute free trade between countries does not exist. With the 
possible exception of the United States, all manage their trade to 
serve their own national interests.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sovereign countries should establish trade policies that serve their 
own best interests, and they should expect their trading partners to 
do likewise. So-called free trade really makes no sense. Fair trade, 
however, is something different. All countries should be held to a 
certain minimal standard in their trade practices, and those that fail 
to live up to such a standard should be penalized. Many of the foreign 
countries that trade with America routinely resort to unfair 
practices, such as devaluing their currency, nationalizing U.S. 
property, violating agreements, stealing our patents and copyrights, 
and counterfeiting our money. It is absurd to advocate "free trade" 
with countries that engage in such disreputable practices.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Free trade" was the slogan used to persuade Congress to pass NAFTA 
and GATT, but what these treaties have done is put U.S. trade under 
the control of powerful new international bureaucracies. GATT created 
the World Trade Organization, which has a legislature, an executive 
branch, and a judicial system to control global trade. GATT is also 
loaded with 22,000 pages of special-interest provisions. What kind of 
"free trade" is it that provides for U.S. taxpayer subsidies of 
foreign industries and governments?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When it comes right down to it, the NAFTA and GATT gang are really 
protectionists. They use the power of government to protect their 
friends. They could care less about protecting American workers, but 
they didn't hesitate to use U.S. taxpayer dollars to protect New York 
investment banks from the consequences of their bad investments in 
Mexico. The GATT treaty was filled with hidden handouts and 
perquisites for the politically powerful, who trumpeted their support 
for "free trade" without publicizing the potential for profit that 
motivated them.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's Founding Fathers were all avowed protectionists. To a man, 
they believed that protection of American workers and industries from 
cheap foreign imports is essential to our prosperity, our 
independence, and our sovereignty. The first act passed by our first 
Congress established tariffs on foreign goods -- an essential rite of 
passage in the transformation of our country from dependent colony to 
sovereign nation. Unfortunately, for the last 25 years, U.S. trade 
policy has been dominated by giant corporations that want to take 
advantage of cheap foreign labor and still have open access to 
American markets. Congressmen and executive branch officials 
accommodate these interests with the expectation of future employment 
or other consideration from the companies they favor at the expense of 
their countrymen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More and more economists are beginning to recognize that "free trade" 
will bring about the total destruction of the balance between capital 
and labor, allowing capital to squeeze labor costs lower and lower. 
This will drive prices lower too, of course, but lower prices will not 
provide much solace to consumers in the long run, because consumers 
are also workers, and workers without jobs cannot take advantage of 
lower prices.

<h2>MSAs</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
 A march to protest the inequities of managed health care is planned 
for our nation's capital this month. Opposition to the tactics of 
health maintenance organizations is bubbling over.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Health maintenance organizations (known as HMOs) suffer from a built-
in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and the CEOs make more money 
when they deny their policyholders the right to see a specialist. 
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to the problem, however -
- one that would put extra money in the pockets of workers whose real 
wages have declined, and ease the strain of downsizing by allowing 
them to take some of their benefits with them when they leave a 
company.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The solution is Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs), which most 
House Republicans campaigned on in 1994. Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, but Clinton 
vetoed the measure. Then the House passed it again in its health care 
reform bill, which is now pending. But President Clinton and the 
Washington press corps are trying to bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich 
Congress into passing the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill without MSAs, in an 
effort to resurrect the Hillary health-care plan resoundingly rejected 
in 1994.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care: the high cost, the choice of doctors, 
portability, pre-existing conditions, job lock, uninsured Americans, 
gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-payments, paperwork, long-
term care, the looming insolvency of Medicare, and even the decline in 
real wages. Here is how MSAs work: An employer buys his employee a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pays the deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
an individual Medical Savings Account. The employee can use this ready 
cash to visit the doctors, hospitals, and clinics of his choice, and 
the high-deductible policy covers any additional expenses. The 
employee owns his own MSA, and can take it with him when changing 
jobs, thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing 
conditions, and job lock. MSA funds are available for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans or by Medicare. Best of 
all, any MSA funds that an employee does not spend will accumulate in 
his own tax-free, interest-bearing savings account. MSAs thus restore 
consumer discipline to the medical marketplace, providing incentives 
to save.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans. Our present 
system unfairly grants tax-deductibility only to plans owned by 
employers, but not to plans that allow individual employees to own 
their own health insurance, control their own health care spending, or 
set up their own plan. The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-
plated health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
self-employed must buy health insurance with after-tax income. It's 
time for Congress to give us the solution to all these problems: 
Medical Savings Accounts.

<h2>Affirmative Action</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
More and more minority members are voicing their opposition to 
affirmative action, rejecting the patronizing racial preferences that 
are supposed to benefit them in college admissions and business 
employment.
</i></blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February, an initiative prohibiting preferential treatment on the 
state and local level qualified for the November ballot in California. 
In March, a federal appeals court rejected the use of racial 
preferences in determining admissions to the University of Texas law 
school. Even as we speak, legislation is pending in Congress that 
would prohibit the use of racial preferences in the hiring of federal 
employees and the awarding of federal contracts. What's going on in 
the state legislatures, the federal courts, and the Congress?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's happening is that minority members themselves are becoming 
increasingly vocal in their opposition to racial preferences, 
recognizing these condescending concessions as the ultimate form of 
racial prejudice -- and rejecting the pandering posture of the self-
appointed minority leaders who promote them. With this groundswell of 
opposition among the supposed beneficiaries of racial preferences, it 
has now become politically feasible to denounce the injustice of 
affirmative action.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terry Eastland is the author of a new book called<i> Ending Affirmative 
Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice.</i> In a recent editorial in the 
Wall Street Journal, Eastland observes that racial preferences "have 
never enjoyed majority support and are now in serious political 
trouble." For one thing, there's simply no denying that racial 
preferences are discriminatory. "Whatever might be said in support of 
preferences, they necessarily discriminate against those who lack the 
'right' race or sex. There is no getting around this fact," says 
Eastland, noting that the white female plaintiff denied admission to 
the University of Texas law school "had academic credentials superior 
to most of the black and Mexican-American students admitted under an 
affirmative action plan."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While encouraging what is called "reverse discrimination," preferences 
rarely provide any substantial remedy for actual discrimination 
against minorities. "Because preferences are often a response to 
presumed discrimination on the part of a company, a government, or 
society generally, they move the focus away from the real instances of 
discrimination," says Eastland. Not only that, but they tend to 
benefit the most gifted minority members, leaving the truly 
disadvantaged in some ways worse off than before.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Affirmative action has halted, and in fact reversed, progress toward 
the color-blind society that civil rights activists once claimed as 
their goal. "Preferences have made it harder to overcome the tendency 
. . . of judging people in terms of their racial and ethnic groups," 
says Eastland. The irrationality and injustice of affirmative action 
is apparent to any thinking person, and that is why "substantial 
numbers (sometimes large majorities) of those typically eligible for 
preferential treatment -- African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian 
Americans -- tell pollsters they are opposed to preferences." Eastland 
concludes that "only law that neither advantages nor disadvantages on 
account of race or ethnicity is law that can equally protect everyone 
in our increasingly diverse nation."

<title>Duplantier:  Privatizing Prisons  -- 5/9/96</title>

<h2>Privatizing Prisons</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
Privately run correctional facilities are cheaper, and better 
managed, than public prisons. There's only one reason there aren't 
more of them in America: politics.
</i></blockquote>

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Privately owned or operated prisons "are widespread throughout the 
United States," observes Steven Loux, a policy analyst for the 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives. In a report published by the 
Key State's Commonwealth Foundation, Loux presents evidence showing 
that "such private facilities are advantageous to governments because 
they save a great deal of money, perhaps more than 10 percent per year 
in operating costs as compared to equivalent public facilities." Not 
only that, but "private prisons meet, if not surpass, the quality of 
services for prisoners and the protection to the general public 
provided by public prisons."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Loux argues that "government is simply not capable of delivering, 
running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as 
effectively as are private firms." For one thing, government does not 
have the benefit of the price system to help guide its decisions. 
Conversely, the private sector is not subject to the political 
considerations that often militate against cost-effective decisions in 
state bureaucracies. "Since political actors do not suffer economic 
pain from operating inefficient businesses, unlike private actors, the 
temptation to substitute the goals of politically influential players 
for cost-effectiveness is overwhelming," says Loux. "The authorities, 
the executive and the legislature, use their monopoly power over the 
delivery of prison services to assist certain ends -- those of 
politicians, bureaucrats, and prison employees."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even though government itself does not respond automatically to profit 
considerations, it can take advantage of the profit-orientation of 
private-sector suppliers. "Profit can be used to discipline private 
firms in ways that it cannot discipline public bureaucracies," says 
Loux. "In fact, market competition can push private firms to not only 
meet government guidelines, but even exceed them." Such are the 
wonders of renewable contracts. "State bureaucracies cannot be fired," 
Loux laments, "but private firms that contract with the state can."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reason that private prisons are more economical to operate than 
public facilities is not because they pay their employees less. In 
fact, the evidence indicates that "private prison firms generally do 
offer equivalent salaries and benefits for individual employees." Loux 
cites "significantly different benefit programs" and "lower absentee 
rates among private employees" as two of the cost advantages of 
private prisons. "Economies of scale," he adds, "can play a role in 
reducing the cost of private prisons. Private firms can purchase in 
bulk for their entire operation, and can do so with less bureaucratic 
involvement in comparison to public agencies."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are other reasons, as well. Loux notes that "government 
agencies, in their desire to maintain their level of functioning in 
the upcoming year, want to prevent any decrease in their funding. 
Consequently, any surplus funding at the end of the year must be spent 
in some way." Also, "private firms, because they can be terminated and 
because they face competition, have the incentive to cater their 
operations to government cost standards."

<title>Duplantier:  Education Reform  -- 5/10/96</title>

<h2>Education Reform</h2>
 


<P>
<blockquote><i>
During the recent government shutdown, the Department of Education 
determined that 89 percent of its workforce was "nonessential. " Why, 
then, are 4500 extra bureaucrats receiving $240 million a year in 
salaries?
</i></blockquote>



<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United 
States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the 
States and the people, and a Federal Department of Education is 
inconsistent with such principles," claim the sponsors of the "Back to 
Basics Education Reform Act" now being considered by Congress. 
"Tradition and experience dictate that the governance and management 
of schools in the United States are best performed by parents, 
teachers, and communities. The intrusion by the Department of 
Education into education policy has not benefited the quality of 
education in this nation."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reform bill's numerous sponsors claim that the Department of 
Education has "weakened the ability of parents to make essential 
decisions about their children's education and has undermined the 
capacity of communities to govern their schools. In the 15 years of 
its existence," they report, "the Department of Education has grown 
from 130 programs and a budget of $14 billion to over 240 separately 
authorized programs which cost almost $32 billion annually. Meanwhile, 
education performance has stagnated or deteriorated."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reformers in Congress argue that the Department of Education has 
"fostered overregulation, standardization, bureaucratization, and 
litigation in United States education. The Department of Education 
spends large amounts of money on its own maintenance and overhead. As 
an organization, it is inefficient, ill-managed, and wasteful." What's 
the solution? "Only through initiatives led by parents and local 
communities with the power to act can the United States elevate 
educational performance toward an acceptable level. The Department of 
Education," the Congressmen observe, "has been hostile to many 
promising reform ideas."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The stated purpose of the Back to Basics Education Reform Act is four-
fold: "to improve the quality of elementary and secondary and higher 
education programs in the nation; to return the responsibility and 
authority for education to parents, teachers, communities, students, 
and States, and provide them greater control over education spending; 
to ensure that the Federal Government does not overregulate and 
interfere in the decision-making of parents, local communities, 
teachers, and students regarding education; and to ensure that 
Americans are able to compete in the global economy of the 21st 
century."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Back to Basics Education Reform Act would repeal Goals 2000, the 
School-to-Work Opportunities Act, and the National Education 
Statistics Act. It would also abolish the Department of Education. In 
addition, the bill recommends "a review and evaluation as to the 
feasibility of further enhancing the ability of States and local 
communities to fund education by reducing the Federal tax burden and 
commensurately eliminating Federal Government involvement in providing 
grants for education programs." Isn't it time we put an end to Uncle 
Sam's unconstitutional meddling in education -- and give those 4500 
nonessential education bureaucrats a chance to do something productive 
with their lives?

 <h2> MOTHERHOOD II</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>

 
Early in December of 1947, Dr. J.A. MacDougall promised a young  
woman dying of tuberculosis that, if she lived long enough, he'd let her  
leave the hospital for a few hours to celebrate Christmas at home with  
her family. </I></blockquote>
 
The numerous medical procedures the doctors had tried in an effort to  
seal the tubercular cavity in the lower lobe of this 23-year-old woman's  
right lung had failed. "Amazingly, she was still alive on Christmas Eve,  
but just barely," Dr. MacDougall recalled, so he kept his promise to let  
her spend Christmas Day at home with her husband and their only child.  
She was grateful for that brief respite, but continued to decline. By the  
end of February, she was down to 80 pounds, and "new complications  
developed. She became nauseous -- even without food in her stomach." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Dr. MacDougall dismissed as "ridiculous" a colleague's suggestion that  
his patient might be pregnant. "Everything I knew about medicine added  
up to one conclusion: she was so ill, so weak, that she couldn't possibly  
have conceived. Her body wasn't up to it. Nevertheless, I ordered a  
pregnancy test. To my astonishment, it was positive." The doctor and his  
colleagues were confronted with a moral dilemma. "Legally, medically,  
we could have taken the child through abortion; it imperiled a life that  
was already in jeopardy. But we didn't do it," Dr. MacDougall confided.  
The doctors shared the woman's religious objections, but they also were  
convinced that "the operation would kill her [and that] her body would  
reject the child anyway." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Somehow, the woman clung to life -- her own and that of her unborn  
child. "And in late June, 1948, an incredible thing happened," said Dr.  
MacDougall. "She began to eat, and to gain weight. A chest X-ray  
showed that the growth of the TB cavity had stopped. Not long after,  
another X-ray showed why: the diaphragm was pushing up against the  
lower lobe of her diseased lung to make room for the child she was  
bearing. Nature was doing exactly what we'd failed to do: it was pressing  
the sides of that deadly hole together. The child was saving the mother." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

What prompted Dr. MacDougall to recount the details of this amazing  
incident forty years after it occurred? "I'm concerned about the  
liberalization of abortion laws and the growing clamor for even greater  
liberalization," he explained. "I'm against it on medical grounds: a  
doctor doesn't exist to take life, but to save it. I'm against it on religious  
grounds: I believe that human life is sacred, that only He who creates life  
has the right to take it away. I'm against it, finally, because of the case  
I've described. The child didn't destroy the mother. It saved her. Call it  
the will of God; call it human love; call it the mystical quality of  
motherhood, the turning in upon herself to fight still more because she  
had still more to fight for; call it what you will. It happened." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

issue of the Canadian magazine "Family" and was reprinted the  
following December in "ALL About Issues," published by American Life  
League.

<h2> LAW OF THE SEA TREATY</h2>   
<P>
<blockquote><I>
   
The Clinton administration is trying to persuade the United States    
Senate to ratify a United Nations Treaty that Ronald Reagan refused to    
sign, with good reason, fourteen years ago!</I>

Despite abundant resources, America nevertheless lacks certain essential    
minerals, such as cobalt, bauxite, chromium, manganese, and platinum.    
Cobalt is essential for jet engines, magnetic materials for electronics,    
metal cutting, and mineral tools. Bauxite is essential to aluminum, and is    
also important to refractories, chemicals, packaging, mechanical    
equipment, and abrasives. Chromium is essential to metallurgical,    
refractory, and chemical industries. Manganese is essential to steel, pig    
iron, dry cell batteries, and various chemical processes. Platinum-group    
metals are essential to automobiles, chemical processing, the electrical    
industry, and petroleum refining.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
We import most of our manganese from Russia and South Africa. Yet,    
the ocean floor extending from our West Coast to Hawaii is rich in    
deposits of this mineral. U.S. security interests may depend on our access    
to such vital resources at the bottom of the sea, but the financial    
investment required to bring them to the surface is tremendous, because    
the minerals are scattered on the ocean floor at depths of as much as    
20,000 feet. Nevertheless, American mining concerns have the capital    
and the technology to take on this challenge, if they can be assured of    
realizing a profit in the venture.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty, currently being pushed by the Clinton    
administration, would give Third World nations control over the    
development and use of the deep seabed mineral resources now being    
mined by American firms. The Treaty's international controls and    
regulations would hamper the efforts of U.S. ocean-mining companies to    
continue harvesting strategic ocean minerals essential to our industry    
and to our military defense.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would surrender major political and strategic    
advantages to Russia, which is self-sufficient in the minerals that    
America extracts from the ocean floor. The Treaty would deny U.S.    
ownership of ocean minerals, while forcing American companies to use    
their technology and capital to mine these minerals for the benefit of    
unfriendly, anti-American countries.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The Law of the Sea Treaty would establish an International Seabed    
Authority, which would set both general production controls and specific    
production limits for ocean mining sites. Any American corporation    
intent on making the tremendous investment involved in mining the    
ocean floor would first have to seek approval from the Executive Council    
of the International Seabed Authority. If its request is approved, the    
American corporation would begin operations with the understanding    
that one-half of the approved mining tract will be set aside so that an    
international mining operation (set up by the Seabed Authority) can use    
the American company's geological data, technology, and money to    
compete against it!
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
   
The United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty threatens the sovereignty and    
security of our nation. It also jeopardizes the legitimate financial    
interests of U.S. businesses and the health of our country's economy. Any    
American politician who supports this treaty has some explaining to do.

<h2>Moscow Bound</h2>


<i><blockquote>


 
With over 1000 pages, including notes and index, Moscow Bound, by  
Vietnam veteran John M.G. Brown, is the most thoroughly documented  
and comprehensive book ever written about American soldiers who  
disappeared in Soviet captivity from 1918 onward. It's not available in  
bookstores, however, we offer the following excerpt. 
 </blockquote></i>
<P>
"American and Allied war prisoners of 1918-1920 were treated [by the  
Soviets] as potential political assets to be exploited for use in a  
worldwide propaganda war. For the first time, the United States was  
confronted with an ideological enemy that held certain American  
prisoners of war secretly, to gain the use of their minds in understanding  
the enemies of Bolshevism, and which also held other U.S. prisoners of  
war and civilians openly, for use as hostages to gain diplomatic  
concessions and ransom. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The official American response to this situation in 1919 was to 'classify'  
all information about the existence of such prisoners of war, or missing  
men suspected of being held prisoner, as a state secret. The public was  
not allowed to know this fact, which resulted in many misconceptions  
about Soviet methods and intentions. Admission of their existence would  
have revealed the impossibility of recovering the prisoners without  
resorting to another major war, less than a year after the 1918  
Armistice.... 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"At the end of World War II, as the Red Army overran eastern Europe,  
hundreds of thousands of western Allied and American prisoners of war  
and interned civilians were liberated by the Soviets, but many thousands  
disappeared while under Russian control. Faced once again with  
impossible Soviet demands for diplomatic concessions, financial aid and  
other conditions for the release of prisoners they publicly denied holding,  
President Harry Truman chose once again to avoid a military  
confrontation so soon after the Second World War. The entire body of  
information concerning U.S. POWs and MIAs, who had been in eastern  
European German POW camps when the Soviets took control, was again  
'classified' in the name of national security, and remained secret for more  
than four decades to come. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The emboldened Soviets, under dictator Josef Stalin and his successors,  
thenceforth kidnapped American military and civilian personnel,  
including aircrews from U.S. Cold War reconnaissance missions, almost  
with impunity, secure in the knowledge that an unspoken 'wink and nod  
diplomacy' existed between the superpowers: that prisoners thus captured  
would remain secret, and unless publicly acknowledged, were 'gone  
forever.' The results of the Korean War further indicated the United  
States was willing to abandon U.S. prisoners of war known to have been  
alive in Soviet, Chinese and North Korean control, rather than submit to  
blackmail demands that would establish a precedent that the United  
States was willing to 'trade in human lives.' President Dwight D.  
Eisenhower, the former U.S. commander in Europe during World War  
II, this time made the decision that the families of POWs and MIAs held  
in China and Russia should not be informed about the fate of their loved  
ones, since it was then believed that the KGB would never release  
them...." 
 <BR>

<h2>Media Violence</h2>


<i><blockquote>


A new report from Focus on the Family charges that the content of our  
popular media is becoming increasingly violent.
 </blockquote></i>

<P>

"Three decades ago, not one popular song encouraged robbery, rape,  
murder, assaults, or using weapons to settle disputes," says Focus on the  
Family research manager Robert Waliszewski. "In today's popular music,  
all these themes can be found -- and worse! Nothing is taboo.  
Unfortunately, America's streets and neighborhoods increasingly reflect  
this fact. What's more, since violent lyrics are a relatively new  
phenomenon, no one knows the results of raising a generation on this  
type of musical diet. In addition, teenagers have greater access to (and  
are listening to) far more music than they have in past generations." By  
the end of high school, the average teenager has listened to more than  
10,000 hours of rock music. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Waliszewski argues that "television's preoccupation with sex, violence,  
and sexualized violence would have been unthinkable in the minds of its  
early pioneers." But ugliness and depravity are pervasive on television  
today, and "TV talk shows are just the tip of the iceberg." Waliszewski  
warns that "television transmits values that are opposite to those being  
taught at home," forcing children "to choose which message to believe."  
Alarming increases in juvenile delinquency rates would seem to suggest  
that television is winning the values battle. "TV receives the lion's share  
of a young person's attention -- and does so in their most impressionable  
years," says Waliszewski. "By the time the average American child  
graduates high school, he or she will have spent nearly 20,000 hours in  
front of a television" -- twice the amount of time spent in school. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Much of the trash on television is recycled garbage from Hollywood.  
Waliszewski notes that films like "Natural Born Killers" and "Menace II  
Society" have encouraged impressionable viewers to imitate the  
unspeakable violence they glorified. But the ill effects don't end there.  
"For many undetermined others, their values were molded -- causing a  
desensitization toward violence and a loss of respect for society's laws  
and lawkeepers." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Jerry Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family cites research identifying "a  
short-term relationship between playing violent video games and  
increased aggressive behavior in younger children." The data suggest  
that "the ill effects of video games are worse than those of TV because  
children actively control the violence rather than passively view it. In  
other words, the more children practice violent acts, the more likely they  
are to perform violent acts." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The ability to "download" video games is one of the major appeals of the  
so-called Information Superhighway. Thirty million people worldwide  
are now hooked up to the Internet, and video games aren't the only  
noneducational diversion available to them. Pornographers and  
pedophiles are already exploiting the perverse possibilities of electronic  
mail. Waliszewski and Melchisedeck of Focus on the Family warn that  
"parents must not look to the government to protect their children. They  
must take an active role in monitoring" the content of the various  
popular media available in their own homes.

<title>Duplantier: CORPORATE GIVING -- 5/20/96</title>

<h2>Corporate Giving</h2>


<i><blockquote>



You'd think that Big Business interests would support our free   
enterprise system and our constitutional form of government, but they   
don't. In fact, the bulk of their annual corporate giving goes to nonprofit   
groups that promote increased regulation and higher taxes.  

   </blockquote></i>

<P>

An expert on corporate philanthropy claims that "corporate America is   
funding its enemies." Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center reports   
that "many corporations give away their investors' dollars to special   
interest advocacy groups that favor irresponsible government policies   
harmful to a corporation's own best interests." In a recent issue of   
Human Events, Fulk charges that "big business is undermining   
American values by freely contributing to tax-exempt groups that work   
against a free and competitive market." He points out that "tax-exempt   
groups receiving the biggest share of corporate charitable dollars   
repeatedly offer status quo proposals to solve America's most pressing   
problems: racial quotas, increased welfare and entitlement programs,   
higher taxes and more government spending, command-and-control   
environmental laws, and regulations on employers."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


More than 300 nonprofit advocacy groups received contributions from   
America's top 250 corporations in 1993, but only 35 of those groups   
received more than $250,000 apiece. Austin Fulk reports that nearly two-  
thirds of these 35 groups "favor the liberal, tried-and-failed policies of   
bureaucratic government. Groups such as the Nature Conservancy, the   
NAACP, the Center for Community Change, and Planned Parenthood   
get big corporate grants."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Liberal groups with a Big-Government bias aren't the only beneficiaries   
of corporate largesse, however. "Corporations not only fund groups   
working against the general interests of business, but some also support   
radical activist groups that are principled opponents of America's   
enterprise tradition," says Fulk. "Corporate funding, even in small   
amounts, affects the fortunes of radical activists far out of proportion to   
the actual dollar amount. A corporate gift lends respectability to radical   
groups. It gives them a credential so that they can ask other corporations,   
individuals, and grantmaking foundations for funding."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Donations to nonprofit groups that promote big government also   
undermine the work of legitimate charities. "Private charities have a   
record of effectively delivering services," says Fulk. "But too often their   
work is overshadowed by failed government programs that perpetuate the   
social problems they were supposed to address. The mission of charity is   
hurt when government programs replace private programs, and when   
taxpayer funding replaces private contributions and individual   
voluntarism."  
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Austin Fulk of the Capital Research Center urges American investors to   
hold corporate management responsible for foolish and self-defeating   
philanthropy. If managers can't make charitable contributions wisely,   
they should make none at all. "Corporate managements do shareholders   
and the nation a grave disservice when they fund leftist advocacy   
groups," says Fulk. "If the welfare state is to be replaced by an   
opportunity society, support for nonprofit institutions must become more   
discerning. Individuals as well as corporations must champion charities   
and advocacy groups that encourage self-reliance. And they must refuse   
support to nonprofit groups that draw strength from government."

<h2>Holding Criminals Responsible</h2>
<blockquote><i>

Noted criminologists say it's time to quit finding excuses for the   
behavior of criminals and start holding them responsible for their   
actions.  </i></blockquote><P>
  
The criminal shares certain personality traits in common with the   
psychopath, says Robert James Bidinotto, editor of a book called   
"Criminal Justice: The Legal System vs. Individual Responsibility."   
Those common characteristics include: "a short-range, self-indulgent   
outlook on life; a lack of any sense of self-responsibility; the desire to   
manipulate and dominate others through chronic deception and force;   
and the ability to shut off his conscience at will." Treating a person who   
exhibits those traits as though he were a responsible citizen is a grave   
error, and yet, that's exactly what our criminal justice system does.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whether that assumption is warranted in a particular 
Bidinotto asserts that the criminal justice system has been captured by   
"intellectuals in the social science establishment," who have convinced   
themselves -- without any evidence whatsoever -- that the criminal is not   
responsible for his own actions, but that society is somehow to blame.   
This "Excuse-Making Industry," as Bidinotto calls it, has recklessly   
abandoned the punishment of criminals in favor of a fervently hoped-for,   
but ever-illusive rehabilitation. Needless to say, this change in policy has   
found favor with the self-indulgent, irresponsible, manipulative, and   
remorseless personalities who make up the criminal element.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"For the last quarter-century, a network of anti-incarceration, pro-  
prisoner analysts, activists, lawyers, lobbyists, journalists, and judges has   
perpetuated a number of false ideas about crime and punishment in the   
United States," say criminologists Charles Logan and John DiIulio, two   
of the authors featured in the book "Criminal Justice." Logan and DiIulio   
argue that "the consequences of these false ideas have been quite tragic   
indeed," making it easier for criminals to indulge in crime, and   
concentrating crime "in economically distressed inner-city   
neighborhoods, inviting the criminal predators of these areas to   
repeatedly victimize their struggling underclass neighbors."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"When a person commits a particularly sordid crime, his sanity may be   
questioned," but even the most violent criminal "is rational, calculating,   
and deliberate in his actions," observes clinical psychologist Stanton   
Samenow, in another chapter of the book "Criminal Justice." "Criminals   
know right from wrong," Samenow insists. "In fact, some know the laws   
better than their lawyers. But they believe that whatever they want to do   
at any given time is right for them. Their crimes require logic and self-  
control."  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Criminals are not "mentally ill," nor should they be excused as "victims   
of poverty, broken homes, racism, and a society that denies them   
opportunities," says Samenow. "Sociological explanations for crime,   
plausible as they may seem, are simplistic. If they were correct, we'd   
have far more criminals than we do. Criminals come from all kinds of   
families and neighborhoods. Most poor people are law-abiding, and most   
kids from broken homes are not delinquents. Children may bear the scars   
of neglect and deprivation for life, but most do not become criminals."

 SLAVE-LABOR GOODS 
 </h2><blockquote></i><P><I>
Legislators in California and Massachusetts are considering bills to  
prohibit their state governments from buying slave-labor goods. 
 </i></blockquote><P>
Legislation proposed in California requires that all state contracts "shall  
contain a statement in which the contractor attests that no foreign-made  
equipment, materials, or supplies furnished to the state pursuant to the  
contract have been produced in whole or in part by forced labor, convict  
labor, or indentured labor under penal sanction." Legislation proposed in  
Massachusetts would likewise require state contractors to "swear under  
penalty of perjury" that their goods have not been produced by forced  
labor. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch, a nonpartisan foreign policy  
watchdog group, suggests that these proposed bills have been "prompted  
by the Federal government's indifference about slave labor overseas and  
its threat to American workers and firms." While acknowledging that  
"the importation of slave-made goods is banned by federal statute,"  
Olsen argues that "the ban has been easily circumvented by cumbersome  
Customs Service regulations and uncooperative foreign governments.  
The Chinese government," he points out, "has not allowed any  
inspection of its laogai facilities in over a year even though the Customs  
Service has demanded to see numerous ones." Olsen reports that "the  
largest forced labor systems in the world are in China and the former  
Soviet Union. The Chinese laogai factories and farms hold 20 million  
workers, equal in number to the entire workforce of California. Many  
gulags in the former Soviet Union are still in operation." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress has shown much  
concern with "slave labor overseas and its unfair economic threat to  
American workers and firms," says Olsen. At a February 29th World  
Affairs Council luncheon in Los Angeles, then-U.S. Trade  
Representative Mickey Kantor "stated that forced labor was not an issue  
in his bilateral negotiations with China. " Olsen notes that Most Favored  
Nation tariff status "was granted to China in 1994 with no human rights  
reservations as in years before," and he predicts that such reservations  
will again fall by the wayside when China's Most Favored Nation status  
comes up for renewal in June. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Carl Olsen of State Department Watch says that the State Department's  
1992 Memorandum of Understanding with China regarding the  
inspection of suspected slave-labor facilities "has been ignored by the  
Chinese government without any consequence. The State Department,"  
he adds, "has no regulation to avoid purchasing slave-made goods for its  
own use or for foreign aid programs. It does not intend to insist on anti- 
slave labor policies for multinational organizations such as the United  
Nations and the Organization of American States." Olsen also points out  
that "no agency in the federal government has any contract provision,  
regulation, or monitoring program to prevent the purchase of slave-made  
goods or services. For the billions of dollars of purchases overseas for use  
overseas by the Federal government, there is absolutely no prohibition  
under current law against purchasing and using slave-made goods since  
the goods are not imported into the U.S."

<h2>RITALIN</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>
  
  
The Chuck E Cheese pizza chain bills itself as the place "where a kid   
can be a kid. " Elementary school used to be such a place, but not   
anymore. Nowadays, when a kid acts like a kid, the public schools   
diagnose him as having an attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Remember, when you were a kid, how you never ran out of energy? How   
you could never sit still for more than a few minutes at a time? How your   
mind would race from one subject to the next? How you loved to   
daydream? You had no idea you were suffering from a disease, did you?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
As many as two million children have been diagnosed as having   
Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.   
The preferred form of treatment for these alleged disorders is a powerful   
drug called Ritalin -- a Schedule II controlled substance, as are cocaine   
and methadone. The U.S. Department of Education formally recognized   
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as a handicap in 1991 and made   
federal funds available for local school districts to provide special   
educational and psychological services for children afflicted with the   
normal characteristics of childhood. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
Needless to say, many school systems liked having extra cash to play   
with, and were perfectly willing to add special physical and mental   
health programs to their ever-growing menu of services if that was what   
would keep the funds flowing from Washington. Goals 2000 has   
provided a convenient umbrella for new programs in which school health   
officials test children for emotional, social, mental, and physical   
disorders -- and, when they deem it necessary, prescribe and administer   
medications such as Ritalin, Valium, and Prozac. New rules allow nurse   
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs. Goals 2000   
proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, Medicaid,   
Maternal and Child Health block grants, state programs, and private   
foundations. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160; 
  
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education gave the Chesapeake   
Institute of Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two videos called   
Facing the Challenges of Attention Deficit Disorder and One Child in   
Every Classroom. The completed videos included enthusiastic   
endorsements of Ritalin from parents whose children take the drug. A   
PBS documentary subsequently revealed, however, that these same   
parents were board members of a group called Children and Adults with   
Attention Deficit Disorder, which has received cash grants of $900,000   
plus in-kind services from the manufacturer of Ritalin. John Merrow,   
executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that Ritalin is now   
so plentiful that a black market has developed on the school playground.   
At many junior high schools, Ritalin is the first drug a child experiments   
with. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
It's bad enough that the public schools have intentionally dumbed down   
their curricula in order to turn our children into intellectual zombies.   
Now they're pinpointing the kids with energy and spunk and drugging   
them into a state of lethargy. Parents of a child who has been diagnosed   
by school personnel as having Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention   
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should seek a second opinion.

<title>Duplantier "CAREERS" Bill -- 5/24/96	 </title>

<h2>"CAREERS" BILL</h2>
<P>
<blockquote><I>  
  
Americans are lucky to live in a society in which education is available   
to all and the individual is free to choose what he will make of himself.   
In totalitarian countries, the State determines who will get the benefit of   
education and what job opportunities a person will have.</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
There is no clamor in the heartland for radical restrictions on the   
freedom Americans enjoy to improve their minds and plot the course of   
their careers. There is no grassroots support for turning our public   
schools into vocational training centers for a docile national workforce.   
How, then, to explain the progress of the CAREERS bill and the   
Workforce Development Act?
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Under these bipartisan education bills now moving through Congress,   
the Federal Government would collect taxes, issue educational   
regulations, and then pass the proceeds and the power to State   
Governors, circumventing their legislatures altogether. This massive   
legislation would restructure public schools throughout America,   
building on the Goals 2000 and School-to-Work Acts passed in 1994.   
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last   
September by a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S. 143 (called the   
Workforce Development Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2. 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
More than 60 Republican members of the Missouri House of   
Representatives recently fired off a letter to House Speaker Newt   
Gingrich, objecting to the fact that H.R. 1617 "centralizes unprecedented   
powers at the federal level" and "supersedes state laws and further takes   
us, the local elected officials of the people of this state, out of the process   
of education." Noting that the CAREERS act "amends out the state   
legislature, replacing it with the Governor," the State Representatives   
assert that "this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and   
flies in the face of the principle of local control of education." 
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
  
The Missouri Republicans also charge that unelected bureaucrats are   
attempting to grab power over school curricula though a grant   
application process. The grant applications that Governors now submit   
in a bid for federal funds bind the states to conform to "standards" and   
"assessments" written by federal or state bureaucrats insulated from the   
influence of local citizens and their elected representatives. The grant   
applications also bind the states to spend money not yet appropriated by   
their legislatures.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Fourteen California State Senators also dispatched a letter calling on   
Congress to "kill" H.R. 1617. They too objected to the transfer of   
legislative prerogative into the hands of the Governor, and opposed the   
establishment of a "National Electronic Data Base" to monitor the   
progress of students along predetermined career paths.
<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
  
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois voted for the CAREERS bill last year, but   
has since reversed himself. He is now urging the repeal of Goals 2000   
and the School to Work Act, as well as the defeat of H.R. 1617 and   
S.143. Such legislation, he contends, would turn schoolchildren into   
"guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the global labor   
market." Is that really what we want for our children?

<h2>The Working Rich</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There are many kinds of bigotry in the world, but most of them, in 
America at least, are recognized as morally repugnant. There is one kind 
of bigotry, however, that seems to be socially acceptable -- the irrational 
prejudice against people who are wealthy.
</blockquote></i>

The vast majority of rich people in America acquired their wealth the 
old-fashioned way: they earned it. Industriousness, determination, 
shrewdness, and daring -- these are the qualities they cultivated to 
achieve self-sufficiency and, ultimately, abundance. The relatively few 
Americans fortunate enough to inherit great wealth have had to display 
these same qualities in order to maintain their positions. Nevertheless, it 
is quite common -- among people who are lazy, aimless, dull, and timid -
- to bemoan their unfortunate lot in life and rail against the undeserved 
luck of those who happen to be rich.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Economist and syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell has had enough of 
this nonsense. "Far from being the idle rich, those in the top fifth of 
income-earners work more than most people and far more than those in 
the bottom fifth," says Sowell. "They work more time and they have 
more people in the same family working. When people are putting in 
long hours of work often after having put in long years of schooling, 
followed by long years of building up the skills and experience that put 
them where they are today, we are not talking about lottery winners or 
people who got lucky some other way. We are talking about 
achievement. And we are talking about the kind of work that other 
Americans benefit from."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Sowell cites Bill Gates as one man whose wealth is richly deserved. With 
his innovative computer software products, the Microsoft 
multimillionaire has provided enormous benefits, directly or indirectly, 
to every single American. "The economy is not a zero-sum game, where 
every gain is somebody else's loss," says Sowell. "We are all better off 
because of those [supposedly] 'fortunate' people who work long hours at 
difficult tasks that not everyone is capable of doing."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The generation of wealth generally requires long, hard work. For this 
reason, improved economic standing is usually associated with 
advancing age. The rich and the poor "are often the same people at 
different stages of their careers," says Thomas Sowell. "People in their 
60s have earned far more than people in their 20s, even though everyone 
in his 60s was once 20. This is not an injustice by 'society.' It is a 
reflection of the mundane fact that there is a huge difference in 
competence and efficiency before and after spending years doing what 
you do." Precious few people start out rich, and the vast majority of 
Americans who begin their careers in the bottom fifth in income "are out 
of there before a decade has passed. For one thing," says Sowell, "they 
have 10 years more experience at the end of a decade."

<h2> Welfare Reform/PA & OR </h2>


<i><blockquote>


Welfare as we know it is not long for this world. State governments all 
across America are redesigning so-called entitlement programs to make 
sure that they promote self-sufficiency rather than dependence.
</blockquote></i>
 
"Over the past five years a new consensus has emerged in the welfare 
debate," reports Peter Barwick of the Commonwealth Foundation in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. "In sharp contrast to the traditional view of 
welfare as an entitlement," says Barwick, "many experts now agree that 
welfare must require work, and that the single most important step that 
can be taken to reform welfare is to impose up-front work requirements 
on all able-bodied recipients. Support for this view comes not from a 
mean-spirited desire to punish welfare recipients, but from a concern to 
help welfare recipients achieve long-term self-sufficiency."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Barwick argues that the welfare reform plan proposed in Pennsylvania 
"falls short in its effort to replace welfare with work. To his credit, the 
Governor insists that welfare recipients work a minimum of twenty hours 
a week in order to receive benefits. Unfortunately, the significance of this 
requirement is vitiated by the fact that it can be satisfied with all sorts of 
substitute activities." Barwick contends that "the Governor's plan gives 
far too much wiggle room to those who would coddle recipients with 
notoriously ineffective and expensive 'education' and 'training' programs, 
or confine them to public-sector make-work programs which fail to give 
participants marketable skills and experience."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One program that does effectively link welfare to work is Oregon's Full 
Employment model, known as JOBS Plus. This program, Barwick 
explains, "takes the money already allocated for the three largest welfare 
programs -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, and 
Unemployment Insurance -- and uses this money instead to subsidize 
jobs for welfare recipients in the private sector." Having proven quite 
successful during its two years as a pilot program, JOBS Plus is now 
being implemented statewide. Barwick notes that Oregon's Full 
Employment model "has been influential in shaping reform in nearly a 
dozen other states to date."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How does the program work? "Participation in JOBS Plus is required of 
virtually all those who qualify for AFDC, Food Stamps, or 
Unemployment Insurance," observes Peter Barwick. "Participants are 
initially given assistance in finding regular full-time jobs. Those unable 
to find traditional employment are placed in subsidized jobs with private-
sector employers. These employers -- who volunteer for the program and 
have final say in all hiring decisions -- are reimbursed by the state for the 
minimum wage plus the employer's share of Social Security, 
Unemployment Insurance, and Workers' Compensation premiums. 
Subsidized jobs under JOBS Plus are temporary, lasting four months, 
with an optional two-month extension. Employers are free to hire 
satisfactory participants at any time during the process."
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

                                                                           
Poor people crave self-respect just like anyone else. Why not give them a 
chance to achieve it, with welfare reform programs that offer a hand-up 
rather than a handout?

<h2> Welfare Reform/MI & MA</h2>


<i><blockquote>


Why does private charity work so much better than public assistance? 
It's because the private benefactor expects to see results from his 
almsgiving. .</blockquote></i>

Private poverty-relief programs emphasize "character-building, one-on-
one mentoring, and a spiritual dimension," says Lawrence Reed of the 
Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland, Michigan. Government 
relief programs, on the other hand, generally promote the personal 
imperfections that perpetuate poverty. In the April issue of "Alternatives 
in Philanthropy," published by the Capital Research Center, Reed reports 
that his home state has drastically revamped its welfare program. 
"Michigan abruptly ended the General Assistance program for able-
bodied, childless adults in October 1991 and adopted a 'social contract,' 
whereby welfare recipients are expected to seek work, go to school, or 
perform community service in exchange for benefits," says Reed. "Nearly 
25 percent of Michigan's AFDC recipients are now working. This is 
three times the national average."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reed thinks the Governor of Michigan is committed to "further reducing 
the role of government and making welfare a largely private initiative." 
He notes that "a growing number of private initiatives to help the poor 
are already underway, some of which sprouted in direct response to the 
state's abolition of General Assistance." Welfare as it currently operates 
"has produced such disastrous consequences that it's hard to imagine 
how a radical overhaul could make things worse," says Larry Reed. "If 
we revitalize the American ideals of charity and self-help, we might end 
up spending less for success than the government now spends for 
failure."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," David Tuerck of the 
Beacon Hill Institute in Boston reports that Massachusetts began its own 
welfare overhaul in 1995. "Able-bodied welfare recipients whose 
youngest children have entered school must work at least 20 hours per 
week in a job or community service program," notes Tuerck. "Parents 
under age 18 must live with a responsible adult or in a supervised group 
home. They must stay in school or in a GED program." They receive no 
additional benefits for children born after August 1996.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though supportive of these reforms, Tuerck insists that the main 
problem with welfare is the way it is funded. "Under the existing system, 
taxpayers send their money to Washington, where most flows into a 
welfare bureaucracy and only a fraction eventually reaches the pockets of 
the poor." Tuerck would retain taxpayer funding of welfare, but make it 
taxpayer-controlled as well. He proposes that "individual taxpayers, both 
itemizers and non-itemizers, receive a 100 percent federal tax credit for 
contributions to eligible charities for up to 25 percent of their federal tax 
liability." David Tuerck argues that such a tax credit would not only 
increase private charitable giving beyond the level of the current public 
dole, but would also guarantee that a far greater percentage of those alms 
actually reach the intended recipients.

<h2> Welfare Reform/IN, WI, CO </h2>


<i><blockquote>





What is the real purpose of welfare? Is it meant to help the unfortunate 
get back on their feet, or was it designed from the beginning to create a 
permanent underclass? </blockquote></i>
<P>


"The focus of Indiana's welfare policy should be to help families become 
self-sufficient," says Andrew Bush of the Hudson Institute in 
Indianapolis. "Government can best achieve this goal by recognizing its 
own limitations and by drawing on the strengths of charities, 
community-based organizations, and other private service providers." In 
the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Bush reports on the Indiana Independence 
Initiative, a graduated work-based plan that "would dramatically change 
the orientation of welfare." This Initiative would help "able-bodied 
parents find immediate work," says Bush. It also "would open public aid 
to a wide range of non-government service providers that would help 
families pursue self-sufficiency."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Michael Hartmann 
of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute in Milwaukee reports that the 
Badger State "has imposed stringent work requirements on welfare 
recipients and has successfully moved many able-bodied recipients into 
productive work." Wisconsin's welfare caseload fell nearly 25 percent 
during a period in which state caseloads across the country "increased by 
an average of 35 percent." In 1988, Wisconsin implemented the Job 
Opportunities and Basic Skills program, which, as Hartmann explains, 
"required caseworkers to closely monitor and motivate welfare recipients 
in their search for employment." In 1993, the state implemented a 
program called Work, Not Welfare, which "limits AFDC payments to 
two years and offers major job-training services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The state legislature recently approved a new program called Wisconsin 
Works, which provides "four graduated work options" for welfare 
recipients. "Recipients unable to perform self-sustaining work will 
engage in work activities, vocational rehabilitation, and counseling," 
says Hartmann of the first, transitional phase of the program. "Recipients 
will learn work habits and job skills necessary for employment in the 
private sector" by doing community-service jobs in the second phase. A 
period of subsidized employment follows, after which participants "will 
be guided to the best available immediate job in the private sector."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also in the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Tom Tancredo 
and Dwight Filley of the Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado 
point out that social pathologies such as juvenile delinquency, drug 
abuse, teen pregnancy, and welfare dependency have all been linked to 
"the absence of a married father in the household." Given this 
documented correlation, they ask, "why does government policy seem 
geared toward driving fathers away?" Despite the "oppressive burden of 
federal laws," Colorado still has "considerable latitude to end the 
perverse incentives that wreck families and contribute to our social ills," 
say Tancredo and Filley. "AFDC, for example, is a matching fund 
program. If the Colorado legislature refused to fund its share, AFDC 
would end in the state."

<h2> Welfare Reform/WA</h2>


<i><blockquote>
 

Demagogues may dismiss welfare reform as "discrimination against 
families, " but the truth is quite the opposite. </blockquote></i>
<P>
It isn't welfare reform that discriminates against families, but welfare 
itself, says John Carlson of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies in 
Seattle. "A young mother can receive a welfare check only if she doesn't 
marry the father, doesn't live at home, doesn't find a job, and doesn't save 
any money. You can't get much more anti-family than that," says 
Carlson. "Young men who father children out of wedlock don't have to 
take responsibility for their actions. The welfare system does it for them. 
And the mother isn't required to identify the father of the child. Again, 
you can't get much more anti-family than that."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the April issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," published by the 
Capital Research Center, Carlson argues that "we should apply the same 
kind of common sense to welfare reform that we would use if someone in 
our own family experienced trouble." A welfare reform bill now under 
consideration by the Washington State House of Representatives "would 
limit welfare benefits and include an additional period of reduced 
benefits for welfare recipients who are working. Recipients who don't 
look for work would have their benefits reduced. They could save money 
without being penalized, but cash benefits would not be increased for 
recipients who have more children."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the same issue of "Alternatives in Philanthropy," Lynn Harsh and Bob 
Williams of the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington 
agree that the welfare reform proposed in the State House "moves in the 
right direction." It provides for "a maximum of 36 months on 
assistance," requiring recipients to "sign contracts outlining their 
responsibilities" and to "participate in a job-training and job-search 
program." The legislation would require unwed mothers to identify "the 
fathers of their children," while denying cash payments to unmarried 
mothers who are minors. Harsh and Williams recommend that the 
reforms also include stringent enforcement of child support laws, the 
easing of restrictions on adoption, "greater tax incentives for charitable 
contributions," and the changing of program incentives "so that state 
welfare agencies redefine success as the number of people removed from 
welfare rolls and placed in long-term employment." The two policy 
analysts note that "the mere talk of tough welfare reform seems to be 
having an effect. Fewer people are applying for welfare in Washington 
State than last year despite no significant changes in the law or the 
economy."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why not support what works? "Hundreds of charities, nonprofit 
organizations, and private-sector job-training and placement programs 
already serve the needy," observe Harsh and Williams. "Many of them 
have a proven record of operating efficiently and with a high degree of 
accountability. In the long run we advocate abolishing government-run 
welfare entirely. Far from being a cruel or reckless approach, this change 
would help renew our families, neighborhoods, churches, and 
communities -- the institutions best able to serve the needy."

<h2>"McCarthyism" </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
When liberals accuse conservatives of "McCarthyism, " they're 
engaging in the very practice they claim to abhor. They're employing the 
infamous smear tactics of innuendo and guilt by association.
</I></Blockquote><P>


"McCarthyism" is a noxious term, so much so that any public figure 
accused of it becomes an instantaneous pariah. "McCarthyism" is also an 
ironic term, for two reasons. First, Senator Joseph McCarthy never 
engaged in any of the tactics associated with the term "McCarthyism." 
He did not make wild, unsubstantiated charges against hundreds of 
innocent people. He smeared no one. Second, the few dozen government 
employees that McCarthy did accuse of being Communists were just 
what he said they were. There was sufficient evidence at the time to 
warrant investigation of the figures he named. In the last four decades, 
the guilt of these person has been firmly established, and materials 
recently released from Soviet archives only add to the crushing weight of 
existing evidence.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If anything, McCarthy did not go far enough, concludes former FBI 
Assistant Director Ray Wannall. "The National Security Agency's 
release of the 'Venona' documents, intercepted communications of Soviet 
KGB officers in the United States to their bosses in Moscow, suggests 
that McCarthy's charges of government infiltration understated the 
reality," says Wannall. The Venona papers "underscore the fact that our 
government was massively riddled with Americans in high-ranking 
positions who were tilting policy to serve Soviet ends and engaging in 
espionage, including sharing our atomic secrets with Stalinist Russia."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wannall argues that McCarthy had good reason to be "especially 
concerned about the State Department. Not only had the department 
been infiltrated by such high-ranking officials as Alger Hiss," but 
thousands of government personnel "had been merged into the 
department from other agencies following World War II," without first 
being screened for Communist affiliations and other security risks.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1948, two years before McCarthy leveled the charges that provoked a 
storm of simulated outrage, the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities reported that "there have been numerous Communist 
espionage rings at work in our executive agencies which have worked 
with and through the American Communist Party and its agents to relay 
to Russia vital information essential to our national defense and security. 
Russian Communists have worked hand in hand with American 
Communists in these espionage activities."

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the wake of what we knew about communism and how thoroughly 
our government had been penetrated by Soviet agents before Joe 
McCarthy exploded onto the political scene," Wannall observes, "it is 
difficult to understand how so many Americans rallied to the anti-
McCarthy cause, or how the term 'McCarthyism' has taken on such a 
derisive tone." Wannall contends that many of McCarthy's critics were 
"apprehensive about what he might reveal concerning them and their 
friends, and they reacted with fury," using the very tactics that we have 
all been conditioned to associate with Joe McCarthy. History will one 
day record, however, that the only person smeared during the McCarthy 
era was McCarthy himself.

<h2> Truth About Communism </h2>


<i><blockquote>



John T. Flynn did not have access to the Venona documents, but he did 
have plenty of other evidence, when he tried to convince his skeptical 
countrymen of the truly insidious nature of the Communist conspiracy.
</blockquote></i><P>

John T. Flynn knew that "one of the greatest difficulties in explaining 
this menace is the inability of the normal, decent American to fully 
understand the peculiar nature of Communist methods." Nevertheless, in 
a nationally syndicated radio broadcast in 1954, Flynn charged that 
"among us is a sizable number of people [who] hate our American way. 
They want to end our free system and introduce a system more nearly 
resembling that of Russia. The State . . . will be supreme. It will own all 
the large industries . . . and, eventually, everything. This is socialism."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn pointed out that Communists "seldom get elected to office. They 
cannot get power to act, at least not so long as they admit they are 
Communists. So their policy is to deny they are Communists or socialists 
and to insert themselves into influential positions in the Democratic or 
Republican parties and to get into bureaus where decisions on policy are 
made." Once they've weaseled their way in, "they use their weight to 
influence those policies of the government which will serve their ends 
and the ends of Soviet Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn charged that "secret cells began to operate in the important 
agencies of our government" in 1933. By the time of his broadcast, 
eleven years later, "thousands of these Reds had made their way into 
almost all of the most important spots in our government." Ensconced in 
positions of influence, "they took their orders directly from agents of the 
Russian espionage system stationed in New York and Washington."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The alarming extent of this penetration of our government was "brought 
out in a series of investigations in which the members of the House and 
the Senate who made the investigations were pilloried and denounced by 
the same newspapers and political leaders who [later denounced] Senator 
Joseph McCarthy. It was the influence of these cells which enabled the 
Soviet government, when World War II ended, to take over all of Eastern 
Europe and most of the continent of Asia, to penetrate our colleges, our 
public school system, many of our leading magazines and newspapers 
and news services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn recalled Senator McCarthy's famous 1950 speech in which "he 
charged that Communists in the State Department were helping to shape 
our policy in Asia and he put the number of Communists in a position to 
do this at 57. But he did not name them publicly. For this and a 
subsequent speech he was greeted by a storm of abuse." Flynn argued 
that "it takes a brave man to stand up against the savage abuse and the 
underground assaults which these Red conspirators pour out upon any 
loyal American who attempts to oppose them." He expressed intense 
admiration for "the undaunted stand [McCarthy took] against the 
malignant defenders of Russia and their confederates and dupes in the 
United States."

<h2> The Real McCarthy</h2>


<i><blockquote>



What exactly did Senator Joseph McCarthy do to provoke such a storm 
of protest in the early 1950s? Just his job, that's all!
</blockquote></i>
<P>
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, 
Senator Joseph McCarthy was responsible for "watching this vast 
bureaucracy -- to spot graft, incompetence, extravagance, and disloyalty. 
As chairman of this committee [McCarthy was] merely carrying out his 
mandate in searching for cases of disloyalty inside the government." 
McCarthy did not wage his "war on communism any place but inside the 
government of the United States," asserted John T. Flynn in a nationally 
syndicated radio broadcast in 1954.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of the slightly more than 200 witnesses who were examined publicly by 
the committee, more than a third refused to answer, most of whom 
invoked the Fifth Amendment. Flynn reminded his listeners that "almost 
all of these were government workers at various level of importance -- 
and in bureaus or agencies peculiarly subject to secrecy. The evil 
McCarthy [was] shooting at [was] treason. The people he [was] stalking 
[were] traitors -- most of them dedicated to the interest of our deadliest 
enemy at home and in the world, Communist Russia."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to exposing the communist conspirators at the Institute of 
Pacific Relations (who had betrayed China and most of Asia to the 
Russians), McCarthy also uncovered agents in the Government Printing 
Office. "A great number of highly secret documents are printed in the 
Government Printing Office," Flynn observed. "The Senator found there 
persons with impressive records of Communist activity. The FBI had 
reported these persons repeatedly but nothing was done about it." Flynn 
noted that, as a result of McCarthy's investigations, "the entire security 
panel in the department was removed and all the security regulations 
overhauled. The penalty [for stealing secret documents] was changed 
from a few days suspension to dismissal." McCarthy's Committee also 
"conducted investigations at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where highly 
secret radar equipment [was] developed. This resulted in the suspension 
of 33 security risks from this very sensitive U.S. Army spot."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The recently released Venona documents confirm what Flynn concluded 
in his 1954 broadcast: that "the most important objective of the 
Communist conspiracy has been to get Communists or Communist dupes 
inside our government departments. Their aim [was] to keep Russia 
advised of what the American government [was] doing and, even more 
important, to actually take part in shaping the decisions on policy of our 
government. The decisions to abandon Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Eastern Germany, and a part of Austria to Russia 
as World War II ended were all accomplished by Communists and pro-
Reds in our State Department."
<BR>

Infiltration of our government was "the most important enterprise of the 
Communist conspiracy in America," said John T. Flynn. "It has cost 
millions of dollars, the lives of numerous men, and incredible labor and 
patience on the part of the Communist leaders." Flynn insisted that 
"McCarthy was not persecuting radicals or even Communists. His aim 
was only at Communists and spies inside the American government."

<h2> Coreless Curricula </h2>


<i><blockquote>


"In demolishing the notion of a relatively stable body of knowledge, a 
traditional set of disciplines to which developing thinkers must 
apprentice themselves, [American universities] have invited their 
students, though half-formed and ill educated, to indulge in a fantasy of 
their own extravagant powers." </blockquote></i>
<P>

In the Spring issue of the Manhattan Institute's "City Journal," 
contributing editor Kay Hymowitz examines the American university 
system and laments "the complete disappearance of a fixed, coherent 
curriculum and with it any shared notion of the well-educated man or 
woman. All that once ordered higher education -- requirements, majors, 
the traditional disciplines, the core curriculum -- is vanishing into the 
chaos of postmodernism. The structured, comprehensive, directed course 
of study has been replaced by a "do-your-own-thing curriculum."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How do the universities explain this great shirking of their responsibility, 
and the intellectual aimlessness to which they've condemned a 
generation? It's all for the best, they say. They did it on purpose! "The 
college brochures yield plenty of examples of how the academy has tried 
to transform the shattering of the curriculum into a boon for students," 
reports Hymowitz. These glitzy sales packets promise the unformed, 
undisciplined student suffocating amounts of the very things he doesn't 
need: "flexibility, openness, independence, freedom." By encouraging 
their students to believe that "they can, in all their ripe perfection, step 
outside society and each create his own one-man culture," the 
universities renounce their very reason for being, which is to encourage 
breadth of learning and an appreciation for the interconnectedness of 
things. <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"The sheer proliferation of courses . . . amplifies the illusion of 
undergraduate freedom," says Hymowitz, adding that "the hundreds of 
thousands of choices available to students stretch the distribution 
requirement to the borders of triviality." Even when a student is required 
to take a specified number of courses from each of certain broad 
categories -- such as humanities, sciences, and social sciences -- he can 
satisfy the requirement with courses so lame or esoteric that he fails to 
acquire even an overview of the discipline.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


"The myth of the college brochure begins with an illusory student: not 
just independent but self-motivated, passionate, self-aware, well-
informed. Consider instead the reality of the college student just 
graduated from an American public school," Hymowitz urges. "Surveys 
suggest he knows little about, among many other things, American 
history. Does he ponder his ignorance in this area and sign up for an 
American history course? Of course not. The libertarian curriculum 
neglects the obvious: the student doesn't know what he doesn't know. 
Further, he doesn't know what he needs to know to be a well-informed 
member of society. That's why someone invented required courses."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The rapidly multiplying menu of course offerings perpetuates "the 
mystique of specialization, which renders archaic the entire notion of a 
shared world of knowledge," says Kay Hymowitz. "Such an approach, 
with its glorification of unencumbered autonomy and individual choice, 
provides no foundation for social solidarity and active citizenship."

<h2>Great Awakening</h2>


<i><blockquote>


There have been three dramatic religious revivals in American history, 
and some social commentators claim that we are, right now, in the midst 
of a fourth "Great Awakening." </blockquote></i>

<P>


Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition believes that America is "a nation 
in which one becomes American not by accident of birth or by ethnic 
heritage, but by subscribing to an idea." In the April issue of "Imprimis," 
the monthly journal of Hillsdale College, Reed argues that America is 
the embodiment of  "a vision -- a vision of a society based on two 
fundamental beliefs. The first is that all men, created equal in the eyes of 
God with certain unalienable rights, are free to pursue the longings of 
their hearts. The second belief is that the sole purpose of government is 
to protect those rights."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed asserts that our Founding Fathers "possessed a view of the world 
and government that necessarily presupposed a people obedient to an 
internalized code of conduct . . . that made a large central government 
superfluous." That internalized code of conduct is based on the Ten 
Commandments. America was at the outset, and still is, "a nation 
undergirded by faith, built by faith, and enlivened by faith."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, the connection between faith and government "is a 
source of vigorous controversy," says Reed. He notes that "a crucial 
debate rages in the land over the role of religion in our public life and 
the role that religious believers should play in our politics. The religious 
conservative vote . . . is now one of the largest, if not the largest, single 
voting bloc in the electorate." Reed predicts that the election in 
November "will not be decided by the union vote, the feminist vote, the 
minority vote, or the third-party vote. It will be decided by the religious 
vote." The upcoming election will be characterized by "the largest 
mobilization of active religious believers in recent memory. And, if 
history is any guide, this mobilization is the sign of another period of 
great transformation in America, for political change in the United 
States has always been rooted in religious upheaval."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reed concedes that "mainline church membership has declined by one-
fourth" in recent decades. But this decline has been "more than made up 
for by the skyrocketing popularity of conservative and evangelical 
churches in which membership has doubled." What has resulted "is a 
complete transformation of America's churchgoing population. Today, 
the typical American churchgoer is orthodox in faith, traditionalist in 
outlook, and conservative on cultural and political issues. Yet, as active 
religious believers move beyond the pews and into public life, a strange 
and disturbing hostility greets them," says Reed. "People of faith have 
become victims of the worst forms of stereotyping, marginalization, and 
demonology." It's time, he argues, to ''reaffirm the role of religion in 
public life" and to "encourage those with strong spiritual beliefs to re-
enter politics after too many years of self-imposed retreat. Religious 
believers must become full citizens."

<h2>Kinsey Part I</h2>


<i><blockquote>
<p>
Sex education programs in schools across America are based in part on studies published by Alfred Kinsey in 1948 and 1953 called Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.  
</I></Blockquote>
<p> 
Representative Steve Stockman (R-1X) thinks the world-famous Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Indiana should be investigated for possible fraud and criminal child abuse. Late last year, Stockman introduced the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995 ( H.R. 2749), calling for a General Accounting Office probe of the government funded  studies of human sexuality conducted by Alfred Kinsey   
nearly 50 years ago. If the GAO concludes that "criminal wrongdoing or scientific fraud" did occur in the preparation of the Kinsey Reports, then "any organization or school [that] uses these studies, without indicating the unethical and unscientific nature, will be denied federal funds for any educational purpose."  
<p>
Congressman Stockman tried to determine on his own the source for the data in Table 34, a chart in the original Kinsey Report that purported to measure the sexual responsiveness of infants, children, and teenagers. His efforts turned into a wild goose chase. "First, I was told by the Kinsey Institute  that the data were compiled from the notes of a single pedophile who is deceased," recalls Stockman. "But, according to Kinsey's book, the table was composed from the observations of 'several adult males who have had sexual contacts with younger boys."'  
<p>
Either way, Kinsey's research into the sexuality of children -- upon which professionals rely heavily for their understanding of normal childhood development -- apparently rests on the testimony of at least one sexual deviant. "This indicates that the basis of sex education in America is a study of the systematic molestation of children as young as four months old," says Stockman. The only other alternative is that Table 34 is a complete fabrication. "Other scholars who worked  with Kinsey in the early '50s have said that the numbers . . . were made up -- fraudulent research," he observes. Stockman  says the purpose of the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act is "to determine to what extent the United States Government funded these fraudulent and criminal studies and what liabilities should be assessed."  
<p>
In a letter to his colleagues in Congress, Stockman pointed out that the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (known as SIECUS) bases its own widely-used and often-imitated sex-ed programs on the studies of Alfred Kinsey. "These texts," he observed, "form the basis of sex education in the public schools of America." Stockman urged his fellow Congressmen to view a videotape called The Children of Table 34, produced by the Family Research Council. The 30-minute expose charges that data recorded in the Kinsey Reports are based on "systematic molestation of infants and children." The documentary concludes that the evidence of fraud and ethical violations in Kinsey's research  warrants an inquiry into the Kinsey Institute.

<h2>Kinsey, Pt. II </h2>


<i><blockquote>
<P>
According to a videotape expose released by the Family   
Research Council in 1994, Alfred Kinsey's famous research   
on human sexuality was either fraudulent or based on   
"criminal experimentation on children funded by taxpayers. " 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 30-minute documentary entitled The Children of Table 34   
charges that Kinsey incorporated into his research data from   
the rape of children and infants, that he used these records of   
perversion and criminality as the basis for his influential   
observations on normal childhood development, and that he   
not only concealed the full extent of his experiments but   
shielded the adults involved in them from criminal   
prosecution. 
<p>
In a booklet that accompanies the videotape,   
Robert Knight of the Family Research Council observes that   
Kinsey's 1948 report, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,   
and his 1953 study, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female,   
"ignited a controversy over sexual morality that persists to   
this day. Both painted a picture of Americans of all ages   
awash in secret sexual experimentation." The philosophy of   
Kinsey and his cohorts "placed all sexual acts on the same   
moral, social, and biological level." The Kinsey Reports, says   
Knight, "provided the [seemingly] 'scientific' foundation for   
America's sexual revolution."  
  <p>
That foundation remained unchallenged until 1981, when Dr.   
Judith Reisman offered a critique of Kinsey's research at the   
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem. "She began   
asking questions that have yet to be answered," says Knight.   
"How did the Kinsey team obtain the data on children? Did   
parents give consent? Was there any follow-up on the   
recorded experiments? Where are the children now?"  
  <p>
Nearly 10 years later, Dr. Reisman attempted to answer some   
of these questions with a book called Kinsey, Sex and Fraud.   
The book, says Knight, "reveals shocking evidence that   
children were sexually abused by adults in the name of   
science." But that was just the beginning of the tragedy.   
Kinsey's bogus and/or criminal research became the basis for   
a burgeoning sex-education industry. "The Kinsey data are   
the sole source of child sexuality data, since no other   
researchers have been willing to risk criminal prosecution for   
reporting on or conducting systematic molestation of   
children," Knight explains. Kinsey's conclusions "have   
permeated America's educational institutions and are the   
major behavioral model on which sex education programs are   
designed for children."  
 <p> 
Today, sex education programs in schools across America   
"systematically strip children of sexual modesty, ridicule the   
idea of sexual restraint . . . and reduce parents' roles to that of   
consultants, not authorities in their children's lives. The   
[rationalization] for this radical departure from traditional   
sexual morality begins with the Kinsey Reports," says   
Knight. "Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many   
ongoing federally-sponsored research programs," he adds,   
noting that a group with close ties to Kinsey, the Sex   
Information and Education Council of the United States   
(known as SIECUS), was chosen in 1994 "to evaluate sex   
education programs throughout the United States and to make   
recommendations to the federal government."

<h2>SIECUS</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Sex Information and Education Council of the United   
States (known as SIECUS) applauds the dramatic increase in   
the number of states that require or recommend sex education   
in public schools. 
</I></Blockquote><P>

A 1994 SIECUS survey of state sex-ed programs reported   
that 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rieo have   
gotten on the bandwagon since 1986, when only three states   
required such curricula. The focus of the SIECUS   
assessment, however, was on the alleged "shortcomings" of   
the state curricula, as determined by deviations from the   
group's own Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality   
Education, K-12, which SIECUS published in 1991. Those 
guidelines include six "key concepts," subdivided into 36   
topics. The key concepts are Human Development,   
Relationships, Personal Skills, Sexual Behavior, Sexual   
Health, and Society and Culture.  
 <p>
The 1994 SIECUS study, entitled Unfinished Business,   
consisted of three major components: the responses of state   
education officials to a 20-question survey; the analysis by   
SIECUS of various state-developed sex-ed curricula; and   
SIECUS's own recommendations for changing curricula to   
conform with their biases about sex education. Resources   
cited for the study include the Alan Guttmacher Institute,   
Planned Parenthood, the Center for Population Options, the   
National Education Association, and People for the American   
Way. Funding for the study was provided by the Carnegie   
Corporation.  
<p>  
The SIECUS study complained that many state curricula   
guides "omit sexual behavior topics; exclude topics that are   
considered controversial, such as sexual identity and   
orientation and abortion; lack thorough coverage of topics   
throughout grades Kindergarten-Twelve, particularly in the   
elementary grades; and lack [what SIECUS calls] balanced   
coverage of abstinence and safer sex." SIECUS says such   
shortcomings represent "unfinished business."  
<p>  
The study laments the absence from most curricula of   
"detailed age-appropriate developmental messages." That is   
the SIECUS euphemism for statements that lay the   
foundation for easier acceptance of permissive sexual   
practices at a higher grade level. When it comes to coverage   
of sexual behavior, SIECUS complains that most curricula   
are guilty of a "fear-based" approach, which means that they   
emphasize abstinence and portray sex as something more   
profound than a recreational activity. To achieve what   
SIECUS calls "balance," the curricula would have to present   
"safer sex" as a more realistic option than abstinence.  
 <p> 
SIECUS rejects the "just say no" approach in sex education,   
asserting that it does "not provide corresponding refusal skills   
or assertiveness messages." For SIECUS, refusal skills are   
sexual negotiation techniques that students can acquire   
through role-playing and instruction in the art of explicit   
conversation. SIECUS ignores the fact that such techniques   
undermine the natural modesty of children (their most potent   
defense), and the likelihood that mastery of refusal skills   
would enable an aggressive negotiator to overcome them.  
 <p> 
Few sex-ed curricula begin early enough for SIECUS. The   
group deplores the benighted parents and right-wing pressure   
groups that have impeded "comprehensive" sex education.   
SIECUS urges a state-funded effort to combat these so-called   
obstructionists.

<h2>Student Rights</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The education establishment is kicking up a ruckus over a bill   
that received nearly unanimous support in the House of   
Representatives. They're determined to make sure that this   
sensible legislation doesn't get past the Senate.
</I></Blockquote><P>


The Family Privacy Protection Act would prohibit schools   
from questioning minors about political or religious   
affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological problems,   
sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or self-incriminating   
behavior, or their opinions of other family members --   
without first obtaining the permission of their parents. The   
need for such a law is clear when schools make a practice of   
bypassing the informed consent of parents to distribute   
condoms to adolescents and subject even younger children to   
coercive physical exams.  
 <p> 
The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires   
in the public school classroom started in the mid-l 970s and   
led to the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights   
Amendment in 1978, sponsored by former university   
president and Senator Sam Hayakawa. The public school   
establishment was powerful enough to prevent regulations   
from being written until President Ronald Reagan demanded   
them in 1984. National Education Association agents in the   
Department of Education and public school administrators   
nationwide still managed to thwart the enforcement of this   
law.  
  <p>
Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which   
has been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th,   
9th and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents protested the   
survey's invasion of privacy, as well as its underlying   
assumption that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal   
tendencies are normal teenage behavior. They also objected   
to way in which the survey encouraged pupils to inform on   
their parents.  
  <p>
Among other things, the survey inquired about the drinking   
habits of family members, to ascertain if their use of alcohol   
had "repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems."   
Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of   
teenagers are using illegal drugs. Some questions interrogated   
the child about his religion. Certain questions -- particularly   
those relating to severe depression and attempted suicide --   
were undoubtedly traumatic for some children. The survey   
also sought to determine the sexual experience and practices   
of the students. It shouldn't need to be said -- though it   
obviously does -- that public schools have no business   
requiring children to answer any of these nosy questions   
without prior written parental consent.  
  <p>
The purpose of the Family Privacy Protection Act is to   
extend the scope of the law to all surveys and questionnaires   
that are federally funded, not merely those funded by the   
Department of Education, and also to remove some vague   
language that has enabled the public schools to circumvent   
the law for the past ten years. The Senate will no doubt be   
besieged by self-styled researchers whose prurient interest in   
the sexuality of children is facilitated by unfettered access to   
our nation's schools. Let's hope our Senators recognize that   
these schools exist only to educate our children -- not to   
provide a steady supply of guinea pigs for behavioral   
scientists.

<h2>Foreign Aid</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
The Clinton administration would have us believe that U.S.   
foreign aid promotes American interests around the globe,   
but this simply isn't so. Foreign aid is a luxury we can ill   
afford, especially when it has adverse consequences.
</I></Blockquote><P>
Believe it or not, most recipients of U.S. foreign aid vote   
against the United States in the United Nations most of the   
time. Roughly 64 percent did so in 1995, according to a   
recent report from the Heritage Foundation. Policy analyst   
Ryan Johnson offers several disturbing examples.  
  <p>
Nigeria voted against the U.S. 69 percent of the time in 1995,   
but we'll send Nigeria nearly $27 million this year despite its   
lack of support. The top ten countries voting against U.S.   
interests the most -- India, Laos, China, Lebanon, Seychelles,   
Pakistan, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, and Burkina Faso -  
- will receive a combined total of nearly $212 million in   
foreign aid this year. Why are we rewarding these ingrates?  
  <p>
Of-the ten nations receiving the most American aid -- Israel,   
Egypt, Russia, Ukraine, India, Peru, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Haiti,   
and South Africa -- only Israel, Russia, and Ukraine voted   
with us more often than not. Egypt, for instance, will receive   
over $2 billion in aid this year despite voting against us 67   
percent of the time last year. India will collect more than   
$150 million in U.S. aid, after having voted against us 83   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
Russia, surprisingly enough, voted against the U.S. only 33   
percent of the time. It's worth noting, also, that nine of the   
U.S.'s ten strongest supporters in the U.N. are former Soviet   
bloc countries! They are: Tajikistan, Latvia, Georgia,   
Uzbekistan, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and   
Macedonia. Israel, which will receive over $3 billion in aid   
this year, is our strongest supporter, voting with the U.S. 97   
percent of the time.  
  <p>
If the U.N. voting records of aid recipients accurately reflect   
their support for U.S. policies, "the U.S. is not getting its   
money's worth," says Johnson. "There may be many reasons   
why a country votes with or against the U.S. at the UN," he   
observes. "But it is clear from these data that foreign aid does   
not win friends where it counts: in supporting U.S.   
diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations. Clearly, the   
foreign aid program in general, and under the Clinton   
administration in particular, has done little to justify public   
confidence that tax dollars are being used wisely by   
America's foreign aid bureaucracy."  
  <p>
In short, foreign aid is not working. "Why, then, is the U.S.   
spending so much money on countries that obviously care   
little about America's interests abroad? And why is the   
Clinton administration fighting to save this program when   
most Americans are opposed to it?" asks- Bryan Johnson of   
the Heritage Foundation. "Last year, Congress tried to cut the   
U.S. foreign aid budget as part of its plan to reduce wasteful   
government spending and balance the federal budget deficit,"   
notes Johnson. "Because the Clinton administration fought   
these proposals, Congress was unable to make more   
significant cuts in foreign aid."

<h2>Orphanages</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Orphanages filled a vital need in America for more than a   
hundred years -- until meddling do-gooders decided that   
these benevolent institutions were somehow inhumane! 
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In the colonial era small children without parents were taken   
in by relatives or cared for informally by neighbors; older   
children were indentured to a master who would teach them a   
trade," observes Marvin Olasky in the May issue of   
Philanthropy, Culture & Society, published by the Capital   
Research Center. "Apprenticeship bore no stigma since it was   
common to send a child at 13 or so into another person's   
home for training or education; all who had hands capable of   
work were expected to use them at an early age." As of 1800,   
there were no more than seven institutions in America for   
parentless children.  
  <p>
"The number of orphanages grew throughout the first half of   
the nineteenth century largely in connection with an   
outpouring of evangelical benevolence," says Olasky. "Every   
epidemic . . . created orphans and new orphanage efforts; by   
1850 there were between 71 and 77. Individual and church   
contributions paid most of the cost, but it was not-unusual to   
have -municipalities pay up to a third, and for expenses to be   
held down through some work by the orphans themselves.   
The Civil War greatly expanded demand for orphanages, and   
the supply skyrocketed to over 600 by 1880. Character as   
well as quantity changed, however," says Olasky, noting that   
"in the late 1800s children of destitute single parents   
increasingly found their way to orphanages."  
  <p>
What was life like in these institutions? "Orphanage directors   
during the second half of the nineteenth century saw their   
mission as not merely furnishing basic material needs but   
creating model American citizens," says Olasky. "They tried   
to instill virtues such as thrift, self-reliance, and sobriety, and   
to create a capacity for hard work; they believed in busy daily   
routines and strict discipline."  
  <p>
By 1910, there were more than 100,000 children in American   
orphanages. "The word 'orphanage' itself became a   
misnomer," says Olasky, "as children of parents who were   
still living but had problems with finances or alcohol found   
the institutions safer and better than life at home. Yet, even   
though the quality of care was evident to observers, reporting   
of orphanages started to turn negative in tone. Much of the   
criticism had an ideological tinge, portraying [these   
benevolent institutions] as materially satisfactory but   
psychologically inhumane."  
 <p> 
As often happens, yellow journalism set the stage for   
government intervention. "Two White House Conferences on   
the Care of Dependent Children, in 1909 and 1919, bent in an   
anti-orphanage direction," observes Olasky; they concluded   
that "single mothers were to receive financial aid so children   
could stay at home, and orphans or those completely   
abandoned should be placed in foster care." It was not long   
before states took over the task that orphanages had   
performed. Marvin Olasky argues that children were better   
off before the government started running their lives.

<h2>Charity</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Man does not live by bread alone. Why, then, does our   
welfare system offer nothing more? 
</I></Blockquote><P>

In the March issue of Philanthropy, Culture & Society,   
Marvin Olasky argues that "we must go beyond   
sentimentality and learn how to fight poverty the right way,   
the biblical way, the way that was practiced in America until   
recent decades." Olasky says "the reason why government   
welfare programs must be transformed is not that they are too   
expensive. The real problem is that they are too stingy about   
doing what is truly important: treating people as human   
beings made in God's image, not as animals to be fed, caged,   
and occasionally petted." He asserts that "private programs   
can do a better job if they are challenging, personal, and   
spiritual."  
  <p>
So, what did our forebears do differently? "During the l9th   
century, before the federal government ever got involved, a   
war on poverty much more successful than our own was   
waged by tens of thousands of local, private charitable   
agencies and religious groups around the country," observes   
Olasky. He concedes that "poverty fighters a century ago did   
not abolish poverty," but insists that "they witnessed a   
movement out of poverty by millions of people." Attitudes   
were different in those days, among beneficiaries as well as   
benefactors. "The optimism prevalent then contrasts sharply   
with the demoralization among the poor and the cynicism   
among the better-off that is so common now," says Olasky.   
Our forebears "knew that the literal meaning of compassion   
is not just writing a check, but having personal involvement   
with the needy, suffering with them, not just giving money to   
them."  
  <p>
Olasky contends that 19th-century Americans "knew that   
people should be challenged. When an able-bodied man came   
to a homeless shelter, he often was asked to chop wood for   
two hours or to whitewash a building. In that way he could   
provide part of his own support and also help those unable to   
chop. They knew . . . that even the most rundown person is   
not just a taker; he can also be a giver. They knew that   
everyone is made in God's image and is capable of helping."  
  <p>
America has paid a terrible toll for its forgetfulness. "We've   
forgotten America's past successes in poverty-fighting," says   
Olasky. "The result has been not just the waste of billions of   
dollars each year, but the death of part of the American   
dream." Welfare, says Olasky, "kills dreams." Not only "the   
dreams of poor individuals who gradually become used to   
dependency," but also "the dreams of children who grow up   
without fathers," and countless other dreams that coercive   
measures cannot fulfill.  
  <p>
Olasky reports that "across America people of many faiths,   
income levels, and races are refusing to give up on the dream   
of effective compassion. More people are capturing the   
understanding that the major flaw of the modern welfare state   
is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy. It gives   
the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone."

<h2>Welfare Reform/CA & IL</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
With Congress talking about bloc-granting welfare money    
back to the states, some good ideas are starting to circulate.
</I></Blockquote><P>

There are nearly three million Californians receiving Aid to    
Families with Dependent Children (known as AFDC),    
roughly two million of whom have been on the dole for more    
than two years. "To a large extent, California's history of high    
AFDC benefits is responsible for the entrenched cycle of    
poverty that many now decry," say Sally Pipes and Katherine    
Post of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco. A    
new proposal by the California Department of Social    
Services is designed to break that "cycle of poverty" by    
substantially reducing benefits.   
   <p>
"Benefit levels would be lowered and one standard payment    
set," say Pipes and Post in the May issue of Alternatives in    
Philanthropy, published by the Capital Research Center.    
"Welfare would not pay more than work." This "flat grant"    
would not be affected by "any increase in the number of    
adults or children in the household." Benefits would be    
available for a limited time only. "The grant would eliminate    
eligibility requirements that make aid available only when    
one parent is deceased, disabled, missing, or unemployed,"    
say Pipes and Post. "Eligibility would instead be based on a    
simple income and asset test, as well as on the presence of a    
child under 18 years of age."   
   <p>
In spite of these promising proposals, California has been    
"fundamentally unable to respond to the particularities of    
individual cases. Herein lies an opportunity for philanthropic    
alternatives," say Pipes and Post, who like to stress "the    
importance of private efforts that are successfully addressing    
the critical and massive problem of repairing the damage    
done by the welfare state. Private programs offer powerful,    
individual-oriented approaches that no government initiative    
can match."   
   <p>
Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute in Palatine, Illinois    
argues that welfare reforms in his state don't go far enough,    
and consist mainly of "throwing good money after bad and    
reshuffling bureaucracies." .In 1994, the state's Governor    
proposed "a $5 billion-a-year state-run health maintenance    
organization." In 1996, the Governor proposed "creating a    
welfare super-agency by merging seven cabinet-level    
agencies and many other boards, commissions, and    
programs."   
   <p>
Bast argues that different reforms "could generate much    
greater benefits more quickly." He calls for "health-care    
vouchers that would give the needy a wider choice of medical    
providers and insurers." He proposes that the care of abused    
and neglected children be turned over "to private agencies    
that have a better track record of placing children into safe    
and stable homes." And he suggests that AFDC payments be    
limited to two years and that the state "remove from the rolls    
all those who fail to report to state offices when told to do so"    
for job training and referrals.   
   <p>
The great thing about America is that our 50 states give us    
the chance to address problems in different ways. Welfare is    
a big problem, and we need all the good ideas we can get.

<h2>Welfare Reform/IA &SC</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Iowa and South Carolina offer two examples of innovative   
welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"In 1993, the Iowa state legislature enacted a welfare reform   
program designed to help welfare recipients become self-  
sufficient,'' reports Amy Frantz of the Public Interest Institute   
in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. Writing in the May issue of   
Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the Capital   
Research Center, Frantz relates that Aid to Families with   
Dependent Children (known as AFDC) "was replaced with   
the Family Investment Program [which] provides cash   
benefits to participants based on their assets, income, and   
family size." Participants in the program "must sign a   
contract, called the Family Investment Agreement, in which   
they promise to participate in Iowa's employment program,   
Promise Jobs." The program provides such services as   
"education and job training, resume writing, and [instruction   
in] interviewing techniques."  
  <p>
Participants in the Family Investment Program "must agree to   
meet a timetable for achieving self-sufficiency,'' says Frantz.   
"Those who refuse to sign a Family Investment Agreement   
must enter a Limited Benefit Plan. This pays reduced benefits   
for three months, then terminates all benefits." Under-aged   
parents who have not yet finished high school "must pursue   
their diplomas to receive benefits."  
  <p>
Frantz reports that "Iowa has also created programs that   
allow private organizations to help those in the Family   
Investment Program." Individual Development Accounts, for   
example, "are held by low-income individuals and can be   
used for post-secondary education, the purchase of a home, or   
starting a small business," says Frantz. "In addition to funds   
that individuals contribute to [these accounts], community-  
based organizations can provide matching funds."  
  <p>
Also in the May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Mike   
Hubbard of the South Carolina Policy Council Education   
Foundation in Columbia reports that South Carolina "has   
joined a growing number of states that have enacted major   
welfare reform. Last year, the General Assembly passed the   
Family Independence Act, requiring the South Carolina   
Department of Social Services to reorient its mission from   
distributing welfare checks to helping welfare recipients find   
jobs." The state must obtain "waivers from certain federal   
laws and regulations," however, before it can implement   
some of the proposed reforms. "Unfortunately," says   
Hubbard, "the Clinton administration is fighting the state   
over most of these, delaying the full impact of reform."  
  <p>
The Family Independence Act redefines success for state   
agencies as "a shrinking caseload and an increase in the   
number of recipients placed in jobs," Hubbard continues.   
"Benefits are limited to 24 consecutive months," and new   
applicants for welfare must "prove they have been looking   
for work." South Carolina goes to great lengths to facilitate   
that job search. "The state helps recipients relocate to areas   
with better job opportunities," for example, and offers   
employers "a tax credit for hiring and maintaining   
recipients." The program is practical rather than sentimental,   
however. "Teenage unwed mothers must live with a parent or   
guardian," says Hubbard, and fathers who fail to pay child   
support have their drivers licenses and other sporting and   
professional licenses revoked.

<h2>Welfare Reform/GA & OH</h2>
<i><blockquote>
<P>
Georgia and Ohio offer two examples of how states are  
moving toward welfare reform.
</I></Blockquote><P>

"Many of the welfare reforms implemented in Georgia in  
recent years lack the boldness of initiatives in other states and  
contain too many exceptions to be truly effective," contends  
Kelly McCutchen of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation in  
Atlanta. Nevertheless, they have had an effect, combining  
with a bustling economy to reduce the welfare rolls by 6,000  
families in a single year. 
 <p>
"Probably the greatest problem facing Georgia's welfare  
system is the state's illegitimacy rate," says McCutchen in the  
May issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, published by the  
Capital Research Center. The state began to address this  
problem in 1994 by denying cash benefits "to unwed teen  
mothers who choose to live on their own," notes McCutchen.  
"The following year, the number of teen mothers living  
independently dropped by 50 percent." In 1996, the state  
stopped its perverse practice of increasing benefits "to  
welfare recipients who have additional children." 
 <p>
The state should not encourage illegitimacy, nor should it  
subsidize indolence. "Able-bodied welfare recipients who  
quit or refuse to take full-time jobs face a reduction in  
benefits,'' says McCutchen. Under the state's latest initiative,  
called Work First, Georgia is "advising social workers that  
finding jobs for recipients is their number-one objective. It is  
also offering businesses tax credits and subsidies, giving  
them an incentive to hire and train welfare recipients." 
 <p>
McCutchen argues that there are "three key elements of  
welfare reform." The first is establishment of paternity. "The  
state," she says, "must send a clear message to teenage boys  
that they will be held financially responsible for any children  
they engender." The second key element of welfare reform is  
benefit reduction. "Welfare recipients should not be better off  
than those who work," she says. The third element is a work  
requirement. "Welfare recipients must not be allowed to stay  
at home and collect benefits." The ultimate objective of  
welfare reform, however, is to get community-based  
organizations back in the driver's seat. "When government  
moved into social welfare," notes McCutchen, "other  
institutions -- families, businesses, churches, and charities --  
were shunted aside. They must once again assume primary  
roles." 
<p> 
In the same issue of Alternatives in Philanthropy, Samuel  
Staley and Douglas Hyne of the Buckeye Institute for Public  
Policy Solutions in Dayton report that General Assistance in  
Ohio "began to be phased out in 1992 and was eliminated in  
1995. This has already saved the state $900 million," they  
observe. Ohio has also implemented a program called JOBS,  
which stands for Job Opportunities and Basic Skills. The  
program "requires a large number of welfare recipients to  
enroll in job-training programs. Refusal to participate results  
in a loss of welfare benefits,'' say Staley and Hyne.  
"Combined with state-mandated self-sufficiency contracts  
that outline steps recipients must take to prepare for  
employment, Ohio's JOBS participation sanctions are  
considered some of the toughest in the nation."

<h2>Anticipating "The Pacific Century"</h2>

     It's become faddish in our lifetimes to name each decade
     according to its defining characteristic. One presumptuous
     prognosticator has preempted this process by naming an entire
     century, before it begins.
<p>
     "During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has
     shifted," observes Jesse Helms. "And it will continue to move
     eastward away from Europe, toward Asia," says the senior Senator
     from North Carolina, "because, as the nations of Eastern Europe
     and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to
     break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking
     care of business at home." This historic shift will usher in what
     Helms calls "The Pacific Century."
<p>
     How will this affect America? It should redound to our benefit.
     "The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40
     percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has
     outpaced trade across the Atlantic," says Helms. "Thankfully for
     the United States -- though the political and economic center of
     gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we
     remain uniquely positioned . . . at the center. The United States
     thus remains the world's anchor."
<p>
     Senator Helms warns, however, that the United States "cannot be
     the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the
     world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the
     world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of
     the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and
     military might and right, an example towards which all others
     aspire."
<p>
     Current U.S. leadership is not setting that example. "In just a
     few short years, the Clinton administration has managed to warp
     U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United
     States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula.
     Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling
     ourselves down the road to irrelevance," says Helms. "In China,
     the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for
     dealing with areas of key interest to the United States. On the
     Korean peninsula, this administration has given lip service to
     our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North
     Koreans." Helms says the U.S. must preserve "its role in the
     dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and
     we must stand up for them."
<p>
     It is in America's best interests to "maintain open and peaceful
     shipping waters for trade" in the Pacific, says Helms. It is
     vitally important that we "maintain a strategic balance among
     China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia." It
     behooves us to "push for more open, less regulated markets for
     U.S. goods and services," and to "show the nations in the region
     that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and
     multilateral agreements." Helms stresses that we should
     "strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in
     the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather
     than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market
     share."

<h2>Big Government Destined For Ashbin</h2>


     Containing the threat, refuting the notion that its triumph was
     inevitable, seizing the moral high ground, defunding the enemy --
     these tactics toppled the Soviet empire and won the Cold War.
     They could also put an end to Big Government in America.
<p>
     "The old Republican coalition of northerners, big business,
     farmers, and professionals has given way to a modern Republican
     coalition of individuals and groups who share a common goal: They
     all want to be left alone by the government," says Grover
     Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in the May issue of
     Imprimis, the monthly publication of Hillsdale College. This
     "Leave Us Alone" coalition consists of taxpayers, property
     owners, small businessmen, gun owners, home schoolers, and other
     pro-family, traditional values conservatives -- all of whom want
     government out of their pockets and off their backs.
<p>
     "The Left as embodied in the Democratic Party is a 'Takings'
     coalition," says Norquist, "made up of groups that want the
     government to take things -- usually money -- from other
     Americans and give it to them. This coalition includes government
     workers, unions, government contractors, corrupt big-city
     machines, federal grant recipients, left-wing intellectuals, and
     both wings of the `dependency lobby' (those locked into welfare
     dependency and those who earn a handsome living managing that
     deliberately never-ending dependency)." This coalition is also
     home to "the radical utopians who wish to use the power of the
     state to restructure society. They include the radical leaders of
     the feminist, homosexual, environmentalist, and animal rights
     movements."
<p>
     The "Takings" coalition is shrinking. The "Leave Us Alone"
     coalition, on the other hand, continues to grow, built, as it is,
     "around a single political principle consistent with American
     history and tradition -- that government should be limited and
     the people free." Norquist says this coalition has "embarked
     consciously on a four-part strategy to defeat the Washington
     establishment and the old Democratic majority. It is the same
     strategy that successfully broke the back of the Soviet empire."
<p>
     As it applies to Big Government in America, containment means
     firm opposition to tax increases. Norquist notes that more and
     more of our elected representatives are getting on the tax-ban
     bandwagon. As for inevitability, it's not the triumph of
     socialism that looms before us, but "devolution of power to the
     states, a private Social Security system, school choice, and
     welfare reform." The Right succeeded in seizing the moral high
     ground with "principled opposition to the welfare state's
     destruction of lives." Defunding the enemy is all that remains.
     "Conservatives," Norquist observes, "are beginning to cut off the
     flow of tax-payer funds and coerced labor union dues to the
     Left."
<p>
     "Freedom is on the march around the globe," says Norquist. "There
     is a great deal of work to be done, but the imperial city of
     Washington will fall to the forces of freedom just as Moscow did.
     It is as hollow, as brittle, and as bereft of self-confidence.
     The 'Leave Us Alone' coalition is growing, and it is fighting on
     the winning side of history."

<title>Duplantier: Colorado's Amendment 2 -- 7/8/96</title>

July 8, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>Colorado's Amendment 2</h2>

<i>The Constitution of the United States says nothing about homosexuality. 
Under the 10th Amendment, therefore, any efforts to regulate 
manifestations of this conduct should be within the province of the states 
and the people.</i>
<p>
In his vigorous dissent from the Supreme Court's recent decision 
overturning Colorado's Amendment 2, Justice Antonin Scalia described 
the statewide ban on laws providing special treatment for homosexuals as 
"a modest attempt . . . to preserve traditional sexual mores against the 
efforts of a politically powerful minority." Scalia argued that the Court's 
ruling contradicts its own 1986 decision upholding Georgia's anti-
sodomy law "and places the prestige of this institution behind the 
proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial 
or religious bias."
<p>
The High Court ignored the question of "whether there was a legitimate 
rational basis for the substance of the constitutional amendment -- for the 
prohibition of special protection for homosexuals. It is unsurprising that 
the Court avoids discussion of this question," says Scalia, "since the 
answer is so obviously yes. The case most relevant to the issue," he says, 
"is not even mentioned in the court's opinion: In Bowers v. Hardwick, we 
held that the Constitution does not prohibit what virtually all states had 
done from the founding of the Republic until very recent years -- making 
homosexual conduct a crime." Scalia points out the obvious 
contradiction: "If it is constitutionally permissible for a state to make 
homosexual conduct criminal, surely it is constitutionally permissible for 
a state to enact other laws merely disfavoring homosexual conduct."
<p>
Scalia argues that nothing in the Constitution "prohibits what Colorado 
has done here. But the case for Colorado is much stronger than that. What 
it has done is not only unprohibited, but eminently reasonable." He 
recalls how three Colorado cities "enacted ordinances that listed 'sexual 
orientation' as an impermissible ground for discrimination, equating the 
moral disapproval of homosexual conduct with racial and religious 
bigotry." Conceding that "homosexuals are as entitled to use the legal 
system for reinforcement of their moral sentiments as are the rest of 
society," Scalia insists nevertheless that "they are subject to being 
countered by lawful, democratic countermeasures as well. That is where 
Amendment 2 came in. It put directly, to all the citizens of the state, the 
question: Should homosexuality be given special protection? They 
answered no."
<p>
Scalia contends that the Supreme Court decision overturning Colorado's 
Amendment 2 "has no foundation in American constitutional law, and 
barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely 
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any 
substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. 
Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the 
sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an 
appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans 
have employed before. Striking it down is an act not of judicial judgment, 
but of political will."

property, it would possess all the power."</i>
<p>
The League of Private Property Voters periodically releases an index 
recording Congressional votes relating to property rights and rating our 
elected representatives according to their respect for private property. 
"There was a major change in Congress in 1994 and private property 
rights continued to grow as a major political issue during the first half of 
the 104th Congress," reports the League. "Consequently, more and more 
politicians climbed on the bandwagon and proclaimed steadfast support 
of property rights." In their 1995-96 Private Property Vote Index, 
recording 15 House votes and 10 Senate votes, the League documents "a 
dramatic improvement in the House of Representatives, with a modest 
gain in the Senate in the 104th Congress. Private property rights were a 
significant part of the Contract With America in the House," the League 
explains. "However, the Senate slowed progress down significantly."
<p>
The change of party control in Congress brought "many more private 
property advocates into committee chairmanships and other positions of 
power. However, there was a powerful split between Western private 
property advocates and Eastern representatives, who generally have a 
lower awareness of the vital nature of private property rights." The 
League reports that the House and Senate passed bills restricting the use 
of unfunded mandates, thereby slowing "the massive increase in Federal 
regulations which invariably lead to 'taking' private property rights. But 
in the area of regulatory reform, risk assessment, private property rights, 
and wetlands compensation, fast House action was faced with a stonewall 
in the Senate." The League contends that there is "a groundswell of 
support to reform the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 wetlands 
regulations," but warns that "the Green advocacy groups have mounted a 
well-financed counter offensive with great success."
<p>
The League argues that "secure and enforceable property rights are 
necessary for civil order. When property ownership becomes vague and 
unsettled, strife and social breakdown soon follow." The League notes 
that "our free market economy is based on secure and enforceable 
property rights." They point out that "private property is what allows 
people to pursue their own goals, independent of the state or society." 
Contrary to what many people think, private property rights are also 
necessary for the protection of the environment. "When people own 
resources in common, they take as much as they can as quickly as they 
can," the League observes. "Many of the professional environmental 
pressure groups often deny the crucial role of property rights in 
protecting the environment. That is because political power means more 
to them than the health of the environment."
<p>
The League points out that "our system of limited government, including 
our constitutional rights, survives because of the widespread ownership 
of property." If it were not for this widespread ownership, "our 
constitutional rights would become mere paper rights, unenforceable 
against an all-powerful government. That is why the protection of private 
property rights should concern all Americans, whether they own property 
or not."

<h2>
On-The-Job Training
</h2>

<i>The experience a person gains on the job is often worth far more than 
the wages he receives.</i>
<p>
"Some commentators argue that unfair foreign competition and callous 
executives have destroyed the social contract between employers and 
employees," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation in the June 
issue of Policy Review. "Others say that inexorable economic and social 
trends, such as the Information Revolution, are enlarging the prospects 
for highly skilled workers while displacing those with less education." 
There is general agreement, however, "that America must raise the 
educational levels of its workers. But would-be reformers," says Hood, 
"often forget that the largest educational system in the United States is 
neither the public schools nor institutions of higher learning. It is the 
education and training workers receive from their employers or in the 
private marketplace."
<p>
Almost every workplace in America offers endless opportunities for 
"lifelong learning." All that's needed is the gumption to take advantage of 
them. "Workers learn new skills, information, and problem-solving 
strategies virtually every day, in formal courses or on the job," says 
Hood. "Motivated by competition and the search for greater value, many 
businesses try to raise productivity through training programs. In the long 
run, such efforts pay off in larger profits, better products, and higher 
wages." Hood reports that "about 50 million workers received some kind 
of formal training" in 1995, at a cost to their employers of more than $50 
billion. Throw in another $300 billion in informal training, and you've 
got a sizable investment in the American worker.
<p>
This is a win-win situation for employers and employees. "Workers who 
become more skilled in their jobs are more productive," observes Hood. 
"Also, studies show that training can raise employee loyalty and reduce 
turnover, in part because workers often find their skills to be more 
valuable at the firm where they were acquired." College graduates who 
rest on their laurels often find themselves earning less than "workers 
without college degrees who nevertheless have obtained specific training 
for their jobs."
<p>
Of course, employees who lack a basic education and a decent work ethic 
are not likely to benefit no matter how much money is spent on them. 
"Despite this enormous investment in training, many workers have few or 
no marketable skills," says Hood. "The problem is one of wasted 
resources. Public schools spend a tremendous amount of tax money but 
often fail to prepare young people academically to benefit from training 
later on. Government sponsored job-training programs have consistently 
posted mediocre returns on the billions of dollars in tax money they 
spent."
<p>
John Hood argues that "federal and state subsidies encourage students to 
pursue post-secondary training in an inefficient manner. Federally 
guaranteed student loans and generous state subsidies entice students to 
enroll in colleges, but a surprisingly low percentage graduate. The time 
students waste in irrelevant (and often outdated) community-college and 
university classes," he suggests, "might be better spent finding an 
employer that teaches useful skills."

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part I
</h2>

<i>1994 was a watershed year for Republicans, but that dramatic 
Congressional election may have less impact than the changes made on 
the state level.</i>
<p>
"Since the Republican victories of November 8, 1994, the press has 
focused on the dramatic changes in Congress. With a net gain of 52 seats 
in the U.S. House of Representatives and eight seats in the U.S. Senate, 
the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time 
in 40 years," observes Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. 
"Party-switching and special elections have since left the partisan balance 
in the House of Representatives at 236 Republicans to 198 Democrats 
(with one independent); in the Senate, it is 53 Republicans to 47 
Democrats."
<p>
Norquist acknowledges the tremendous impact on national politics of this 
party realignment, but insists, nevertheless, that Washington is not where 
the action is. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist argues 
that "the intense focus on Washington DC has obscured the conservative 
revolution within the states. In some ways, the changes occurring in state 
capitals across the country are even more important than those inside the 
Beltway," he contends. "Conservative reforms at the state level make 
similar efforts in Washington both more likely and, oddly, less important. 
The states have led the way so far, and they are quite prepared to march 
ahead even if the revolution in Washington stalls."
<p>
Norquist contends that "the 1994 shift in partisan control was more 
pronounced at the state and local levels than in Washington. Republicans 
won 24 of 36 gubernatorial races to increase the number of statehouses in 
their column from 19 to 30," he reports. The vast majority of Americans 
"now live in states with Republican governors." This historic, 
comprehensive realignment "affects the content of the policy debate in at 
least two ways. First, it intensifies the pressure from the states for more 
autonomy," says Norquist. "Second, a Republican Congress is more 
likely to fulfill its commitment to 'devolution' knowing that ideologically 
sympathetic governors are at the helm in many key states."
<p>
The example of reform-minded Governors, who practice what they 
preach about cutting big government, may be just what our Congressmen 
need to help them stick to their guns. "In Washington, political reform 
has been frustrated by a recalcitrant Senate and Bill Clinton's veto pen," 
observes Grover Norquist. "Of the Contract with America's 10 specific 
items, Congress has passed only the line-item veto, procedural reforms in 
the House of Representatives, and the Congressional Accountability Act, 
which brings Congress somewhat under the same laws it imposes upon 
business. The House has passed the Balanced Budget Amendment, 
regulatory reform, and other legislation, only to see them watered down 
or stopped in the Senate. Bill Clinton has twice vetoed welfare reform, 
and a relatively narrow tort-reform bill was passed over his veto."
<p>
The states are having more success. "The new generation of Republican 
governors and state legislators is advancing the Republican reform 
agenda," says Norquist, "from tax cuts to tort reform."

<h2>
 States Lead Reform, Part II
</h2>

<i>Don't be frustrated by the slow pace of political reform in our nation 's 
capital. Take heart in the dramatic progress being made by our sovereign 
states.</i>
<p>
"In 1995, while Republicans in Congress were debating a $500-per-child 
tax credit and cutting the capital-gains tax in half, 17 states with 
Republican governors cut taxes," reports Grover Norquist of Americans 
for Tax Reform. Writing in the June issue of Policy Review, Norquist 
notes that, last year, "12 Republican governors took on one of the fiercest 
Democratic special-interest groups -- the trial lawyers -- and won. While 
Congress was only able to enact a very limited reform of frivolous 
stockholder lawsuits, Republican governors made significant strides."
<p>
Tax reform and tort reform are just two of the many historic changes now 
occurring throughout these United States. "The latest Republican anti-
crime agenda has made little headway in Washington, where the Senate 
has failed to act on a package of bills passed by the House," says 
Norquist. "Meanwhile, Republican governors led the way in enacting 
'truth-in-sentencing' laws that require violent criminals to serve at least 85 
percent of their sentences. " A majority of states have also passed 
legislation allowing for the carrying of concealed handguns.
<p>
The states are not waiting for Washington to reform welfare and health 
care, either. "Although Bill Clinton has vetoed the Republican welfare-
reform bill," says Norquist, "Republican governors continue to 
experiment with efforts to free individuals from the dependency of 
welfare." Clinton may have vetoed Medicare reform and Medical Savings 
Accounts, but five Republican governors "shepherded Medical Savings 
Accounts through their state legislatures. These forays into market-based 
health care will have a significant effect on overall medical costs and 
insurance premiums," says Norquist, "contributing substantially to the 
debate in Washington, and perhaps eventually ending the impasse. And, 
when Congress does finally enact reforms in Medicare, the states will 
already have in place the mechanisms to take full advantage of it."
<p>
The states are also outpacing Congress in providing protection for 
property rights. "In March 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives 
passed legislation recognizing that the Takings Clause of the Constitution 
is invoked when government actions destroy or reduce the value of 
private property, not just when the property is physically occupied by 
government. That legislation has not seen final action, of course," notes 
Norquist, but that hasn't stopped the states from pushing ahead. 
"Beginning in 1992, the states began passing legislation protecting the 
property rights of their citizens. To date, 23 states have enacted 
legislation of varying strength, and more efforts are under way."
<p>
Our sovereign states seem to be asserting themselves once again. This 
bodes well for America. "All the Republican governors are traveling in 
the same direction and showing real courage in tackling the special 
interests of the old establishment order," says Grover Norquist. They've 
declared war on the welfare state, and they're not taking any prisoners.

<h2>
Gambling
</h2>

<i>"Roughly three-quarters of all Americans now gamble -- and they have 
an abundance of venues from which to try their luck. Presently 48 of the 
50 states allow one or more forms of legalized gambling."</i>
<p>
"More and more state governments have seized upon legalized gambling 
as a revenue-generating gold mine -- a voluntary tax willingly paid out by 
citizens enamored with visions of quick riches," says Robert Reno of 
Focus on the Family. "This development has reversed government's 
historic position as a gambling regulator. Instead, state governments are 
now pouring resources into promotion and marketing, attempting to 
induce citizens to gamble." Once hooked on the tamer forms of gaming, 
state governments soon lose their resistance to the more intense forms. "A 
state's initial foray into the gambling arena is frequently via a lottery," 
notes Reno. "After an initial flurry of activity, revenues from the lottery 
begin to decline. However, the state becomes increasingly dependent on 
gambling revenues, and therefore must offer other, more attractive, ways 
to entice citizens to part with their money." Reno points out that, "by 
introducing the lottery, government also expands the potential market for 
other gambling ventures." Research shows that "gambling participation 
rates increased sharply as states increased the number of forms of 
gambling allowed."
<p>
Politicians make a lot of extravagant promises to justify the legalization 
of gambling, but somehow the promises don't pan out. "Gambling 
proponents in government frequently justify their stance by noting that a 
significant portion of the proceeds are earmarked for education, public 
works, or other such projects intended to benefit communities," observes 
Robert Reno. "However, they often fail to mention both the unreliability 
of gambling as a revenue source . . . and the fact that diverting gambling 
funds to such projects often yields little, if any, net gain in funding for 
those projects."
<p>
Reno confirms that "the introduction of gambling on a widespread basis 
correlates with a marked increase in crime." For one thing, "gambling 
tends to attract a criminal element." For another, problem gamblers 
frequently "turn to crime to finance their involvement." Researcher 
Robert Reno notes that "one of the alleged benefits often cited by 
proponents of legalized gambling" is that it allows state governments to 
"undercut illegal gambling and thus hinder organized crime." Au 
contraire! "By enlarging the pool of bettors and, at the same time, 
reducing gambling's stigma," says Reno, "the state actually creates an 
increased market for illegal gambling activities."
<p>
Gambling is not the economic godsend the hucksters would have us 
believe. In fact, says Robert Reno, "the net economic effects are often 
negative." That's because "gambling-related jobs tend to be low-paying; 
other businesses suffer from the introduction of gambling; and gambling 
is associated with a host of costly social problems." What does gambling 
really offer? "A legacy of broken families and shattered lives," says 
Reno, "not to mention a price tag to society that runs into the billions of 
dollars. The government's present infatuation with and promotion of 
gambling," he concludes, "is unconscionable in light of the devastation."

<h2>
America's Future's Record
</h2>

<i>America's future depends on Americans who believe in America. That's 
why America's Future was founded fifty years ago!</i>
<p>
When America's Future was founded, fifty years ago, the Second World 
War had just concluded and the United Nations had just been born. The 
Cold War had not yet begun, and neither had the conservative movement. 
Fifty years ago, there were only a handful of conservative, 
constitutionalist, free-market-oriented organizations and publications. But 
the number of liberal, leftist, and crypt )communist groups in America 
numbered more than a thousand.
<p>
Our nation was in transition in 1946, and our enemies were well-
organized. Stouthearted individuals and intrepid organizations were 
needed to defend the American way of life. And so, on April 24, 1946, 
America's Future, a nonprofit educational organization, was founded in 
New York City by a group of businessmen dedicated to the preservation 
of two great fundamental American principles: the competitive, private 
enterprise system that has made our country strong and prosperous, and 
the constitutional form of government that has kept us free from the 
tyranny of dictators or factions.
<p>
From the very beginning, America's Future concentrated its educational 
efforts on the proverbial man-on-the-fence, the uncommitted millions, 
students eager to learn about their country and its traditions, educators 
and ministers (who are the prime targets of the collectivists), parents 
concerned about the future of their children, workers who have benefited 
from the free enterprise system, and voters who control the destiny of our 
nation. Beginning in 1946, America's Future sponsored and produced 
over the ABC Radio Network a Sunday afternoon commentary featuring 
Congressman Samuel Pettengill, a renowned constitutionalist. We also 
began publishing and distributing pro-American books, pamphlets, and 
reprints (now numbering in the millions).
<p>
In the 1950s, one of the country's most influential print and broadcast 
commentators, John T. Flynn, joined forces with America's Future. Flynn 
was a frequent contributor to prestigious national magazines; and his 
book, The Road Ahead, which showed how socialism was creeping 
across England and the United States, sold more than one million copies. 
Flynn pulled no punches. He went behind the headlines to explain the 
real significance of events and personalities. He attacked Big 
Government and Big Business with equal vigor, always from the 
perspective of an unwavering, unapologetic Americanism. His 
commentaries for America's Future, aptly named "Behind The 
Headlines," were soon being broadcast on more than 300 radio stations in 
the Mutual Broadcasting System. Commentaries by Flynn were also 
distributed to thousands of newspapers across the country, with an 
estimated readership of twenty million.
<p>
That's how America's Future began, fifty years ago. Today, with the vast 
majority of Americans now identifying themselves as conservatives and 
the liberal welfare state discredited, we like to think that we can claim 
some of the credit, and we invite you to join us in celebrating the Golden 
Anniversary of America's Future.

<h2>
John T. Flynn on Socialism
</h2>

<i>The former managing editor of the New York Globe, John T. Flynn was 
a frequent contributor to America's most prestigious magazines, the best-
selling author of several books on the evils of socialism, and the 
originator of our Behind The Headlines commentaries.</i>
<p>
"A socialist society cannot be organized and conducted by the federal 
government under our Constitution," wrote John T. Flynn in his book 
called The Decline of the American Republic, And How to Rebuild It, 
republished in condensed form in 1957 in America's Future's All-
American Book Digest. "There is not one sentence in the Constitution," 
said Flynn, "that would authorize the federal government to socialize our 
medical facilities, to regulate or finance our schools, to engage in 
industrial or mercantile enterprise, or to carry on any of that multitude of 
activities which have, as a matter of record, brought the federal 
government into almost every kind of business in one degree or another. 
The great limitations on the federal government; were specifically set 
down in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn pointed out that the Constitution was designed "to bring into 
existence a government that possessed all the powers necessary to defend 
the nation from foreign enemies and to guarantee to all the citizens 
certain great fundamental rights of freemen, and to leave to the states -- 
the several small republics -- the powers essential to the government of a 
free people." The Constitution thus stood as an insurmountable barrier to 
power-hungry socialists -until Franklin Delano Roosevelt acceded to the 
presidency. "Despite all the endless care exercised by the framers of the 
Constitution, and the judgments of the Courts for 148 years," Flynn 
lamented, "the revolutionary elements in the United States found a way in 
which to complete their perversion and subversion of the Constitution 
without submitting these radical changes to the states [which were] the 
only authority empowered to make changes in the Constitution."
<p>
Flynn explained how this was accomplished: "The Supreme Court is 
empowered, under the Constitution, to 'interpret' the meaning of the 
Constitution where questions of judicial differences appear," he observed. 
"It had, according to its time-honored practice, interpreted the 
Constitution to mean what its framers wanted it to mean. There was, 
therefore, but one course open to the revolutionary cabal in Washington. 
It was a plan to change the Constitution, literally to wreck the whole 
fundamental structure of the American government . . . by judicial 
interpretation."
<p>
And so, the safeguards were discarded, and America got its taste of 
socialism. "The vast and compulsive apparatus of government had been 
dismembered by our forefathers and its various parts entrusted to a 
variety of agencies," observed John T. Flynn, to ensure that our federal 
government would never have "sufficient power to oppress the citizen." 
But the power that our Founding Fathers so wisely divided was 
recombined "by the decisions of a group of judges who were put on the 
bench in a revolutionary maneuver to give to words in the Constitution 
wholly new meanings."

<title>Duplantier: World Heritage Areas -- 8/8/96</title>

August 8, 1996</i><br><p>
<h2>WORLD HERITAGE AREAS</h2>

<i>Did you know that the United Nations has sovereign control over 
Yellowstone Park? That's right, the UN, for all practical purposes, owns 
Yellowstone National Park!</i>
<p>
World-famous Yellowstone Park in Montana was visited by UN officials 
last fall, but they weren't there on vacation! Tom Deweese of the 
American Policy Center reports that these internationalist bureaucrats 
were "inspecting a site for a proposed gold mine . . . located on property 
outside of the Yellowstone National Park boundaries." In a recent issue of 
his group's newsletter, called Insider's Report, Deweese revealed what 
these world-governing wannabes were up to. "Radical environmentalists 
who oppose the mine development deliberately brought the UN into the 
debate in an attempt to stop it," he explained. "The decision of the UN 
site inspectors will determine if the mine may be developed. Their 
decision will end the debate."<p>

You heard correctly. This isn't some paranoid, futuristic fantasy. It's real, 
and it's happening right now. The UN is deciding whether or not 
American citizens have the right to put their own property to productive 
use. "What does the United Nations have to do with determining how 
land is used inside United States territory?" you ask. Deweese provides 
the shocking answer. "The United Nations," he says, "has sovereign 
control of Yellowstone Park."<p>

According to Deweese, radical environmentalists "invoked a little known 
treaty called the World Heritage Convention in order to involve the 
United Nations in an internal United States dispute. Jimmy Carter, in 
1978, signed the treaty and thereby designated Yellowstone a World 
Heritage Site. Now the United Nations has ultimate say in what happens 
to the park." Though not on park land, the site of the proposed mine 
happens to fall into the treaty-mandated "buffer zone."<p>

"There are several more World Heritage Sites within U.S. borders," 
observes Deweese. And, if you're not scandalized already, you will be, 
when you hear what two of them are: the Statue of Liberty in New York 
harbor and Independence Hall in Philadelphia! "That's right," says 
Deweese; "the United Nations controls the spot where America's 
Founding Fathers created our nation." In other words, authority over the 
two most famous symbols of our freedom has been ceded to an 
organization that seeks to destroy that freedom.<p>

"The World Heritage Convention is just one of a series of treaties that the 
United States has signed in the past few decades that grant control to the 
United Nations over U.S. law," Deweese points out. "Most of these 
treaties now have programs already in place to grab U.S. soil. And son e 
of these programs are much worse than just taking our nation's 
landmarks. Some have targeted all of the private property in the nation. 
That means your home." Perhaps the worst offender is the UN 
Convention on Biological Diversity, which, Tom Deweese charges, "lays 
down the plans for a 'reversal' of the process of civilization, ultimately 
overseeing the herding of people into pre-selected, isolated enclaves, 
while the rest of America becomes vast wilderness."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Protecting Property Rights -- 8/9/96</title>

<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>

F. R. Duplantier</a><br>    
August 9, 1996</i><br><p> 
<h2> PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>
<i>"The federal government increasingly passes the costs of its policies on 
to private property owners. To protect species under the Endangered 
Species Act, to preserve wetlands under the Clean Water Act, or to effect 
some other such goal, the government typically prohibits or constrains 
property owners from using their property as they wish. "</i>
<p>
"Although the United States was founded on the principle that 
government should not be allowed unfettered power to impose its will on 
law-abiding citizens or seize their property, federal agencies have found a 
loophole that allows them to usurp property through regulation," observes 
John Shanahan of the Heritage Foundation. "These regulatory takings can 
strip any American of the right to use his land as he wishes. In some 
cases, they even can almost wipe out the value of that land -- and, with it, 
the life savings of individual citizens."
<p>
The Private Property Protection Act of 1995, passed by the House last 
year, "would require compensation by the regulating federal agency 
whenever regulatory restriction of property rights under the Endangered 
Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act exceeds 20 percent 
of the value of the regulated parcel," observes Shanahan. The Omnibus 
Property Rights Act of 1995, now under consideration in the Senate, 
"would require compensation by federal regulating agencies whenever 
the taking of some 'portion' of property diminishes the value by 33 
percent."
<p>
Both bills seek to reinforce the U.S. Constitution's unambiguous 
endorsement of property rights. "The Fifth Amendment implicitly 
recognizes that the federal government may take property for public use," 
concedes Shanahan, but "explicitly mandates that government must pay 
the property owner for the land confiscated." It thereby "ensures that the 
cost is borne by those who benefit -- the public -- and not by the citizen 
unfortunate enough to own the land the government requires." Any 
federal regulation that deprives an American citizen of the full use of his 
property violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. "Just 
compensation for regulatory takings preserves individual civil rights," 
argues Shanahan, noting that "property rights are essential to preventing 
the usurpation of other rights under the Constitution."
<p>
Imagine the consequences if there were no Fifth Amendment. "If 
government had a free hand to take property without payment, the 
incentive to confiscate property that conferred only a small public benefit 
would be overwhelming," says Shanahan. "In fact, that is exactly what 
has happened. The federal government now owns 30 percent of 
America's land, with even higher percentages in the West, and is using 
regulatory takings with increasing frequency to enhance its effective 
control over even more extensive tracts."
<p>
Compensation requirements are needed to discourage the federal 
government from confiscating property. The problem today, says John 
Shanahan, is that "federal enforcement officials have found that they can 
use regulations to gain control of property while circumventing the just 
compensation requirements of the Constitution. Federal property rights 
legislation thus is needed to provide a standard that will force federal 
regulators to consider the costs and benefits of taking private property."

<title>Duplantier: NEA Resolutions -- 9/05/96</title>

 <i> September 5, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NEA Resolutions </h2><p>                           




<i>The National Education Association maintains one of thefive largest federal Political Action Committees in the country. The teachers union donated 99 percent of its PAC money to the Democrats in 1994 It's important to know, then, where this influential group stands on various issues.</i><p>


Ninety-one percent of the nine thousand delegates attending the NEA convention in Washington DC over the July Fourth weekend voted to endorse Bill Clinton for reelection as President of the United States. Clinton was on hand to accept the NEA's Friend of Education Award, and to present his plan for education reform, which included Internet access for every public school classroom in America, tax credits for anyone wanting to attend a-cornmunity college, and a $10 million program to combat truancy. The President proposed financial penalties for mothers and fathers who miss parent-teacher conferences, or whose children skip classes. He also recommended that the government provide "intensive counseling" for such parents.<p>

Resolutions approved at the 1996 NEA Convention were more circumspect than last year's bombshells, but they still exhibited hostility to traditional values and the rights of parents. Needless to say, the delegates called for increased federal funding for public education, in particular for programs designed to alleviate "sexual orientation discrimination." They argued that the "immigration status of students or their parents" should have no bearing on eligibility for public school attendance. And they insisted that privatization, performance contracting, tuition tax credits, and voucher plans are "detrimental to public education and must be eliminated."<p>

NEA delegates endorsed "early childhood education programs in the public schools for children from birth through age eight." Such programs would include "a full continuum of services for parents and children, including child care, child development, developmentally appropriate and diversity-based curricula, special education. and anorooriate bias-free screening devices."<p>

 

NEA delegates asserted an "increasingly important role" for public schools in providing sex education. "Teachers and health professionals," they contend, "must be legally protected from censorship and lawsuits." Otherwise, they might have to think twice about offering instruction in birth control usage and perverted sexual techniques. "To facilitate the realization of human potential," the delegates proclaimed, "it is the right of every individual to live in an environment of freely available information, knowledge, and wisdom about sexuality." The delegates also called for "comprehensive AIDS education programs as an integral part of the school curriculum."<p>

The NEA insists that homeschooling students "meet all state requirements. Instruction should be by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum approved by the state department of education should be used." Less adamant about holding its own members responsible, the teachers union opposes "standardized testing that is mandated by local, state, or national authority [and] the use of these tests to compare one student, staff member, school, or district with another." Not surprisingly, NEA delegates resolved that "competency testing must not be used as a condition of employment, license retention, evaluation, placement, ranking, or promotion of licensed teachers."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Separating School & State -- 9/06/96</title>

<h2> Separating School & State </h2><p>                           



<i>The federal government doesn't run the churches in America Why should it run the schools?</i><p>

"In America, we don't use the government to run the churches; and, considering our diversity, we have admirable religious harmony," observes Marshall Fritz in the July issue of The Freeman. Fritz believes that "this 'hands-off" policy is America's greatest gift to the human race." He recommends that the policy be extended to the field of education, as well, calling for "the separation of school and state."<p>

A former Christian school principal, Fritz is the founder of the Separation of School and State Alliance, which advocates the dismantling of the public school system in America. "People have long pondered why parent-funded private schools seem to work fairly well . . . and tax-funded public schools seem to be going downhill at an increasing speed," Fritz remarks. "In fact, public-school educators are scrambling to imitate the non-essential features of private schools. Some call for uniforms, son e want 'values' programs, all clamor for fewer layers of administration in their hopes to reverse their downward plunge. The stampede has gone so far that even union leaders are calling for . . . 'more choice and market dynamics."' They just don't get it, says Fritz. "In their call for 'market dynamics,' union leaders miss the real secret of success of parent-funded schools: parental responsibility."<p>

This, Fritz declares, is "the key difference between tax-funded and parent-funded schools. Parent-funded schools have a high percentage of parents who are fully exercising their parental rights in education, and tax-funded schools have few such parents." Fritz explains that "parents who directly provide for their children's education sacrifice. That act both reflects and influences their attitude about their children's education. In contrast, paying taxes . . . is neither investment nor sacrifice. One is not deferring gratificat on, but merely avoiding pain. Coercion is central to the financing of tax-funded schools," Fritz contends, "whereas deferred gratification, usually based on hope and love, is the financing source of parent-funded schools."<p>

Fritz argues that government, as "the great enabler of irresponsibility and dependence," has created "an epidemic of parental irresponsibility." Nor will parents learn to be responsible again until they are forced to "pay the price of irresponsibility." Fritz argues that parent-funded schools succeed because they "have love as part of their culture; it starts with their financing. Tax-funded schools have coercion as part of their culture; it also starts with their financing. In education, like so much of life, love works. Coercion doesn't."<p>

While recognizing that "our forebears had the wisdom and courage to end government-compelled church funding, attendance, and practice," Marshall Fritz says we should go them one step better and prohibit government from "compelling school funding, attendance, and curriculum. Only with the separation of school and state," says Fritz, "can we re-establish parental responsibility, protect parents' rights, and enable schools, teachers, and students to flourish in an environment of educational freedom."<p>

 <i> September 9, 1996<p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Facts </h2><p>                           


<i>When it comes to environmentalism, the popular wisdom, more often than not, is wrong</i><p>



Pollution is a growing problem, right? Wrong! "The environment is cleaner than at any time in the past halfcentury," observes Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "The average American [today] is exposed to fewer potentially harmful pollutants than at any time since the 1930s. Air and water pollution, which had risen during the 1940s and 1950s, have fallen consistently and considerably since that time. Today, pollution of all kinds is responsible for less than 1 percent of cancer deaths."<p>

Speaking of cancer, aren't cancer rates going up and up? Actually, they're not. "Cancer rates are falling, not rising," says Bast. "We've lived with pesticides, automobiles, and electromagnetic fields for nearly a century. During this period, overall cancer rates among the non-elderly population went down, not up. Cancer rates among the elderly appear to have increased, but this is due partly to better diagnosis and partly to the rapid decline of other causes of death."<p>

So, maybe we're healthier and we're living longer, but an environmental cataclysm is bound to occur eventually, right? Wrong again. "Predictions of impending global ecological disasters are untrue. There is no scientific validity to claims that acid rain, global warming, deforestation, or ozone depletion will cause global environmental disasters at any time in the future," says Bast. "Most environmental problems have been or are being solved. Automobile emissions, for example, have been reduced by 90 to 97 percent during the past twenty years. The threats of deforestation and resource depletion have been eliminated from the developed countries of the world, and remain problems only in Third World countries torn by civil war and acute poverty. Oil spills are less common and cause less ecological harm than in the past. Landfill technology has advanced 'dramatically' in the past decade."<p>

But aren't our resources running out? Won't we have to learn to live with less? No to both questions. "Innovation and the use of reason to solve problems, not any change in human nature or in the amount of natural resources, make us wealthier than our grandparents," says Bast. "The 'gloom and doom' school of thought within the environmental movement systematically overlooks the role of ideas in finding new resources, managing waste, and protecting human health and the environment. Their zero-sum solutions are unnecessary and often don't work."<p>

Prosperity is a mixed blessing, though, isn't it? Not at a 1. "Prosperity is good for the environment," says Joseph Bast. "The fear that prosperity leads to environmentat destruction saturates the literature of the environmental movement. But prosperity has made it possible for us to invest in parks and wildlife preserves, clean our air and water, and treat or store our wastes," says Bast. "Prosperity is not only compatible with a clean environment; it is environmental protection's necessary precondition."<p>

 <i> September 10, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Logic </h2><p>


<i>Protecting the- environment requires accurate information and sound reasoning When environmentalism degenerates into sentimentalism, it winds up doing more harm than good.</i><p>




Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute charges that "the biggest barrier to improving environmental protection . . . is the environmental movement itself." Co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism, Bast argues that "the lack of understanding and critical thinking on the part of most environmentalists has compromised the movement's ability to be an effective force for environmental protection. The popular wisdom on issue after issue," he contends, "bears little resemblance to what objective scientists have to say." As a result, "many environmentalists are wasting their energy -- and the dollars of consumers, businesses, and taxpayers -- fighting nonexistent problems or problems that already are being solved, while bigger problems go unnoticed."<p>

Bast offers a quick course in critical thinking. Lesson Number One: "Correlation is not causation," he says. "Just because two things happen at the same time doesn't mean one is causing the other. We need proof, including a reasonable theory showing the path by which one thing causes another to occur. Most environmental scares -including global warming, electromagnetic fields, and dioxin -- resulted when the correlation of two things was mistaken for causation."<p>

Lesson Number Two: "Not everything can be explained. The truth," says Bast, "is that the causes of most specific cases of cancer, miscarriage, and child deformity in the U.S. are unexplained." He points out that "the victims of these afflictions" are not necessarily "experts on the causes of their illnesses. A victim's guess is no more reliable, and may be less reliable, than the guesses of any other nonexpert."<p>

Lesson Number Three: "Trends can't predict the future. During the 1 970s, global temperatures fell several years in a row and [so-called] 'experts' . . . predicted a new ice age," recalls Bast. "During the 1980s, temperatures rose several years in a row and the 'experts' . . . predicted catastrophic global warming."<p>

Lesson Number Four: "We can never avoid risk completely. Everything we do carries with it some risk," says Bast. "There is no such thing as a product, decision, or action that carries no risk whatsoever. Keep in mind that the risks of drowning (16 in a million), or dying in an accident at home (90 in a million), or dying in an automobile accident (192 in a million) greatly exceed the alleged environmental risks being decried by some organizations."<p>

Last Lesson: "We have to make choices," says Joseph Bast, even when it comes to protecting the environment. "We have to choose among different ways to do it. We can't do everything, all at once, because trying to do so would be extremely wasteful, unnecessarily injure many people, and probably produce unintended consequences that harm the environment. Instead, we must apply the same prudence that we apply to other important parts of our lives. The importance of environmental issues doesn't somehow exempt them from this discipline. In fact, their importance makes careful planning and efficiency all the more necessary."<p>

 <i> September 11 , 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> Environmental Science </h2><p>

<i>Any environmentalist who rejects the scientific method, and the objective truth it leads to, obviously has some other agenda than protecting the environment.<i><p>


"Some environmental groups insist that, unless a substance or action can be 'proven to be harmless' to human health or the environment, it should be restricted or banned. This is an impossible standard to meet," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute. "It is impossible to prove that something does not exist."<p>

This is but one of the many scientific lessons offered in a new book, co-authored by Bast, called Eco-Sanity, A Common-Sense Guide to Environmentalism. The nature of toxicity is another. "The dose makes the poison," says Bast. "Some chemicals can be highly toxic, so it is natural for us to be concerned about their possible effects on human health and the environment. But the real, as opposed to the hypothetical, threat posed by a substance depends on our exposure to the substance, or its dose. Many toxic substances, both man-made and natural, are present in the air, water, and our food, but they are present in such small amounts that only recently have we invented the tools needed to discover their presence. There is little convincing evidence that these substances pose any threat to human health at current levels of exposure."<p>

Extrapolating the results of an experiment from one specises to another may be ill-advised. "Mice are not little men," says Bast. "Experiments on laboratory animals are valuable ways of measuring a chemical's toxicity or its likely effects on wildlife. But such experiments fail to accurately assess human cancer risks. The enormous doses fed to laboratory animals cause tissue damage and stress, which can lead to tumors even if the substance being tested is not carcinogenic at normal doses. Animal tests also assume that mice and humans respond the same way to chemicals, even though mice sometimes respond to chemicals very differently than rats and guinea pigs."<p>

Risk is a relative -- not an either-or -- proposition. "Risks can be measured and ranked," says Bast. "Researchers can measure and compare the risks associated with different courses of action." Reasonable estimates can be used to "rank environmental problems according to how much risk they pose to the environment or our health. This, in turn, helps us prioritize problems and decide where our limited resources would be best spent."<p>

Bias can skew the results of any research effort. "Science is not immune to politics," says Bast. "Most scientific research taking place in American universities is subsidized by the government, which means it is influenced by politics. Some scientists have political beliefs or loyalties that influence their views, especially on subjects outside their area of technical training." A report issued by an independent scientist is "less likely to be politicized" than one issued by a government agency, Bast observes. Either one, however, should be subjected to peer review. Environmental research must not be exempted from rigorous scientific standards.<p>

<h2> Environmental Economics </h2><p>


<i>The free market can protect the environment far better than any government can, so why not take advantage of it?<i><p>



People will take care of the environment voluntarily if they have sufficient incentive for doing so. Property rights provide that incentive. "A property rights strategy works through incentives; government intervention relies on commands," says Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute, co-author of a new book called Eco-Sanity, A CommonSense Guide to Environmentalism. "Ownership leads to better stewardship. We tend to take better care of things we own than of things we only rent or borrow," says Bast. "Natural resources, therefore, are better cared for if they are owned by the people who use them." Not surprisingly, governments tend to prefer a coercive approach, which requires a monitoring system and "an apparatus to punish those who attempt to evade the commands."<p>

For governments, of course, coercion can be an end in itself. The sincere environmentalist, however, has no excuse for succumbing to the totalitarian temptation, once he realizes that compulsion is counterproductive. "Pollution problems occur where rights are not defined and enforced," says Bast. "When things are privately owned, the civil justice system keeps us from invading or damaging them. But, when they are owned in common . . . we are often driven by competition with others to exploit them quickly and with little regard for their future value. The result is often pollution, unsustainable rates of development, and endangerment of wildlife."<p>

The free exchange of the free market "can help solve environmental problems," says Bast. "Transferable property rights enable those who value a resource most highly to bid it away from those who value it less. Potential buyers -for example, nonprofit organizations and clubs devoted to conservation -- can use their property rights to purchase or lease land, reward good stewardship, or purchase covenants that restrict allowable uses of land. Such exchanges reveal the true cost of protecting the environment and ensure that this cost is shared by those who value the environment most."<p>

Because they do not operate according to free-market principles, governments inevitably harm the environment. "Government officials seeks to expand their budgets and authority by delivering short-term benefits to special interest groups," says Bast. "Because they do not own the resources they manage, these officials are unlikely to manage them for maximum asset value." Government' i monopoly status prevents it from comparing "its own efficiency to that of competing organizations. As a result, government agents cannot know how good a job they are doing -- or how much harm they are causing."<p>

The free market encourages efficiency, and that's good for the environment. ''Efficiency means producing the most output with the least input," says Joseph Bast. "Over time, a system that rewards efficiency will also tend to produce less pollution than one that tolerates inefficiency.'' Governments, on the other hand, are notoriously inefficient, and their inefficiency leads to waste and pollution. Environmentalists without hidden agendas should recognize the superiority of the free-market approach.<p>

<title>Duplantier: Recycling -- 9/13/96</title>

 <i> September 13, 1996 </i><p> 
 
<h2> Recycling </h2><p>



<i>There are more than 7000 curbside recycling programs in the United States, with more than 100 million Americans participating. Two questions need to be asked, however: Do these programs work? Are they cost-effective?</i><p>

"Americans seem to be having a love affair with recycling," observes writer Harvey Black in a recent issue of Environmental Health Perspectives. "No longer do people simply look for a refuse container to toss away a used soda can or plastic bottle. They search for the right recycling receptacle. All over the United States, when it's time to take out the garbage, millions of people take out carefully sorted bundles of newspapers and cardboard, bags of aluminum and steel cans, and plastic containers -- all destined for recycling."<p>

The question is, does all this extra effort make any sense? In his article, entitled "Rethinking Recycling," which was reprinted by the Heartland Institute as an antidote to Earth Day propaganda, Black reports that "a number of economists and policy analysts have questioned whether the benefits of recycling outweigh the ease of disposing of waste materials in landfills. Critics say that what seems at first to make a great deal of sense doesn't always stand up to a close examination. For instance, some critics argue that collection costs make recycling a bad bargain for many localities because the costs often exceed the prices that the recyclables bring on the open market. They also charge that operating additional trucks to pick up recyclables increases toxic diesel emissions, offsetting any environmental gains."<p>

Black notes that "forms of recycling have been in use in the United States for almost 100 years At the turn of the century," he observes, "waste paper and rags were used to make new paper when wood pulp was scarce or too expensive. Recycling scrap metal and other materials was an American institution during World War II. And deposits on glass soda bottles in the 1950s and 1960s encouraged people to recycle and reuse them."<p>

These traditional forms of recycling all made economic sense at the time. "When the modern version of recycling began," says Black, "its economics were disastrous in some cases." He explains that "the economics of recycling is a mosaic of issues including collection costs, market demand, landfill costs, and recycling infrastructure and technology. Determining whether recycling makes economic sense involves analyzing these components to see how they fit into the total picture."<p>

Such considerations "may seem complex," concedes Harvey Black, "but they are at least somewhat quantifiable. The health and environmental benefits of recycling -- including energy conservation, toxic emissions reductions, and preservation of resources -- are far more difficult to quantify. Health and environmental benefits are somewhat indirect and are valued differently from individual to individual. Still, advocates of recycling argue that the more intangible benefits offer the most compelling case for recycling." Could it be that they simply don't understand economics, or do they just prefer not to have their efforts measured by an objective standard?<p>

<h2>The Argument Against Gun Control</h2> </center><p>
  
America cannot remain the land of the free unless it continues to be the  
home of the brave. <p> 
 
  
Fueled by anti-gun hysteria, the drive to disarm America gathered  
momentum with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther  
King Jr. in 1968, the year that saw passage of the Gun Control Act. It   
neared its logical conclusion in 1981 when the Village Board of Morton  
Grove, Illinois banned the possession of all handguns and attempted to  
compel local citizens to surrender their weapons to the police. But, in the  
following year, the pendulum began to swing back the other way. In 1982  
the city council of Kennesaw. Georgia voted unanimously to require the  
head of every household to own a gun and ammunition. That year the  
incidence of burglary went down 73 percent in Kennesaw. Meanwhile, it  
was going up in Morton Grove.  <p>
  
Whether their motivation is a sincere desire to reduce the incidence of  
homicide, or a determination to render patriotic Americans defenseless,  
advocates of gun control have trouble advancing credible arguments on  
its behalf, relying instead on emotional appeals and exploiting every gun- 
related tragedy. What else can they do when FBI statistics show that most  
of the states with the highest murder rates have extensive gun control.  
while most of the states with the lowest murder rates have little or no gun  
control?  <p>
  
The pragmatic argument against gun control is simply that it doesn't  
work. Indeed, it seems to encourage crime to the extent that the  
criminally inclined are emboldened by the powerlessness of potential  
victims. But there is an even stronger moral argument, which will be  
heard more and more frequently as Americans in increasing numbers  
express their disenchantment with dependency and seek to reestablish  
their self-respect.  <p>
  
It is the argument of a brave people whose descendants very nearly  
succumbed to cowardice. As incorporated into the Declaration of  
Independence. it expresses the once self-evident truths that all people   
have the right to live, to be free, and to act in their own best interests; that  
these fights are given to us by God. not by other men; that governments  
have no other purpose than to protect these rights; and that a people can  
at any time discharge a government whose protection has burgeoned into  
oppression.  <p>
  
The possession of rights presupposes not only the responsibility for their  
proper use, but also the power to preserve them. Given the obvious  
inability of government to protect the rights of all people at all times, and   
the obvious inability of an unarmed citizenry to protect itself against a  
government that enjoys a monopoly on the use of force, it is abundantly  
clear that a free people must be armed to remain free. Americans are   
beginning to understand again that independence is a right, and bravery  
the virtue that preserves it. It's a good thing, too, because America will  
remain the land of the free only as long as it is also the home of the   
brave.  <p>

<h2>Americorps: Voluntarism?</h2> <br></center>
 
When Congress tried to defund Americorps last year, Democrats accused  
Republicans of wanting to destroy "voluntarism." But what kind of  
voluntarism is it when the volunteer gets paid, and handsomely?  <p>
  
  
High school graduates who defer college for a year and enroll in  
Americorps instead "receive a healthy stipend and a $4,700 voucher for  
college education," reports Robert Sirico, president of the Acton Institute   
for the Study of Religion and Liberty, in a recent newspaper editorial. He  
cites an audit by the General Accounting Office that pegged the cost of  
the 20,000 Americorps "volunteers" at nearly $31.500 each, "which  
works out to be pretty good pay at taxpayers' expense."  <p>
  
Sirico suggests that "voluntarism" may not be the right word for such  
activity. "One view of voluntarism is that it is uncompensated labor," he  
observes. "People volunteer at a soup kitchen or in local service clubs.   
Well, by that definition, Americorps is not voluntary. Eliminate the  
incentives of the stipend and the education voucher and then we'll  
discover just how 'voluntary' the program is." <p> 
  
Sirico is willing to consider other definitions. He notes that voluntarism  
may be construed to mean "doing something because of benevolent  
personal desire," and concedes that Americorps workers may be   
motivated by good intentions. "But this does not set them apart from  
other workers." he insists. "Most entrepreneurs love their work. They also  
desire the happiness of others. They try to give people something they  
want, whether it is a good meal, quality clothing, sturdy housing, or  
reliable letter delivery. Somehow, though, capitalist acts are not supposed  
to qualify as 'voluntary' in this sense."  <p>
  
Suppose "voluntarism" simply means "anything that is not coerced." Still,  
we have a problem. "In a market economy, the jobs of just about  
everyone pass this test. No one is forced to take a job," says Sirico. "Most   
people face an array of alternatives of how to use their talents in the  
market." Sirico insists that "the very existence of our social safety net  
means workers in America volunteer to be responsible people, to earn a   
living by the sweat of their brows."  <p>
  
No, none of these definitions will do. "The only trait of Americorps that  
distinguishes it from charity, jobs, or entrepreneurship in the private  
sector," Sirico concludes, "is that it is sponsored and run by government.   
This seems to be the message of Americorps: You're not really working  
for the social good unless you are working under government guidance."  
Sirico finds this message disturbing. "It teaches young people a false  
notion about trade," he says, the notion being that "working for a

<h2>Social Experimentation in Americas Armed Forces</h2> </center>
 
Here is a revolting irony for you: Daring young combat pilots feel more 
secure dodging anti-aircraft guns over enemy territory than they do when 
speaking their minds on American soil. <p>
 
 
The temperature can reach 125 degrees on the tarmac at Nellis Air Force 
Base in Nevada, reports Mindy Belz in a recent issue of World magazine. 
"Hotter still," she says, "is the situation of any officer who dares  
to question even in a private conversation, the Clinton administration's 
policies that are undermining the spirit of America's armed forces." Belz 
observes with dismay that the officers at the Air Force Weapons School 
"speak cautiously. even mechanically, about profound changes in the 
military" -- voicing pat approval for such controversial trends as women 
in combat, downsizing of the services, and murky missions under foreign 
command. When the men charged with defending our freedoms have to 
watch everything they say and be constantly on guard against betrayal, 
something is desperately wrong in America. <p>
 
It is true that soldiers must be trained not to question authority. "The 
militarys code of ethics -- taking orders -at its best preserves order and 
strength in the military," Belz concedes. "But the about-face of President 
Clinton (and President Bush before him) on fundamental issues -- such as 
keeping military policy insulated from the fluctuating pop-culture 
influences -- has trickled down without public debate." This is an  
unhealthy situation. It will lead to demoralization of the troops, their 
involvement in social experimentation. and reduced security for our 
country. "Stifling debate on matters that go to the heart of military 
readiness undermines the dutiful," Belz charges. "Political correctness 
turns loyalty into Newspeak." <p>
 
Orders may be orders, but every veteran can remember when giving and 
getting some guff was part of the equation. After all, the right to have his 
own opinion, the right to disagree, was partly what he fought for. Blind 
obedience went out with the Nuremberg trials. Or did it? Belz cites the 
case of Navy Lt. Commander Ken Carkhuff, a 17-year veteran who 
confided to his commanding officer that he had religious objections  
to women in combat. That comment led ultimately to a board of inquiry, 
which recommended separation from the service. Fortunately, public 
opinion persuaded the Secretary of the Navy to overrule the board and  
allow Carkhuff to remain. A high-ranking Air Force officer who prefers 
to remain nameless says that criticizing the concept of women in combat 
is "a career-ender." <p>
 
Belz points out that "the Senate continues to hold the power of conferring 
rank on all military officers,'' and that feminist senators "have attacked 
the retirement grade of three Navy admirals . . . who were accused of  
not promoting women." This is America? Men who spent their entire 
lives in service must now kowtow to these feminist bullies or risk 
jeopardizing the benefits they have earned. Can this be the country they  
fought for? <p>

<h2>The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty </h2></center>
 
The Clinton Administration claims to have abandoned the doctrine of  
Mutual Assured Destruction, but its interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic  
Missile Treaty with the former Soviet Union says otherwise. <p> 
  
  
"The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is at the heart of the debate on ballistic  
missile defense," say Kim Holmes and Baker Spring of the Heritage  
Foundation. "Whether to proceed more quickly or more slowly to deploy  
missile defenses, and in what way, or whether to proceed at all, is  
determined by how the ABM Treaty is viewed. The strategic assumptions  
underlying the treaty. forged during the Cold War, are very much alive in  
the Clinton Administration. They drive the Administrations approach not  
only to missile defense policy, but also to arms control and even U.S.  
policy toward Russia," Holmes and Baker charge.  <p>
  
The two defense analysts argue that the Clinton Administration's  
interpretation of the ABM Treaty is perpetuating America's vulnerability  
to ballistic missile attack. That interpretation reflects a willingness "to   
defend U.S. allies and forces overseas but leave American citizens and  
territory vulnerable to nuclear attack." Holmes and Baker contend that the  
Administration is "expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty to limit  
theater missile defenses, even though this was never intended b! the  
original architects of the Treaty."  <p>
  
The Clinton Administration calls the ABM Treaty "a cornerstone of  
strategic stability," but disavows the doctrine of Mutual Assured  
Destruction that underlies it. Holmes and Baker point out that "the basic   
assumption behind the ABM Treaty was that the ability of the Soviet  
Union . . . and the United States to destroy each other was the central  
factor in maintaining strategic stability. The ABM Treaty," they say,   
"was designed to ensure that this vulnerability continued." But, if Mutual  
Assured Destruction "is no longer the guiding principle of U.S. doctrine,  
then the ABM Treaty can no longer serve as a cornerstone of strategic  
stability."  <p>
  
The Treaty is not much of an incentive for arms control either. A strong  
U.S. strategic defense program is far more conducive to offensive  
reductions than the ABM Treaty ever was or ever will be," say Holmes   
and Baker. "During the 1980s progress toward offensive reductions  
occurred only after the U.S. made it clear to the Soviets that the Strategic  
Defense Initiative would proceed." Noting that "no major arms control  
agreement with the Russians has been initiated by the Clinton  
Administration. which has scaled back America's missile defense  
programs," the two analysts conclude that "the Russians are quicker to   
reach arms control agreements with the U.S when they face a determined  
U.S. missile defense program than when they face a weak one."  <p>
  
The doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction should be scrapped once and  
for all, say Holmes and Baker, and replaced with a policy that "seeks to  
prevent potentially hostile forces from obtaining missiles and weapons of  
mass destruction," deters the possessors of such weapons from using  
them, defends against missile attacks once they have begun, and allows  
for preemptive strikes against missile delivery systems.  <p>

<title>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx -- du Pont</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center>
<i>Thursday, September 28, 1995</i><hr>
 
<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<h2>Educators Attack Family Values  </h2></center>
 
An education expert says that "challenges from conservative citizen  
groups objecting to particular instructional strategies and materials" are  
hampering efforts "to make fundamental changes in public schooling "  <p>
  
  
Writing in the September 1993 issue of Phi Delta Kappan, Indiana  
University professor of education Martha McCarthy tipped off her  
colleagues to a new trend in parental protests against teaching materials.   
"Until the late 1970s the targets were usually individual books," she  
observed. "While the list of individual books under attack continues to  
grow. recent protests -- often orchestrated by national conservative  
groups -- are more likely to focus on entire textbook series and  
components of the instructional program." <p> 
  
That means that pet theories and vested interests are at stake. Take, for  
instance the Whole Language approach to reading. McCarthy noted that  
"the most widely challenged textbook series" at that time was Harcourt  
Brace Jovanovich's 10-volume anthology Impressions, which uses the  
Whole language method. "Most of the challenges focus on the series'  
subject matter rather than on its pedagogical approach," she conceded.  
"but the controversy associated with Impressions may have implications  
for the future of Whole-Language instruction."  <p>
  
McCarthy reported that conservatives have also attacked the Quest  
curriculum for teaching relativism and disrespect for parental authority,  
the Tactics for Thinking program for teaching New Age beliefs, and   
Outcome Based Education for teaching hardly anything. She noted that  
"instruction pertaining to values clarification, self-esteem, multicultural  
education, evolution, AIDS education, and global education are being  
contested as anti-Christian, anti-American, or other vise inappropriate."  
But the meddling doesn't stop there, McCarthy continued. "Several  
instructional strategies currently touted in the education literature, such as  
collaborative learning and thematic instruction, are being challenged  
because they shift to students some of the responsibility that was formerly  
lodged with the teacher."<p>  
  
Such challenges, McCarthy warned her peers, "call into question some of  
the basic assumptions of school restructuring initiatives," thereby posing  
"far more serious threats to efforts to improve the public school program  
than do challenges to individual novels." What's more, she added, "the  
success rate of those initiating challenges has been rising." Even  
unsuccessful challenges sometimes delay construction of educational  
utopias, "for the controversy itself can disrupt school operations and  
interfere with implementation of the program." Then there's the dreaded  
ripple effect: "When materials or programs are attacked in one school  
district, the controversy often affects other districts."  <p>
  
In a fit of candor, McCarthy advised her colleagues to drop their pretense  
of impartiality and give up trying to appease parents. "Instead of arguing  
that the challenged instructional programs are value-neutral or trying to  
sanitize the curriculum so that no groups are offended, policymakers and  
educators need to take a stand," exhorted McCarthy. She thus confirmed  
what many conservative parents have suspected all along: that educators  
are fighting an undeclared war against families with traditional values.  
We should thank Martha McCarthy for letting parents know what they're  
up against.  <p>

<title>The Problems With Health Maintenance Organizations -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>The Problems With Health Maintenance Organizations</h2></center><p>

Health maintenance organizations (called HMOs) are growing rapidly. 
And so is the evidence that the managed care they provide is not all it's 
cracked up to be! <p>

According to the September issue of Consumers' Research, "the main 
difficulty with HMOs is the financial arrangement made with doctors." 
That arrangement may include "a fixed amount of money per covered 
patient," as well as "bonuses for delivering care on a frugal basis." Such 
incentives "reward physicians for deferring or withholding care that is 
seen as being too expensive -- in essence pitting the financial interest of 
the doctor against the medical interest of the patient."<p>

Consumers' Research reports that, with HMOs, "the less your doctor 
does for you. the more money he gets to keep." That means that HMOs 
have built-in incentives "against referring you to a specialist authorizing a high-tech procedure. or approving a costly operation. In some HMOs. there may be a review board empowered to deny you such treatment even when your doctor says you need it."<p>

Consumers' Research offers a sampling of "the mounting number of 
press accounts and official studies" indicating that, once you join an 
HMO, "you may receive inadequate care. or be denied some procedure 
that could improve your health or even save your life." A Washington 
Post story from August of last year reports that some doctors believe the 
managed care system "changes the way physicians think about patients 
for the worse and may encourage them to shun patients with high risks or 
expensive health problems." This past August, the Washington Post 
reported on the situation at a San Francisco medical center, where "organ 
transplant specialists have turned down patients who might have been 
given transplants in the past even though they had poor prospects for 
recovery." Without transplants, of course, such patients are doomed.<p>

Last November American Medical News reported the comments of an 
emergency physician in Sacramento regarding "dangerous interference by 
managed care plans" lobbying the state legislature to restrict the scope of 
their coverage. He cited the case of a patient with a possible spine 
fracture whose plan denied authorization for care, and a patient with "an 
externalizing arterial hemorrhage" who was ushered out of an emergency 
room and sent off to a plan physician's office. "There has been a great 
deal of gatekeeper misbehavior and failure to understand emergency 
medical procedures," said the doctor. "That puts patients in a position of 
choosing between their lives and their pocketbooks, even though they are 
insured and these services should be covered."<p>

According to the July 9th New York Times, "hospitals across the country 
report that HMOs are increasingly denying claims for care provided in 
hospital emergency rooms." Early this year, the Department of Health 
and Human Services revealed that up to 25 percent of former HMO 
participants surveyed "said they failed to receive primary care, referrals 
to specialists, and HMO coverage of emergency care they believed they 
needed." The Department found that "chronically ill and disabled 
patients" have expressed "an alarmingly high level of dissatisfaction with 
the care provided by HMOs."<p>

<title>ABM Treaty -- Duplantier</title>
</head>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br>
 F.R. Duplantier<br>
 October 3, 1995</i><br><hr>

<h2>ABM Treaty</h2></center>

It looks as if our representatives in Washington may finally summon the 
courage to withdraw from the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and 
renounce the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction that jeopardizes our 
nation's safety.<p>

In June the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected an 
amendment to a defense appropriations bill that would have endorsed 
continued adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The 
amendment's defeat could foreshadow an end to the insane policy of 
Mutual Assured Destruction, which many people call the MAD doctrine. 
This vote of 221 Republicans and 21 Democrats "suggests that there is, at 
long last. a growing -- and bipartisan -- appreciation that America's 
present vulnerability to ballistic missile attack is as reckless as it is 
absurd." says Frank Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security 
Policy. "The tally also admirably reflected the House leadership's 
determination to correct this grievous deficiency."<p>

During an appearance on the Sunday morning TV show "This Week With 
David Brinkley," a few days before the vote. House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich argued that the United States should "proceed with defending 
itself against ballistic missiles from countries like Iran, North Korea or 
Syria or Libya." Noting that an anti-ballistic missile system could be 
functional "within two or three years . . . for a very low cost," Gingrich 
declared his strong support for "setting aside the ABM Treaty" so that the 
United States can defend itself.<p>

Some said that this House vote was "tantamount to a repudiation of the 
ABM Treaty." That's an exaggeration, but. according to Frank Gaffney, 
it's a good start. It shows that advocating abrogation of the ABM treaty is 
"no longer politically taboo." Gaffney predicts that "the new taboo will be 
the idea of perpetuating the American people's vulnerability to ballistic 
missile attack."<p>

Frank Gaffney explains the vote like this: "First, the public is largely 
unaware that it is unprotected against missile strikes," or that the ABM 
Treaty requires that our country remain defenseless. "When acquainted 
with that reality, [Americans] overwhelmingly favor putting [U.S.] 
defenses into place," Gaffney observes. "Second, notice was served on 
those legislators who persist in voting against providing such protection 
[that they] will be held responsible for voting to perpetuate U.S. 
vulnerability."<p>

The diehard supporters of the obsolete ABM Treaty were reduced to 
denying the threat of ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations, or 
insisting that maintaining a treaty with Russia is somehow more 
important than protecting ourselves against attacks from other quarters. 
Such arguments are clearly untenable. "The truth of the matter, of course, 
is that there is a growing threat -- both from indigenously developed 
[missile] systems and from those that can be bought on the world 
market," says Gaffney, noting that there are roughly 25 countries 
currently "working to acquire ballistic missiles and the chemical, 
biological and/or nuclear weapons they might carry." The old model of 
two superpowers facing each other no longer reflects the world we live 
in. The 1972 ABM Treaty cannot protect us from rogue nations that 
commit terrorist acts and now have the capability of nuclear mischief.<p>

<h2>Pollution Control</h2></center>

Wouldn't it be great if driving a car made the air cleaner instead of  
dirtier? That may seem like a crackpot idea, but someone's already 
developed the technology to make this paradoxical pipedream a 
revolutionary reality.<p>

In a recent column in the Washington Times, Eric Peters sings the praises 
of realistic pollution-control technologies that "would allow Americans to 
continue their love affair with the automobile -- without despoiling the 
planet." Particularly promising is the aptly-named "smog-eating radiator," 
developed by Ford Motor Company and the Engelhard Corporation. 
Peters explains that this intriguing new device "features a special catalyst coating that treats all the outside air that flows through it. [acting] much like an air filter -- only on a much larger scale.". This revolutionary new radiator appears to be able to "destroy 90 percent of the ground level ozone in ambient air that passes through it."<p>

Putting all that in layman's terms, Peters says that "'dirty' air passing 
through the radiator comes out the other side virtually 'clean.' Thus, the 
mere act of driving your car could actually clean up the air we breathe -- 
instead of making things worse than they are." The radiator does the 
cleaning all by itself. Nothing else is needed, says Peters, "and the 
technology can be applied to any vehicle on the road, regardless of age. 
Indeed,  it would be theoretically possible to retrofit most of the cars 
currently in service for a fairly modest amount of money, and with no 
adverse impact on vehicle function or performance."<p>

Peters observes that "one of the biggest obstacles to improving air quality 
is the 'lag time' between the introduction of a new emissions control 
technology" and its widespread usage. The simplicity of the smog-eating 
radiator should greatly accelerate the turnaround time. "Instead of the 
usual 10 or more years it takes for something like engine computers or 
fuel injection to become commonplace -- and therefore have a 
meaningful impact on air quality -- the smog-eating radiator could be put 
into widespread service in a fraction of that time."<p>

Studies indicate that smog-eating radiators have the potential to reduce 
air pollution more effectively than either alternative fuels or coercive 
carpooling. One such study. Peters reports, "estimates that if 9 million 
vehicles traveling 266 million miles per day in Los Angeles were 
equipped with smog-eating radiators, the air flowing through these 
radiators -- and being purified of harmful ozone and carbon monoxide 
along the way -- would be equivalent to all the air across the entire Los 
Angeles area up to a height of about 15 feet."<p>

There's a lesson to be learned from all this. "This technology is a terrific example of the innovation that is possible if society gives industry the chance to work on the best solutions for our air pollution problems," says Lou Ross of the Ford Motor Company. "You can't predict where invention is going to come from -- and you certainly can't mandate it into existence."<p>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>

<h2>People for the American Way</h2></center>

People for the American Way is pulling out all the stops in its fight 
against the so-called Religious Right. That's because the radical left 
knows the tide is turning against them.<p>

The Capital Research Center describes People for the American Way, the 
tax-exempt organization founded in 1980 by television producer Norman 
Lear, as "the largest and most influential group seeking to counter the 
Religious Right in America." PAW's donors include big names in the 
entertainment industry, the National Education Association and several 
other unions, and numerous tax-exempt foundations.<p>

The group's avowed objectives are to uphold church and state separation, 
maintain prohibitions against school prayer, and provide "technical and 
legal assistance" to combat "censorship" of school books. "During the 
1992-93 school year, PAW says it documented 347 cases in which a 
parent, school official, or church group demanded that library [books] or 
textbooks be removed or restricted -- up from 229 cases the year before." 
According to PAW, "religious conservatives or members of organizations 
described as 'Far Right' . . . were involved in 90 percent of the cases and 
were believed to have inspired another 18 percent."<p>

A PAW report on the conservative impact on school boards during the 
1992-93 school year documents "the emergence of a grassroots 
revolution that threatens to undermine an already challenged American 
public education system." PAW alleges that the Right "is now in the 
initial stages of a community-by-community battle to gain control over 
school boards through the ballot box."<p>

People for the American Way thinks that the exercise by parents of their 
democratic prerogative is truly sinister! PAW argues that it is unfair for 
candidates of the Religious Right to win elections without revealing 
"their full agenda for the schools." PAW ignores the fact that such 
"stealth tactics" were the very means liberals used to establish their 
current hegemony. PAW warns that the so-called, Religious Right is no 
longer confined to the "Bible belt," noting that in 1993 "Religious Right 
candidates won school board elections in at least 12 states." According to 
PAW's count, roughly a third of the 243 candidates it identified as 
belonging to the Religious Right "won primaries or general election 
campaigns" in 1993.<p>

For years now education officials have acted as "change agents," 
insinuating into the public school system policies and curricula offensive 
to parents with traditional values. Gradually, the hidden objectives are 
becoming known, and parents are fighting back. The education 
establishment grows increasingly hostile as it tries to protect its control 
over children's minds. The attacks against the Religious Right, 
orchestrated by People for the American Way, are going to get shriller. 
But the shriller they get, the more cause there is for optimism; for that 
shrillness is a reflection of the insecurity felt by members of a public 
school monopoly facing exposure. They know that the secret victories 
they have achieved over the past several decades will not withstand an 
open battle.<p>

<title>Television's New Fall Lineup -- Duplantier</title>

<h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES</h4>

<h2>Televisions New Fall Lineup</h2></center>

Does art imitate life, or does life imitate art? Television's new fall lineup may hold the answer.<p>

The question -- whether art imitates life, or vice versa -- can be applied 
fruitfully to television, if one assumes a loose interpretation of the word 
art, which, of course, is the interpretation in vogue. The "situations" in 
some television programs do reflect an existing reality, while others 
clearly serve as models for imitation. Most, however, fall somewhere in 
between mere re-creation and outright advocacy. The single-parent TV 
family, for instance may now reflect an unfortunate demographic trend, 
but it's been a television standby for years. Perhaps the phenomenon 
began as a matter of plot convenience, or as a cheap trick for winning 
instant sympathy for the main character. Whatever the case, on TV at 
least, the broken home has proven to be more enduring than the 
traditional American family as memorialized in Leave It to Beaver. Ozzie 
and Harriet, and The Dick Van Dyke shows. Nowadays, only minority 
families are allowed to remain intact on television.<p>

Which comes first, the broadcast broken home or the real-life broken 
home? It's hard to say. Nevertheless, the number of broken homes on TV 
is disproportionately high and constitutes a distortion of reality. Single-
parent TV families naturally lend themselves to grief mongering. What in 
public schools today goes by the name of "Death Education" has wormed 
its way into prime-time programming. Those single-parent TV families 
that have not resulted from divorce presuppose the death of one of the 
spouses. Such programs encourage the immature viewer to contemplate 
the prospect of his own parents' estrangement from each other, as well as 
the even grimmer possibility of their untimely deaths.<p>

Casual sexual practices are also more prevalent on the air than off. and 
gratuitous displays of flesh and simulated carnality are on the rise, 
especially in "dramatic" serials. Raunchiness and the rapidly changing 
multiple-plot format often go hand in hand, for they both pander to the 
demand for immediate gratification. The mature, loving relationship and 
the sophisticated, sustained plot require a keener insight into human 
nature and a greater attention span than are commonly possessed by 
people who respond to mental images with their sweat and salivary 
glands. With their incessant jumping from one swiftly developing plot to 
another. and the endless permutations of "relationships," the nighttime 
soaps are custom-made for the impatient hedonist.<p>

As with each new television season, there are one or two bright spots on 
the video horizon. Most of the new shows, of course, will fail to generate 
any significant interest among jaded television viewers, and some will set 
new standards for the stinker. A rare few will carve out audiences 
sufficient to perpetuate their existence. Still, we'd all be better off if the new fall lineup were completely disappointing. Then maybe we'd find the 
time, and the energy, to read a book, dine out with our spouses, play 
games with the kids, or visit the neighbors.<p>

<title>Environmental Protection -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>Environmental Protection</h2></center>

The federal government has undermined private property rights in the 
name of environmental protection, but it's becoming increasingly clear 
that protecting the environment and protecting the rights of landowners 
go hand in hand.<p>

"The growth of federal land-use regulation over the past two decades has 
sparked a firestorm of grassroots opposition," says Jonathan Adler of the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute. "Landowners around the country are 
upset with their government for denying them the reasonable use of their 
land in the name of protecting endangered species. maintaining 'wild and 
scenic' rivers, preserving wetlands. and establishing national parks." 
Adler says there is "broad public support for current environmental laws." 
but there is also "strong public sentiment in favor of compensation for 
regulatory takings." In other words. Americans believe in protecting the 
environment against despoliation, but they also believe in protecting the 
landowner against expropriation. Americans believe that landowners 
should be reimbursed for any losses caused by environmental regulations.<p>

Although "literally dozens of federal statutes and programs restrict the 
nonharmful use of private property." federal laws all by themselves 
account for "the lion's share of regulatory takings," says Adler, citing the Endangered Species Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act as the 
major culprits. Seventy-five percent of threatened species "rely upon 
private land for some or all of their habitat." and most officially 
designated wetlands are held privately. "Thus, as long as the federal 
government continues to rely upon regulation to conserve these 
resources, widespread conflicts with private landowners are inevitable."<p>

"The proper aim of federal government efforts to protect 'the 
environment' is to prevent the imposition of harmful substances upon 
unconsenting persons and their properties; and. failing that. punishing 
those who transgress against others in this manner," Adler contends. 
"Pollution is a 'trespass' or 'nuisance' under the principles of common law. Environmental statutes should not supersede common law protections, as 
most have. but rather reinforce them."<p>

Adler points out that "'public goods' such as military bases and highways 
are created by purchasing lands from private owners. On the other hand, 
'public goods' like wetland preserves and wildlife refuges are created by 
bureaucratic edicts that deny property owners the use of their land. This 
is not how it should be." Adler insists. "If the public wants to protect the habitat of an endangered species or preserve an ancient stand of trees for some aesthetic, spiritual, or broad 'environmental' value, then the public should be willing to pay for it, just as it pays for other 'public goods."' The current landowner should not be expected to absorb the loss.<p>

Adler maintains that property rights are "important for both economic 
and environmental reasons, and must be protected from both government 
regulation and private malfeasance. Compensating landowners when they 
are deprived of the reasonable use of their land will not produce 
environmental catastrophe. Far from it. In many cases, it will eliminate 
the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of 
existing government regulations."<p>

<title>U.S. Postal Service -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>U.S. Postal Service</h2></center>

One out of five first-class letters entrusted to the United States Postal 
Service arrives late. Nearly a fourth of the Postal Service 's two-day 
Priority Mail takes at least three days to get where it's going The zip code is now four digits longer, but the postal service is showing less and less zip.<p>

"The Postal Service has a well-earned reputation for slow delivery," says 
Gregory Conko of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. More than a 
century of monopoly status has made the Postal Service "complacent and 
slothful," Conko contends. "An over-bureaucratized management and a 
powerfully unionized workforce have resisted improvement and turned 
mediocrity into a perverted trademark."

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 gave the ostensibly independent 
Postal Service "broad authority to improve management capability, 
modernize antiquated facilities. and allow postal rates to keep pace with 
cost increases." says Conko. "Tragically, the original goal of improving 
the quality and scope of service, while achieving financial self-
sufficiency over a period of years, has never been realized." The extent of 
the Postal Service's failure is reflected in the size of the debt it owes to the U.S. Treasury -- a whopping $9 billion.<p>

Despite its lack of success, the Postal Service has its defenders. They 
argue that "private, commercial rivals -such as Federal Express, United 
Parcel Service, and more than 300 other alternate delivery firms -- are 
willing to compete with the Post Office only for expensive overnight 
service. but have no interest in delivering the lower-priced items.'> 
Conko calls this a "disingenuous argument." since the Postal Service 
enjoys a "legal monopoly on first-class mail." If that monopoly is more of 
a burden than a benefit, as this line of reasoning seems to suggest, then 
there shouldn't be any objection to repealing the monopoly. Once the 
first-class field is open to all comers, it will soon be obvious whether 
anyone wants to compete or not.<p>

"Supporters also argue that private firms wouldn't deliver first-class mail 
to ever home in the country as cheaply as the Postal Service," says 
Conko, but this too is a bogus argument. since the Post Office has never 
delivered to every home nationwide. "There are many areas in the United 
States where the Postal Service will only deliver mail to Post Office 
Boxes," notes Conko. "In some western states, farmers have to travel as 
far as 40 miles to pick up their mail. But private delivery companies often 
target rural areas for service. The Postal Service even contracts out much 
of its rural delivery . . . to private firms." Conko points out that "private competition for first-class mail delivery was alive and well (as well as legal) in the 19th century." Delivery services like the famed Pony Express "offered stiff competition to the government's Post Office, providing better. more timely service and charging lower rates."<p>

Conko applauds congressional proposals to privatize the Postal Service. 
but insists that "the most important aspect of reform remains rescinding 
the postal monopoly.... Real privatization can come later," he argues, "but 
competition is the key to improvement."<p>

<title>Social Security Pandering -- Duplantier</title>

<h2>Social Security Pandering</h2></center>

Politicians pander to senior citizens when they say that Social Security is 
sacrosanct. Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution warns of what will 
happen when the baby boomers are drawing benefits instead of paying 
taxes.<p>

"Even the most gung-ho budgetcutters in Washington make it a point to 
say that Social Security is off-limits," says syndicated columnist Thomas 
Sowell of the Hoover Institution, who concedes that to say otherwise is 
considered tantamount to political suicide. While acknowledging that 
Social Security recipients would be "outraged and up in arms if the 
federal government reneged on its promises and pulled the rug out from 
under them.'' Sowell insists that drastic steps must be taken to avert an 
impending disaster.<p>

Even if we are obliged to honor expensive promises made in the past, 
"we can at least stop making the same promises for the future." says 
Sowell. "Assure all those currently receiving Social Security checks that 
they will not lose one red cent." he urges. "Give the same assurances to 
those within a decade of their eligibility for Social Security. But there is no reason to continue subsidizing everyone who reaches a certain age." 
says Sowell. "If there are elderly people who are needy. Let them be 
subsidized out of general revenues, from which a transitional phaseout of 
Social Security could also be financed."<p>

Sowell explodes several of the enduring myths about Social Security. 
One myth is the notion that social security payments are qualitatively 
different from welfare relief. "As for the argument that people who have 
put contributions in are not welfare recipients when they take money 
out," says Sowell, "that of course depends on how much they put in and 
how much they take out." Most social security recipients extract far more 
from the system than they contributed.<p>

The fact "that Social Security is currently running a surplus and, that its 
reserve is expected to reach $3 trillion by the year 2020" serves as the 
basis of another myth. the myth of the system's solvency. "All of us can 
run a surplus," says Sowell, "if we are allowed to count all our assets and 
ignore enough of our liabilities," Sowell concedes that "$3 trillion is 
certainly a lot of money -- but not if you owe $4 trillion."<p>

Even the I in FICA, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, represents 
"pure fraud," says Sowell. "The word 'insurance' serves the political 
purpose of removing the onus of its being a handout like welfare or other 
entitlement programs. But a genuine insurance system collects money 
and invests it in assets which cover its liabilities. The Social Security 
system's assets have never covered its liabilities. It is not insurance." 
Sowell insists, "but a pyramid scheme in which those who enrolled earlier 
get what is paid in by those who enroll later."<p>

Sowell says the scheme "worked like a charm as long as the pyramid kept 
expanding, with the baby boomers' contributions being used to support 
the smaller generation before it." But, when the baby boomers reach age 
65, there will not be enough taxpayers to support social security as we 
know it.<p>

<h2>Central Intelligence Agency</h2></center>

The major media chastised the CIA for taking so long to ferret out Soviet 
mole Aldrich Ames. But the media itself may be partly to blame for 
undermining the Agency's ability to protect itself:<p>

"The announcement of the arrest of Aldrich Ames early last year. and the 
details of his horrific work as a Soviet mole inside the CIA for nine years, touched off a firestorm of attacks on the CIA itself," says James Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of Freedom, and a former OSS officer. Tyson says the major media criticized the CIA for its 
"negligence" in allowing Ames's dirtv work to go undetected for so long, 
attributing that negligence to the reluctance of the agency's "Old Boy 
Network" to suspect one of its own. At least four major books have been 
rushed into print to add fuel to the fire.<p>

"What has not been recognized," Tvson charges, "is that the media and 
some of the book authors are themselves greatly responsible for the 
weakness in the CIA's counterintelligence operations. which allowed 
Ames to operate freely." According to Tyson. it was "the media vendetta 
on the CIA and its counterintelligence that led to ag,itation in Congress 
and successive presidential administrations. resulting in the firing of the 
counterintelligence head. James J. Angleton, and a virtual dismantling of 
the CIA's counterintelligence staff. This in turn caused the Agency to be 
vulnerable to the operations of a Sos iet mole like Aldrich Ames."<p>

Undermining the counterintelligence capability of the CIA was a major 
communist objective. says Tyson. "In the 1 960s and '70s, the Soviet 
Union under Khrushchev and his successors mounted a massive 
propaganda campaign against the CIA, much more effective than the 
clumsy efforts of the Stalin regime. The Soviets," Tyson reminds us, 
"regarded the CIA as a major threat. the eyes and ears of their main 
enemv. the United States. In the '70s, the campaign reached a climax with 
increasingly strident attacks by ultra-liberals." CIA critics jumping on the bashers bandwagon included "communist front groups like the National 
Lawers Guild and farleft Soviet sympathizers like the Institute for 
Policy Studies." <p>

Tyson recalls that President Gerald Ford and CIA Director William Colby 
made "many well-meaning but naive attempts to cooperate with reform 
efforts." Colby eventually fired counterintelligence chief Jarnes Angleton 
and many of his top aides. and was himself later fired by Ford. 
"Angleton's competence and reputed paranoia about moles is still a matter 
of disagreement among experts," concedes Tyson. "but there is no doubt 
that, after firing him.Colby and his successors went too far in virtually 
dismantling the counterintelligence capability."<p>

Under President Carter, hundreds of counterintelligence agents were let 
go. Eventually, the top echelon in the Agency began to emphasize 
technical means of acquiring intelligence. such as satellite photographs, 
in preference to traditional espionage. Tyson says "the main lesson of the 
Ames disaster is not the need to reform the CIA's 'Old Boy Network' and 
out-of-date procedures, but to restore its capacity for human 
intelligencegathering, especially in the counterintelligence area."<p>

<h2>J. Edgar Hoover</h2></center>

The reputation of J. Edgar Hoover has been greatly tarnished in the 23 
years since his death, but two new books about the longtime FBI director 
have set the record straight at last.<p>

Smearing the character of J. Edgar Hoover has been a popular pastime for 
two decades, but it's time now to put his ugly business behind us. Former 
FBI agent Ray Wannall says two new books offer a fresh. objective 
appraisal of the man who single-handedly transformed the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation "from a dumping ground for political hacks, ex-
convicts, and alcoholics into a world-renowned law-enforcement 
agency."<p>

Wannall says William Breuer's J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men is an 
engrossing. exhaustively researched book that captures "Hoover's 
mystique and the sheer force of his will." Breuer himself declares that 
one of his motives for writing the book was to "counter the barrage of 
vilification and garbage that has been heaped on this great American." 
Just 99  years old when he was appointed FBI Director in 1924. Hoover 
quickly established a reputation as a disciplinarian, rooting out the rabble among his investigative staff and replacing them with skilled lawyers and accountants -- all subjected to rigorous background checks and intensive training courses, and thereafter held to a strict code of conduct. One high-level FBI man recalls that Hoover "had standards of perfection and he expected everybody in the Bureau to live up to them."<p>

With his awesome leadership and managerial ability, Hoover led the FBI 
in a successful assault on the notorious (Gangsters of the Prohibition and 
Depression eras. Ma Barker, John Dillinger, "Pretty Boy" Floyd, 
"Machine Gun" Kelly, "Baby Face" Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde are 
just a few of the public enemies Hoover brought to justice. In 1936. 
President Franklin Roosevelt directed Hoover to develop intelligence 
regarding subversive activities by communists, fascists, and other anti-
American groups. Hoover's success in this mission explains the ferocity 
of the subsequent attacks on his character.<p>

Ray Wannall also recommends a book written by Cartha D. DeLoach, the 
Number Three man in the FBI. behind Hoover and his associate director. 
Wannall says Hoover's FBI: The Inside Story by Hoover's Trusted 
Lieutenant "shows the full spectrum of Hoover's character and 
personality and is laced with Hoover's humor and amusing incidents 
involving prominent people, members of Congress. and White House 
personnel." The book. Wannall insists, presents "an unbiased portrait of 
the man, warts and all. by one who knew him, worked closely with-him, 
put up with his idiosyncrasies, and admired him even to the point of 
declining to take over his job when it was offered to him."<p>

DeLoach acknowledges in his book that Hoover was "proud and vain . . . 
and not above abusing his power. He could be petty and vindictive. He 
stayed in office too long, and, in so doing, he helped damage the 
reputation of the FBI he had virtually invented and perfected." Hoover 
may not have known when to quit, but the accomplishments he achieved 
in his prime cannot be denied. He was a true patriot, and he deserves an 
honored place in American history.<p>

<title>U.N. Ambassadors Owe U.S. $9 Million -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.N. Ambassadors Owe U.S. $9 Million</h2></center>
<P>

United Nations ambassadors and their embassies owe U.S. banks,  
landlords, and merchants more than $9 million, and some have been  
delinquent on their debts for more than two years! 
       <P>
"The problem of diplomatic indebtedness is a matter of significant  
concern," admits UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "Non- 
payment of just debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community  
and tarnishes the image of the United Nations itself." As much as it may  
worry the Secretary-General, the tarnished image of the UN is the least of  
concerns for the unfortunate New York City businesses left holding the  
bag. And some observers would argue that the UN's image isn't nearly as  
tarnished as it deserves to be. 
                     <P>
The debt of the deadbeat diplomats stood at roughly $1 million in 1990,  
but the UN's head-in-the-sand reaction allowed it to multiply by a factor  
of nine in just five years. Moreover, it was only at the insistence of the  
U.S. mission and the City of New York that the debt was made public at  
all. The names of the offending diplomats, however, remained secret. A  
vote by the U.S. Senate at the end of July, withholding $10 million from  
the UN until the names of the diplomats are disclosed, may loosen some  
lips. 
                         <P>
About 80 percent of the $9 million debt is owed to banks and landlords,  
the rest to merchants. According to Boutros-Ghali, 31 missions have  
contributed to the debt, but five alone account for 83 percent of it. Those  
five are rumored to be the African nations of Sierra Leone, Congo, Zaire,  
Liberia, and the Central African Republic. 
                             <P>
"Some missions had not paid rent for two years or more," reports  
Boutros-Ghali. "And a number of residential landlords had either lost  
their property or were at risk of losing it because diplomatic tenants. who  
could not be evicted, would neither pay their rent nor leave the property." 
                                       <P>
New Yorkers don't like getting stiffed, and they're becoming increasingly  
reluctant to offer their goods and services to foreign legates. The billion  
dollars of revenue that the UN supposedly generates for the city each year  
is offset by the cost of services the city must provide, and by the  
aggravation caused by diplomats who flout local laws and abuse their  
privilege of immunity. Americans outside of New York derive no  
economic benefit whatsoever from the UN, but the price we pay as  
taxpayers is substantial, given the status of the United States as the UN's  
largest contributor. The real cost of the UN, however, must be reckoned  
in liberties and lives lost.  
              <P>
Next Wednesday marks the fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of the  
United Nations Charter by the United States Senate on October 25, 1945.  
For the next two weeks, while the major media trumpet the dubious  
achievements of this would-be world government, we'll be reporting  
Behind The Headlines on the myriad ways in which the United Nations  
undermines the sovereignty of our country and threatens the individual  
rights protected by our U.S. Constitution.

<h2>The U.N.'s Checkered Past</h2></center>
<P>

 
Before we get caught up in all the hoopla surrounding the 50th  
anniversary of the United Nations, let's review the checkered past of this  
would-be world government. 
                                                          <P>
The United Nations was designed to serve the interests of the Soviet  
Union. The principal author of the UN Charter, and its first Secretary  
General, was Communist spy Alger Hiss, and the only nation allotted  
three votes, rather than one, was the Soviet Union. The second UN  
Secretary General, Trygve Lie (PRONOUNCED: LEE), revealed in his  
book, called In the Cause of Peace, that U.S. Secretary of State Edward  
Stettinius made a deal with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that the  
second most important position in the UN would always be held by a  
Communist. 
                                   <P>
From the beginning, the Soviet Union used the UN as a headquarters for  
espionage and terror. According to the 1956 Annual Report of the Senate  
Internal Security Subcommittee, "Accreditation to a diplomatic or  
semidiplomatic position frequently has been given to members of the  
Soviet secret police as a 'cover' for their real objectives in the United  
States.... Soviet agents have engaged, within the boundaries of the U.S.,  
in kidnapping and coercion of foreign nationals who are United States  
residents."                      <P>
 
The Soviet Union also used the UN as a platform in the heart of New  
York City from which to spread revolutionary and subversive  
propaganda. A UN delegate from Poland who defected to the United  
States testified that his Soviet masters considered the UN "one of the  
most important platforms for Soviet propaganda in the world." In 1952 a  
Senate investigation into the "Activities of United States Citizens  
Employed by the United Nations" produced voluminous evidence that  
"there is a Communist 'fifth column' operating within the UN  
Secretariat." 
                                                              <P>
The first war waged by the UN was the Korean War of 1950-53. Korea  
became a battlefield only because the Soviet Union was temporarily  
boycotting the UN and the Soviet delegate was not present to cast a veto  
the day the United States requested UN action. Thereafter, however, the  
Soviets used their position and influence in the UN to force a stalemate in  
Korea. The Soviets never made the mistake of boycotting again, and  
never again did the UN lend assistance to the victims of Communism --  
among them Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia,  
Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Rumania, and Tibet. 
                                                <P>
The UN did take immediate action in the Congo, however, speedily  
dispatching a "peace force" to wage war against the anti-communists of  
Katanga. UN troops killed women and children, attacked schools,  
hospitals, and churches, and used every means at their disposal to force  
the anti-communist Katangans into a Communist coalition government  
dominated by Soviet-trained agents. 
                                                         <P>
This is the history the United Nations will be celebrating next week --  
fifty years of smearing the reputation of the United States and  
undermining our interests, fifty years of providing a propaganda forum  
and an espionage base for the Soviet Union, fifty years of ignoring the  
victims of Communist aggression and actively helping to extend the  
reach of the evil empire.                   <P>

<title>U.N. Leaks U.S. Intelligence -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.N. Leaks U.S. Intelligence</h2></center>
<P>

 
President Clinton has taken steps to ensure that the security of U.S.  
classified intelligence information is never compromised again by the  
likes of CIA mole Aldrich Ames. Leaks resulting from lax security  
practices at the United Nations, however, don't seem to concern him. 
  <P>
"A new politicized management team has been hired to shake up, purge,  
and otherwise discipline the CIA's covert operations directorate," reports  
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy. "This is being done in  
the name of preventing such disastrous compromises of U.S. intelligence"  
as those perpetrated by Aldrich Ames. "Yet, there appears to be one  
important exception to this policy," says Gaffney. "If the compromise  
occurs as the predictable result of sharing intelligence with the United  
Nations, it seems the Clinton administration is inclined to regard that as  
an acceptable cost of doing business." 
                     <P>
Sharing intelligence information with the United Nations can be risky  
indeed. Gaffney points out that UN personnel in Somalia were "rather  
casual about safeguarding classified information supplied by the United  
States. In fact, had it not been for a chance discovery by a U.S. diplomat  
literally turning out the lights as the UN bailed out of Mogadishu,  
sensitive data -- some of which reportedly identified the Somali sources --  
would have been compromised." 
                          <P>
This near-disaster was not unprecedented. "There have been at least four  
incidents in which the United Nations has breached the security of  
classified documents provided by the United States," reports Gaffney.  
Until recently, in fact, "there was no agreement in place obliging the  
United Nations to provide for the protection of intelligence supplied by  
the United States." Gaffney says the Clinton administration seems to  
believe that "it would be demeaning to the Secretary-General even to ask  
for such an agreement." 
                              <P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee amended the Foreign Relations  
Revitalization Act so that it "blocks the provision of U.S. intelligence  
information to the United Nations, its employees. or any associated  
organization unless mechanisms 'have been formally agreed to and  
implemented by the United Nations for protecting intelligence methods  
and sources."' The United Nations would thus be required to "adopt  
background investigation and security violation investigation procedures  
comparable to those employed by the United States government; agree to  
protect U.S.-provided intelligence in a similar manner; immediately  
notify Washington if there has been a security breach . . . and cooperate  
in U.S. Law enforcement investigations [of such breaches]; and ensure  
that U.S. classified data is not given to nationals ineligible for access to  
such information." 
                 <P>
Despite its boisterous attempt to prevent any further damage to U.S.  
intelligence efforts by double agents, the Clinton administration  
strenuously opposes efforts to protect U.S. intelligence from treachery or  
incompetence inside the UN. The lesson to be learned from the Ames  
affair, according to Frank Gaffney, is that intelligence sources "are highly  
perishable and, once exposed, are gone for good." He warns that  
"undisciplined, indiscriminate sharing of classified information with the  
United Nations" is sheer folly. 
                         <P>

<title>U.S. Gets Pitiful Returns on U.N. Investment -- Duplantier</title></head>

<h2>U.S. Gets Pitiful Returns on U.N. Investment</h2></center>
<P>
 
 
The United States spent more than three and a half billion dollars on the  
United Nations in 1994, which included a billion dollars just to support  
the UN's so-called "peacekeeping" operations and nearly two billion  
dollars' worth of military support services. What did we get for all those  
billions? Not much! 
        <P>
"The UN has been, and will continue to be, of only marginal relevance to  
international peace and security," says Thomas Sheehy of the Heritage  
Foundation. "Suggesting otherwise only sets the stage for future policy  
debacles involving the U.S. military." Sheehy argues that "UN  
peacekeeping turns disastrous when it takes the form of 'peacemaking."'  
That's because "UN forces quickly become just another group of  
combatants," fighting at a tremendous disadvantage under UN rules of  
engagement. 
                         <P>
Sheehy points out that "the countries providing peacekeepers have  
considerably less interest in the conflicts than do the forces their troops  
are fighting. As casualties are incurred, pressure mounts to bring the  
troops home," he observes. "The result is often a half-hearted and  
ultimately futile operation that suffers casualties in vain, as the U.S. did  
in Somalia." Sheehy adamantly rejects suggestions that "U.S. hesitancy to  
intervene in Bosnia and elsewhere . . . is immoral. The 'immoral' policy,"  
he insists, "is to suffer casualties in a conflict with no bearing to  
American national security and soon after to abandon the U.S.  
commitment, as was done in Somalia." 
                                  <P>
The Clinton administration argues that the U.S. would be forced "to act  
alone or not at all" if it refused to participate in UN operations. This is  
simply not true. "The U.S. has acted in concert with allies in most of its  
international conflicts," Sheehy observes. The main concern of UN  
boosters like the President is obviously "not for American security, but  
for the prestige of the UN, which suffers considerably without active  
American participation." According to Sheehy, "Collective action on a  
regional basis, such as in NATO and during the Persian Gulf War,  
whether or not it is sanctioned by the UN, undoubtedly is the best way to  
maintain international peace and stability." 
                                               <P>
Charles Lichenstein, also of the Heritage Foundation, warns that the UN  
"is reinventing what used to be called 'peacekeeping.' In the last several  
years, that do-good concept has been stretched to encompass a range of  
UN operations that typically involve the use of force, even the waging of  
war." The term "peacekeeping" now means "almost anything . . . that the  
UN wants it to mean." Lichenstein says as many as 70,000 U.S. military  
personnel currently participate in this misnamed process. "Some are  
serving in war zones, some are offshore or in aerial surveillance and  
interdiction missions, some are in support roles. But all are serving under  
the authority only of UN Security Council resolutions as implemented by  
the U.S. commander-in-chief." Lichenstein concludes that it would be  
better for the U.S. to "act alone" than to get caught up in "ill-defined,  
open-ended 'peace' operations that arguably exceed the UN's authority  
and certainly exceed its capabilities or demonstrated competence."

<h2>U.S. Soldier Refuses to Submit to U.N. Authority</h2></center>
<P>

 
U.S. Army Specialist Michael New was scheduled to join a United  
Nations "peacekeeping" force in Bosnia early this month, but Specialist  
New decided to risk the possibility of court martial, dishonorable  
discharge, and a prison term rather than wear the UN insignia on his  
uniform. 
        <P>
When Michael New joined the U.S. Army and swore an oath to uphold  
the Constitution of the United States, no mention was made of the United  
Nations. No one said anything about swearing allegiance to a would-be  
world government. or being subject to service under its alien command.  
That's why Michael New balked when he was ordered to wear the UN  
insignia. Up to that point, he had been a typical American soldier, subject  
to the command of American military officers and possessed of all the  
rights of an American citizen -- and that's what he wanted to remain. 
                             <P>
Specialist New demanded to know how a UN emblem on his uniform  
would affect his status as a soldier in the U.S. Army. Would he still be in  
the service of the United States, or would he be considered to be in the  
service of the United Nations instead? If taken prisoner during the UN's  
"peacekeeping mission," would he be treated as an American POW or as  
a UN hostage? Michael New's superiors refused to answer those crucially  
important questions. 
                        <P>
The Army was in "a difficult position," remarks Dennis Cuddy, former  
professor of U.S. history at the University of North Carolina, and the  
author of a popular pamphlet on the New World Order. If the UN insignia  
on his uniform would have no effect on Michael New's status as an  
American soldier, then why was it so important for him to wear it? If the  
insignia merely identifies a UN operation, then why didn't American  
soldiers serving in Korea wear UN emblems on their uniforms? 
                                      <P>
Taking a pass on those prickly posers, the Army argued that President  
Clinton as commander-in-chief had lawfully ordered American soldiers  
to wear the UN insignia, and that's the end of that. The alleged lawfulness  
of the order presumably derives from a classified Presidential Directive  
of May 3, 1994, in which Clinton asserted his authority "to place U.S.  
forces under the operational control of a foreign commander." Cuddy  
says that "one reason New has asked for an explanation of how his status  
would change if he wore UN insignias is to determine if this order  
actually is lawful." Cuddy contends that it is unconstitutional, and that  
Army Specialist Michael New is "correct to refuse to wear UN insignia  
over his American uniform." 
                                                 <P>
Why all the fuss about a silly little emblem? Dennis Cuddy argues that  
obscuring the national identities of troops participating in a UN  
peacekeeping mission and forcing them all to sport UN insignia indicates  
"a change of command or authority." Once the United Nations has troops  
that it can truly call its own, it will have become what its founders wanted  
it to be -- "a de facto world government."

<title>U.N. Treaties to Limit U.S. Citizens' Rights -- Duplantier</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>U.N. Treaties to Limit U.S. Citizens' Rights</h2></center>
<P>

 
Despite their lofty rhetoric, the various treaties proposed by the United  
Nations would not give Americans any additional rights. What they  
would do is restrict or repeal many of the rights we already have, and  
Americans certainly don't want that! 
 <P>
A treaty is a solemn agreement between nations that is legally binding on  
the signatory governments, and on their peoples. U.S. diplomats have no  
business participating in the drafting of treaties that threaten our nation's  
sovereignty and the Constitutional rights of American citizens. U.S.  
Presidents have no business signing such treaties. And U.S. Senators  
have no business ratifying them. 
                <P>
It is incumbent upon anyone sworn to uphold our Constitution to be ever  
mindful of the impact a treaty may have on it and to examine such a  
potent document scrupulously, anticipating contrary constructions and  
adverse interpretations of ambiguous terms. The preservation of U.S.  
sovereignty and of the liberties of American citizens should be the  
primary concern at all times -- not the self-esteem of statesmen, or  
fearsome but fictitious "world opinion." Willfully jeopardizing the  
security of our country, whether in the interests of a foreign nation or as a  
prelude to world government, is treason plain and simple. 
                           <P>
Treaties pose far more of a hazard to the United States than to any other  
nation because of the preeminence of treaties in our system of  
government. Under the U.S. Constitution, laws passed by Congress must  
be "in pursuance" of the Constitution, but there is no such express  
limitation on treaties. In an address to the American Bar Association in  
1952, former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles acknowledged the  
grave danger inherent in treaty ratification. "Under our Constitution  
treaties become the supreme law of the land," he explained. "They are  
indeed more supreme than ordinary laws, for Congressional laws are  
invalid if they do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty laws  
can override the Constitution." 
                                    <P>
The various UN treaties, which internationalist pressure groups are  
constantly urging us to sign, have nothing to offer the American people.  
On the contrary, they pose serious threats to the blessings of liberty that  
we already enjoy. These treaties would supersede the U.S. Constitution  
that protects our rights, override our federal and state laws, and upset the  
balance of power unique to our federal system. They provide no real  
benefits to the citizens of other countries either, and the sacrifice of our  
own rights would not be justified even if they did. We would not be  
protected by the so-called Reservations and Statements of Understanding  
which could be attached. They serve only to acknowledge the many  
dangers in the treaties.   <P>
 
Any treaty that threatens the rights of Americans -- the rights our  
forefathers fought so hard for -- is a treaty we can do without. Nor do we  
advance the cause of human rights worldwide by diminishing our  
sovereignty. We serve that cause far better by concentrating on concerns  
closer to home and trying to set a noble example for others to follow. Let  
the tricksters have their treaties. America should perfect its own standard  
of human rights, and let other nations follow our lead. 
                                     <P>

<h2>Any U.N. Treaty is a Treaty We Can Do Without</h2></center>
<P>

 
Any United Nations treaty is a treaty we can do without, because it will  
surely threaten the rights of Americans . 
 <P>
One of Douglas MacArthur's famous lines was, "Old soldiers never die,  
they just fade away." Unfortunately, old treaties not only never die; they  
don't even fade away. Old treaties retain their life forever. Also,  
unfortunately, the United Nations has some old treaties lying around, and  
we must be ever-vigilant if we are to be sure they are never ratified. 
             <P>
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights would change  
the marriage laws of most of our states in the name of equality and  
thereby repeal the fundamental legal rights possessed by American wives.  
This Treaty would give carte blanche to some future international  
tribunal by insisting that all persons are "entitled without discrimination  
to equal protection of the law," without defining what that means. The  
Treaty would allow any foreign government, friendly or unfriendly. to  
accuse the United States of violation. It wouldn't take very long for the  
envious nations of the world to begin their feeding frenzy. How much  
sympathy do you think we would receive from a UN human rights  
committee stacked against us? 
                       <P>
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial  
Discrimination would require the United States to "prohibit and bring to  
an end, by all appropriate means, including legislation as required by  
circumstances, racial discrimination by any persons, group or  
organization." This provision would override our First Amendment right  
to freedom of association in private clubs and other private action. A UN  
Committee would hear complaints against us, without revealing the  
identities of the complainants. The Treaty's enormously broad  
descriptions of racial discrimination would offer endless opportunities for  
mischief as the Committee demands explanations and remedies for our  
alleged transgressions. 
                              <P>
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  
would require the United States to "recognize the right of everyone [in  
the world] to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family,  
including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous  
improvement of living conditions." It would further require that we  
"ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to  
need." How would we recognize that "right," and how would we ensure  
that "equitable distribution"? With an ever-increasing transfer of 
American wealth, that's how! 
                                        <P>
The worst aspect of the UN Treaty on Economic, Social and Cultural  
Rights is its refusal to include the fundamental right to own property.  
This is why the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon. and  
Ford Administrations consistently took the position that the United States  
would not sign it. President Jimmy Carter reversed this position and  
signed it, which means this UN treaty is sitting around in the bottom  
drawer waiting for a chance to be ratified. 
                 <P>
All these UN treaties are bad news for the United States, and a threat to  
our constitutional liberties. If you hear that any UN treaty is being  
considered in the U.S. Senate, be sure to tell your Senator to vote no.

<title>Oppose UN Children's Rights Treaty -- Duplantier</title></head>

<hr>
<h2>Oppose UN Children's Rights Treaty</h2></center>
<P>

 
The proposed UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is a good example of  
why Americans should vigorously oppose all efforts to transform the UN  
into an organization with real authority. This Treaty would override the  
U.S. Constitution, giving the federal government power over children that  
supersedes the rights of parents. 
                <P>
The underlying premise of the United States Constitution is that all  
individuals are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.  
Our Constitution serves to protect those preexisting rights against  
encroachment by government. So-called human rights treaties proposed  
by the UN, on the other hand, presuppose that individual rights originate  
with the treaties themselves, or with the governments of signatory  
nations. This is a crucial distinction, because what government gives  
government can take away. 
                <P>
The UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is a case in point. The Treaty  
purports to give the child the right to express his own views freely in all  
matters, to receive information of any kind from whatever source, to  
choose his own religion, and to enjoy "rest and leisure." Back talk and  
blasphemy are therefore protected, as are propaganda and pornography,  
cults and covens, idleness and iniquity -- any interest or activity indulged  
in by an undisciplined child. 
                        <P>
The Treaty would serve to protect these supposed rights of children not  
against the encroachment of government, but against the encroachment of  
parents. By denying the right of parents to raise their offspring as they see  
fit and by encouraging the rebellion of sons and daughters, the Treaty  
would divide the family into warring factions, effectively destroying the  
one institution that truly does protect the rights of children. 
                                   <P>
This UN Treaty stipulates that primary education be "compulsory and  
available free to all," giving no indication as to whether this provision  
would either require the subsidization of private and religious schools or  
prohibit their existence altogether. Prescribing school curriculum with a  
specificity contrary to our custom, the Treaty calls for inculcating in all  
children respect for "the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United  
Nations," for "civilizations different from his or her own," for the  
"equality of sexes," and for "the natural environment." The glorification  
of such things will no doubt be accompanied by the stigmatization of  
religious faith, American culture, heterosexuality, traditional families,  
and private enterprise. 
                 <P>
The Treaty would also require our government to "ensure the  
development of institutions, facilities and services for the care of  
children" and to establish universal standards for protecting young  
persons against neglect, exploitation, and abuse. Refusing to surrender  
one's child to the care of a government-approved institution may be  
presumed to constitute incontrovertible evidence of neglect. Who's to  
decide? A new international bureaucracy, of course, which will be  
established to monitor abuse of the bogus rights created by the Treaty. A  
committee of ten so-called experts will supervise this effort, and you can  
bet your first-born baby that their view of what's proper for your progeny  
will not coincide with yours. 
                        <P>

<h2>Oppose The UN Convention on Discrimination Against Women</h2></center>
<P>

 
The United Nations Convention on Discrimination Against Women  
would upset the constitutional balance of power between our federal and  
state governments, undermine many of the rights possessed by American  
women, and subject our society to regulation by a committee of  
international inquisitors. 
                            <P>
The very first article of the UN Treaty on Women should have aroused  
the suspicions of every U.S. Senator. How could anyone sworn to uphold  
the U.S. Constitution fail to recognize the impropriety of ratifying a  
treaty that candidly promises to control "private organizations and even  
interpersonal relationships," and to reach into areas that are not regulated  
by the federal government? Neither magnifying glass nor fine-tooth comb  
was needed to examine this treaty; the threats it poses to our nation's  
sovereignty and the rights of American citizens are writ large! 
                       <P>
Article 2. for example, would invalidate laws that register males only for  
military service and assign males only to combat duty. Does any Senator  
believe that the majority of the American people favor the drafting of  
women and their assignment to the combat infantry? Article 2 would also  
require Congress to pass "appropriate corrective legislation" to regulate  
"membership in private clubs or organizations." Would this mean the  
sexual integration of women's colleges, of professional sports  
organizations, of Scout troops, of convents and monasteries? You bet it  
would! 
                               <P>
That's not the half of it. Make no mistake about it: what we're talking  
about here is the other half In the interest of eliminating alleged  
discrimination against the half of the population that is female,  
everything must be cut in half. Article 4 authorizes strict sexual quotas in  
employment, stipulating that special measures "aimed at accelerating de  
facto equality between men and women shall not be considered  
discrimination." Article 10 would require the "elimination of any  
stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all  
forms of education, " and that means both public and private schools. 
                                       <P>
Article 11 would require Congress to legislate Comparable Worth, the  
feminist notion that government functionaries should establish wage  
scales based on their own subjective notions of "value." Never mind the  
influence of such market variables as the availability of labor, the demand  
for a given product or service, and the cost of living in a given area.  
Never mind that all the countries that rely on government-set wages have  
lower wages, and lower standards of living, than we Americans do.  
Article 11 would also require "the establishment and development of a  
network of child-care facilities," so that all women would be free to cast  
off the joys of motherhood and revel in the drudgery of wage labor.  
Article 16 would keep down the demand for such child care facilities by  
providing for abortion on demand. To make sure that all the preceding  
articles are adhered to, Article 17 would bring us under the supervision of  
a committee of 23 so-called experts elected from countries dominated by  
repressive regimes.

<h2>GATT & NAFTA: The After-Effects</h2></center>

The North American Free Trade Agreement (known as NAFTA) and the

havoc on the U.S. economy, but it's not too late to save our sovereignty. 
   <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade (known as ACCT) plans  
this month to file the first of several legal challenges to the NAFTA and  
GATT treaties and the $53 million bailout of Mexico. The Coalition is  
determined to block the implementation of these sovereignty-usurping  
treaties before they cause any more damage. Former U.S. Customs  
Commissioner William von Raab has signed on with the ACCT Lawyers  
Committee supervising the legal challenges, which is headed by  
America's Future Chairman Robert Morris. 
                       <P>
Two years ago, at an ACCT conference on NAFTA, von Raab predicted  
that passage of the trade agreement linking the Mexican and American  
economies would lead to "chaos on the border," and so it has. "Trucks are  
rolling across the Rio Grande by the thousands," ACCT reports, "many of  
them loaded with cocaine and other illegal drugs now being sold on the  
streets and in the school yards all across our country." Thomas Considine,  
director of the federal government's Drug Enforcement Administration.  
advised a Senate committee in August that drug gangs in Mexico could  
eventually rival the ruthless ring now operating in Colombia. According  
to the Washington Times, these gangs routinely rob Southern Pacific  
freight trains "carrying millions of dollars in consumer goods" hecho en  
Mexico and destined for the U.S. market. 
                                  <P>
A Congressional Joint Economic Committee reported that "Mexican  
imports to this country cost the United States 137,000 jobs" in the nine  
months following passage of NAFTA. Imports from Mexico have soared  
since then, perhaps tripling the job-loss figure. "Trade with Mexico has  
been a big factor in the expanding U.S. trade deficit this year," says trade  
correspondent Richard Lawrence in the August 1 8th Journal of  
Commerce. In the first six months of this year, "the U.S. posted an $8.5  
billion merchandise deficit in Mexican trade, compared with a $1 .1  
billion surplus a year earlier." 
                    <P>
A study by Vanderbilt University documents some of the specific  
consequences of NAFTA: tomato production down 25 percent in Florida,  
Scott Paper Company cutting more than 10,000 jobs worldwide prior to  
opening multimillion-dollar plants in Mexico, the virtual elimination of  
the apparel industry in the United States. Syndicated columnist Sam  
Francis says the impact of NAFTA can be measured in "the destruction of  
whole lives, careers and lifetime hopes . . . as plants relocate,  
communities vanish, neighborhoods stagnate and opportunities for  
Middle Americans gurgle away forever in the backwash of NAFTA's  
sweep through the American economy and society." 
                         <P>
The American Coalition for Competitive Trade is determined to  
document the true cost of NAFTA and GATT and to see that these  
treaties are revoked before that cost soars even higher. Their efforts may  
determine whether or not America remains a land of opportunity.

<h2>Federal Government Supports Advocacy Groups</h2></center>
<P>


   

[The U.S. Government awards more than $39 billion a year in grants to 
advocacy groups that most Americans would not support, if given a 
choice. That's $39 billion of our money to promote ideas we don't agree with!]
<p>
The American Association of Retired Persons (known as AARP) 
received more than $73 million in taxpayer funds in a single year. The 
National Trust for Historic Preservation raked in $7 million. The AFL-
CIO and the American Bar Association each garnered more than $2 
million. Neither the lawyers lobby nor any other group is entitled to such handouts, but they obviously have no scruples about asking for them. 
<p>"The financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount 
funneled to these organizations," say Marshall Wittrnann and Charles 
Griffin of the Heritage Foundation. "Each one not only lobbies for its 
contract or grant but also advocates for bigger, more expensive social 
welfare programs."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin have no objection to privately funded advocacy. "It 
is an entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of 
the federal government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which 
lobby Congress or other government entities." This practice is an affront 
to Americans of all political persuasions. "It is ever bit as unjust to force 
liberal taxpayers to fund organizations on the right as it is to force 
conservative taxpayers to finance organizations on the left." say 
Wittmann and Griffin. Taxpayers should not be forced "to underwrite 
advocacy with which they disagree."
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin argue that taxpayer funding of advocacy 
organizations is wrong on at least three levels: "It is fiscally irresponsible 
to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return 
to American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides 
in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite 
few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that 
often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures."
<p>
Our Founding Fathers took great pains to design a government that 
would discourage the growth of factions who seek to promote their own 
special interests without regard to the common good or the rights of 
other citizens. "Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal 
government today subsidizes them," say Wittmann and Griffin. "This 
distorts the political process by favoring one faction over another and by 
nourishing a network of special interests" committed to the growth of 
government.
<p>
Wittmann and Griffin call for "tougher laws" that would put an end to 
the subsidization of factions. They recommend that witnesses testifying 
before Congress "be required to divulge . . . whether they receive federal 
funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount." They insist that 
any organization receiving federal funds should be prohibited not only 
from lobbying, but also from maintaining "organizational ties to any 
entity that engages in lobbying activity." This, they say, is the only way 
to make sure that no American is "compelled to finance lobbying 
activities with which he disagrees."

Duplantier</a> <brNovember 14, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>Multiculturalism is A Step Back</h2></center><P>



[Multiculturalism is the new pet theory of academicians and policy 
planners, but the evidence indicates that cultural diversity often leads to 
social conflict, retards economic progress, and restricts personal 
freedom.]
<p>
                      

The freedom that leads to economic growth is more likely to be found in 
a homogenous society, says Gerald Scully of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis. "Economic freedom and rule of law are fundamental for 
high levels of economic growth," contends Scully. "Security of property, 
freedom of contract, and free market exchange promote capital formation 
and, hence. economic growth. A legal system based on law rather than 
men's whims stabilizes the rules under which resources are allocated." 
<p>Without individual freedom and a legal system that protects it, 
"transforming poor nations into rich nations is virtually impossible." 
says Scully. Poor nations are often characterized by cultural diversitv. 
which leads to "social conflict," a loss of freedom. and a stagnant 
economy.
<p>
All the various immigrant groups that came to America brought with 
them their "own culture, some elements of which were thought to be 
inconsistent with American values." Scully notes that. until recently, our 
national policy was "to homogenize immigrants -- to make them speak 
English and disabuse them of radical political beliefs." As long as we 
maintained this policy. we "managed cultural conflict better than the rest 
of the world." says Scully. "The tension of absorbing different cultures 
through immigration has been partly diffused because of institutions that 
protect individual freedom. and because attempts have been made to 
bring immigrants into the cultural mainstream."
<p>
The problem with multicultural societies is that "the ethnocentric 
differences of race, religion, ethnicity and language often lead to 
enmity." The violence in Northern Ireland. the separatist movement in 
Quebec. the terrorism in Palestine, the ethnic rioting in India -- all are 
manifestations of multicultural madness. "Even if different groups live 
together peacefully," Scully contends, "the lack of a common language 
and common norms reduces cooperation" and drives up the cost of 
commerce.
<p>
Imposing socialist policies can retard economic growth in any society, of 
course, but in multicultural societies "intergroup conflict may result in 
additional economic inefficiency, lower the growth rate, and even turn 
violent. Hostilities make property insecure. which slows the rate of 
capital accumulation. Eventually, in culturally diverse societies, one 
cultural group tends to dominate and to suppress violence and manage 
enmity." That domination generally takes the form of "discriminatory 
restrictions on occupational choice? denial of educational opportunities, 
licensing of trade, confiscation of land, nationalization of business, 
restrictions on property [and] exchange and mobilitv restrictions," all of 
which have an adverse economic impact on society as a whole.
<p>
Scully laments the passing of America's "melting pot" method of 
assimilating immigrants, which combined "disparate elements into a 
common substance." The common rights we shared as individuals, no 
matter what our ethnic origin, are now being replaced by "group rights." 
<p>This is a dangerous development, "because emphasizing our cultural 
differences may exacerbate intergroup enmity and lead to social 
breakdown."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 15, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>United Nations Repatriates Asian Refugees</h2></center><P>



       

[The United Nations High Commission on Refugees has long denied 
reports that it mistreats Asian refugees, forcibly returning many of them 
to the Communist countries from which they fled. But now former 
officials of the UN High Commission have come forward to confirm 
those reports.]
<p>
Officials of the United Nations High Cornrnission on Refugees and 
spokesmen from our own State Department persist in claiming that 
screening procedures for the Vietnamese and Laotian refugees detained 
in holding camps in Thailand. Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia are 
fair and orderly. They also maintain that the poor souls who have been 
repatriated have nothing to fear from the ruthless thugs who rule their 
homelands. These claims have now been challenged, however -- by 
former officials of the UN High Commission itself.
<p>
One such official is Simon Jeans, an Australian attorney who served as a 
legal consultant to the UN High Commission on Refugees in Indonesia 
in 1992. At a recent House of Representatives subcommittee hearing. 
Jeans testified to rampant corruption by the Indonesian officers in charge 
of the refugee camps. "Corruption in Indonesia was systematic," said 
Jeans. Bribes and sexual favors were the price paid for preferential 
treatment.
<p>
Another witness before the House subcommittee was Wa Vue. a leader of 
the Hmong tribal people of Laos. This tribe was an unwavering 
Arnerican ally during the Vietnam war, and its members were postwar 
victims of a violent campaign of genocide by the communist Lao 
government. More than l 00 000 Hmong have found sanctuary in the 
United States, but thousands more live in daily dread of repatriation as 
they languish in the holding camps in Thailand.
<p>
Wa Vue and his father, Vue Mai, were detained in one of those camps. 
Vue Mai was active in a resistance movement known as the United Front 
for the Liberation of Laos. Officials from the UN High Commission and 
the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok persuaded Vue Mai to give up this effort 
and return to Laos. In November 1992 a State Department 
representative, accompanied by Thai and UN officials. escorted Vue Mai 
to the border. He was to meet with Lao officials and arrange for the 
resettlement of a large number of Hmong refugees. In October 1993 he 
disappeared in Laos and has not been heard from since. On February 26, 
1995, the rest of the Vue clan -- except for Vue Mai's wife and his son, 
Wa Vue -- were rounded up and forcibly returned, presumably to suffer a 
similar fate.
<p>
"This tragic tale is further evidence that the United States should 
reexamine its role in refugee screening and treatment in Southeast Asia," 
argues James Tyson, president of the Council for the Defense of 
Freedom. "Contrary to State Department assertions, the House 
subcommittee hearing brought out further evidence that such screening 
is extremely unfair, corrupt, and often violent." Many of the refugees 
from tyrannical regimes in Southeast Asia were loyal allies of the U.S. 
during the Vietnam War, says Tyson. "We have a real obligation to see 
that they receive equitable hearings."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 16, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-Poverty Program Supports Leftist Causes</h2></center><P>




[Every year on the weekend before Thanksgiving, American Catholics 
are asked to contribute to their Church's Campaign for Human 
Development (known as CHD). More and more Catholics are declining 
to do so, however, as they learn about the Campaign's strange support for 
radical, left-wing organizations.]
<p>
The Capital Research Center in Washington DC reports that the 
Campaign for Human Development. the antipoverty program of the 
American Catholic bishops. is not at all what the faithful have been led 
to believe it is. If American Catholics had had any idea where the money 
really goes, they would not have dumped more than $230 million into 
the CHD collection baskets over the past 25 years. "What they are not 
told. and what the bureaucrats at CHD do not want them to know." the 
Capital Research Center charges. "is that most of CHD's money goes to 
support liberal activists who use it teach people how to organize and 
agitate for more government spending programs."
<p>
Adding insult to injury. "CHD-funded activists are often openly 
disdainful of the teachings of the Catholic Church. Whose offerings they 
gladly accept." CHD's 25th anniversary conference, held three months 
ago in Chicago. provided a good example of the persons and policies 
unwittinglv promoted by pious parishioners. Conference participants 
were treated to speeches By "a Marxist college professor. pro-abortion 
and pro-gay rights activists. and a strident opponent of school choice."
<p>
The Campaign for Human Development "operates on the same 
assumptions as Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty," providing no 
incentives for "individual striving and responsibility." According to the 
Capital Research Center. "Rather than offer the poor the example of 
success, and guidance in achieving it. CHD explains why poverty is the 
system's fault and teaches how to radicalize institutions." Despite its 
claims of nonpartisanship, "almost all of its activities fall on the left -- 
often the far-left -- side of the ideological spectrum. CHD-funded groups 
invariably favor public policies that require state intervention and 
decision-making. And these build support for their positions by resorting 
to the rhetoric of class consciousness and the tactics of social conflict."
<p>
The Capital Research Center contends that "CHD has established a long 
track record of funding groups whose activities many Catholics would 
find repugnant." It also has a history of responding to the problems of 
society with solutions that "preclude genuine Christian social action. By 
concentrating on tried-and-failed methods of victimization and blame, 
CHD undermines the individual's capacity for spiritual, moral, and social 
renewal."
<p>
The Capital Research Center implores the American bishops "to initiate 
a desperately-needed overhaul of the Campaign for Human 
Development," urging them to "exercise active oversight, not rubber-
stamp decisions by CHD professional staff." If nothing else, the bishops 
should be "honest with parishioners about the aims and activities of 
CHD." In the meantime, if American Catholics want to know what 
they're contributing to, they'll have to conduct their own investigations.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 17, 1995 <br></i><hr><h2>The Enduring Wisdom of John T. Flynn</h2></center><P>


[Noted journalist and author John T. Flynn warned more than 50 years 
ago that America was headed down "the road to Socialism. " His 
recommendations for averting disaster are just as valid today as they 
were then.]
<p>
In a book called The Road Ahead, published decades ago, the late John 
T. Flynn argued that Americans committed to fighting the creeping 
advance of socialism in our country must first "rid themselves of the 
moral intimidation which has been imposed on their minds." An excerpt 
from that book appears in a new compilation of Flynn's writing entitled 
Forgotten Lessons. published by the Foundation for Economic 
Education. Flynn noted that "the American system has been painted as 
something wicked. bungling. even brutal. while the Planned New World 
of the future will be filled with sweetness, light, and plenty." This false 
picture has had an impact not only on naive Americans, but also on 
those who ought to know better.
<p>
John T. Flynn observed that the choice before us is not "between a 
perfect system called Socialism and an imperfect system called 
Capitalism. It is a choice between two human systems both of which will 
inevitably have their imperfections because they are human. But the 
Socialist Planners do not concede this. Capitalism they present to us only 
in terms of its defects. But Socialism is painted only in terms of the 
wonderful things it is going to do some day." Citing the disastrous effects 
of Socialism in Russia. Germany. Italy. and Britain. Flynn reminded his 
readers that "the greatest and most efficient producing machine in the 
world is in [America]. This did not happen by accident " he asserted. "It 
is the result of the soil of freedom in which it grew."
<p>
Socialism was far advanced in America even in Flys day, and it has 
gained ground since then. Fort years later we are still confronted with 
the need to counteract what Fly called "the social disease that is 
destroying us." Flynn urged his countrymen to "stop apologizing for our 
Capitalist society." We should take no more steps down the road to 
Socialism. he said. and we should turn out of office any politician who 
tries to lead us in that direction. Flynn pointed out. Iong before Dan 
Quayle and Pat Buchanan. "that we are in a social war. and that we must 
fight it as such." He said we should "put an end to the orgy of spending 
that is rapidly bankrupt the nation," quit trying to plan our economy, and 
instead let "our free system of private enterprise operate at its fullest 
capacity."
<p>
John T. Flynn was a founding member of America's Future, the producer 
of this series of broadcasts, and a man of great wisdom and vision. Flynn 
advised his readers to rediscover their principles in the U.S. 
Constitution. the Declaration of Independence, and American history -- 
and use those principles "to dismantle the tyrant State in America and to 
build up once again the energies of a free people."

President Clinton has made much of his plan to "reinvent government, " 
but a prominent management consultant says the President's proposed 
reforms would only make matters worse.
<p>
President Clinton promised to overhaul the federal civil service so as "to 
make the entire federal government both less expensive and more 
efficient, and to change the culture of our national bureaucracy awav 
from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and empowerment." 
But Donald J. Devine. former director of the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management says that "this reinvention will weaken management. Iead 
to greater inefficiencies. dilute individual performance initiative. 
reinforce the culture of complacency. and make government less 
accountable."
<p>
In a Heritage Foundation report entitled "Making Government Work," 
Device argues that the President's proposed reforms downplay the 
importance of individual merit and performance and shift control over 
the executive branch from the President to federal bureaucrats and 
unions. "Instead of reinventing government." savs Devine, "Clinton's 
proposals would make things worse by transferring leadership to 
committees and unions and assuring weak executive leadership."
<p>
President Clinton's proposals ignore the key principles of "real 
government reform." says Devine. the first of which is to "keep the 
mission simple." To be successful. every government agency must have 
"a simple. clear mission with an imaginative leadership dedicated to that 
mission." Unfortunately. "government missions have become enormously 
more complex" than they used to be. and civil servants are now saddled 
with responsibilities that are ill-defined or contradictory. "Government." 
Devine insists. "can work effectively only when relatively few things are 
assigned unambiguously to a few institutions with sufficient esprit le 
corps to do them well."
<p>
Devine notes that our central government has "strayed far from its 
federalist roots" and recommends that its scope be strictly limited once 
again. "Functions properly performed by the states should be transferred 
back to them." he says. The federal government should also take 
advantage of the "reduced costs. greater efficiency, and improved 
management that flow from contracting work out to the private sector."
<p>
Devine calls for the reestablishment of "a true merit system." The hiring 
and promotion of civil servants must be based on "knowledge, skills, and 
abilities" once again. he says. The President and his department heads 
must accept and assert their responsibility for the activities of the 
executive branch. Devine notes that "the thrust of the Clinton reforms is 
to remove authority from the political and career executives . . . and 
transfer it to labor-management councils." This is foolish and 
irresponsible. says Devine. "Without political leadership. when the 
President gives an order, there is no reason to assume anything will 
happen down the line in the federal bureaucracy. That is why 
responsibility in current law rests with the political agency head." 
Devine argues that "effective government management requires strong 
agency leadership," which in turn requires straightforward missions and 
clear-cut performance standards.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 21, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Affirmative Action Discriminates Against Whites</h2></center><P>


   

[The debate over affirmative action and the alleged disparity in 
opportunities for whites and blacks overlooks one thing -- not all blacks 
are alike, and neither are all whites.]
<p>
In a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, former U.S. Navy Secretary 
James Webb pointed out that "differences among white ethnic groups are 
huge. fed by cultural tradition, the time and geography of migrations to 
the country, and . . . the tendency of white Americans to discriminate 
against other whites in favor of their own class and culture." Webb cited 
a 1974 study by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research 
Center that divided white Americans into 17 distinct ethnic and religious 
backgrounds.
<p>
The study ranked these 17 separate groups according to their educational 
and financial status. and the results were not what you might have 
expected. "Contrary to prevailing mythology, the vaunted White Anglo-
Saxon Protestants were even then not at the top," said Webb. Jews in 
fact, led the list. followed by Irish. Italian. German. and Polish 
Catholics, in that order. Educational attainment and income levels 
within each group were consistent throughout the country which would 
seem to indicate that differences among the groups are "culturally rather 
than geographically based."
<p>
According to that 1974 study, white families at the top of this list earned 
nearly $5000 more per year than white families at the bottom. The 
income difference between whites and blacks as a whole, at the time. was 
less than $4000. The obvious conclusion, according to Webb, is that. 
"even prior to the major affirmative action programs, there was a greater 
variation within 'white America' than there was between 'white America' 
and black America. and the whites at the bottom were in approximately 
the same situation as blacks."
<p>
The whites at the bottom are the ones who have felt the brunt of 
affirmative action. at the very time when a shrinking industrial base and 
a declining public school system are diminishing their prospects for self-
improvement. But sympathy for their plight is not in fashion. "The 
prevailing attitude has been to ridicule whites who have the audacity to 
complain about their reduced status." said Webb. and to rationalize 
policies that discriminate against them as remedies for a "past wrong."
<p>
Webb says the working-class white male "sees a government system that 
seems bent on belittling the basis of his existence, and has established a 
set of laws and regulations that often keep him from competing His 
evermore-isolated leaders have mandated [a so-called] 'equal 
opportunity' bureaucracy in the military . government and industry . . . 
whose sole function is to report 'political incorrectness' and to encourage 
the promotion of literally everyone but him and his kind." The current, 
coercive celebration of "diversity" has no appeal to the white male at the 
bottom of the ladder. To him, diversity is "a code word used to exclude 
him . . . no matter the extent of his qualifications and no matter the 
obstacles he has had to overcome."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 22, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Unfunded Mandates Shackle States</h2></center><P>



           

[State governments used to agree to almost anything to get on the federal 
gravy train. Now that Washington is making them pay for the ride, some 
states want to get off that train.]
<p>
Unfunded mandates. That's what the uproar's about. It seems the federal 
government is imposing more and more obligations on state 
governments without providing the funds necessary to pay for them. and 
so the states have to come up with the money themselves. Having to raise 
millions of dollars to comply with federal regulations. Or divert funds 
from their own programs, does not sit well with state officials. It's 
patently unfair, and it's unconstitutional. But, in the short run, it may be 
a good thing. After all. the states raised few objections as long as federal 
mandates were fully funded and they might never have complained if 
they hadn't felt the pinch.
<p>
How did the states get themselves into this fix? Thomas Atwood and 
Chris West of the Heritage Foundation explain: "States succumb to the 
temptation of federal funds and buy into a program; the people and the 
state become dependent on it; Congress changes the rules of the game: 
and the state is directed actually to change its law or even its constitution 
in order to continue receiving the popular funding. Strings-attached 
programs can lead to the federal government's virtually dictating state 
law. Yet. all too often. states have been quick to bargain ~" a! their 
autonomy in pursuit of federal dollars."
<p>
Complying with the dictates of the federal government used to be seen as 
"a small price to pay for federal funding of popular state-implemented 
programs." say Atwood and West. "But now the federal share of that 
funding is decreasing while the mandates are becoming more numerous. 
complex. and expensive. Unfunded federal mandates and highly 
prescriptive federal programs have backed many states and localities into 
a fiscal comer. forcing them to sacrifice their own programs and 
priorities in order to comply with standards set by a distant federal 
government."
<p>
Now at long last. state officials are "challenging the authority of the 
federal government to impose these mandates. whether funded or not." 
They're monitoring the votes of their Congressmen on mandates. They're 
challenging the federal government's ever-widening interpretation of the 
Constitution's Comrnerce Clause. Theyre accusing the federal 
government of violating the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the 
states and the people all powers not expressly delegated to the federal 
government. And on occasion, they're just plain refusing to comply.

Atwood and West warn that "the centralization of power in Washington 
threatens to smother America's enterprise and liberty." But the battle is 
joined, and the tide may be turning. "The states have the power, the 
authority, the opportunity, and the responsibility to rein in an out-of-
control federal government," say Atwood and West. All they need now is 
the will to assert themselves, and the determination to stick to their guns.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 23, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Thanksgiving Reflections</h2></center><P>


                           

[Today is a day to give thanks. But gratitude doesn't always come easily.]
<p>
It can be difficult to be grateful to someone who offers what is good for 
us when what is good for us is not what we want. Often we are grateful 
for the wrong things, the things that spoil us instead of the things that 
make us strong. As children we may appreciate the teacher who forgoes 
homework assignments. the parent who slips us cash without demanding 
any labor in return. and the aunt who plies us with candy. As ignorant. 
penniless adults with mouths full of cavities we ma! take the longer 
view.
<p>
Making a list of the gifts we have received can be a good way to develop 
our sense of gratitude and to sharpen our ability to recognize the hidden 
benefits in things that have not come gift-wrapped. We might begin our 
survey by listing those things that we recognize immediately as gifts: the 
presents we receive for birthdays. the year-end bonuses. the winning 
lottery tickets. Then w e might list those things we take for granted but 
would recognize as gifts if we thought about it: our health. our talents. 
the perfect weather for last weekend's picnic. Next, a list of rights. 
which. if we're honest. we will concede are not rights at all but privileges 
or gifts: life. liberty, property.
<p>
Last. we might list those burdens that -- if we think long and hard 
enough -- will be seen to provide some unexpected benefits and to 
constitute blessings in disguise: those long commutes that allow us time 
to plan and to reflect. the financial reverses that force us to draw closer 
to our families in a common struggle. the personal calamities that plumb 
the depth of our character.
<p>
Having prepared a comprehensive list of gifts received -- one that 
includes not only the obvious gifts. but also the ones we take for granted. 
the ones we think of as being rightfully ours. and even the ones we are 
accustomed to think of as burdens -- it remains only to determine the 
source of all these gifts and to select an appropriate response for 
communicating our appreciation. We will find that. just as the majority 
of our gifts have not come wrapped, so too have they arrived without 
labels identifying the giver. And yet. those of us who are not determined 
to be dense will readily acknowledge Who is the source. direct or indirect      
of all gifts.
<p>
But how will we show appreciation to Him? The best way is by putting 
the gifts He has given us to good use. The familiar parable of the talents 
suggests that it is not enough to reach the end of our journey merely with 
the gifts He has given us intact. We are meant to develop our aptitudes. 
invest our graces wisely!. make the most of our opportunities, and 
overcome the obstacles that confront us. That's what Thanksgiving is all 
about.

Duplantier</a> <br>November 24, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Spies Elude U.S. Security</h2></center><P>

[The John Walker spy case shocked America. How did Walker manage to 
steal so many of our county's secrets and pass them on to the Soviets for 
18 years without being detected?]
<p>
How did John Walker get away with his treacherous activities? The 
answer is simple: "The U.S. security system does not work." <p>That's the 
conclusion of George P. Morse, a security consultant with half a century 
of experience. Morse considers it likely that "American secrets are still 
being compromised in ways similar to those which John Walker found so 
easy and effective to employ, for there is really no effective U.S. 
government security system in place to stem the hemorrhaging." In a 
new book called America Twice Betrayed Morse concludes that our 
nation's security system is "unsound and unworkable and should be 
abolished and replaced."
<p>
A veteran of 30 years' service with the OSS and CIA, Morse contends 
that the apprehension of spies like Walker has resulted more often from 
luck than vigilance. "The great majority of spies and enemy agents have 
actually been uncovered by accident." he observes, "or through exposure 
by the subject's relatives or defectors from the intelligence services of 
other nations. They have not generally been uncovered by our official 
government security, investigative. or intelligence systems." In fact. says 
Morse. "the way security has traditional v been conceived and organized 
by the U.S. government makes it virtually impossible to protect our 
secrets."
<p>
In his book. America Twice Betrayed. Morse proposes a new system of 
U.S. government security to "remedy many of the failures of the past 
[and] at the same time substantiallv reduce both the monetary and 
human costs associated with security." What is needed, says Morse, is "a 
total rethinking of our basic approach to security." His first step would be 
to eliminate the "wasteful and counter-productive" full field investigation 
of all applicants for federal employment. Such an investigation "creates 
the illusion that the people investigated and then 'cleared' will always be 
loyal and honest." says Morse. "It provides a false sense of security 
which enables management and staff to avoid [their obligation to 
maintain] constant vigilance."
<p>
Instead, Morse would require the applicant "to offer proof of both 
suitability and trustworthiness and loyalty." Standard reference checks 
would be followed by an intensive interview. drug-screening. and a 
polygraph examination. "Polygraph tests -- and the fear of having to 
undergo one -- are arnong the few really effective tools available to the 
government to deter and detect treason or prevarication." Says Morse, who argues that "applicants seeking government employment and security 
clearance must, as a condition of their employment, accept reasonable 
limits of privacy and their constitutional rights against self-
incrimination."
<p>
Morse also calls for the development of "an appropriate and 
comprehensive set of standards that state concretely what is and what is 
not acceptable to qualify for a U.S. government security clearance." The 
most pressing need. however, is for a dramatic improvement in "the 
abysmal quality of management exercised by the Executive Branch from 
the President on down."

[They're convinced they can solve all the world's problems if we just do 
what they say. No matter how messed up their own lives are, no matter 
how much they disrupt the lives of others, those dauntless do-gooders 
never stop believing that they know what's best for the rest of us.]
<p>
The do-gooders jump from cause to cause, dictating solutions that betray 
ignorance of the problem at hand and total disregard for the consequences 
of their proposals. They don't seem to care whether their policies and 
practices really work or not. Why, then, do they do what they do? <p>Don't 
let their lofty rhetoric fool you. What do-gooders are really after, says 
syndicated columnist Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution, is "ego 
gratification " By making us feel bad, they make themselves feel good.
<p>
Sowell cites many examples. "Recycling, drug education, sex education, 
animal rights, gun control, multiculturalism. environmentalism and 
innumerable other social crusades produce far more benefits to the 
crusaders than for society,. In many cases, they make society worse off," 
says Sowell. "Studies have repeatedly shown recycling does more harm 
than good, and much evidence suggests that the actual consequences of 
both drug education and sex education are nil, at best."
<p>
Do-gooders don't care if recycling causes more ecological damage than 
the original manufacturing process. They don't care if drug and sex 
education programs encourage experimentation. They don't care if gun 
control increases violence. They don't care if multiculturalism 
exacerbates racial tensions. Do-gooders don't care how things really 
work, or what the truth is. Their sole concern is to "make a statement." As 
Sowell points out. "there is no need to check out facts if the real point is 
moral preening."
<p>
Do-gooders have plagued mankind with their coercive correctives for 
hundreds of years. "In the l 9th century, housing reform in the cities was 
the big crusade," says Sowell, "especially in the slums occupied by 
recently arrived immigrants. Though many immigrants lived in crowded 
quarters in run-down neighborhoods because they had no choice, others 
doubled up and scrimped to save money to send to their families back in 
the old country. Some saved to prepare for a better future."
<p>
It's too bad that the do-gooders couldn't leave well enough alone, but it's 
in their nature to interfere. They felt compelled to save those poor souls 
from themselves. "Reformers decided that people needed more space per 
person and wrote that into laws, thereby raising the cost of housing to the 
immigrants," says Sowell. "People were forced to spend their money not 
on what their own top priorities were, but on what the anointed 
busybodies decided was best for them."
<p>
Such meddling has gone on for millennia. Sowell understands the 
syndrome and accepts it as a fact of life, observing that "the real question 
is not why some people treat public policy as exercises in ego 
gratification. The question is why the rest of us listen to them so 
gullibly."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 28, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Public Schools are a Dismal Failure</h2></center><P>
[It's time to face up to the failure of our nation's educational system. A 
Nobel Prize-winning economist argues that the only way to save the 
public schools is to privatize them.]
<p>
"Our elementary and secondary educational system needs to be radically 
reconstructed," says Nobel economist Milton Friedman of the Hoover 
Institution. The system is hopelessly defective, and the "technological 
and political revolutions of the past few decades" are only going to make 
it worse. Friedman predicts that "a widening gap between the incomes of 
the highly skilled . . . and the unskilled" will lead to "serious social 
conflict. "
<p>
Friedman points out that dramatic technological advances have "made it 
possible for a company located anywhere in the world to use resources 
located anywhere in the world, to produce a product anywhere in the 
world, to be sold anywhere in the world." Equally dramatic political 
changes in Eastern Europe and Latin America have led to the widespread 
rejection of central planning in favor of free markets and "added greatly 
to the pool of low-wage, yet not necessarily unskilled labor" with which 
U.S. workers must compete. These developments have put "downward 
pressure on the wages of low-skilled labor," widening the income gap in 
America. If this gap continues to widen, "it threatens to create within our 
own country a social problem of major proportions," warns Friedman. 
<p>"Such stratification is a recipe for social disaster." Only a dramatically 
improved school system can brighten the prospects of Americans at the 
bottom of the economic ladder.
<p>
Friedman argues that "radical reconstruction can be achieved only by 
privatizing a major segment of the educational system." To encourage "a 
gradual yet substantial transfer from government to private enterprise." 
<p>Friedman recommends "a voucher system that enables parents to choose 
freely the schools their children attend." He concedes, however, that "the 
political power of the school establishment" has been, and will continue 
to be, a major obstacle to this effort.
<p>
Central city residents suffer most from the poor quality of public 
schooling. "The reason is partly the deterioration of our central cities, 
partly the increased centralization of public schools." says Friedman. 
<p>"Power has moved from the local community to the school district to the 
state, and to the federal government. About 90 percent of our kids now go 
to so-called public schools. which are really not public at all but simply 
private fiefs primarily of the administrators and the union officials."
<p>
Friedman insists that everyone will benefit from a voucher system, 
"except a small group of vested interests." The big winners will be "the 
residents of central cities, who will have a real alternative to the wretched 
schools so many of their children are now forced to attend." That "small 
group of vested interests" has tremendous clout, however. <p>"The teachers' 
unions are bitterly opposed to any reform that lessens their own power," 
says Friedman, "and they have acquired enormous political and financial 
strength." They won't hesitate to use that strength to defeat "any attempt 
to adopt a voucher system."

Duplantier</a> <br>November 29, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legalized Gambling Destroying Communities</h2></center><P> 
 
[The social and economic havoc that legalized gambling is wreaking on  
communities throughout our country could have been avoided, if only  
Americans had learned the lessons of history.]  
  <p>
"On the whole, legalization of gambling in the United States has failed  
completely. Instead of eliminating abuses, it increased them . . .  
legalization attracted criminals." That's the conclusion of Virgil Peterson,  
onetime director of the Chicago Crime Commission. Mr. Peterson made  
those remarks in the 1950s, but they're even more appropriate today, now  
that state lotteries and gambling casinos have sprouted up all over the  
country.  
  <p>
"Commercialized vice and gambling have always been the principal  
props of the underworld," said Peterson, more than 40 years ago. "The  
intrinsic character of gambling naturally attracts the criminal element.  <p>
The kidnapper, the armed robber, the burglar, and the thief engage in  
their criminal enterprises for the purpose of obtaining money without  
working. Gambling establishments appeal to this type of individual."  
  <p>
In 1956 a New Orleans newspaper published a series of editorials  
reminding its readers of the many social ills that inevitably result when  
commercial gamblers are allowed to gain a foothold in a community.  
New Orleanians should have known better. After all, the city had had a  
long history of legal and illegal gambling and the dire consequences were  
a matter of public record. "Those who cannot remember the past are  
condemned to repeat it," said the philosopher George Santayana, and he  
might have added that there are always sharpies in the shadows waiting to  
cash in on our short memories.  
  <p>
The editorial writer for the New Orleans paper argued that "commercial  
gambling breeds official and political corruption. It is the incubator of the  
racketeer and the gangster." How do gambling interests gain a foothold?   <p>
What happened more than 40 years ago in Phenix City, Alabama typifies  
their methods: "The gamblers moved in, with the sanction of some  
officials. The bribe money looked good to them. They let more gamblers  
in. But the gambling profits looked even better. They moved in with the  
gamblers." Greed knows no limits, however. "Big, easy profits make big  
spenders. Big spenders seek bigger profits, and, eventually, some  
insurance that their profits will continue." Wherever the professional  
gambler operates, "he amasses a huge fortune which he eventually uses to  
influence government so as to insure not only his continued prosperity  
but an even greater one."  
  <p>
The newspaper warned that "the crime that gambling breeds is not  
confined to the professional gamblers. Infected also are hopeless  
gamblers. Like the dope addict, the gambling addict finds his fleeting  
thrills expensive. Money earned through lawful means rarely can support  
his pleasures. He turns to crime, to stickups, to burglary, to  
embezzlement, to white slavery, even to murder, for the fast buck that he  
needs to indulge himself."  
  <p>
Today's racketeers may have MBAs and designer suits, but they're still  
racketeers, and their activities are sucking the lifeblood out of our local  
economies and breeding vice. How much damage will they have to do  
before we send them packing?

Duplantier</a> <br>November 30, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>PC on Campus Hinders Pursuit of Truth</h2></center><P>
[The search for truth is getting to be a risky business.  Just ask any  
college student who's run afoul of the thought police on campus.]   
  <p>
There's no longer any use in denying it. The temples of learning have   
become indoctrination centers. Academic freedom has given way to mass   
hysteria. A bizarre misanthropic cult now reigns supreme on American   
college campuses. "Political correctness has been used to enforce   
conformity and to stifle debate," say Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann of the   
Hoover Institution. "Censorship is practiced in a variety of ways. through   
the planned disruption of meetings, the use of so-called speech codes, and   
the coercive use of sensitivity training or suspension from school.   
<p>Indirect censorship is also practiced through the selection of assigned   
reading and also through hiring practices."  
  <p>
The puppets of political correctness reject the European focus of   
American history, ignoring the fact that "the United States is, for the   
greater part, a demographic and cultural extension of Europe beyond the   
Atlantic. About four-fifths of the US population derives from European   
stock," say Duignan and Gann. "The United States owes a cultural debt to   
almost every land under the sun," they concede. "But no other country   
influenced the United States as much as Great Britain." Our language, our   
literature, our legal system, our system of government, our ethical system   
-- all have British origins.   
  <p>
The PC crowd insists on a growing array of ethnic studies programs to   
remedy the alleged racial bias of Western scholarship. They're unwilling   
to accept the fact that the United States is a product of Western   
civilization. with pronounced European characteristics -- characteristics   
that include a unique appreciation for cultures other than its own. <p>"Far   
from being one of the world's most oppressive societies, the United States   
is the most successful multiracial and multiethnic state in existence," say   
Duignan and Gann. "No other country attracts as many immigrants and   
bestows its citizenship on so many newcomers. No other country is   
ethnically more varied."  
  <p>
Purveyors of political correctness claim that the West has had a uniformly   
negative impact on lesser developed countries. On the contrary.   
"mainland has gained in the long run by the Western conquest of the New   
World and by the consequent emergence of new nations," say Duignan   
and Gann. "Modern industrial civilization allows not only higher   
economic productivity! than its early predecessors but also an infinitely   
larger population and higher material well-being and a longer life," not to   
mention "an infinitely larger number of choices."  
  <p>
In their eagerness to condemn the United States as a racist and sexist   
society. the PC partisans willingly ignore the numerous alternative   
explanations for economic inequities -- such as the median age of ethnic   
groups. cultural and genetic differences. and so on. They also maintain   
that America is not the free country we have all been "brainwashed" to   
believe it is. That they themselves are the ones who have been   
brainwashed. that the PC movement itself threatens the liberties of all   
Americans -- such ironies are lost on this humorless horde.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 1, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>NAFTA Bad for American Workers</h2></center><P>

[It is estimated that nearly one million Americans lost their jobs this year 
as a direct result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (known as 
NAFTA). How many more American workers will have to suffer the 
same fate before our leaders admit they made a mistake?] 
 <p>
NAFTA has taken a terrible toll on the American economy, and the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as GATT) will only 
make matters worse, says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. Gill points out that "the United States is currently 
running record trade deficits with Mexico, after years of chalking up 
trade surpluses against that country." Of even greater concern is "the 
continued migration of our industrial plants to Mexico, which every day 
robs us of more jobs." An estimated one million jobs will have been lost 
by the end of this year. In spite of their rosy, pre-NAFTA predictions, 
giant American companies like Mattel, Allied Signal, General Electric. 
Procter & Gamble, Scott Paper, and Zenith have failed to create the 
thousands of new jobs in the United States that they promised. Instead, 
they have laid off American workers. 
 <p>
NAFTA hasn't done Mexico and Canada any good either, says Gill. "In 
Mexico, hundreds of thousands of poor farmers are being driven off the 
land and the middle class is collapsing under interest rates which in some 
cases are well over 100 percent. Conditions have become so bad in 
Canada that several western provinces . . . are threatening to secede." Gill 
says that Mexico is in "a state of chaos since NAFTA." Drug trafficking 
is on the rise, crime is burgeoning, farmers are in revolt. "The collapse of 
the peso drove hundreds of small businessmen into bankruptcy," says 
Gill.  "The job losses have been tremendous, in spite of the growth of 
exports to the U.S." Nearly 60 percent of the Mexican workforce is 
unemployed. 
 <p>
As Mexico's internal problems worsen, they pose a growing threat to the 
health and security of the United States. "Even before NAFTA, Mexico 
was the principal conduit for cocaine coming into the U.S. from 
Columbia and other Latin American countries," and the volume has 
increased substantially ever since. "Crime, rampant in Mexico for 
decades, has spilled across the border like a tidal wave in the last two 
years." 
 <p>
William Gill contends that "the American people, like the Mexicans and 
Canadians, have all been made the victims of a gigantic fraud -- the 
biggest scam in history." He argues that there is "only one way to halt the 
insanity  NAFTA and GATT are spreading across America and around 
the world. And that is to roll back both of these fraudulent treaties." Gill 
insists that "NAFTA must be abrogated. America and Mexico cannot 
keep on absorbing the terrible punishment this treaty has inflicted upon 
the people of both countries." 
 <p>
Gill's group, the American Coalition for Competitive Trade, is filing 
several legal challenges to NAFTA and GATT and the $53 billion bailout 
of Mexico. The Coalition wants to block the implementation of these 
treaties before they cause any more damage to our sovereignty and to our 
economy.

<html><HEAD><TITLE>Duplantier:  ANTI-RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY RAMPANT IN HOLLYWOOD</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><h4>BEHIND THE HEADLINES </h4><i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F.R. Duplantier</a> <br>December 4, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Anti-religious Bigotry Rampant in Hollywood</h2></center><P>
[A new documentary offers numerous examples of the anti-religious 
bigotry that is rampant in Hollywood.] 
 <p>
"For years now, the entertainment industry has attacked our faith and 
undermined our value system," observes Dr. James Dobson of Focus on 
the Family, in his introduction to a new documentary entitled Hollywood 
vs. Religion. "The entire Judeo-Christian tradition is ridiculed." The 
hour-long video tape is narrated by Michael Medved, New York Post 
film critic and co-host of the PBS program called Sneak Previews.  He 
examines more than 50 contemporary films that lampoon the religious 
beliefs of the American people. Unfortunately, this is just a sampling.  <p>
"There are a great many other movies that also mock our faith," says 
Dobson. 
 <p>
According to Medved, Hollywood's hostility toward religion is a fairly 
recent development. Showing heartwarming scenes of Spencer Tracy in 
Boys Town, Bing Crosby in The Bells of St. Mary's, and Julie Andrews 
in The Sound of Music.  Medved notes that "this tradition of taking a 
positive view of the clergy and the faithful continued well into the l960s." <p>
But the film world has lost its fondness for the faith.  "Today, by contrast, 
moviemakers will stretch to insert images of vicious clergymen or crazed 
killer Christians,'' says Medved.  They'll even go so far as to introduce 
vicious stereotypes into remakes of old films -- such as The Blob and 
Cape Fear -- where none existed before. 
 <p>
What are the stereotypes? Here's how Hollywood views the world of 
religion: "The Catholic Church is linked to the Mafia. Evangelical 
believers are suckers and dupes. In their hearts, many Christians want to 
take over the country and establish a dictatorship. Orthodox Jews are 
hypocrites.  Agnostics, on the other hand, are wise, wonderful people." <p>
Hollywood will bend over backwards not to offend the fringe elements of 
society, but the cherished beliefs of the vast majority of Americans are 
fair game. "Only the sensibilities of mainstream Western religious groups 
are repeatedly ignored." says Medved. "And many films send the 
unmistakable message that higher truth can only be found outside the 
teaching of all organized faith." 
 <p>
Everything in Hollywood is carefully calculated, says Medved, and that 
includes the anti-religious imagery that we are seeing more and more of: 
"It's no accident when filmmakers show us so many villains who happen 
to be religious," he observes.  Why do they do it?  Directors and 
producers like to claim that they're only giving the public what it wants, 
but the box-office failure of such offensive movies as The Last 
Temptation of Christ puts the lie to this claim. More than three dozen 
films featuring repugnant religious stereotypes have come out of 
Hollywood in recent years. "Almost all of these movies ended up losing 
money," says Medved. The real reason that such films continue to be 
made is that they reflect the mindset of a "tightly knit community whose 
members happen to share some similar, unspoken values and biases. And 
one of those biases involves sincere and deep-seated contempt for 
organized religion."

Duplantier</a> <br>December 5, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Legal Redistribution of Wealth Unjust</h2></center><P>
[Our legal system can be just, or it can be philanthropic, but it cannot be 
both.] 
 <p>
"Self-preservation and self-development are common aspirations among 
all people. And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties 
and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor, social progress would be 
. . . uninterrupted," observed the l9th Century French economist Frederic 
Bastiat in a small book titled "The Law," published in 1850. "But there is 
also another tendency that is common among people. When they can, 
they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others." 
 <p>
In order to live, legally, at someone else's expense, it is necessary to turn 
the law into "an instrument of plunder." No matter how noble the 
justification, once the premise is accepted that a government can 
expropriate the wealth of some of its citizens and dispense it to others, 
theft has been legalized, and the signal has been sent -- to haves and 
havenots alike -- that nothing is secure. Bastiat considered this the 
greatest evil to which any society can be subjected, but recognized it as 
the ultimate goal of all greedy men and do-gooders. The ill effects of 
such a transformation are predictable. When the law ceases to be just, 
respect for it diminishes, and society suffers.  "The safest way to make 
laws respected is to make them respectable," said Bastiat. "When law and 
morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of 
either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law." 
 <p>
Bastiat argued that "the most peaceful, the most moral, and the happiest 
people" in the world are to be found in "countries where the law least 
interferes with private affairs; where government is least felt; where the 
individual has the greatest scope, and free opinion the greatest influence; 
where administrative powers are fewest and simplest; where taxes are 
lightest...." Their bliss shall continue only so long as each citizen 
remembers that "the existence of persons and property preceded the 
existence of the legislator, and his function is only to guarantee their 
safety." 
 <p>
Inevitably, though, there will be some who think they are better than the 
rest of us. "Too many persons place themselves above mankind," said 
Bastiat; "they make a career of organizing it, patronizing it, and ruling it." <p>
But mankind does not need their help. "God has given to men all that is 
necessary for them to accomplish their destinies." Bastiat had no use for 
"quacks and organizers . . . with their artificial systems!" He denounced 
"the whims of governmental administrators, their socialized projects, 
their centralization, their tariffs, their government schools, their state 
religions, their free credit, their bank monopolies, their regulations, their 
restrictions, their equalization by taxation, and their pious moralizations!" 
 <p>
Bastiat's challenge to the do-gooders bears frequent repetition: "You who 
think that you are so great! You who judge humanity to be so small! You 
who wish to reform everything! Why don't you reform yourselves?"

Duplantier</a> <br>December 6, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Socialism's Continuing Appeal</h2></center><P>
[Socialism makes no economic or intellectual sense. How, then, do we 
explain its continuing appeal?] 
 <p>
"Thanks to its promise of regeneration, thanks to the hope it flashes 
before all the disinherited of life, socialism is becoming a belief of a 
religious character rather than a doctrine." Thus concluded French social 
psychologist Gustave Le Bon in a book entitled "The Psychology of 
Socialism," published at the turn of the last century. The dream of 
socialism is "to substitute itself for the ancient faiths," said Le Bon. It 
seeks to do so by appealing to "the sentiments of envy and hatred which 
it creates in the hearts of the multitudes. To the crowd, no longer satisfied 
with political and civic equality, it proposes equality of condition." 
 <p>
Socialism is a form of collective fatigue, a kind of mass despair. 
Energetic peoples have no use for it. Thriving cultures are characterized 
by "a considerable extension of what is confided to personal initiative, 
and a progressive reduction of all that is left to the state to perform." In 
worn-out cultures, that is, cultures on the decline, "the government is 
always a power absorbing everything, manufacturing everything, and 
controlling the smallest details of the citizen's life." 
 <p>
Le Bon argued that all forms of  government enshrine one or the other of 
"two different and opposing fundamental principles -- individualism and 
collectivism. By individualism, man is left to himself; his initiative is 
carried to a maximum and that of the state to a minimum. By collectivism 
a man's least actions are directed by the state . . . the individual possesses 
no initiative; all the acts of his life are mapped out." Le Bon had no 
difficulty determining which of these two conflicting principles leads to 
greater results. "The peoples among whom individualism is most highly 
developed are by this fact alone at the head of civilization," he said, "and 
today dominate the world." 
 <p>
Socialism has no appeal for a vigorous, self-confident people. It begins to 
gain ground, however, when the middle and upper classes lose their 
moorings, when they are "no longer sure of their rights. Or rather, they 
are not sure of anything, and they do not know how to defend anything." <p>
Once they succumb to what Le Bon called a "vague humanitarianism," 
their days as free men are numbered. "Under the unconscious but 
disintegrating influence of this humanitarianism, the directing classes 
[lose] all confidence in the justice of their cause. They surrender more 
and more to the leaders of the opposing party, who merely despise them 
in proportion to their concessions." 
 <p>
To avert the triumph of socialism, Le Bon counseled his countrymen to 
"give up our perpetual prospects of reform, and also the idea that we must 
always be changing our constitutions, our institutions, and our laws. 
Above all we ought to limit, and not constantly extend, the intervention 
of the state, so as to force the citizens to acquire a little of the initiative 
and the habit of self-government" of which they have been deprived by 
pandering and paternalistic programs.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 7, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Political Chaos and the Decay of Language</h2></center><P> 
[British writer George Orwell is best remembered for the novels 1984 and 
Animal Farm, two of the most prophetic satires about 20th Century 
socialism ever written. But Orwell was also a prolific journalist and 
essayist. A short piece he wrote entitled "Politics and the English 
Language" should be required reading for anyone who wants to explore 
the connection between degraded language and political tyranny.] 
 <p>
The quality of our language and the quality of our thought are 
inextricably linked. Our language "becomes ugly and inaccurate because 
our thoughts are foolish," said George Orwell, "but the slovenliness of 
our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts." Orwell was 
convinced that we could improve the quality of our language and the 
quality of our thought if we would just pay more attention to what we say 
and write. "Modern English," he said, "is full of bad habits which spread 
by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the 
necessary trouble. If one gets rid of these habits, one can think more 
clearly, and to think more clearly is a necessary first step toward political 
regeneration." 
 <p>
Among the bad linguistic habits Orwell identified are worn-out 
metaphors, pretentious diction, and meaningless words. Many metaphors 
"have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save 
people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves." Who today can 
even recall what it originally meant to "toe the line" or "ride roughshod 
over"?  Pretentious diction, particularly the use of polysyllabic words of 
foreign derivation, is a nasty habit favored by "scientific, political and 
sociological writers" who are "haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek 
words are grander than Saxon ones." The worst habit of all is to use 
language, our tool of communication, in such a way as to communicate 
nothing.  "In certain kinds of writing, " said Orwell, "particularly in art 
criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages 
which are almost completely lacking in meaning." 
 <p>
Orwell observed that "modern writing at its worst does not consist in 
picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in 
order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long 
strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else. <p> 
"This allows us to avoid the difficult task of thinking.  If we get out of the 
habit of thinking, however, we become susceptible to all sorts of 
foolishness. 
 <p>
Political writing nowadays is invariably "bad writing," said Orwell, 
because it is used primarily for the "defense of the indefensible." 
Euphemism, evasion, and vagueness are its main characteristics. Every 
conscientious citizen must be in the habit of thinking, and pay close 
attention, if he is to avoid being victimized by the obfuscations of 
demagogues. Orwell encouraged all true patriots to "recognize that the 
present political chaos is connected with the decay of language."  He 
urged us to defend our liberties by defending our language.

Duplantier</a> <br>December 8, 1995<br></i><hr><h2>Communists Still A Threat</h2></center><P> 
[Dramatic reforms in the once-captive nations of Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union signaled the end of the Cold War and ushered in an era of 
peace, right?  Not necessarily.  One former KGB agent says the whole 
thing's a charade -- part of a long-range Soviet strategy to conquer the 
West without firing a shot!]
<p>
Anatoliy Golitsyn was a KGB agent for 16 years prior to his defection to  
the United States in 1961. In 1984 he published a book called New Lies  
for Old in which he predicted unprecedented economic and political  
reforms behind the Iron Curtain. the legalization of Solidarity in Poland.  
and the fall of the Berlin Wall. His predictions were ignored or dismissed  
at the time, but all soon came to pass. Westerners were astounded by the  
turn of events, and in the euphoria that followed the significance of  
Golitsyn's predictions was lost. 
 <p>
But Golitsyn is sounding the alarm again. He's just published a new book  
called The Perestroika Deception in which he repeats the warnings he  
issued more than 10 years ago. Golitsyn says the purpose of perestroika is  
twofold: to elicit Western financial support for the revitalization of the  
socialist economies, and to facilitate the convergence of East and West.  <p>
The ultimate aim is "peaceful conquest of the United States and Western  
Europe from within." 
 <p>
The Communists have gone to great lengths to recreate the trappings of  
Western democracy, with opposition parties and free elections. But they  
are just imitations of the real thing. "Even so-called 'free' elections do not  
pose a problem for the Communist parties. Because of their secret  
partnership with the 'opposition.' the Communist Parties are invariably in  
a winning position. It is their candidates -- whether Communist or 'non- 
Communist' -- who always win, since all the non-Communist candidates  
and 'parties' are controlled," says Golitsyn. "The Communists have  
succeeded in concealing from the West that the 'non-Communist' parties  
are secret partners of the Communists, not alternatives or rivals to them." 
 <p>
The same thing goes for the so-called independent Republics. "The  
present Communist strategists are concealing that it is they who are now  
creating 'independent' Republics." says Golitsyn. "The strategists are  
concealing the secret coordination that exists, and will continue to exist,  
between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of these newly 'independent'  
Republics." He says the apparently fragmented Soviet Empire can be  
reassembled at any time. 
 
Perestroika represents "a broad strategic assault on the Western mindset,"  
an assault that gives every indication of achieving spectacular success.  <p>
"The meaning of developments in the (formerly) Communist world is  
misunderstood," says Golitsyn, "and the intentions behind Communist  
initiatives have been misinterpreted. Enemies are accepted and treated as  
though they have suddenly overnight. become allies of the West."  
Golitsyn confesses himself saddened by "the contemporary jubilation of  
American and West European conservatives who are cheering  
'perestroika' without realizing that it is intended to bring about their own  
political and even physical demise."

<h2>Real Men</h2></center><P> 
[Remember the good old days when men were the towers of strength and 
faithfulness we expected them to be?]
<P>
Tens of thousands of American males are trying to rediscover what it 
really means to be a man, and thousands of American women are rooting 
for them. Syndicated columnist Armstrong Williams reports that a group 
called Promise Keepers is "attracting men of all backgrounds to publicly 
declare their faith in God and acceptance of responsibility for leadership 
in their families and communities." Promise Keepers have filled football 
stadiums to demonstrate their determination to keep their marriage 
promises. What's behind it? Why is it happening now? Williams believes 
that, after three decades of experimentation it's become indisputably 
clear that the deconstruction of traditional gender roles by the feminist 
and the playboy movements has failed.
<P>
"After more than a quarter-century that saw the rise of feminism, gay 
rights, and societal approval of a variety of so-called 'alternative 
lifestyles,' we have come almost full circle," says Williams. "The results 
of our cultural experimentation -- high divorce and illegitimacy rates, 
rising crime and violence -- have forced us to take a second look. 
Perhaps the traditional male role as a leader of the family and 
community, should be restored."
<P>
There's little doubt about that, of course. The big question is, How many 
young American males can even remember what it means to be a real 
man? Not many, concludes Williams, who offers a refresher course. 
Being a real man means respecting "the institution of marriage" and 
being responsible for the children that you bring into the world. It means 
scrupulosity in word and deed. "A real man has no need for profanity 
[and] does not engage in public disorderliness or drunkenness. A real 
man accepts responsibility for his actions; he does not make excuses for 
his mistakes or failures. He learns from them and improves himself to 
ensure that they do not happen again."
<P>
A real man is always conscious of the impression he makes, knowing 
that he is "an example and role model for his own children and the 
children in his neighborhood." He is honest, bold, and resolute. "That 
means making a decision consistent with your principles and sticking to 
it," says Williams. "A real man knows that showing love is not a 
weakness, but a strength." He understands the difference between men 
and women, accepts it, celebrates it. At the risk of being denounced for 
his gallantry, he holds doors open for women and gives up his seat on 
the bus for them.
<P>
A man must have "integrity," says Armstrong Williams, and that means 
"holding on to your principles regardless of the circumstances." A lot of 
men need these lessons in manhood, Armstrong says, because Americans 
"have forgotten where we came from and so we don't know where we're 
going. Only by remembering how things once were will we be able to 
begin working to restore civility and virtue to our chaotic society." Three 
cheers for the Promise Keepers!
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Global Taxes</h2></center><P> 

[The fat cats at the United Nations are tired of having to rely on the 
generosity of member countries. They now want to bypass these 
sovereign governments and tax the people of the world directly!]
<P>
The calls for a global tax to finance the operations of the United Nations 
seem to be coming from all quarters. The so-called Independent 
Commission on Population and Quality of Life argues that the United 
Nations should be able to tax aviation traffic and freight, aviation fuel, 
ocean freight and cruises, telecommunications frequencies, 
communications satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods 
and services. At the UN World Summit for Social Development, held in 
Copenhagen earlier this year, Clinton appointee James Speth, head of 
the UN Development Program, proposed a global tax on speculative 
movements of international funds, the consumption of non-renewable 
energy, environmental permits, and the arms trade. The Clinton 
Administration is pushing for ratification of the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, which would set up an International Seabed Authority to 
collect fees and royalties imposed on American mining firms.
<P>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. Tobin predicts that "the 
revenue potential is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year." Needless to say, 
UN bureaucrats are enthusiastic about the possibilities of this new 
"Tobin tax."
<P>
The Commission on Global Governance argues that "it is time for a 
consensus on global taxation for servicing the needs of the global 
neighborhood." The Commission, which is supported by government and 
foundation funding, calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. The Commission claims that "the idea of safeguarding and 
managing the global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted."
<P>
The Worldwatch Institute calls for a global tax to finance "the transition 
to a sustainable society -- including environmental programs, social 
initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." The Oxfam Poverty Report 
proclaims that "international aid should be seen as a financial 
entitlement, and as part of a compact between citizens in the industrial 
and developing worlds." The Ford Foundation wants the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. This 
"levy on the utilization of the global commons" would allow the UN to 
put the squeeze on American taxpayers without going through our 
Congress. The World Federalist Association, headed by former 
presidential candidate John Anderson, recommends UN taxes on 
international travel and postal service.
<P>
The United Nations has no right or authority whatsoever to tax people, 
businesses, or transactions, but that won't stop the UN's greedy 
international bureaucrats from trying to usurp such authority. Too much 
of our country's wealth has already been squandered on this subversive 
organization with the cooperation of American leaders. Imagine how the 
UN will bleed us dry when it has its own taxing power and no longer 
needs to ask for our cooperation!
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Bilingual Ed.</h2></center><P> 
[Bilingual education is a bureaucratic boondoggle that is isolating 
immigrant children from the rest of American society and relegating 
them to a life of second-class citizenship.]
<P>
Federal bureaucrats forced bilingual education programs into the public 
schools in 1974 without any research whatsoever to demonstrate their 
effectiveness. Twenty years later, there's still no proof that these 
programs bring immigrant children into the English-speaking 
mainstream of our nation. Prior to 1974, millions of immigrants learned 
English by the immersion method. That means that immigrant children 
went to public schools where only English was spoken and learned this 
new language rapidly. They then went home and taught English to their 
parents.
<P>
Since 1974, federal regulations have required that public school 
instructors be proficient in the foreign language they teach, but do not 
require that they speak English fluently. A school can lose its federal 
funding if it fails to "instruct," "maintain," and "develop" in the student's 
native tongue, but there is no corresponding penalty for failing to teach 
English. Unfortunately, foreign language instructors have discovered 
that they can enhance their job security by delaying their students' 
transition to English. As a result, many of their students graduate from 
public high schools without ever learning English. 
<P>
Representative Toby Roth of Wisconsin has introduced a bill in Congress 
mandating that all federal government business be conducted in English 
and repealing statutes that require non-English ballots and bilingual 
education. "In many places in America, English is no longer the first 
language in school," says Roth. "Our children are now taught, by law 
and with government funds, in dozens of languages other than English -- 
12 different languages in New York City alone. Instead of a first-rate 
education in English. students in bilingual education classes are taught 
in their native tongue, and English is rarely spoken."
<P>
Toby Roth argues that, despite the enormous expense involved (an 
estimated $8 billion annually), "bilingual education is a dismal failure at 
doing what Congress originally asked it to do: teach children English 
quickly and effectively. Tragically, it relegates countless children -- 
unable to speak, understand, and use English effectively -- to a second-
class future. More important, programs like bilingual education divide 
our country by undermining the common bond that holds our country 
together -- our English language."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that the purpose of his legislation is simply to 
ensure that "the primary language of instruction in schools is English, 
and that [Americans] vote and deal with the government in English. 
People will still be able, even encouraged, to speak and learn a foreign 
language, and preserve their heritage," he insists. "The only significant 
difference will be that government actively reinforces our common 
language rather than erodes it."
<P>
Congressman Roth says that his overriding goal is "to keep America one 
nation, one people. We must preserve the common bond that has kept 
this country of immigrants together for more than two centuries by 
making English our official language. Our future as a united nation 
depends on it."

<h2>Truth in Learning</h2></center><P>                

[The failure of our educational system -- especially our colleges and 
universities -- can be traced, ultimately, to one human flaw, arrogance.]
<P>
The tremendous popularity of the television quiz show called Wheel of 
Fortune no doubt derives from the program's ingenious design, which 
encourages contestants to delay solution of the puzzle while racking up 
points for guessing the letters that compose it. Home viewers are thereby 
assured of knowing the answer long before it is officially acknowledged. 
What keeps Wheel of Fortune fans coming back is the pleasant feeling of 
superiority home viewers enjoy each time the answer is revealed, and 
they find out it's just what they thought it was.
<P>
A similar predictability may have accounted for the tremendous 
popularity of one of the best-selling books of the 1980s, Allan Bloom's 
The Closing of the American Mind. That's the book that started an 
impressive genre of writing critical of colleges and universities. After all, 
Allan Bloom didn't really tell us anything we didn't already know. We'd 
known for years that the colleges are filled with leftist and relativistic 
ideologues. We didn't need to spend $20 on a 400-page book to find that 
out, but many of us did, and were gratified that a university professor 
had finally said what we'd been saying all along.
<P>
A lesser-known scholar named James Schall also set out to expose the 
intellectual blight in our nation's universities. His book, entitled 
Another Sort of Learning, appeared almost simultaneously with the 
paperback  release of The Closing of the American Mind, but it did not 
enjoy similar success. Here's why: Rather than make us feel superior, 
even a bit smug, by confirming our bleak assessments of contemporary 
education, Schall's book made us feel uneasy. Schall insisted, for 
instance, that "most of the important things we do not in fact learn are 
not learned because we choose not to learn them." In other words, we 
expect too much from the universities, and we've only got ourselves to 
blame for our manifest deficiencies.
<P>
Schall went even further. He suggested that a university is "not really 
equipped" to provide the education we need. He said that the university 
is "designed, consciously or unconsciously, to prevent us from 
confronting in our own lives the ultimate questions of existence and 
essence." Needless to say, Schall's radical ideas didn't go over big in 
college towns. After all, it's one thing to say that the system isn't 
working: it's another thing entirely to say it isn't meant to work. But 
that's what Schall said, emphasizing that "we meet the more ultimate 
things in our churches, in our families, in our living, in our friendships."
<P>
Schall wasn't satisfied with condemning relativism. He had to talk about 
Truth. Allan Bloom had discussed Truth too, but somehow, in Schall's 
book, Truth seemed to mean something specific. Unlike Bloom, Schall 
dared to identify the source of Truth, and to declare that revelation 
makes it available to everyone, the humbler the better. James Schall's 
book, Another Sort of Learning, addresses the first causes of the 
decline of college campuses today.

<h2>Pugwash Brainwash</h2></center><P> 

[This year's Nobel Peace Prize speaks volumes about the dubious politics 
of the Nobel Committee.]
<P>
This year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Pugwash Conferences 
on Science and World Affairs, a long-inactive organization, and to one 
of its last remaining members, 86-year-old Polish-born Joseph Rotblat. 
Few Americans under the age of 50 even remember the Pugwash 
Conferences or have any idea who Joseph Rotblat is. They're not likely to 
understand the significance of this year's Peace Prize, or to realize what 
a travesty it is.
<P>
The Pugwash Conferences took their name from the location of the first 
conference, held in 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, the home of the 
organization's chief financial backer, multi-millionaire U.S. industrialist 
Cyrus Eaton. Eaton and other Pugwash members, such as British 
philosopher Bertrand Russell, were ardent socialists who sought, under 
the guise of scientific objectivity, to influence world affairs to the 
advantage of the Soviet Union and to the detriment of the United States.
<P>
The most important Pugwash Conference took place in Moscow in 1960. 
Among the more prominent U.S. scientists attending were Jerome 
Wiesner and Walt Rostow, who shortly after their return became leading 
policy planners in the next administration of President John F. Kennedy. 
At that Moscow conference, Wiesner outlined a comprehensive program 
for nuclear disarmament and for transferring our nation's military 
strength to an international agency. Rostow also addressed the 
conference, recommending a nuclear test ban treaty .
<P>
Rostow was well placed in the Kennedy Administration to promote this 
objective. In 1963, President Kennedy sent Averell Harriman to Moscow 
to sign the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, thereby perpetuating the 
tremendous advantage that the Soviets had gained from a recent series of 
giant nuclear tests. Rostow and his fellow Pugwash members were 
criticized for jeopardizing U.S. security with this treaty, but they 
continued to insist that "nuclear parity will promote peace." They 
argued, absurdly, that abandoning America's nuclear advantage in favor 
of equality between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. would make the Soviet 
Union feel more secure and thereby less likely to resort to war!
<P>
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who served in both the Kennedy 
and the Johnson Administrations, made "parity" a cornerstone of his 
strategy to abandon our strategic superiority. He argued that "nuclear 
parity" would give the world "a more stable balance of terror." It had, in 
fact, the very opposite effect, emboldening the Soviet Union to extend its 
evil empire, secure in the knowledge that the United States could no 
longer risk a nuclear showdown. The Soviets maintained their aggressive 
military posture until President Reagan rebuilt our military strength and 
demonstrated his determination to follow through on building the 
Strategic Defense Initiative. Unable to keep pace with our procurement, 
the evil empire self-destructed. In awarding this year's Peace Prize to the 
Pugwash Conferences, the Nobel Committee makes abundantly clear that 
its idea of "peace" is really pacifism.

<h2>Medical Savings Accounts</h2></center><P> 

[The most important section of the Republicans' Medicare reform bill is 
Medical Savings Accounts.]
<P>
It is the inclusion of Medical Savings Accounts (known as MSAs) that 
makes the Republican Medicare bill a genuine, free-market-oriented 
reform. Without them, according to Peter Ferrara of Americans for Tax 
Reform, the Medicare plan could not be supported "by anyone who 
opposed the Clinton health plan last year." Ferrara argues that MSAs 
will allow "market incentives and competition [to] control costs 
consistent with patient preferences." Without MSAs, "the Medicare 
reform would only meet the budget targets through the same heavy-
handed rationing mechanisms included in the Clinton plan last year."
<P>
All fall, there has been tremendous pressure from the media and the 
liberal establishment to drop MSAs from the Medicare package, but that 
would be a tremendous mistake and jeopardize the future of Americans 
in their golden years. According to policy analyst Peter Ferrara, 
"reimbursements to doctors and hospitals would be cut so much that 
many would refuse to treat Medicare patients. In particular, the elderly 
would no longer have access to the latest, most advanced, most 
sophisticated care. They would suffer with essentially the same low-
quality care as imposed on Medicaid patients today." Or they would be 
shunted off into health maintenance organizations, "where they would 
have to give up control over their health care to a third-party 
bureaucracy."
<P>
Who gets control -- "each individual patient, or the government and its 
designated rationing bodies" -- is the central issue in health care reform. 
"MSAs give power to the people. Without MSAs, the Medicare reform 
plan would only take control over their health care away from retirees."
<P>
According to Ferrara, Medical Savings Accounts "provide complete 
catastrophic coverage for all expenses over the deductible in the plan. 
Medicare does not provide such coverage." MSAs put a reasonable cap 
on "out-of-pocket expenses for the elderly." Medicare, by contrast, has 
no cap on out-of-pocket expenses. Retirees can be liable for tens of 
thousands in expenses each year under the program, says Ferrara. "That 
is why 70 percent of the elderly buy private supplemental insurance to 
cover those gaps." MSAs can be used to "pay for health expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs." MSAs also "allow 
broader freedom of choice of doctors and services than Medicare." As it 
stands now, many doctors refuse to treat Medicare patients because 
Medicare "underpays health providers so substantially." Ferrara says 
"that problem will only get worse in the future."
<P>
Widespread use of Medical Savings Accounts would reduce health care 
spending dramatically. Health care costs would be reduced by as much as 
30 percent if all Americans switched from traditional third-party 
insurance to Medical Savings Accounts. Those opposed to MSAs use 
false budget estimates, claiming that MSAs would increase Medicare 
spending. But Peter Ferrara insists that "MSAs do not increase out-of-
pocket costs for the sick. They reduce them," and, in fact, are better than 
what Medicare gives seniors now.

<h2>Aristotle on Democracy</h2></center><P> 

[The Greek philosopher Aristotle analyzed the benefits and 
disadvantages of various forms of government. His comments on the 
nature of democracies are especially valuable to Americans.]
<P>
Aristotle believed that communities are established when men are 
"drawn together by a common interest," each attaining "a share in good 
life." This good life is "the chief end, both for the community as a whole 
and for each of us individually." Aristotle argued that monarchies, 
aristocracies, and democracies can all be acceptable to the citizens of a 
country if their constitutions are just: "Those constitutions which 
consider the common interest are right constitutions," said Aristotle. 
"Those constitutions which consider only the personal interest of the 
rulers are all wrong constitutions, or perversions of the right forms."
<P>
Justice demands that a nation's rulers -- whatever their number -- be 
bound by law. Men have a right to expect impartiality when they sue for 
justice. For this they need "a neutral authority; and law is a neutral 
authority." The sovereignty of the law must supersede the sovereignty of 
the ruler. The law is a higher authority than the ruler because it proceeds 
from a higher authority. "He who commands that law should rule 
[commands] that God and reason alone should rule," said Aristotle: "he 
who commands that a man should rule adds the character of the beast."
<P>
Democracies inevitably decline when they cease to respect this higher 
authority and place the interests of any one group above the common 
good. In so doing, they ultimately destroy their middle classes. Without 
those middle classes, or "golden mean." democracies are left with 
"people who are ignorant how to rule and only know how to obey, as if 
they were so many slaves, and, on the other hand, people who are 
ignorant how to obey any sort of authority and only know how to rule as 
if they were masters of slaves." Clashes between the envious and the 
contemptuous will soon level such a state. "Nothing could be further 
removed from the spirit of friendship or the temper of a political 
community," warned Aristotle. "Community depends upon friendship."
<P>
The continued existence of a substantial middle class in America is vital 
to the preservation of our form of government. Every assault upon the 
middle class threatens to undermine the integrity of that government. 
The most obvious assault upon the middle class is our confiscatory 
income tax. The progressive income tax was one of Karl Marx's goals, 
and he supported it specifically to impoverish the middle class, thereby 
polarizing society and promoting class warfare. If we are to retain our 
freedom, we must protect this beleaguered middle class from further 
encroachment. Efforts to restore our constitutional government would be 
greatly facilitated by a swelling of the middle class. We are indebted to 
Aristotle for his exposition of the crucial role that the middle class plays 
in safeguarding freedom and a just society.

<h2>Pursuit of Happiness</h2></center><P> 

[Along with our lives, the promise of salvation and the means through 
Christ are undoubtedly the greatest gifts ever bestowed on mankind.]
<P>
Inspiration and a close examination of God's plan in nature enabled pre-
Christian Greek and Roman philosophers to formulate reasonably 
effective systems for right living and right government. Yet God himself, 
the acknowledged source of all true law, saw fit to promulgate His codes 
more directly. First He gave us His Ten Commandments through Moses, 
and then He sent His only Son to reaffirm those commandments and to 
offer us two central laws under which those commandments were 
subsumed: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great 
commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself."
<P>
In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ made clear that we must obey the 
spirit of God's law and not merely the letter. Surely this is a fantastic 
vision of utopia a world in which men love their enemies and forgive 
them every trespass: in which they do not swear, do not look on women 
lustfully, and do not seek revenge; do their alms and praying privately; 
and take no thought of their own lives of tomorrow. "Be ye therefore 
perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Christ 
commanded the multitudes.
<P>
Christ knew that His listeners could not live up to these exacting 
standards without divine assistance, but He presented them as an ideal, 
something to strive for, and He offered us another gift, His grace, by 
which we might truly have hope of attaining perfection. This vision of 
utopia is at once the most unrealistic ever presented to man and at the 
same time the only one that we can really, with God's grace, hope to 
enjoy. It is everything that this world is not, and we must renounce the 
things of this world if we are to share in that one.
<P>
More than 400 years after the birth of Christ, the great Christian 
theologian Augustine gave to the temporal approximation of this utopia 
the name "The City of God" and juxtaposed it to the earthly city: "The 
one consists of those who wish to live after the flesh, the other of those 
who wish to live after the spirit." According to Augustine, the earthly 
city has been formed by "the love of self, even to the contempt of God: 
the heavenly city by the love of God, even to the contempt of self." The 
end of the heavenly city is "peace in eternal life," whereas "the earthly 
city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace."
<P>
In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas adapted Aristotle's philosophy to 
the formulation of his own Summa Theologica. Like Aristotle, 
Aquinas maintained that the end of man is happiness, but he insisted 
that this happiness is an eternal one that we cannot obtain in this world.

<h2>Founding Fathers</h2></center><P> 
[The Declaration of Independence and our U.S. Constitution incorporate 
the wisdom of the ages. They are a gift to us from our Founding 
Fathers.]
<P>
The Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas affirmed the right of subjects 
to depose a king "if, becoming a tyrant, he abuses the royal power." In 
this he anticipated the thinking of the 17th century English philosopher 
John Locke and of the American patriots who declared their 
independence from the British crown in 1776.
<P>
According to John Locke's Second Treatise of Civil Government, the 
authority of political power derives from a social contract agreed to 
voluntarily by free, equal, and independent men. That power loses its 
authority when, by violating this contract, it loses the consent of the 
parties thereto. Locke conceded that the people are generally reluctant to 
exercise this power to dissolve ineffective or oppressive governments: 
"Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient laws, 
and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people without 
mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of abuses, prevarications, and 
artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the people, 
and they cannot but feel what they lie under and see whither they are 
going, it is not to be wondered that they should then rouse themselves 
and endeavor to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them 
the ends for which government was at first erected."
<P>
Locke went to great lengths to distinguish liberty from license and to 
demonstrate that law is the liberator, not the oppressor of man. "Law, in 
its true notion, is not so much the limitation as the direction of a free and 
intelligent agent to his proper interest, and prescribes no farther than is 
for the general good of those under that law," said Locke. He argued that 
"the end of law is not to abolish or restrain but to preserve and enlarge 
freedom," emphasizing that freedom is not, however, "a liberty for every 
man to do what he [pleases]."
<P>
The Declaration of Independence enumerated the abuses of royal power 
that the founding fathers considered sufficient to justify their 
renunciation of the king's sovereignty. There, and in the Preamble to the 
Constitution of the United States, they spelled out the principles that 
formed the foundation of their  vision of a better world. Echoes of 
Aristotle, Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and John Locke can be 
heard in both documents. The Constitution with its Bill of Rights 
incorporates the wisdom of the ages. By protecting our God-given rights 
from the encroachment of government we expand our freedom to pursue 
true happiness.
<P>
In this season of gift-giving, let us be grateful not only for the gifts that 
God has given us directly but also for those that have come to us through 
the wisdom of our Founding Fathers. Let us pass these gifts on to our 
descendants in the hope that they too will share our vision of a better 
world.

<h2>Christmas Verse</h2></center><P>

[Everyone loves the Clement Moore classic "A Visit from St. Nick." 
Here's a revised version of that yuletide favorite that recaptures the true 
meaning of Christmas.]
<p>
Twas the morning of Christmas, when all through the house/All the 
family was frantic, including my spouse;/For each one of them had one 
thing only in mind,/To examine the presents St. Nick left behind./The 
boxes and wrapping and ribbons and toys/Were strewn on the floor, and 
the volume of noise/Increased as our children began a big fight/Over who 
got the video games, who got the bike./I looked at my watch and I said, 
slightly nervous,/"Let's get ready for church, so we won't miss the 
service."/The children protested "We don't want to pray:/We just got our 
presents, and we want to play!"
<p>
It dawned on me then that we had gone astray,/In confusing the purpose 
of this special day;/Our presents were many and very high-priced/But 
something was missing -- that something was Christ!/I said, "Put the gifts 
down and let's gather together,/And I'll tell you a tale of the greatest gift 
ever:/A Savior was promised when Adam first sinned,/And the hopes of 
the world upon Jesus were pinned./Abraham begat Isaac, who Jacob 
begat,/And through David the line went to Joseph, whereat/This carpenter 
married a maiden with child,/Who yet was a virgin, in no way defiled./ 
Saying 'Hail, full of Grace,' an archangel appeared/To Mary the Blessed, 
among women revered:/The Lord willed she would bear -- through the 
Spirit -- a Son./Said Mary to Gabriel, 'God's will be done.'
<p>
"Now Caesar commanded a tax would be paid,/And all would go home 
while the census was made;/Thus Joseph and Mary did leave Galilee/For 
the city of David to pay this new fee./Mary's time had arrived, but the inn 
had no room,/So she laid in a manger the fruit of her womb;/And both 
Joseph and Mary admired as He napped/The Light of the World in his 
swaddling clothes wrapped./Three wise men from the East had come 
looking for news/Of the birth of the Savior, the King of the Jews;/They 
carried great gifts as they followed a star --/Gold, frankincense, myrrh, 
which they'd brought from afar.
<p>
"As the shepherds watched over their flocks on that night,/The glory of 
God shone upon them quite bright,/And an angel explained the intent of 
the birth,/Saying, 'Glory to God and His peace to the earth.'/For this was 
the Messiah whom prophets foretold,/A good Shepherd to bring His 
sheep back to the fold;/He was God become man, He would die on the 
cross,/He would rise from the dead to restore Adam's loss.
<p>
"Santa Claus, Christmas presents, a brightly lit pine,/Candy canes and 
spiced eggnog are all very fine;/Let's have fun celebrating, but leave not a 
doubt/That Christ is what Christmas is really about!"/The children right 
then put an end to the noise,/They dressed quickly for church, put aside 
all their toys;/For they knew Jesus loved them and said they were 
glad/That He'd died for their sins, and to save their dear Dad.
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Secular Humanism</h2></center><P>

[Paul Kurtz, president and editor-in-chief of Prometheus Books, 
explained once in an Associated Press interview exactly what it is that he 
and other "secular humanists" actually believe.]
<p>
"Secular humanists are committed to the use of reason and science to 
understand the world," said Paul Kurtz. "We also believe it's necessary to 
develop a new morality appropriate to the present needs. I believe in the 
use of reason to build a good life on this planet without the illusion of 
salvation or immortality." That good life and that new morality are the 
subjects of a number of written works bearing the emblem of Kurtz's 
publishing house, Prometheus Books. Here-are some of the titles: 
Atheism: The Case Against God,  Beneficent Euthanasia, The 
Encyclopedia of Unbelief, The New Sexual Revolution, Ethics Without 
God, and Religion Without God.
<p>
In an essay entitled "Humanism and the Moral Revolution," Kurtz 
contends that traditional morality has been made obsolete by "an 
explosive technology that has rapidly transformed our culture. A sharp 
disparity has emerged between the new technology and our inherited 
moral codes." Kurtz believes that "the good life is achieved when we 
realize the human potential. This means that we ought to reject all those 
creeds and dogmas that impede human fulfillment or impose external 
authoritarian rules upon human beings. The traditional supernaturalistic 
moral commandments are especially repressive of our human needs," 
says Kurtz. "They are immoral insofar as they foster illusions about 
human destiny and suppress vital inclinations."
<p>
In another essay, Kurtz confides that Humanism "is related to a doctrine 
of liberation and emancipation. It values the autonomy of free agents, not 
only in their intellectual beliefs but in their aesthetic experience, their 
romantic or sexual proclivities, their moral tastes and values." No subject 
is taboo to free-thinking secular humanists -- no subject, that is, except 
one: belief in God. The faithful will be outcast in the coming new order, 
and the measure of the "freedom" of what passes for thought will be the 
fervency of one's nonbelief. "Humanism cannot in any fair sense of the 
word apply to one who still believes in God as the source and creator of 
the universe," Kurtz comments.
<p>
Will free-thinking secular humanists suffer the faithful to exist as 
harmless anomalies and quaint anachronisms? No, our faith is a constant 
challenge to their infidelity; it makes them feel bad. Humanists cannot be 
truly free until all belief and all believers are exterminated. "For 
Humanism has always been opposed to any and all forms of tyranny over 
the mind of man," proclaims Kurtz. "This puts Humanism squarely in 
opposition to all authoritarian, religious or totalitarian ideologies that 
attempt to suppress, limit or censor human intelligence or to impose an 
orthodoxy of belief or morality." It's an unpleasant fact, but secular 
humanism and faith in God cannot coexist. One of the two must 
ultimately triumph. Rest assured that humanists, if they ever have the 
power, will not tolerate us as we have tolerated them.

<h2>Bosnia</h2></center><P>

[The war in Bosnia is a European affair, and European nations should 
settle it. The United States has no strategic interests in Bosnia and gains 
nothing by getting involved.]
<p>
In a historic address to the U.S. Congress, the President acknowledged 
that the interests of European nations are of no particular significance to 
the United States. These nations get embroiled in "frequent controversies, 
the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns," said the 
President, concluding that it would be "unwise" to get involved in matters 
of purely European concern. The geographic isolation of the United 
States is a tremendous strategic advantage, and Americans should make 
full use of it. The President said it would be foolish to jeopardize the 
peace and prosperity of our country by thrusting ourselves into the 
middle of the age-old ethnic and national rivalries of Europe.
<p>
These, alas, are not the sentiments of President Bill Clinton. They were 
expressed by an American president, however -- our very first president, 
in fact. President George Washington made his remarks 900 years ago in 
the Farewell Address that culminated his two terms in office. With those 
parting words, Washington advised his countrymen to protect our Union 
against the internal threat of factions and the external threat of foreign 
entanglements. <p>

Like most of our twentieth-century presidents, Bill Clinton is either 
ignorant of, or indifferent to, the warning issued by the Father of our 
Country -- as Clinton's decision to send 20,000 American soldiers into 
Bosnia clearly demonstrates. The President has an obligation to offer the 
American people a persuasive explanation for deployment, but he has yet 
to identify a compelling national interest in Bosnia, and his justifications 
so far seem specious at best. No matter how much the President may 
insist that we do, America does NOT have a moral duty to send troops to 
Bosnia. America does NOT have "values" that must be protected there. 
America does NOT need to go to Bosnia to assert its leadership in the 
world.
<p>
Clinton's status as Commander-in-Chief empowers him to deploy U.S. 
troops in defense of American citizens or interests; it does NOT entitle 
him to send troops anywhere he pleases for whatever reason he chooses. 
Sending U.S. troops to Bosnia will NOT keep the fighting from 
escalating into a wider conflict, it will do just the opposite. Our troops 
will NOT be "peacekeepers," for there is no peace to keep in Bosnia, nor 
has there been for some 500 years. U.S. servicemen should NOT be 
forced to assume the role of international policemen.
<p>
If Europe wants an end to the bloodletting in Bosnia, let European 
nations stop it. They have all the requisite resources. America, in the 
meantime, should concentrate on American interests. We should heed the 
advice that George Washington gave in his famous Farewell Address: 
"The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in 
extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political 
connection as possible."
<p>                           <P>

<h2>Illiteracy and Delinquency</h2></center><P> . 

[Everyone's got his own idea of the best way to reduce crime -- more  
policemen, longer sentences, more prisons, and so on. But a number of  
studies suggest that teaching criminals to read may be the best solution of  
all!] 
 <p>
The National Adult Literacy Survey, commissioned by the U.S.  
Department of Education, found in 1993 that nearly half our adult  
population are poor readers. Another U.S. Department of Education  
survey, also in 1993, disclosed that more than two-thirds of U.S.  
schoolchildren cannot read up to their grade level. Al Shanker, longtime  
president of the American Federation of Teachers, declared in 1989 that  
only 3 to 6 percent of 17- and 18-year-olds are able to read editorials and  
articles in major newspapers and write a several-page essay. He said that  
80 percent of public school graduates cannot even write a two-paragraph  
letter to a supermarket manager applying for a job. A study on illiteracy  
commissioned by the Department of Justice in l992 said that 21 million  
Americans can't read at all, 45 million are marginally illiterate, and 20  
percent of high school graduates can't read their diplomas. 
 <p>
A l 993 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that "the major cause  
of delinquency" is reading failure, and that-children in schools are  
"denied the means to achieve the goal to read." Juvenile delinquents and  
adult prisoners who are taught to read using a traditional intensive  
phonics method show a marked decrease in behavior problems as they  
become literate. 
 <p>
With a research grant funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, Michael  
Brunner spent two years analyzing the literature on illiteracy and  
recidivism. In a new book called Retarding America: The Imprisonment  
of Potential, he comes to the chilling conclusion that reading failure is a  
major cause, rather than just a correlate, of anti-social behavior. Brunner  
found that a high percentage of incarcerated juveniles were diagnosed  
early in school as "learning disabled" even though there was no evidence  
of specific neurological abnormalities. These children never received the  
kind of reading instruction that is successful -- namely, intensive,  
systematic phonics. So they never learned how to identify sounds in  
isolation, to blend individual speech sounds into words, or to segment  
polysyllabic words into speech sounds. Brunner discovered that failure to  
learn to read is a major cause for the frustration and low self-esteem that  
lead to juvenile delinquency. 
 <p>
Brunner reports a poignant interview with an incarcerated teenage boy  
who could decipher only four words and spell two. His years in the public  
school system were a time of constant humiliation because he could not  
read. Combative behavior was the only means he could think of to keep  
his peers from laughing at him. In the correctional institution, the boy  
was taught to read with remedial intensive phonics. Another teenager,  
interviewed at Ironwood Maximum Security Prison, felt like a new  
person once he had mastered phonics and learned to read. It sounds  
incredible, but making sure children learn how to read in the first grade is  
a proven crime prevention technique!

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>Breast Cancer Goose Chase Harms Everyone</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P> 
Question: How many studies does it take to establish that the cause of 
an illness is not pollution?  Answer: There are never enough when the 
accusers are a combined force of feminists and environmentalists.
<p>
Since the early 1990s, women in the Northeastern U.S., especially Long 
Island, New York, have been claiming that A) they are suffering an 
extraordinary rate of breast cancer, and that B) the cause most 
assuredly lies in the hand of man.  What the specific pollutant is, 
they have been at a loss to say--pesticides in general,  chlorinated 
chemicals, power lines.  The point is that some faceless, nameless 
corporation run by insensitive (no doubt cigar-chomping) white males 
has to be at fault.
<p>
Environmentalists have willingly accommodated them in this belief.  
Not long ago the left-wing magazine Mother Jones featured a cover with 
a woman wearing a gas mask as a brassiere.
<p>
Now there has appeared the latest in a series of studies showing that 
pollution isn't the cause of these higher breast cancer rates.  And 
you know what?  No one seems to care.
<p>
This study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute 
(JNCI), shows that women in the Northeast are indeed more likely to 
die of breast cancer than in other regions of the country.  It also 
found the risk was almost completely due to certain risk factors which 
these women have incurred, including having children later in life and 
greater rates of alcohol use and obesity.
<p>
Other lifestyle factors not looked at could probably explain the rest.
<p>
"This [study] suggests there is nothing uniquely hazardous about 
living in the Northeast," said Joseph K. McLaughlin of the 
International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
But the activists don't want to hear this. Cindy Pearson, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based National Women's Health Network, 
told the Boston Globe the study "doesn't set my mind at ease, and it 
doesn't make me think there aren't environmental factors at work."
<p>
The federal government's chase after pollutants as a cause of breast 
cancer can be traced back to May 1992, when Long Island women began 
demanding that federal health officials find a bad guy to blame for 
what they perceived as an  extraordinary breast cancer rate in their 
area.  "Women want to know: Why me?  Why now?  Why on Long Island?" 
said one activist.<p>

More telling were the words of Francine Kritchek, co-chair of "One in 
Nine."  "Women are tired of being told that it is because of their 
educational background, their high socio-economic status, their ethnic 
background and their age that they are prone to this illness," she 
said.  In other words, bring me somebody's--ANYBODY'S-- head on a 
platter.
<p>
At the time, four state studies had failed to find connection between 
breast cancer in the state and environmental influences such as 
pesticides.  Nevertheless, with the help of the state's Republican 
U.S. Senator, Al D'Amato, the lobbying has paid off in the form of 
several lavish studies.  The JNCI study was one of them.  And despite 
its negative findings, the NCI is moving forward with a much larger 
one investigating the possible connection between environmental 
factors and breast cancer, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study 
Project. The cost?  An incredible $7 million.
<p>
Yet in 1993 still another study found that the Long Island breast 
cancer rate wasn't extraordinary.  Using a computer database, the Long 
Island-based newspaper Newsday discovered, "The highest breast cancer 
incidence rates were in the San Francisco Bay area, suburban Boston, 
and suburban Chicago, not on Long Island.  Nassau and Suffolk (the 
counties making up Long Island) ranked right in the middle of the 
group studied."
<p>
Did this mollify the Long Island activists?  Far from it. "The fact 
that Long Island isn't alone isn't a comforting thought at all--it's 
an even more disturbing message," one told Newsday.
<p>
Get it? The original problem was that Long Island's breast cancer rate 
was so extraordinarily high. When it turned out it wasn't 
extraordinarily high it was proof of an even greater problem.  Do the 
words "no-win situation" come to mind?
<p>
All of this might be a bit humorous, were in not for a couple of 
considerations. First, this fanatical quest for corporate villains to 
blame is coming at a real human cost. What incentive does a woman have 
to reduce her lifestyle risks if she's convinced that nothing she's 
doing is contributing to her chances of breast cancer?
<p>
Second, these studies are extremely expensive and are a terrific waste 
of time for our nation's top researchers.  In general, breast cancer 
spending--like that of AIDS--is completely disproportionate to its 
incidence.
<p>
Compare breast cancer with prostate cancer. Breast cancer probably 
struck about 183,000 American women in 1995, killing 46,000. Prostate 
cancer probably afflicted about 244,000 men, killing 35,000.  Breast 
cancer survivors may lose one or both breasts, a cruel maiming but one 
fixable through plastic surgery.  More and more often the disease is 
being treated by removal of the tumor only.
<p>
Prostate surgery survivors, conversely, often face permanent impotence 
and incontinence.  But while breast cancer will receive $500 million 
from the feds, prostate cancer will get less than $80 million.  There 
are no studies looking for environmental causes of prostate cancer.
<p>
There are only so many medical researchers and funds to go around.  
It's time we start using our resources based on where they can do the 
most good.  Endless efforts to satisfy paranoid activists don't meet 
that standard.

<i>1/16/96</i><hr><h2>How the Media and Lawyers Stir Up False Illness </h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>



</center><hr>



<P> 


You've probably never heard the term "nocebo" before, but you've 
almost certainly suffered from it.  More than that, the nocebo effect 
is a major player in some of today's biggest health scares.
<P>
A nocebo is a negative placebo. That is, while a placebo pill makes 
you feel better though unbeknownst to you it's only made of sugar,  a 
nocebo makes you feel bad though physiologically speaking it shouldn't 
be able to.
<P>
For example, if someone in your office is suffering from a cold you, 
too, may feel your throat tightening, your bones aching a bit, your 
head hurting perhaps.  Sound familiar? It's happened to all of us.
<P>
When a newspaper at which I worked moved to a new building somebody 
told the librarian that there was formaldehyde in her new library 
bookshelves.  Formaldehyde is a suspected human carcinogen and the 
librarian knew this.  Soon she was suffering from a headache, aching 
joints, and labored breathing--all classic psychosomatic symptoms.
<P>
But then she heard there was no formaldehyde in the shelves. Suddenly 
the symptoms disappeared.  Apparently the final word on the shelves 
was that they did contain formaldehyde but the librarian remained 
blissfully ignorant of this and hence symptom free.
<P>
Nocebos don't get talked about much, which is why the American Health 
Foundation (AHF) recently called together a number of experts for a 
conference on the subject. For nocebos aren't just minor curiosities, 
but are wreaking havoc in America today.
<P>
"We think nocebo has a powerful effect," says AHF President Ernst 
Wynder,  "particularly if the suggestion is made by your doctor and 
then your lawyer and then the newspapers."
<P>
Examples?  Consider Gulf War Syndrome. Tens of thousands of Gulf War 
vets are now claiming that something they were exposed to in the Gulf 
is making them ill. Their list of symptoms totals more than 75, with 
the most common being the classic psychosomatic symptoms such as the 
librarian suffered. Yet study after study, including one just released 
from the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, have 
showed that Gulf War vets have no more discernible illness than one 
would expect in a group of that size and age category.
<P>
Curiously, virtually none of the sick soldiers complained for the 
first couple of years after the war. Then reservists began to say they 
were sick but the active duty soldiers still had no complaints. That's 
when it hit the newspapers and television, with every news report 
stating emphatically that the syndrome was real. Suddenly the active 
duty soldiers were falling ill, too.
<P>
Yet for the longest time the mysterious ailment remained confined to 
the United States.  Why?  Because other nation's media weren't 
covering the topic.  When the British press started writing about Gulf 
War Syndrome, suddenly British soldiers began falling ill.
<P>
Another example? Try silicone breast implants.
<P>
"For 30 years women were satisfied with implants," Emory University 
gynecology and obstetrics professor Dr. Elizabeth Connell told me.  
Connell headed the FDA panel that investigated the implants.  "Lot of 
studies at the [FDA] hearings and since then showed a very high level 
of pleasure and acceptance and gratitude."
<P>
But then the media and the lawyers got in the act.  Newspapers and 
magazines ran stories with titles like "Ticking Time Bombs,"  "Toxic 
Breasts," and "After Implants, Horror Began."  Suddenly women with 
implants were suffering all sorts of strange illnesses and "realizing" 
that illnesses they already had must be related to their implants.
<P>
"When you have women being told they have ticking timebombs in their 
breasts, what are they to think?" said Connell.
<P>
As with Gulf War Syndrome, the breast implant scare  appears to be 
confined to U.S. shores. Yes, strangely enough, silicone only makes 
American women sick.
<P>
Media reports have also kicked off other famous incidents of hysteria, 
such as a rash of illness at New York's Love Canal after the local 
newspaper informed the citizens they were living on top of a toxic 
waste dump.
<P>
Sometimes there's more to this than blind panic.  There's what 
Columbia University psychologist Dr. Herbert Spiegel, who spoke at the 
AHF conference, calls "secondary gain."
<P>
What this means is that the nocebo effect can be greatly exaggerated 
when the sufferer finds out there's something to be obtained through 
the suffering. Sometimes it's just sympathy. Other times its being 
taken off a job one doesn't like. And sometimes it's big bucks, which 
is where lawyers come in.
<P>
Spiegel is convinced that secondary gain is behind many of the breast 
implant claims, what with some law firms advertising "$100,000 OR MORE 
MAY BE OWED TO YOU!" if you have silicone breast implants.
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that many, " he told me, "of those women . . . 
have an eye on the deep pockets" implant manufacturers.
<P>
Likewise for Gulf War Syndrome, from which many soldiers hope to gain 
lifetime disability pay and others have joined a class action suit 
against numerous chemical companies. "Gulf War Syndrome is a wonderful 
illustration of what I'm talking about," says Dr. Spiegel.
<P>
Can the nocebo effect be cured? Sure. The media, the courts, and the 
general public need to take a healthy dose of skepticism. This won't 
be a popular remedy; it's not as emotionally gratifying as blaming bad 
guys (corporations, government) or as financially rewarding as suing 
them. But then, the best medicine seldom tastes good. It's just good 
for us.

<i>1/17/96</i><hr><h2>Catch Drunks, Don't Harass Drivers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
<P> 
On Christmas Eve, 1966, my godfather smashed his car into a tree and 
killed himself.  He was drunk. The best that could be said of his 
sorry exit from this earth was that unlike so many other drunk 
drivers, he didn't take anybody with him.
<P>
You might think this would make me very concerned with drunk driving 
laws and you'd be right. But you'd be wrong if you think it has made 
me an advocate of the continuing trend to reduce allowable levels of 
drivers' blood alcohol content (BAC) from 0.1 percent to 0.08 percent.
<P>
It's not that I wouldn't be in good company.  Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving (MADD) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) have lobbied vigorously for lowering the limit to .08, while 
the American Medical Association wants it lowered to 0.05 and the 
Department of Health and Human Services wants it knocked down even 
lower to 0.04. But the evidence these good folks cite to support their 
new drinking laws just doesn't wash.
<P>
True, the number of what the NHTSA calls "alcohol-related deaths" has 
shown a steady and significant decline since the early 1980s. During 
that time, a number of states--now totaling 13--have screwed down the 
legal BAC limit from 0.1 to 0.08.
<P>
But does this mean there's a connection? The key word is "deaths." In 
fact, traffic deaths in general have been going down for years as a 
result of safer cars and higher seat belt usage rates. So it only 
makes sense that those from any given cause, including alcohol, would 
be declining.
<P>
A better measure is alcohol-related collisions.  This number has gone 
down just a bit, and it's not at all clear it has to do with those few 
states lowering their BAC limits.
<P>
It's not that drivers don't show signs of impairment at levels below a 
BAC of 0.1.  Indeed, research has shown impairment at levels of 0.04 
or even lower. I drink so little alcohol myself that I could probably 
be impaired driving by a brewery and smelling the smoke stack exhaust.
<P>
Rather, the issue is should we put out a net so wide and so tightly-
woven as to sweep up huge numbers of people or should we concentrate 
on those most likely to create carnage on the streets?
<P>
The net analogy is not a bad one. Even advocates of a 0.08 BAC limit 
admit that drivers below the level of .1 rarely drive erratically, 
hence the only way to catch them will be putting up more police 
roadblocks and doing more random breath testing.  And what will we get 
for these pesky little violations of drivers' privacy?
<P>
Dr. H. Laurence Ross, a professor at the University of New Mexico and 
author most recently of Confronting Drunk Driving, estimates a 
potential increase of 60 percent of DWI offenders (legally-speaking) 
under 0.08 with the possibility of no decrease in fatalities. The 
reason is that the potential of alcohol to impair drivers and cause 
accidents is directly proportionate to the amount consumed.
<P>
According to a recently released study from the Harvard Injury Control 
Center, "Among all male drinking drivers who were killed, 67 percent 
had BACs of 0.15 or above.  Among young adult male drivers (ages 20-
34), 41 percent had BACs of at least 0.20, or twice the legal limit in 
most states."
<P>
Lower BAC advocates note that about 3,000 fatalities each year are 
caused by drivers with BACs of less than 0.1.  But this is misleading. 
The vast majority of fatalities are caused by people with no 
measurable alcohol in their systems at all, yet they still managed to 
kill someone.  For all we know, the drivers who killed those 3,000 
people would have done so just as readily without the aid of liquor. 
<P>
Ironically, one opponent of .08 BAC laws is MADD founder Candy 
Lightner.  In 1992 she wrote, "If we really want to save lives, let's 
go after the most dangerous drivers on the road.  Putting our trust in 
new laws and regulations that attack only the tip of the iceberg will 
not make our highways safer."
<P>
Lightner has been branded a traitor by MADD, especially since two 
years after writing those words she became a lobbyist for the liquor 
industry. Nevertheless knows whereof she speaks.  The man who ran down 
her own 13-year-old daughter in 1980 has been arrested several times 
for drunken driving, each time with a BAC of 0.2 or higher.  And each 
time he gets out of jail and goes at it again.
<P>
Lightner argues that police ought to concentrate their resources on 
arresting drunk drivers, not just drivers who happen to have been 
drinking. When serious offenders are arrested they need to be treated 
seriously, with license revocations and other penalties that increase 
steadily as their number of offenses increases. 
<P>
But to arrest drunk drivers you need police, and suddenly declaring 60 
percent more Americans as criminally inebriated will stretch resources 
thinner than ever.  "Adoption of 0.08 percent BAC has not to date been 
accompanied by any comparable new investments in police resources," 
notes Dr. Ross in a recent issue of Health Drinking magazine, "thus 
diluting an already inadequate control system.  The effect may well be 
to reduce the chances of any impaired drivers being arrested."
<P>
That's something to think about the next time a weaving automobile 
shoots past you and you wonder how come there's never a cop around 
when you need one.

<P>
<h2>GM's Electric Turkey </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
<P>
Imagine a car with a third the cruising range of the cheapest one on 
the market.  Imagine that while the cheapest car takes about three 
minutes to refuel this one takes three to 15 hours, depending on the 
equipment you buy to refuel it.  Imagine that the car will only be 
sold in a few markets in the southwest because it's useless in cold 
temperatures.  Now, if your imagination really stretches, imagine that 
this joke of an automobile costs about $35,000 or four times what the 
cheapest car goes for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But this is no imaginary car. It's General Motors' much-celebrated EV1 
electric car, the product of many years of development and one 
extremely large dose of environmental nonsense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Resembling a turtle with angular lines, GM's electric Edsel isn't the 
technological marvel it's advertised to be. Indeed, it's all too 
similar to the electric cars that competed with and lost to piston 
engine-powered cars almost 100 years ago.  Moreoever, piston 
technology has improved steadily since then.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;An economy car equipped with such an engine can be propelled an 
amazing 50 miles with a mere gallon of gasoline that weighs only eight 
pounds and costs less than bottled water.  The EV1, in contrast, uses 
low-tech lead acid batteries that in the best of weather propel the 
car only 90 miles with 1175 pounds of batteries, almost half the 
weight of the car itself.  Other types of batteries such as nickel-
metal hydride, nickel cadmium, zinc-air, and lithium would give a much 
longer charge but at even greater expense.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The lead-acid batteries are not only heavy but huge.  The EV1 has only 
two seats, not because it pretends to be a sports car but rather 
because batteries take up what would be the back seat. Lead-acid 
batteries also last only two to three years and are an environmental 
mess to dispose of in a land fill. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all the criticisms of  electric cars are deserved--just most of 
them.  For example, some on the extreme fringe of the environmental 
movement claim that they shouldn't be labeled zero emission vehicles 
because the power plants that supply the electricity emit pollution 
when they burn coal or oil.  True, but the emissions which electric 
cars produce are generally far outside the city where pollution is a 
problem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's too bad some of the environmental nuts don't understand this, 
because essentially, GM has built a car that only a rich tofu-eating 
environmental looney could be interested in--like, say, actor/activist 
Ed Begley Jr.  Problem is, he already has one.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;That's a huge chunk of the electric car market that's already got one 
in the garage.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;But it's not really GM that built the EV1; rather it's the bureaucrats 
at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) who did.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In a fit of  both arrogance and technological ignorance, CARB mandated 
back in 1990 that by 1998, two percent of all new cars sold in 
California would have to be zero-emission ones, thus sending the car 
companies scrambling to develop electric vehicles. Ironically, just 
two weeks before the EV1 was announced, CARB backed down  and pushed 
the mandate off into the 21st Century.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;Why GM decided to market the car anyway is anyone's guess, though 
rumors fly (which a GM spokesman denied to me) that the introduction 
was a quid pro quo to get CARB to drop the mandate.
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to ignoring technological reality, the CARB mandate also 
ignored how much cleaner cars have already gotten.  Cars built these 
days put out only about four percent of the exhaust of cars produced 
in 1970. That's why the air above every American city has gotten so 
much cleaner since then.  The reason these cars sometimes put out 
large amounts of  pollution is because like anything mechanical, they 
can break and must be repaired.  Also, their owners can tamper with them to improve mileage at the expense of high emissions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;What's needed is a device that can detect defective or tampered-with 
exhaust systems.  It happens that Dr. Donald Stedman and other 
researchers at the University of Denver have invented just such a 
device.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;When placed by the side of the road, it measures how much pollution a 
car puts out as it drives  by. High emissions trigger a video camera 
which films both the car and its license plate. This allows the 
municipality using the device to send a letter (perhaps backed by a 
threat of a fine) to the violator informing him that his car emits too 
much pollution and must be repaired.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;The ability of remote sensing to "read" vehicle exhaust accurately and 
cheaply has been demonstrated repeatedly in the U.S. as well as in 
Canada and Great Britain. Alas, its biggest advantage is its biggest 
drawback.  Because it only singles out gross polluters and leaves most 
of us alone, bureaucrats hate it.  They'd rather foist upon us 
nonsense like the EV1 electric turkey.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160&#160;&#160;&#160;It's possible that electric cars will one day be a viable form of 
transportation for something other than short trips or putting around 
the golf course, but that day is years away.  For now, rather than 
giving in to environmentalist pleas and extortion, the automakers 
should line up behind remote sensing as a way of keeping gasoline cars 
running clean.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Cancer Charge Against Milk Udderly Ridiculous -- 2/1/96 </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<i>February 1, 1996</i>
<h2>Cancer Charge Against Milk Udderly Ridiculous</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>

<P>  
Six years ago there was panic in the streets over a chemical sprayed  
on apples called Alar.  Parents threw out their apple sauce and poured  
apple juice down the sinks.  One poor mother went so far as to call  
the state police to have them pull over her child's school bus and  
remove the apple from his lunch pail.  If Dr. Samuel Epstein had his  
way, it would be deja vu all over again, but this time with milk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Epstein, a professor of environmental medicine at the University  
of Illinois School of Public Health in Chicago has created a stir in  
the nation's media, if not yet its grocery stores.  He claims, in the  
January International Journal of Health Services, that much of the  
milk sold today contains a possible potent cancer-causing agent called  
recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone, or rBGH. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This hormone occurs naturally in cows but scientists can now clone it  
and give it to the animals in larger doses than they would normally  
produce, thereby increasing milk production about 10 to 15 percent.   
Perhaps five percent of all milk sold now is produced this way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's claim--in a journal which is neither peer-reviewed nor  
widely read (I had never even heard of it before)--is that IGF-1, a  
hormone responsible for cell growth and division, is more abundant and  
potent in milk from rBGH-treated cows. The hormone may act "indirectly  
by sensitizing the breast to subsequent unrelated risk factors" such  
as radiation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yes, and it may give you super powers and allow you to leap tall  
buildings with a single bound, but there's precious little evidence  
for either hypothesis. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein's allegation uses no new evidence and indeed his charge isn't  
new.  He's been on the warpath against rBGH since at least 1989, when  
it was moving through the approval process. Cancer is just one several  
nasties he accuses it of causing, including increasing the chance of  
contaminating milk with pus from an infection of the udders called  
mastitis. Yuk! 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During these six years of attempted sabotage, Epstein's claims have  
been repeatedly rebuffed by the best names in the business.  The  
Journal of the National Institutes of Health Research has reported  
that Epstein's "scientific evidence is slim" and is based on a single  
31-year-old paper by endocrinologist Peter Forsham.  Forsham, it said,  
"called Epstein's interpretation of his work `ridiculous.'" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Agencies and respected organizations such as the American Cancer  
Society (ACS),  the American Medical Association (AMA), the FDA, the  
National Institutes of Health, the American Dietetic Association, and  
the World Health Organization have all put their stamps of approval on  
rBGH and strongly repudiated Epstein. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The bottom line in the scientific community, "An AMA spokesman  
recently reiterated, "that there is no evidence that there's any link  
to anything that could be hazardous to your health." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ACS points out that, "Extensive testing and research [have] shown  
that [rBGH] is indistinguishable from natural bovine growth hormone  
and thus entails no health risks for consumers."  Not only that,  
rBGH actually can't do what Epstein claims. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His  theory assumes that the hormone can enter and remain viable in  
the digestive tract.  But as Dr. Michael J. MacDonald, a University of  
Wisconsin pediatric endocrinologist who studies the effects of  
hormones on children has pointed out, IGF-1 is produced not in the  
stomach but the liver, and if it entered the digestive system, stomach  
acids and enzymes would destroy it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If it got into milk it wouldn't be absorbed," he told a reporter.   
"It's a protein. It would be digested." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'd drink it any time," he said of milk from rBGH-treated cows, "and  
if my children were infants, I'd feed it to them." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein, you see, is one of the three horsemen of the cancer  
apocalypse.  (The other two are Devra Lee Davis, now with the Public  
Health Service, and Dr. David Rall, retired director of the National  
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences). There's an excellent  
chance that if you're hearing that we are suffering an epidemic of  
cancer from man-made causes, be it from petroleum products,  
pesticides, or now Bessie the Cow--you're hearing it from, or at least  
because of, them. 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has testified before Congress that 70 to 90 percent of cancer cases  
result from man-made products.  In a just-released video critical of  
his positions, "Science Under Siege" produced by the Competitive  
Enterprise Institute and National Empowerment Television, Epstein  
tells the audience, "Escalating increasing [sic] cancer rates over  
recent decades is a result of exposure to avoidable carcinogens in  
air, water, and food and the workplace." 
 <BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Epstein regularly makes such preposterous statements, which I know  
because the media just as regularly repeat them. He is the fair-haired  
boy of  the apocalyptic environmental movement and of the media.  A  
search on the Nexis database of magazines, newspapers, and some TV  
news broadcasts pulled up 318 references to both Epstein and cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time, though, from what I could tell, the media weren't so  
credulous. Consistently they allowed somebody to refute Epstein's  
mooings. Let's hope next time reporters ignore this quack altogether  
and devote precious news print to real problems. This fair-haired boy  
has long since cried "wolf" too often to be taken seriously.

<h2>
Global Warming Hotheads Use Anything to Justify Their Theory 
</h2>

<P>  
What if the media told you that declining prices across the board were 
a sign that inflation was again rearing its ugly head?  What if they 
told you that sharp drops in murder and assault rates nationally 
indicated that crime was on the upswing?  Wouldn't you be in the least 
bit suspicious, even if you didn't come from Missouri, the "show-me 
state"? 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That's the sense you may have gotten lately in reading articles in the 
national media about how this incredible bun-freezing winter we've 
been having is evidence of global warming.  When we have an especially 
hot summer, they say it's global warming.  Now that records for cold 
temperatures are snapping like so many icicles and the northeast has 
just dug out of its worst blizzard in decades, we're told that's proof 
of global warming, too.  Ever heard of the expression, "Heads I win; 
tails you lose?" 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there it was, the cover of the January 22 Newsweek: "Blizzards, 
Floods & Hurricanes:  Blame Global Warming." There also was the New 
York Times front-page article by William K. Stevens: "Blame Global 
Warming for the Blizzard," and a nationally syndicated article by 
environmentalist Jessica Matthews which ran under such titles as 
"Brrr, Global Warming Brings Our Blizzard." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, these writers have established careers as global 
warming doomsayers.  Stevens harps on it so incessantly as to 
practically put to shame the Roman Senator Cato who insisted upon 
ending every speech with "Carthage must be destroyed." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure, sometimes counter-intuitive things happen. That's why somebody 
invented the term "paradox."  But, doomsayers, the idea of warming 
causing freezing cold pushes that just too far. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's a silliness about [attributing blizzards to global warming] 
that's just overwhelming," says MIT climatologist Richard Lindzen. 
"Were global warming to occur," he notes, "you would have reduced 
temperature variance."  That's because extreme cold comes from wind 
blowing down from the north. If the north and south poles warm the 
most, as global warming climate models predict, the north would be far 
less likely to produce the kind of icy blasts it has sent to us these 
past few weeks. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Lindzen adds, "The truth of the matter is the poles haven't warmed 
and the storms we're having now produce very cold weather because the 
climate has not behaved the way the models have said they should." 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;University of Virginia climatologist Pat Michaels agrees that extremes 
in temperature would actually decrease if the world grew warmer, from 
night to day and month to month.  "The season to season extremes are 
decreasing," says Michaels. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then how to explain this terrible cold weather if it's not caused by 
warming?  Hmm, that's a toughy. Could it be that when it comes to the 
weather, the abnormal is often the norm? To borrow from one of the 
more vulgar expressions of the day: Bad Weather Happens. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to global warming enthusiasts, any and all aberrations are proof 
that the sky is falling.  Thus, last year's high number of dangerous 
hurricanes was again cited as proof of the warming effect. It made an 
encore on Newsweek's January 22 cover.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, coastal 
inhabitants can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming enthusiasts desperately grasp at anything to prove 
their  case.  In early January the Climatic Research Unit at the 
University of East Anglia made headlines, including the New York 
Times, with a preliminary report saying 1995 was the hottest year on 
record.  But their data was actually for only 11 months. Rather than 
risk December's temperatures spoiling everything they jumped the gun 
and sent out their press releases. Their fears where fulfilled when 
December's average temperature came in at the lowest in 17 years 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was a pretty ordinary year," said NASA scientist John Christy, who 
has been analyzing satellite data on temperature since 1979. And James 
Hansen of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who pretty much 
started the whole global warming scare, admits his study of land 
areas--where the effects of global warming would be most severe--
revealed 1995 was about 0.02 degrees centigrade cooler than 1990. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the theory of global warming continues to be just that--an 
unproven theory. And even were it valid, the theory cannot explain 
blizzards and cold snaps. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And where does this weather unfit for man or polar bear leave global 
warming skeptics? Just as they have always claimed that an 
exceptionally hot summer doesn't prove global warming, they cannot now 
claim that an exceptionally cold winter disproves it.  And they 
haven't. I've yet to any global warming skeptic make such a claim. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Global warming doomsayers have had similar opportunities for honesty. 
Instead, the likes of Stevens and Matthews went for sensational 
headlines.  To them, any well-publicized weather story is an 
opportunity to promote their pet theory.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, the theory of global warming hasn't been disproved. But clearly 
some of its more fervent enthusiasts need to step back, look at the 
evidence, and chill out.

<h2>
Will the U.S. Repeat Peru's Deadly Chlorine Folly?
</h2>

<P>
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA You may have heard the term "red death."  It  
dates back to the middle ages, which is where most North Americans  
probably imagine it.  But it has a modern name: cholera.  And if you  
live in Peru or any of 14 other South American countries, it's very  
real and right now--thanks in part to bad advice from the U.S.  
Environmental Protection Agency.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi's voice shook with emotion as he described the  
situation to a gathering here of Latin American, British, and U.S.  
policymakers at the Atlas Foundation Workshop on Science, Technology  
and the Environment in Fort Lauderdale. Ten thousand Latin Americans  
have died, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and more  
than a million made sick.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ghersi blames "U.S. imperialism." But this imperialism didn't come at  
the point of a bayonet as it has so many times in the past.  Rather it  
came from EPA pronouncements regarding the chlorination of drinking  
water.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chlorine is the most effective killer of bacteria, including that  
which causes cholera,  in water supplies.  While other techniques such  
as ozonation or using ultra-violet light can kill bacteria at the  
point of contact, chlorine added to water keeps on killing all the way  
to the faucet.  New contaminants  after the water leaves the treatment  
facility are still eliminated.  About three-fourths of all U.S.  
drinking water is chlorinated, while most of the rest is treated with  
a combination of chlorine and ammonia.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Chlorination and disinfection of the water supplies are the public  
health success stories of the century," says Carol Henry, director of  
the International Life Sciences Risk Science Institute.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the broad class of chemicals known as chlorines have lately has  
been under an all-out assault by American environmentalists, who  
accuse them of everything from thinning the ozone layer to causing  
cancer to reducing sperm counts to shrinking alligators' penises.   
(Question: How do you measure an alligator's penis? Answer: Very  
carefully.)  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greenpeace International, using the pithy if not overly imaginative  
slogan "Chlorine kills!" (meaning people, not germs), has demanded the  
elimination of all man-made chlorines in use.  This  while leaving  
alone those which occur naturally, such as sodium chloride, better  
known as table salt.  Such a drastic move, according to the consulting  
firm Charles River Associates, would cost the economy $91 billion a  
year.  Other critics say it would cost many American lives, pointing  
to Peru as an example.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What happened in Peru is that their government took the  
environmentalists and the EPA more seriously than ours has so far.   
The EPA has to a great extent bought into the environmentalist anti- 
chlorinated chemical rhetoric, with Administrator Carol Browner  
calling for reducing, if not eliminating, use of chlorines.  The EPA  
has also made much of the fact that some studies have shown a   
slightly increased risk of cancer from drinking chlorinated water.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We Norte-Americanos, who have become somewhat resistant to the  
"everything man-made causes cancer" cries of the environmentalists and  
the EPA, have taken thus far a sane attitude towards this.  Berkeley  
biologist Bruce Ames has noted that if there is any risk of cancer  
from chlorinated water at all, it is a thirtieth that of a serving of  
peanut butter.  But Peruvian bureaucrats bought the rhetoric wholesale  
and greatly reduced the chlorine pumped into the country's water  
supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This set the stage for horror when, Pan American Health Organization  
officials suspect, a Chinese freighter released its cholera- 
contaminated bilge water into the harbor in Lima.  Eventually the  
bacteria made its way into open wells which hadn't been chlorinated at  
all and in other fresh water supplies in which chlorine levels had  
fallen too low to kill the germ.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As is usual with epidemics, the rich have fared considerably better  
than the poor. Peru's rich can afford private water supplies and  
bottled water.  It is the poor, says Ghersi, who "have been sacrificed  
for the EPA and the environmentalists."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Undaunted by all this, the EPA is now taking action that may well  
endanger much of the U.S. water supply.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Citing the hypothetical cancer risks from chlorination, the agency in  
1994 proposed a rule that would require water systems across the  
country to eliminate the process known as pre-disinfection as a means  
of controlling "disinfection by-products."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to some officials, this unfunded mandate would cost local  
governments an additional $4 million a year and might force small  
water systems to abandon chlorination completely.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The proposed water regulation has some health officials absolutely  
boiling.  "Reducing chlorine levels in public water systems poses an  
immediate and significant threat to public health," says Douglas  
Kinard of the South Carolina Department of Public Health. "A  
conscientious health professional with experience in waterborne  
disease outbreaks should not support a rule which compromises public  
health."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or, as Robert Forbes of the Florida Department of Health and  
Rehabilitative Services put it, "the reduction or elimination of  
chlorination of drinking water to reduce the risk of . . . disease, is  
analogous to reducing or eliminating air travel to protect people on  
the ground from being hit by falling aircraft parts!"  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Enrique Ghersi hopes that won't happen here as it has in his homeland.  
"We're ahead of the U.S.," Ghersi told me sarcastically.  "And have  
returned to the Middle Ages as a result."

<title>Fumento: Study Finds Pesticides Not the Problem, Eating Habits Is  -- 2/20/96</title>

<h2>
Study Finds Pesticides Not the Problem, Eating Habits Is
</h2>

<P>
At least once a year, it seems, Americans are hit by a carpet bomb 
attack orchestrated by environmental groups and the media.  The theme: 
Our food supply is killing us because of pesticides used by greedy 
corporations and chemical companies.  Anyone who denies it is accused 
of being a dupe of industry.  But now a counter-attack has been 
launched by the highly influential and independent National Research 
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Far from posing the clear and present danger that the environmental 
groups say they do, the NRC says that the synthetic chemicals that 
prove carcinogenic in large-dose rodent testing are greatly 
outnumbered by natural chemicals which do the same thing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The good news is that according to the report, neither seems to pose 
much risk. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"While some chemicals in the diet do have the ability to cause cancer, 
they appear to be a threat only when they are present in foods that 
form an unusually large part of the diet," said Ronald Estabrook, 
chairman of the NRC committee.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What really counts, the report says, is not those things we 
unknowingly take into our bodies in minuscule quantities, but rather 
foods that we intentionally ingest in  massive doses: fats, calories, 
and alcohol. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the report specifically looked at cancer, it certainly bears 
noting that the worst thing about these ingredients is their ability 
to induce death not from cancer but from obesity, heart disease, and 
liver damage.  Further, another dietary component, fiber, has been 
strongly tied to a reduced incidence of cancer and heart disease. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other words, if you're really worried about cancer or your health 
in general, these are the things to concentrate on.  It means, 
essentially, doing what your mom told you to do: eat more fruits and 
vegetables and consume anything else in moderation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet only one in five American children eat five or more servings of 
fruits and vegetables a day, the government's dietary recommendation. 
We get a third of the fiber we're supposed to.  At the same time, 
Americans are taking in more calories than ever and have made 
themselves the fattest western nation on earth, causing an estimated 
300,000 premature deaths each year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Environmental groups have effectively scared many Americans away from 
fresh produce.  The Alar campaign in 1989 remains the most prominent.  
Orchestrated by the Natural Resources Defense Council, it had 60 
Minutes declaring the apple growth regulator Alar, "The most potent 
cancer-causing agent in our food supply."  Actress Meryl Streep 
appeared before Congress to blubber and demand, speaking of course on 
behalf of all mothers, that chemicals like Alar be yanked.  It was. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet the Alar campaign was only one of many environmentalist-media 
joint efforts. "Do I Dare to Eat a Strawberry?" ran the title of a New 
York Times article last fall, promoting a paper by the Environmental 
Working Group. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These scares have doubtless impacted buying habits but have had even 
greater impact on regulatory agencies--especially the EPA, which feels 
a need to react to each new horror story. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"I'm very concerned about diets," says Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, 
the scientist whose research into natural carcinogens inspired the NRC 
report. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 "If you don't get enough vitamin C," he told me, "it's like stepping 
unprotected in front of an X-ray machine. And we're spending no money 
trying to get the poor to eat better diets and we're taking on average 
of  $2,000 from each family for EPA regulations.  I think we just have 
our priorities completely out of whack." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That goes for both personal priorities and national ones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On a personal level, we contentedly stuff our faces with Ho-Hos, 
Twinkies, and Big Macs. And while getting significantly more fiber is 
as easy as buying whole wheat bread instead of white, Americans 
overwhelmingly choose white bread, safe in the belief that the 
government is regulating away any and all types of cancer. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nationally, it's time for the feds to end what could be called the rat 
race--the assumption that says that anytime a synthetic chemical in a 
huge dose (typically several hundred thousand times what a human would 
take in) promotes cancer in a laboratory rodent, we must race to 
regulate or ban it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's also time to get rid of the notion (common among 
environmentalists) that whatever nature makes is harmless while 
anything developed in a lab is harmful. As the NRC report--and a mass 
of other evidence--shows, a carcinogen is a carcinogen.  If it's 
present in significant enough amounts to invite regulation, then the 
regulations should apply whether the source was Ma Nature or Dow 
Chemical. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"This suggests we need to look at both natural and synthetic 
pesticides, compare them, and come up with better tests," says Fran 
Smith, president of the Washington-based Consumer Alert. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, the committee said more naturally occurring chemicals should 
be individually tested for their ability to cause cancer, starting 
with those that are found in the highest concentrations in commonly 
consumed foods.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't count the environmentalist groups out yet.  Over the last 
few years, as their case against synthetic chemicals causing cancer 
has grown weaker and weaker, they've started blaming them for other 
problems.  These include immune dysfunction and declining sperm 
counts.  If it's true that you just can't keep a good man down, that 
goes double for a bad environmentalist.

<h2>
Implant Tests Cashing in on Junk Science 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

<P>
"Government Warns on Breast Implants," ran the title of a recent AP 
story. The title was misleading. The issue wasn't breast implants but 
tests claiming to show that such implants may have caused harm. And 
this is a real shame because behind that false headline lies a story 
about one of the greatest health hoaxes of the decade and of how junk 
science permeates the courtroom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The brief article itself was accurate as far as it went. It informed 
readers that the Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors 
against using unapproved tests to detect antibodies to silicone 
leaking into the body from ruptured breast implants or to detect 
illness that silicone may have caused. Antibodies are a defense 
response the body produces to the introduction of a foreign substance. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article failed to point out that these very tests have played a 
key role in trials against silicone implant manufacturers which 
sometimes return verdicts measured in millions of dollars. Their 
existence no doubt played a part in the manufacturers' consenting to a 
$4.2 billion dollar settlement, the largest personal injury settlement 
in history. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article also didn't say that these tests are essentially a scam--
worthless except that, yes, they can pull in verdicts of millions of 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tests generally claim to work by one of three methods: detecting 
chemicals given off by the silicone implant; finding antibodies 
created by the body in reaction to the silicone; or detecting 
antibodies created in reaction to the body's own proteins that have 
been somehow modified by the implant. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Part of the problem with any silicone-detecting test is that we're all 
continually exposed to silicone from a number of sources, including 
puddings, cake mixes, antacids, and lipstick. Diabetics are exposed to 
relatively high levels of silicone as well, through repeated 
injections. Indeed, the very pouch that contains the silicone gel of a 
breast implant is itself made of a form of silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of this, the British Department of Health stated in a 1995 
report: "The fact that anti-silicone antibodies have been detected 
both in silicone implant recipients and, at a lower titre [level], in 
people who had not received medical silicones, raises doubts about 
their significance." The report went on to exonerate silicone implants 
of the charges against them: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, the scam-artist inventors of these tests have enjoyed great 
success pushing their traveling medicine show. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the case of Dr. Nir Kossovsky of the UCLA, an inventor of one 
of the types of tests the FDA warned against. Kossovsky is one of the 
best-known critics of silicone implants, has testified at the FDA 
hearings that resulted in the essential ban on silicone breast 
implants, and is a regular expert witness for plaintiffs in implant-
related trials. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Kossovsky developed what he called Detecsil, for "detect silicone." 
"The Detecsil test confirms whether or not an individual has developed 
an immune response to silicone-associated proteins," declared an 
advertisement. As such, it could be useful in showing whether women 
with autoimmune disease (in which the body's immune system turns on 
itself) got that illness from silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In legal depositions supporting his expert witness testimony, 
Kossovsky cited tests from the famed Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation in La Jolla, California as corroborating his own.  In fact, 
Scripps researchers found the antibodies of autoimmune disease victims 
were the same regardless of whether they had silicone implants or not. 
All the test found was that there was a higher level of antibodies in 
anybody with autoimmune disease, exactly what one would expect. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Scripps has repeatedly to disavowed Kossovsky's statements. Indeed, a 
Scripps researcher was on record as saying, "To my knowledge, there is 
no test that can predict or indicate any specific immune response to 
silicone," which is what the test must do to prove adverse health 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even before this latest public FDA warning, Kossovsky had been warned 
by the Agency to quit using his test. But the damage has been done. 
The test has played a crucial role in numerous implant trials, 
including ones with verdicts of $7 million, $25 million, and an 
incredible $40 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Then consider the case of another company making claims for a test 
able to detect silicone antibodies in women with autoimmune disease. 
It was developed by Emerald Biomedical Services of Woodlands, Texas. 
Dr. Noel Rose of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, one of the 
most prominent researchers in the field, contacted Emerald to see if 
he could confirm their findings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Originally he did, but later he found the same positive reactions in 
women without silicone implants. He informed Emerald the test appeared 
useless, and Emerald sent Rose a letter telling him in politest terms 
to go play in the traffic. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nonetheless Emerald persisted in sending out information packets to 
potential clients boasting that Rose had validated their study--until 
being warned to desist by Johns Hopkins lawyers. In that same packet, 
Emerald offered their services as an expert plaintiffs' witness and 
bragged about the large settlements their test and testimony had 
helped win. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At last Kossovsky and Emerald have been put in their place. But not 
before their tests terrified countless numbers of women and wreaked 
havoc in a major sector of American industry. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's always been a false cliche that crime doesn't pay. It does, and 
so does its close relative, junk science.

<h2>
Sugar, The Everglades... And Big Government
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>
Poor Al Gore.  Even when he correctly diagnoses a problem, he just 
can't come up with a solution that doesn't involve Big Government--
even when Big Government  is the problem in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Case in point: the threat to one of the world's most magnificent and 
important eco-systems, the Florida Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This threat is primarily from sugar farming, which uses up more and 
more of this precious land every year.  Far worse, huge amounts--as 
much as 80 percent--of the phosphorous used in fertilizing sugar cane 
in Florida drains into the Everglades. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This sets off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria and 
algae and also fostering the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The farming has also dramatically reduced the flow of fresh water from 
Lake Okeechobee into the Everglades, again damaging the eco-system.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Gore's solution to this is a tax-and-spend Democrat's solution to all 
problems--raise taxes and spend them.  Tax all sugar growers a penny a 
pound and spend the money to buy as much as 140,000 acres back from 
farmers to convert them back to marshlands.  His explanation is that 
we already subsidize sugar 18 cents per pound, so really we'd just be 
cutting their subsidy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alas, the situation isn't nearly that simple. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, the government does not directly subsidize sugar. It does 
guarantee sugar farmers a minimum of 18 cents return per pound, but it 
never pays any of that out.  Rather it enforces import restrictions to 
prop the price of sugar up.  Sugar in this country currently 
wholesales for about 23 to 24 cents a pound, about twice the cost 
globally. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So what Gore is proposing isn't holding back a bit on a subsidy, it's 
just a tax, and one that will leave the import restrictions completely 
intact. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet it's the import restrictions that are the real cause of the 
problem.  By artificially inflating the production value of sugar, 
they encourage industry to grow far more crops than they otherwise 
would.  In 1981, 334,000 acres of Everglades were used for sugar 
farming; today the number is about half a million acres. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Get rid of the protections and farming in the Everglades will plunge.  
If this puts sugar cropland back to its 1981 level, it will give us 
back 166,000 acres of wetlands--26,000 more than the Gore proposal.  
It will also greatly reduce the price that Americans pay to prop up 
Big Sugar's profits.  In all, the sugar program is estimated to cost 
consumers $1.4 billion a year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But what if this doesn't go far enough in helping the Everglades?  
Then step two would be to levy a tax on the polluters themselves, the 
farms in the Everglades.  Taxing beet farmers in Louisiana to pay for 
damage caused by cane farmers in Florida is hardly fair, nor does it 
accomplish the purpose of discouraging environmentally harmful 
farming. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Actually, steps one and two will complement each other.  That's 
because by getting rid of the import restrictions, the price of sugar 
cane farmland in the Everglades will drop considerably.  Far less tax 
money would be needed to buy up crop land and turn it back to the 
egrets, eagles, and alligators. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Big Sugar will scream that this is all terribly unfair.  Competition?  
Why, it's downright un-American!  Further, 420,000 American jobs will 
be lost, they claim, as the American sugar industry folds.  Actually, 
the USDA says that sugar farmers employ about 46,000 people 
nationwide, including perhaps 15,000 in Florida.  In any case, the 
sugar industry would hardly fold and the  government could use 
lowering our sugar import restrictions to pry open markets in other 
countries which would create American jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, both the House and the Senate have just thrown away 
chances to reduce or eliminate Big Sugar's protection.  That may have 
something to do with all the sweet green stuff the industry spreads 
around.  Together, the sugar cane, sugar beat and corn sweetener 
interests contributed almost $12 million to candidates for federal 
office from 1979 through 1994, according to the Washington-based 
Center for Responsive Politics. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if the Clinton Administration wants to do the right thing, there's 
still time to insist that the new farm legislation does so.  If only 
it can get over its belief that Big Government is the solution to a 
problem that Big Government's largesse to Big Sugar created in the 
first place.

<h2>
Procter & Gamble's Non-Fat Fat: Neither Satan Nor (Sigh) Savior 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Okay, so it wasn't Time magazine's &quot;Man of the Year,&quot; but it came 
awfully close, making the cover of the January 8, 1996 issue. The 
subject was Procter & Gamble's remarkable fat substitute olestra, to 
be marketed under the name Olean. It's been hailed as a powerful 
weapon in the battle of the increasingly bulging American bulge. It's 
also been portrayed as a death-dealing villain. It is neither. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Food and Drug Administration has now approved olestra -- the first 
artificial fat available that can be used in the baking and frying 
process -- to be used in potato chips, taco chips, and crackers.  
Later P & G may request the FDA to approve it for use in such goodies 
as cakes, brownies, and french fries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to most taste-testers, to the tongue foods made with olestra 
are identical to those made with real fat.  But to the body, olestra 
may as well be Teflon, since it literally slides through the 
intestines without stopping off to visit arteries, hips, or 
waistlines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The FDA approved the fake fat over the objections of some scientists 
and consumer advocates, who warn that it has unusual risks.  Some 
studies have shown that as little as two ounces of olestra chips can 
act as a laxative. It can also cause other gastrointestinal 
difficulties including a condition called (forgive me; but science 
writers must sometimes be gross) &quot;anal leakage.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But as such it will hardly be alone among favorite foods.  One needn't 
be familiar with the famous scene in the movie &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; to 
know the effect that beans can have.  And if you eat more than a few 
prunes or other dried fruits at one sitting you may well find yourself 
doing several more sittings somewhere else. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In any event, the FDA approval requires labeling the product to this 
effect.  My guess, though, is that the label will often be ignored by 
overzealous consumers -- though probably ignored only once. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More alarming is olestra's ability to wash out of the body certain 
nutrients believed important for preventing disease. While P&G will 
fortify olestra with vitamins A, D, E, and K, it will not add back a 
controversial class of nutrients known as carotenoids, which many 
believe protect against cancer.  P & G says evidence for that is 
lacking. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This nutrient depletion &quot;could potentially produce a large number of 
deaths annually and major morbidity in the U.S. population,&quot; Dr. Meir 
Stampfer of Harvard University wrote the FDA. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But P & G's agnostic position has repeatedly been boosted recently by 
one study after another finding that the Vitamin-A derivative beta 
carotene, a carotenoid, apparently provides  no cancer-fighting 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Institutes of Health in December told the FDA that nobody 
knows if depletions at the levels olestra causes would really harm 
anyone.  But certainly one factor that boosts P & G's position is that 
for the most part, olestra can only wash out whatever went in with it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Eat spinach and Pringle's potato chips together and you're going to 
lose the benefit of the spinach.  Alas, people are a lot more likely 
to combine the potato chips with dip and a beer or soda pop than with 
nutritious vegetables. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if olestra isn't the anti-Christ, it may not prove much of a 
savior, either. &quot;By replacing the fat in snacks, Olean can help 
millions of Americans cut excess fat and move closer to achieving an 
important dietary health goal,&quot; says P&G Chairman John Pepper.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'd say more like thousands, and here's why.  Americans have been 
hoodwinked into believing that anything that's fat free won't make 
them fat. They've bought tens of millions of books and videos from 
shysters like Susan (&quot;Stop the Insanity&quot;) Powter and Martin (&quot;The T-
Factor Diet&quot;) Katahn telling them exactly that. They so fervently want 
to believe it that they do. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But they're wrong.  Any energy consumed that is not burned off 
immediately becomes fat.  True, if you ate two ounces of potato chips 
cooked in olestra rather than fat, you'd have just 120 calories 
instead of 300.  For that matter, you could eat four ounces of olestra 
chips and still come out slightly ahead. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But if Americans could stand to eat that few chips, they wouldn't need 
fat substitutes in the first place and we wouldn't be the fattest 
nation on the face of the earth. Overeating is our problem and 
olestra, far from curing it, will only encourage it among many people. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the experience with artificial sweeteners such as saccharin 
and aspartame (NutraSweet), which provide virtually no calories. Their 
use tripled in the 1980s and should have caused sugar consumption to 
decline and caloric intake to decline.  Instead even as artificial 
sweetener consumption has increased so has sugar intake, caloric 
intake, and Americans' waistlines.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That said, if you have the discipline to simply swap artificial 
sweeteners for sugar and don't tell yourself that a Diet Coke allows 
you to eat an extra piece of fried chicken, you can come out ahead of 
the game. Likewise, if you eat ten olestra potato chips instead of ten 
fat-fried potato chips, you win. It's a matter of free will and having 
the strength to exercise it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That's why the FDA's decision was a good one. Government can protect 
us from dangerous substances, but government cannot protect us from 
ourselves.

<title>Fumento: The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane  -- 3/25/96</title>

<h2>
The (Literally) Unspeakable Evil at Dunblane 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
A gunman bursts into the gymnasium of a small Scottish grade school.  
He begins firing, systematically hunting down nearly every child in 
the room.  Before he finishes and ends his own life with a blast to 
the brain, sixteen "wee ones" and their teacher lay dead in a huge, 
spreading pool of blood. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is an act of unmitigated evil.  Or is it?  Apparently it depends on 
whose newspapers you read. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I happened to be in Ireland at the time of the shooting, exposed to 
the coverage of the Irish and British press.  Every article I read, it 
seems, used the terms "monster," "pervert," and "evil" to describe the 
slayer, Thomas Hamilton.  There were some examples of this in the 
American media, as well. Time magazine's article included the words "a 
monster goes on the rampage" and Time essayist Lance Morrow focused on 
the element of evil.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But far more typical was this Associated Press line.  "A 43-year-old 
loner with an unsavory reputation massacred more than half of Dunblane 
Primary School's kindergarten class and its teacher on Wednesday, then 
shot himself dead."  Indeed, "loner" was the American media's chief 
descriptor of Hamilton. That's like summarizing George Washington as a 
man with a powedered wig or Abraham Lincoln as merely being tall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As to his "unsavory reputation," what the paper means is that he 
papered his walls with photos of little boys in various states of 
undress.  It means he was kicked out of the Boy Scouts for having 
little boys disrobe in front of him.  The kids called him "Mr. 
Creepie."  How do you get from this that he merely had an "unsavory 
reputation"? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The British media pulled no punches.  "Residents Say Scottish Killer 
Was Evil Pervert," ran the headline of the Reuters news service story 
out of Scotland.  "What has happened reminds us of the depths to which 
human evil can sink," concluded the London Evening Standard."  The 
London Daily Mirror referred to "evil Thomas Hamilton."    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why has the American media been so reticent about calling this man 
what he is? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"At the foundation of all this is the Left's rejection of religion and 
fundamental to that is the question of whether human beings are 
capable of evil or not," says Rabbi Daniel Lapin, President of Toward 
Tradition and a radio talk show host in Seattle.  "The whole of 
western thought has always been based on the idea that there is evil 
of which people are [inherently] capable . . . " 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Left, he says, argues that since "no human beings capable of doing 
wrong things, evil must come from the institutions of society," 
usually but not always the church. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certaintly had this happened in the United States, the media would 
have done what they've  always done with shootings: blamed the 
institution of lax gun laws.  But because it happened in a nation with 
some of the strictest gun laws, they were  left foundering. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet,  the American media seem to  have trouble believing even some 
institutions can be evil.  These, after all, are the same people who 
to this day snort, chuckle, and guffaw when they refer to President 
Reagan's description of  the Soviet Union as an "evil empire."  As if 
there could possibly be a better term for a state that murdered tens 
of millions of people, kept hundreds of millions of others in bondage, 
and kept a nuclear arsenal trained on those whom it couldn't 
subjugate.  The British media, by contrast, treated and continues to 
treat Reagan's words with deference. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Robert Royal, vice-president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in 
Washington, D.C., attributes the media's reticence to our having "made 
ourselves into such a therapeutic society that we don't like to think 
people have choices in right or wrong . . . .  If something goes wrong 
it's a sort of chemical malfunction, [and] people are not responsible 
for what they do." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Or a psychological malfunction, says the Rev. Robert Sirico, President 
of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty in Grand 
Rapids, Michigan.  The media "have to characterize in psychological 
terms, not moral ones.  Evil is just something we don't understand," 
he says. He adds that, "Morality is grounded in human free will," 
something else the media doesn't accept.  "If it turns out a child 
abuser was abused by his father, it exonerates him," he says.  "Since 
the media doesn't accept free will, it can't accept good or evil." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's "a very sophisticated amoral logic," he says.  But unlike true 
logic, it is ultimately incapable of explaining anything. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is what happens if you remove the concepts of good and evil. 
Without the context of the Civil War and slavery, Abraham Lincoln 
truly was only a president who happened to be tall; without the 
Revolutionary War and the Continental Congress and its aftermath, 
George Washington was just a president with a wig. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Call Thomas Hamilton anything you want--43 years old, a loner, fat, 
bald, bespectacled.  But if you don't call him evil, you're omitting  
what set him apart from the world's other five billion people that 
day.   As Time's Lance Morrow put it in the title of his essay, "Only 
the Vocabulary of Evil Could Explain What Happened at Dunblane."

Echoes of a Famine from 150 Years Ago

GALWAY, REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Grown men wept at the sight.  Women screamed and tore their hair.  
Some fainted.  For they knew that from Galway Bay to Dublin, from Cork 
to Belfast, death would soon stalk the land.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The event was the infestation of the Ireland's potato crop with "late 
blight." It was to spark the "Great Hunger," the 150th anniversary of 
which we mark this year.  Before it ended, a million Irish had died, 
and perhaps a million more had emigrated, and the future of Ireland -- 
and the United States, where most of the emigres landed -- would be 
forever changed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Botanists will tell you the famine was caused by the fungus 
Phytophthora infestans.  Yet wrong-headed government policies had at 
least as much to do with it.  As one Dubliner put it to me during my 
visit, "Where you see famine, politics must lie  just below the 
surface."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the famine, the Irish had been among the healthiest people in 
Europe.  Their usual daily diet was potatoes.  These comprised perhaps 
60 percent of the food for the people in general but close to 100 
percent for those in the poorer west and southwest regions of the 
country.  Potatoes could be grown economically even on the tiny 
parcels of land the Irish Catholics were allowed to cultivate. 
Further, they thrived even in the rocky, damp earth of the western 
part of the island.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The menu was monotonous but highly nutritious. If you ate enough -- 
and the Irish men ate as many as 14 pounds a day -- they supplied 
virtually every vitamin and nutrient your body needed.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But in 1845, this godsend became a deadly liability.  That's when the 
late blight first appeared.  (Ironically, it could have been the 
result of importing a new strain of potato from America to make the 
current strain healthier.) The blight moved so quickly you could 
practically watch its progression, and in a matter of days a field 
would be destroyed.  Like a dark veil it spread across parts of 
continental Europe, then England, and then hopped across the Irish 
channel.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poor farmers watched in horror as their green field turned black and 
then began to give off a stench like putrefying flesh.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, in 1845 the blight only claimed about 60 percent of what would 
have been a bumper crop in Ireland.  Food in storage was enough to 
tide the population over for a year.  But when the late blight 
appeared again the next year, the stores had been exhausted and 
suffering would begin that the Irish to this day have not forgotten.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many people died from outright starvation.  Autopsies performed on the 
dead would find their bodies entirely devoid of food.  Many more, 
however, in their weakened state, succumbed to "famine fever," a 
general term describing illness from typhus, dysentery, and cholera.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reported the Cork Examiner of the poor in its community:
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Death is in every hovel; disease and famine, its dread precursors, 
have fastened on the young and old, the strong and the feeble, the 
mother  and the infant; whole families lie together on the damp floor, 
devoured by fever, without a human being to wet their burning lips or 
raise their languid heads; the husband dies by the side of the wife, 
and she knows not that he is beyond the reach of earthly suffering; 
the same rag covers the festering remains of mortality and the 
skeleton forms of their living, who are unconscious of the horrible 
contiguity; rats devour the corpse, and there is no energy among the 
living to scare them from their horrid banquet; fathers bury their 
children without a sigh, and cover them in shallow graves, round which 
no weeping mother, no sympathizing friends, are grouped; one scanty 
funeral is followed by another and another.  Without food or fuel, bed 
or bedding, whole families are shut up in naked hovels, dropping one 
by one into the arms of death.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the potato failure, much of this suffering was not inevitable.  
For just as was the case recently in Ethiopia and Somalia, crop 
failures play on a part in famines.  The rest comes from the failure 
of government.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ireland was at the time actually a part, albeit reluctantly so, of the 
wealthiest nation on earth, the United Kingdom.  But many in Britain 
loathed its people.  In those days before CNN, British papers often 
depicted  the Irish as slothful and stupid "bogtrotters."  British 
cartoonists depicted them as hairless apes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like today, the government promised much and delivered little.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of Ireland's produce was in grains, but these continued to leave 
port for English and other destinations.  Some food was imported, but 
then as today, powerful special interest groups prevailed upon the 
government to severely limit imports rather than to hurt their bottom 
lines. Then, as today, the government set up public works projects to 
provide pointless make-work jobs, building roads that began and ended 
nowhere and docks where no port would ever be.  Then, as today, people 
were huddled together in massive projects.  Often as not disease ended 
their stay.  (Today, it would be crime or drugs.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today the line, "We're from the government and we're here to help," 
has become a joke.  Back then, nobody laughed.  The hatred they 
developed has survived to this day and plays out in the bitter 
violence of the Irish Republican Army.  The combination of a deadly 
fungus and a deadly government policy continues to be lethal today, 
150 years later.

<h2> How the Media Reward Themselves for Dishonesty 
</h2>

When it comes to Gulf War Syndrome (GWS), the evidence keeps going in 
one direction and the media keep going in the other. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the most recent development, the Pentagon has just released its 
latest study.  It looked at almost 19,000 Gulf vets and found, once 
again, that aside from certain psychological problems there's no 
pattern of symptoms to suggest that "Gulf War Syndrome" means anything 
other than any sickness that happens to befall a Gulf vet. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

GWS is essentially a media creation.  Out of the 700,000 vets who 
served in the Gulf, a few began complaining of various but unrelated 
ailments.  Soon the media got ahold of it and pronounced this a 
mystery, as if out of 700,000 men and women after a period of a few 
years, none were supposed to be sick.  When soldiers read of this 
mystery "syndrome" they began assuming, in the way people do, that any 
illness they had was related to it.   At last count, their were over 
75 symptoms attributed to GWS, ranging from life-threatening ones like 
cancer and heart disease to lesser ones like weight loss and weight 
gain, graying hair, kidney stones, thick saliva, hot and cold flashes, 
increased urination, lightheadedness, sensitive teeth, hemorrhoids, 
and a "foot fungus that will not go away." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the symptoms are often connected to psychosomatic illness, 
such as joint pain, memory loss, and headaches.  Others, like semen 
that burns the skin, are as unsubstantiated as Elvis sightings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Every major study looking for a cause of GWS has found the same thing.  
There just ain't no such animal.  The first two of these came from the 
National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, and both 
found that other than psychiatric ills induced by stress, Gulf vets 
have no more illness than one would expect.  These studies were 
criticized somewhat for their methodology by the  National Academy of 
Science's Institute of Medicine (IOM), and the media gaily repeated 
that criticism.  But in January the IOM itself concluded there was no 
such thing as GWS. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, the media continue to promote the story and to 
congratulate themselves for it.  Life magazine has just won the 1996 
John Bartlow Martin Award for Public Interest Magazine Journalism for 
its November cover story, "The Tiny Victims of Dessert Storm." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The article--which purported to discover a high rate of birth defects 
among children of Gulf War vets--was "a good, tough, moving look at a 
national tragedy," gushed contest judge Doug Balz, managing editor of 
the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine.  It worked "on both the heart and 
mind of the reader." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Again, with all those children born to 700,000 vets, you're going to 
have a certain number of problems.   But study after study has found 
no more problems than would be expected.  These include one from the  
Mississippi Department of Health of an alleged birth defect cluster, a 
larger study of 620 pregnancies at Robins Air Force Base, and a 
combined study of 6,392 pregnancies at several bases which found Gulf 
vets' wives' miscarriages at the same level as that population had 
before deployment to the Gulf.  It was also about half the civilian 
rate. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"I think it's unconscionable to frighten people out of reproducing 
unless you have some good data to support that contention," Dr. 
Russell Tarver, who led the Mississippi National Guard investigation, 
told me. "I think you're committing a crime against those veterans." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's what Life did.  It carefully ignored each of these studies.  
Instead it simply regaled its readers with touching anecdotes about 
children with birth defects whose parents had become convinced--by 
other stories like Life's--that being endowed with a perfect baby is a 
God-given right which was cruelly taken from them because of their 
service in the Gulf. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why do the media continue to ignore the evidence in favor of personal 
testimonials from people they themselves have terrified? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 "There's no question that the media tend to look at the negative side 
and the bad news more than the positive side and good news," Los 
Angeles Times news critic David Shaw told me.  "This is particularly 
true of medical problems and health issues because these are things 
about which the people worry the most. That's doubly true when 
children are involved. People tend to throw all skepticism out of the 
window." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Part of the problem, Shaw adds, is the "herd of independent minds" 
phenomenon.  Members of the press corps are loath to write anything 
that will make them seem odd.  "Reporters tend to be more likely to 
parrot the conventional wisdom," says Shaw.  "There's a premium to be 
paid for doing the story that goes against the grain."  And one to be 
gained for going with it, as the Life award shows. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But doesn't accuracy count?  Not usually. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"In the two years I was a judge at the Pulitzers I don't remember 
hearing anybody saying `Let's make phone calls'" to verify what's in a 
story, said Shaw.  I think the assumption is that if there were 
something wrong with the story the paper wouldn't be entering it." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lately there's been a lot of hand-wringing from the media about why it 
seems the public hates them.  Why?  They reward dishonesty and 
incompetence with cover stories of major magazines.  Then they hand 
out awards for those stories.  Good people suffer as a result.  What's 
not to hate?  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<title>Fumento: Latest Scare is a Tempest in a Teapot -- 4/17/96</title>

Latest  Scare is a  Tempest  in a Teapot    
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

<P>

Where are those tea-heaving Boston patriots when you need them?  Iced    
tea around the country is turning up deadly and the best that can said    
about it is that the British -- already beset by "mad cow disease" --    
don't have to worry about it since they don't like iced tea anyway.    
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
   
Well, actually no one has died from the tea.  Actually, no one has    
even gotten sick from it.  But that hasn't stopped the media from    
using such sound-bite headlines as "Killer Tea" and "Bad Brew."  Nor    
has it stopped major chains such as Wendy's, Kentucky Fried Chicken,    
Boston Market, Blimpie, and Taco Bell from dropping iced tea from    
their menus.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tempest in a teapot began back in the summer of 1994 when a    
restaurant customer in Cincinnati asked the local health department to    
test some tea with an "off" odor that had been served him at a    
restaurant.  The Cincinnati Health Department ran a fecal coliform    
test and then ran out to 20 other restaurants, rounded up their iced    
tea, and tested it all.  It found a modest level of fecal coliform    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Coliform in a water supply is a sign of possible harmful    
contamination, including the sometimes deadly bacteria E. coli, which    
caused the Jack in the Box deaths (from eating undercooked beef) three    
years ago.    
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But tea isn't water;  it comes from a plant and the leaves of that    
plant are naturally exposed to fecal bacteria from droppings of birds    
and other animals.  Bacteria has always been in tea isn't a warning    
sign of anything.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nonetheless,  a year later the Health Department released the names of    
the restaurants to the Cincinnati Enquirer.  Since "enquiring minds    
want to know" the Enquirer ran a story titled "Iced Tea Worse than    
River," purportedly showing that "contamination is severe" in    
restaurant tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From Ohio the story spread to Kentucky, Georgia, and other states.     
Television station after station went out to local restaurants and    
brought back their iced tea for testing, and each reported in    
breathless horror that all or virtually all of the samples contained    
bacteria.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It apparently didn't occur or matter to them that if the tea were    
harmful there would have been a steady stream of sickened customers.     
In fact, deaths and illnesses of the iced tea epidemic continued to    
stand at zero.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)    
felt compelled to act, issuing an advisory stating, "Tea is a beverage    
with little history of disease transmission," and "At present, no    
outbreaks of infection have been reported to CDC that were clearly    
associated with the consumption of tea."  No outbreaks ever, out of    
nearly 10,000 investigations of food-borne illness over the past    
decade.  The CDC did take the opportunity to provide appropriate    
directions on safely brewing tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But this didn't satisfy the Associated Press (AP), which labeled the    
advisory a "warning" and asserted it was based on tests indicating    
"high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, which can cause stomach upset    
and diarrhea."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

AP's report led to more than 140 news segments, almost all alarming.     
"Along with what makes your tea so tasty, you could be getting a    
strong dose of some nasty bacteria that could make you sick," a    
Miami/Ft. Lauderdale TV reporter warned. A Tampa/St. Petersburg    
station declared, "You might be drinking danger and not even know it."      
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A Los Angeles station consulted the expertise of the person on the    
street.  It quoted one iced tea drinker as being "shocked" while    
another said, "I think it's outrageous."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Meanwhile CNN co-anchor Katherine Calloway punctuated a news segment    
by saying, "I don't think I'll ever order iced tea in a restaurant    
again."    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Some stations interviewed "experts" until they found somebody to agree    
with them.  "If one [bacterium] is present, it's too much," a    
University of Texas School of Public professor told a Houston station.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody had gotten sick from drinking tea.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By February, the Wendy's chain had capitulated to the media-generated    
fear, suspending sales of the terrifying tea.  Perish the thought that    
the chain that pioneered a burger with three quarter-pound slabs of    
artery-choking, obesity-causing beef would sell its customers    
something that was bad for them.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I went to a Wendy's last night.  Virtually every food served is    
guaranteed to push you towards a quadruple-bypass.  You can feel your    
arteries harden just scanning the menu.  They ought to have a team of    
paramedics with a heart resuscitator standing by for anyone who orders    
the Big Bacon Classic Combo.  But iced tea remains banned.    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And still nobody has gotten sick from drinking tea.        
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other fast-food chains are switching to individual bags of tea, which    
will contain the same bacteria but, hey, it's not safety but the    
appearance of safety that counts, right?    
   <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

I only wish I owned lots of stock in a soda pop company right now.

<h2>

The Strangling Vines of Regulation   
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>

                
                       
     Even my most libertarian friends will admit to me in moments of weakness that there are
some government regulations they don't particularly mind.  My favorite is the one governing how
many rodent hairs or droppings can be in a jar of peanut butter.  And where would dumb sitcoms
be without a gag about the infamous prohibition against removing mattress tags?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The big problem with regulations is that they're the opposite of parties--more is definitely
not merrier.  And while somebody may or may not benefit from them, somebody always pays for
them.  Often enough, that somebody is all of us.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's the conclusion of two recently released papers from the Center for the Study of
American Business (CSAB) at Washington University in St. Louis.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The first, by Ohio University economist Richard Vedder, finds that government
regulations cost the U.S. economy $1.3 trillion a year in lost productivity. To give you an idea of
how much that is, if you took 1.3 trillion dollar bills and stacked them on top of each other they'd
reach--well, awfully damned high.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The second paper, by economist and CSAB Chairman Murray Weidenbaum, finds that the
companies that suffer most from regulation are medium-sized firms.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder notes in his report that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to
spend to put into effect government mandates.  But it's the indirect costs--in the form of reduced
productivity growth--that really clobber them.  Vedder says this means the economy only grows
at a rate of one percent per year, instead of the two percent it should.  If regulatory activity
remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. Gross Domestic Product would have been about $7.6
trillion.  Instead it was only $6.3 trillion.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That means lost jobs, jobs that never get created, and lower wages.  It means a drag on
the stock market so that mutual fund you're counting on to support you in geezerhood won't be
nearly as big as it would otherwise.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Vedder says environmental regulations make up the lion's share of the costs, but he hasn't
done a breakdown to see exactly how much it is.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     "I will concede there could be benefits," to some regulations, Vedder told me.  Maybe
from lots of regulations.  "But the problem is we've abandoned the principle of moderation. 
There's diminishing returns with regulations as with anything."
     For example, he says, "The first billion spent on particulate matter [a cause of air
pollution] probably eliminates a lot, but maybe the tenth or 20th or 50 billionth reduces the
pollution by very small amounts.  The cost-benefit ratio turns negative at some point.  I would
suggest those severely diminishing returns had already set in probably over a generation ago and
we've been paying the price ever since."<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     The point of Weidenbaum's study is that it's the nation's medium-sized businesses--not
the big multinationals like AT&T and IBM or the mom & pop operations that people are always
so concerned about--that bear the brunt of this regulatory onslaught.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's because the medium-sized firms fill out pretty much the same forms and meet the
same requirements as the big boys.  But the big boys have a lot more sales to show for their
troubles.  In fact, the costs of complying with regulations for companies with 20 to 499
employees averages over $5,000 per worker, says Weidenbaum, compared to just under $3,000
for companies with more than 500 employees.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As for the little businesses, everybody feels sorry for them, so they have lots of
exemptions.  A lot of  regulations only affect companies with 50 or more people.
     But don't think these companies don't suffer, too.  What happens if they're at 49
employees--and there are probably one heck of a lot of companies with 49 employees--and just
need to expand by a couple more?  Generally speaking, they don't.  It's too much of a headache.
     The answer, as Weidenbaum stresses, is not to raise the level at which the regulations kick
in.  Make the cut-off  75 employees and you're going to find an awful lot of companies with 74.
     Rather we need to re-evaluate our regulatory system completely.  We should start with the
perverse system of incentives we give regulators.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     As it stands, if you're a environmental or health researcher and you don't discover a new
problem, you're probably not going to get your grant renewed.  So you make darned sure you
find a problem.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     Then the government regulator hears about the newly discovered problem.  He has to
implement a regulation to reduce or prevent it or he's probably not going to keep being able to
justify his job.    <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
     That's how it's possible to end up spending billions more each year on regulations with no
discernible increase in benefit to safety, health, or even aesthetics.  We need to clean house.  We
must subject current as well as proposed regulations to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, keeping in
mind that even beneficial regulations are a drag on the economy.  Just don't touch the one that
keep's Mickey Mouse's cousins out of my peanut butter.<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>
Media at Loss for Words Over AIDS Decline
   
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">

</a>

<P>

                
Ya know, it's getting so you can't trust anyone these days.  A few 
weeks ago, I was enthralled by the hit movie "Fargo," in part because 
its producers claimed that the tale of murder and mayhem in a small 
Minnesota town was based on a true story.  Only the names were 
changed, we were told, out of respect to the dead.  But there were no 
dead.  The movie was virtually a complete fabrication. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Maybe the movie's producers took their cues from the way the national 
media handles the news concerning AIDS.  Unlike "Fargo," there have 
been lots of deaths with AIDS. But as the latest yearly data just 
released from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) show, the epidemic that so recently was tagged as spiraling out 
of control is now fizzling. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Overall, AIDS cases were down seven percent last year, from 79,897 to 
74,180. Great news, right?  Try "no news"--at least to most of the big 
boys in the media. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All three major TV network newscasts ignored the CDC's annual report, 
as did all three of the nation's major newsmagazines and most of the 
nation's major newspapers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Oh, sure, USA Today gave it a graphic comprising 69 words.  And the 
New York Times mentioned that new data existed, but only gave the 
numbers for New Jersey.  The Washington Post only gave it brief 
mention in an editorial. After all, we wouldn't want the nation's 
lawmakers to know that the disease they keep throwing more and more 
money at is on the decline, would we? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Contrast this with the coverage the media gave the epidemic in 1994, 
when cases greatly increased, albeit as the result of a statistical 
artifact resulting from the CDC expanding the definition of what 
constitutes an AIDS case.  Back then the New York Times's Lawrence 
Altman devoted a thousand words to the story, with the scary title 
"AIDS Cases Increase Among Heterosexuals."  Actually they "increased" 
among ALL groups, but what the hey? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yes, both USA Today and the Washington Post wrote the story up two 
years ago, as did the Los Angeles Times and all the other big guys. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is actually the second year in a row that AIDS cases have fallen, 
but it means a lot more this year.  That's because last year the data 
were still reflecting the shakeout from the new case definition.  The 
explosion of cases reported in 1994 led to a dearth in 1995.  But this 
year the decline is clearly real. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even those reporters who did deign to mention that the largest 
epidemic of the century was starting to implode nonetheless managed to 
put a PC slant on it.  Thus, Karen Hill's story for the Associated 
Press (AP) was sent out over the wires as "AIDS Rate Down Nationwide, 
But More Blacks, Women Infected."  The body of the story also 
indicated that there  is a "spread" of the disease among women. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In actuality, 123 FEWER adult or adolescent women were reported to 
have contracted AIDS in 1995 than the year before.  It's nice to know 
that even if your child never learns to add or subtract, he can always 
get a job with the nation's largest wire service. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If AIDS really were spreading among women, it sure would be hard to 
explain how births to women infected with the AIDS virus dropped 
dramatically from 957 to 730.  Many states didn't have a single baby 
born with AIDS.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about that heterosexual "explosion" the media loves to talk about?  
Actually, there was a drop of 500 cases in that category.  Even AP 
didn't try to mess with that number; instead, like everybody else, 
they just ignored it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How about teenagers?  It wasn't long ago that the media were telling 
us that AIDS among teens would soon be more common than pimples.  But 
teen AIDS cases fell, too. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, in every way the AIDS epidemic has stubbornly refused to act 
like the media, the media's anointed "experts" and the government have 
said it would go.  It has steadfastly refused becoming a democratic 
disease, an "equal opportunity destroyer" as the nation's largest AIDS 
lobbying group once put it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead, the disease is more and more one of the marginalized in our 
society.  Blacks are about 12 percent of the population, yet they now 
contribute as many victims to the epidemic as do whites.  Hispanics 
also are grossly over-represented.  Broken down by risk factor, the 
vast majority of cases continue to come from homosexual men and 
intravenous drug abusers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
White heterosexuals, the "risk group" on which the media harp 
incessantly, made up two percent of all AIDS cases last year.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
None of this should be in the least surprising.  I predicted it nine 
years ago in my first science article.  I did so not by slaughtering a 
chicken and reading its entrails, but simply by consulting the 
publicly available data and interviewing the real experts. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The media and the government ignored these data and those experts, 
instead fabricating an epidemic of white, middle-class heterosexuals 
with false headlines, misleading statistics, and celebrity victims.  
This led to the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars fighting 
non-existent fires while the real ones have raged on.

<title>Fumento: FDA Screwing Around With Device Approval - 5/30/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
             FDA SCREWING AROUND WITH DEVICE APPROVAL
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>


Why is it that whenever the FDA quickly approves a drug or medical 
device, you always read about it in the first few pages of the 
newspaper, but when it delays approval of something that could prevent 
death and suffering, you usually only hear about it in the opinion 
pages--if at all? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Case in point: this column.  Subject: The FDA's delay in approving 
something called a pedicle screw to treat serious spinal injuries, a 
delay that is encouraging terrifically expensive litigation against 
the screws' manufacturers and making doctors hesitant to use them. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally pedicle screws were only used to fasten leg and arm bones, 
and the FDA approved them for this purpose.  But orthopedic surgeons 
found they were excellent for also fusing bones of the spine which had 
broken or degenerated.  There are other ways of doing this, such as 
wires, rods, or hooks, but once physicians tried the screws, the other 
techniques pretty much fell by the wayside. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA has never approved the screws for this express purpose.  
Nonetheless, FDA policy wisely allows a drug or device which has 
proven safe and effective for one thing to be used for another.  It's 
called "off-label" use.  Virtually everybody reading this column has 
probably received a drug or treatment that hadn't been approved for 
that specific purpose, yet doctors had decided it was a good thing to 
offer their patients. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example the class of drugs that includes Tagamet, Pepcid, and 
Zantac was originally  approved only for clinically-verified duodenal 
ulcers.  But long before the FDA approved their wider use, doctors 
found they were helpful for many types of stomach disorder and 
prescribed them as such.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So it has been with pedicle screws used for spinal bone fusion.  Over 
300,000 times, doctors have used these on patients' back bones, in the 
belief that it was the best treatment.  But, of course, operations 
don't always accomplish their intended end; even the simplest.  I am 
now facing my third surgery to have a painful inflamed section of 
nerve removed from my foot.  Against all odds, the damned thing just 
keeps growing back--and believe me, being a freak of nature isn't all 
it's cracked up to be.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just so, not all patients who have pedicle screws used on their back 
receive complete relief.  Sometimes it's the doctor's fault and 
sometimes that's just the way it is.  But in this litigation-happy 
country, nothing ever "just happens."  Somebody had to pay and pay 
dearly, and that's where the trial lawyers come in. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
About 7,000 patients who have received spinal treatment with pedicle 
screws have filed suits with an estimated total liability of $1 
billion.  Their lawyers' chief weapon: That the FDA has been steadily 
dragging its feet on the approval of the technique.  You can just hear 
the plaintiff's lawyer booming at the doctor on the witness stand: 
"You mean to tell us that you inserted these screws even though you 
knew for a fact that the FDA has not approved them for that purpose!" 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The best answer to that is: "Yeah, but so what?"  But you can see how 
an uninformed jury might feel otherwise.   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA approval of pedicle screws for use on the spine would "take the 
wind right out of the trial lawyers' sails," one industry insider told 
me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Way back in 1994 an FDA panel of medical experts voted unanimously to 
ease regulations on the use of the screw.  And the 1995 FDA proposal 
itself says, "The data demonstrate that the use of pedicle screw-based 
instrumentation [on spinal degeneration and fractures] results in 
significantly higher rates when compared with treatment with no 
instrumentation or with currently available . . . devices." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, the trial lawyers are desperate to see the screws remain 
unapproved and have enlisted the lobbying and legal support of Sidney 
Wolfe's Public Citizen advocacy group, which often works hand-in-hand 
with plaintiffs' lawyers.  Yet not only is the FDA dragging its feet 
on granting approval (except for one extremely rare form of back 
surgery), one of its top officials has actually sabotaged the case for 
approval. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The sabotage arose out of something generally called the Cohort Study, 
a major evaluation published in the medical journal Spine which 
concluded that pedicle screws were at least as safe and more effective 
than previous methods of treatment.    
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As such, the study is devastating to the trial lawyers' position, 
prompting their typical reaction of trying to intimidate and harass 
the doctors who worked on the study.  The FDA knows about this tactic 
and so flatly told the lawyers it would not release the names.  But 
FDA Deputy Associate Commissioner Mitch Zeller  nonetheless turned the 
names over to a group associated with the trial lawyers.  He says he 
did so accidentally, not having noticed that they were marked as 
confidential.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Joseph Barton (D-TX), claims Zeller isn't telling the truth and 
is demanding that the Justice Department investigate.  In the 
meantime, subpoenas issued to doctors who worked on the Cohort Study 
have risen nearly five-fold since their names were released. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
FDA Commissioner David Kessler has apologized for the release, but has 
rushed to his employee's side in saying it was inadvertent.  Barton is 
right; that's a question for Janet Reno, not David Kessler to answer.  
In the meantime, the way for the FDA to undo some of the damage is to 
give its approval to pedicle screws for spinal use.  Get a backbone, 
commissioner, and do what's right.

<h3>EPA'S OWN PANEL SAYS IT<br> MASQUERADES DIOXIN POLICY AS SCIENCE</h3>  

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr> 
You probably don't remember when the EPA released its report on dioxin in September in the same way you remember, say, when JFK was shot or O.J. took his ride in the Ford Bronco. But the headlines might ring a bell:  "Dioxin Pollution Risks 'Worse than Feared,'" "Toxicity of Times Beach 'No Longer in Doubt,'" "Dioxin Scare is Real."<p>
Here's the catch.<p>
The EPA report was just a draft.  As in: "not the one that counts."  As such, it had yet to be evaluated by the agency's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).  Now that board has rejected the conclusions that led to those scary headlines and sent the report back to the agency for a rewrite.<p>
Alas, no headlines this time. No, not a single major newspaper (or minor one that I'm aware of) ran a news story on the SAB decision, though Science magazine gave it a short write-up ("Panel Slams EPA's Dioxin Analysis") and there were a few editorials and op-eds.<p>
For 15 years now, the EPA has pursued a vendetta against dioxin, a by-product of paper bleaching, and of incineration of certain materials.  Until it was banned as such, it was also a by-product in the 
manufacturing of some herbicides, including the notorious Agent Orange.<p>
Ever since the chemical was found to be horribly toxic to guinea pigs -- albeit far less so to every other animal species tested, including other rodents -- the EPA and other environmental organizations have 
relentlessly attacked it as they have no other chemical save the pesticide DDT.<p>
Fear of dioxin contamination led to the evacuation of Love Canal and Times Beach, Missouri, and to telling Vietnam vets that they may be at extraordinary risk of disease.<p>
As a member of the class of chemicals called organochlorines, dioxin has become a cornerstone of Greenpeace's and other groups' efforts to ban all synthetic organochlorines -- a ban that would cripple the economy.<p>
The purpose of the EPA draft report was to show that this vendetta had been justified.  In addition to the old charge of dioxin being a possible human carcinogen -- causing as many as one in 1,000 human 
cancers -- the EPA added two newer charges: that it might affect human children in the womb and that it could compromise immune systems at levels approaching those to which Americans are currently exposed.<p>
While those human exposure levels are infinitesimal compared to our exposure to so many other chemicals, the EPA maintained that what causes illness in some animals at huge doses must also cause sickness in humans at tiny ones. Predictably it prompted such headlines such as "EPA:  Dioxin Exposure is Risky for People, Too."<p>
But several scientists at the meeting challenged the EPA's assumption, used in all its policy-making that there is no threshold below which a harmful chemical causes no harm. One was the University of Wisconsin's Alan Poland, widely known for his discovery of the "dioxin receptor," the molecule in cells to which dioxin must bind before it produces any affects.  He said 150 years of science contradicted the EPA no-threshold position.  Regarding dioxin, Poland said the normal level to which Americans are 
exposed -- four molecules of dioxin per cell -- is far below the number required to have an effect, considering that there are about 10,000 receptor molecules per cell.<p>
One EPA official complained to me that the board meeting had unfairly been characterized as negative. In fact, he said, the only problems the SAB found were with the ninth chapter. Of the first eight, it was highly complimentary.<p>
But that's just the point.  The first eight chapters were written by scientists outside of the EPA.  Only the last chapter, the conclusive one, the one from which EPA was to draw its regulatory policy and from 
which the media drew the headlines -- that was the one written by the EPA itself.
In that chapter, said Poland at the meeting, "policy masquerades as science."<p>
"This is probably the best data set that the EPA will see in my lifetime," Poland added.  "Yet, despite all of that, the first eight chapters are thrown away."<p>
Board members repeatedly accused the EPA of picking and choosing its data.  For example, the largest, most-heavily studied group of persons with known high exposure to dioxin were the members of Operation Ranch Hand, the men who did the actual spraying of Agent Orange on the jungles of South Vietnam. (Their motto: "Only you can prevent forests.") The EPA report duly noted any possible minor abnormality in this group.  But it neglected to say the Ranch Handers were strapping specimens of healthy humanity.<p>
"The EPA didn't mention that there were no more cancers than would be expected, no affects on the immune and nervous systems, no increase in deaths, and no increased birth defects in their children." SAB member and Office of Technology Assessment official Michael Gough told me.  "They mentioned nothing that didn't serve their purpose."<p>
One SAB member,  Dr. Knute Ringen of the Center to Protect Workers' Rights in Washington, D.C., concluded: "I think that the agency has pretty much come to the end of the line with regard to producing 
useful decision-making information on dioxin, and that it's time to go on to something else."<p>
But the EPA's dogged obsession with justifying its dioxin policy will not end -- unless, that is, Congress finally pulls the purse strings shut.<p>

<title>Disability Act</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>Disability Act Cripples Small Businesses</h2> 
</center>
<hr>
<b>Michael Fumento</b>
<p>
<p>
A Harris poll shows that 90 percent of business executives surveyed support the enforcement provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Well, you know people who claim everything big business says is a lie?  This time they may be onto something. 
<p>
One wonders, for example, if the Coca-Cola company was polled.  Two  years ago, a Coca-Cola executive got drunk at a company party and  threatened a co-worker.  The company fired him and he sued, because  under the ADA alcoholism is a disability.  Coca-Cola claimed they didn't fire him over the "disability," but over the threatening  
behavior--there being as yet no federal protection for such people.  A  jury disagreed and handed our soft drink sot over $1 million in lost wages and $6 million in punitive damages.  He won't get it all, since the ADA limits punitive damages to $300,000 for big businesses, but it wasn't for want of trying.  
<p>
And how about Exxon, which--after a certain accident off the coast of  
Alaska--began cracking down on employees in dangerous jobs who imbibe.   
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which oversees  
enforcement of the ADA, is suing them for it. 
<p>
Yes, under the ADA, behavior which society used to condemn can now be handsomely rewarded.  
<p>
Under the ADA, which took effect in 1992, businesses with 15 or more employees are forbidden from discriminating in hiring, firing, or promotions on the basis of a disability.  In addition, businesses catering to the public such as theaters, stores, and restaurants must  make their facilities highly accessible to disabled persons in terms of getting in, using the bathroom, and getting around. 
<p>
No one yet knows how wide the definition of "disabled" will end up. It certainly is wide enough to include the obese.  But to qualify you have to be really, really fat.  If you just have a pot belly or thunder thighs you've got a lot of hard eating in front of you. 
 
Traditional disabilities are far outnumbered by this new breed.  According to the National Organization on Disability, which commissioned the business poll, there are 49 million disabled  Americans at any one time.  (And naturally it represents the wishes of  all of them.)  Of these, fewer than 2 percent are in wheelchairs. 
<p>
Of complaints filed under the ADA, as of the end of March only 7.3% had anything to do with disabilities of the extremities such as paralysis or missing limbs.  Blindness and deafness accounted for 6  percent of complaints.  Back pain, conversely, made up almost a fifth  of all cases while emotional and psychiatric impairments were 11.6  
percent. 
<p>
So much for the imagery of the Vietnam vet in a wheelchair. 
<p>
No, under the ADA, we may not all get our 15 minutes of fame, but by  golly we all get a grab at the brass ring of disability. Still, big business has learned to stop worrying and love the ADA, says the poll. 
<p>
Don't believe it.  People often tell pollsters what they think they should say rather than what they really believe.  That's why polls showed California's anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187 headed for certain defeat just days before it easily passed.  
<p>
Yet at least those were anonymous polls.  There was nothing anonymous here.  Guarantees of confidentiality notwithstanding, no CEO in his right mind would want to be listed somewhere as disapproving of an act which everybody thinks is supposed to help Stevie Wonder and Jerry's Kids. 
<p>
Had Harris polled small businesses, the response might have been more
straightforward. That's because a single lawsuit can hurt a small business so much more. 
<p>
True, under the ADA businesses with fewer than 50 employees can lose no more than $50,000 in punitive damages.  But, "the typical small business owner takes home less than $40,000 a year, so basically it means the business, the house, the car, and then some," explains Wendy Lechner of the National Federation of Independent Businesses. 
<p>
Moreover, Lechner told me, "The  litigation can cost more than the damages [settlement or award] and that is what frightens" small  businesses. For a company like Coca Cola a few hundred thousand  dollars in litigation costs doesn't amount to cola beans.  For Charlie  Chan's Chinese takeout, it means their goose could be cooked even if they win. 
<p>
The public access section of the ADA also slams small businesses particularly hard.  An article in the current issue of Reason magazine by Brian Doherty details the nightmare odyssey of a Denver restaurant owner who ended up needlessly paying over $100,000 in construction costs and fees to make his business comply.  
<p>
Fines aside, small business owners are terrified of bad publicity.  Lechner spoke of a  Tennessee woman who rented space for her business in a local mall.  A local activist group demanded she make her store more accessible to wheelchairs and she agreed but added that by contract she needed to wait until the mall owner arrived back in the country.  Not good enough.  Soon the story of this heartless
businesswoman was everywhere. "She feels she may not recover for years  because 
it was all over the papers," says Lechner. 
<p>
If our congressional representatives were to conduct an informal poll  of some of their own small-business owning constituents, they'd  probably hear something a lot different than what millionaire chief  executives told the Harris people.  They'd probably hear that the ADA needs to be scrapped--or at least severely disabled.

<title>Fumento: The Media's Militia Hate-Fest -- 8/8/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 8, 1996</i><br>
<h2>The Media's Militia Hate-Fest</h2>
You've got to hand it to those braniacs in the media. Almost before 
the blast of the Olympic bombing stopped ringing in our hears, they 
knew whodunnit. Actually, it was a simple deduction for them.  The 
person who phoned in the warning had an American, white-sounding 
voice; therefore it was (ominous music, please) THE MILITIA! <p>

Now, now, don't pay any attention to the talk about this loner 
security guard with the hero complex.  The media had its men long ago. <p>

Here's how the Associated Press (AP) began a story. "The bomber who 
brought terror to the Olympics was a white male, may not have worked 
alone and may have shared militia groups' hatred of international 
organizations." <p>

Of course, this means he just as easily could have worked alone and 
despised militia groups almost as much as, say, the media do. But 
that's not the way AP wanted to slant it. <p>

Then there was the headline: "Two Militia Members Potential Suspects 
in Olympics Blast." <p>

"Potential" here serves the same purpose as "may" in the AP story. It 
takes nothing and makes it seem like something. Heck, as an American 
male with a white-sounding voice  (not to mention one who was trained 
to blow things up in the Army) I could have been a potential suspect.  
(I hope I don't get a call from the FBI now.) <p>

When I did a search of the Nexis computer data base of newspapers, 
magazines, and TV news shows and plugged in the key words "militia," 
"Olympic," and "bomb," I found no fewer than 343 articles containing 
those terms! <p>

Granted, a couple of those pieces actually said there was no reason to 
suspect the militia.  But most of the rest bent over backwards, 
sideways, and at any odd angle to try to tie these things together. <p>

Why? <p>

"With the Oklahoma City bombing, there were 36 hours in which it was 
Middle Eastern terrorists," David Kopel, research director of the 
Independence Institute in Golden, Colorado reminded me. "It's the same 
human instinct to rush to judgment against whoever is the modern hate 
object." <p>

Says Kopel, "A lot of what the media thrives on is conflicts of good 
versus evil.  What they put into the `evil' box varies with sociology 
of the times.  In the 1910s it would have been anarchists; in the 
1930s it would have been sex-crazed Negroes on marijuana.  Now it's 
the tobacco industry and gun owners." <p>

So part of the reason the media hate the militia is because they have 
guns.  (God help them if they also smoke.)  But certainly another 
factor is the media fear what they don't understand.  Since they are 
so enamored of big government, they can't possibly comprehend the 
thinking of people so very mistrustful of big government.  Indeed, 
it's safe to say that many militia members are downright paranoid, but 
that's hardly illegal and hardly a characteristic of only militia 
groups. <p>

Further, both the media and the public have a misconception of the 
militia because the only time you hear of them, they've done something 
wrong, be it stockpiling illegal weapons or refusing to pay taxes. 
But, says Kopel, focusing on criminals on the fringe of the militia 
movement, "Is no more fair than saying that the cops who beat up 
Rodney King are representative of police throughout the country." <p>

Finally, the pot is being stirred by groups which make their living by 
making you think all militia members are white boys who wear pointed 
white hoods or greet each other with "Heil Hitler!" instead of 
"Hello!" (Never mind that the leader of one of the largest militia 
units, J.J. Johnson of Ohio, is black and that he's called the media 
attempts to identify the militia with racism as "drive-by 
journalism.") <p>

One such group is the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR), which as I 
documented in a July 8 Wall Street Journal article basically 
fabricated the "epidemic" of black church burnings.  Depending on the 
gullibility of the reporter, the CDR will say there are anywhere from 
50,000 to 200,000 militia members and allies, though a 1995 Anti-
Defamation League report put the figure at 15,000. <p>

Another militia-baiting group is the Southern Poverty Law Center, 
headed by Morris Dees.  The Atlanta bombing, he suggested to wide-eyed 
reporters, might be a militia effort to "disrupt the one-world 
movement." <p>

It probably never occurred to most of us, militia included, that the 
modern Olympic games--now a century old--were part of any one-world 
movement, instead of a forum for athletes to glorify their countries 
and earn fat endorsement contracts. <p>

 But Dees profits handsomely from spreading hysteria. According to an 
August 3 USA Today story, his group has now amassed a fortune of $68 
million, even while other civil rights groups are going broke. <p>

"Morris Dees is an effective, demagogic hatemonger who's using his 
immense talents to get rich by making Americans afraid of each other," 
says Kopel. "He's a fraud who has milked a lot of very wonderful, 
well-intentioned people," Stephen Bright of Atlanta's Southern Center 
for Human Rights told USA Today. <p>

Says Kopel, "If the militia hadn't come along, Dees and the CDR would 
have had to invent them, and they have indeed invented what they mean 
to a lot of people." <p>

That includes virtually the entire U.S. media. Now if they can only 
find a way to blame the downing of TWA Flight 800 on a small band of 
militia in Idaho . . .  <p>

<title>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</title>

<hr>

<h2>ANTI-OBESITY DRUG IS HEAVY ON HYPE</h2>


By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
It seems that when it comes to weight-loss products, the expression 
"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" just doesn't have 
meaning.  So it has been with the so-called "miracle anti-fat pill," 
which isn't a pill, isn't a miracle, and has "hype" written all over 
it.
<p>
Recent studies in Science magazine have claimed synthesized high doses 
of a naturally-occurring hormone, called leptin, caused mice to go 
from Jackie Gleason to Art Carney in a matter of weeks. This has 
sparked a celebration in various media outlets.  The St. Petersburg 
(Florida) Times, the most-read newspaper in one of the fattest parts 
of the country, gushed, "Just think: You could gorge yourself on ice 
cream, potato chips, tacos . . . . Then just pop a miracle pill, and 
your worries are over . . . . The world would be couch-potato heaven."  
<p>
Ah . . .  Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow there's a drug, 
right?
<p>
Reality check.
<p>
The first little problem with leptin is that the "pill" is actually 
injections, possibly daily, for life.
<p>
No big deal?  Ask any insulin-dependent diabetic.  The difference 
between leanness and simple obesity (obesity is usually defined as 
being 20% over ideal weight) is about the equivalent of a McDonald's 
Big Mac.  Probably few of us would cherish trading sandwiches for 
shots.
<p>
Then there's the efficacy issue. Leptin works wonders on rotund 
rodents and no doubt Mickey will soon have heard the last of Minnie's 
teasing about his "beer cheese belly." But mice are not small men.  
Medical literature is replete with instances of drugs that cured or 
killed rodents yet had no effect on humans.
<p>
Recent research by Dr. Jos Caro and others at Thomas Jefferson 
Medical Center in Philadelphia, including a study in the June Journal 
of Clinical Investigation, has found that obese people actually 
already have far higher levels of leptin than do lean ones.  This 
could mean that leptin is useless as a weight regulator in humans.  
Or, as Dr. Caro told me, the situation could be like Type II diabetes, 
in which sufferers have high levels of insulin but are resistant to 
its effects and therefore must be given much more insulin.
<p>
Maybe a massive dose of leptin would work on obese humans, says Dr. 
Caro. "But that is an optimistic view. It may also not work."    
<p>
Then there's safety.  We don't know yet how safe large leptin 
infusions are for mice, much less humans.
<p>
What all this means is that the two-year timeline some reporters have 
suggested for general use of the drug is laughable.  Five is more like 
it, and perhaps far more.  
<p>
Assuming leptin even worked perfectly, there would still be the 
problem that obesity is often just the most obvious indicator of the 
physical harm on ourselves by overeating and underexercising.  Leptin 
won't strengthen the lungs, heart, and other muscles grown soft 
through too many hours of watching Home Improvement and Roseanne.  It 
won't lower cholesterol levels. It won't prevent colon cancer and 
other malignancies linked to a bad diet.
<p>
And then there's another kind of harm for which obesity is merely a 
marker, the mental attitude that's led to the obesity epidemic.
<p>
Despite the other obesity hype we've been hearing lately, that of "fat 
genes," genes cannot explain the waistline explosion of the last two 
decades that has made a third of us obese and as many as three-fourths 
of us overweight.  Genes cannot explain why Americans of European 
descent weigh so much more than do Europeans, making the land of the 
free also the land of the fattest people on earth.
<p>
Yes, there is evidence that some human obesity is genetic, and if some 
300 pounder insists he sustains his weight on a turnip a day, I won't 
argue.  But most fat people are only lying to themselves when they 
blame their ancestors.
<p>
One better object of blame is a culture that encourages overeating and 
underexertion. Another is ourselves.
<p>
It used to be that concepts like "self-restraint," "delayed 
gratification," "self-denial" and "all things in moderation" were 
indicative of building character.  Now they have become quaint.
<p>
Tell an overweight American he should eat less and exert himself more 
and you're likely to get the same incredulous response you'd get if 
you told a welfare mother with seven children by six men that human 
beings should not behave like rabbits.
<p>
Gluttony isn't called one of the seven deadly sins because it can 
spoil your looks in a bikini, but rather because of its impact on the 
spirit.  But Americans don't want to hear about that sin or any other.
<p>
Instead, we want to indulge, and we don't want to bulge.  So we spend 
billions of dollars a year chasing after fad diets, false prophets, 
anti-cellulite salves, pills, foods, drinks, and exercise equipment 
guaranteed to effortlessly burn off gazillions of calories. We buy 
books and videos from screaming women with blonde crewcuts, and 
purchase cream promising to magically drain the fat from our thighs.
<p>
 Sure, no miracle cure has worked yet, but the next one just might. 
Anything's better than a little self-discipline, a little denial.  And 
who knows, maybe the next promised miracle will really pan out.  Maybe 
leptin will.
<p>
Yes, some day we may all be able to walk around in a glorious leptin 
lethargy with feedbags on one end and bags like they sling under 
parade horses on the other end.  
<p>
But alas, what truly ails this nation no drug is going to cure.

<title>GULF WAR SYNDROME: SON OF AGENT ORANGE</title>
</head>

<hr><center><h2>Gulf War Syndrome:  Son of Agent Orange</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento </a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Yet another scientific study has found no evidence that Gulf War 
Syndrome (GWS) is anything other than a broad tag applied to any 
illness found in any Gulf Vet. But those who deny the evidence remain 
undaunted. After all, says Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown, it 
took 20 years for the government to conclude that Agent Orange, a 
defoliant used on the jungles of South Vietnam, caused severe health 
problems in vets. Now the government liberally doles out payments to 
Vietnam vets with any number of diseases it claims have been linked to 
Agent Orange.
<p>
Indeed, the cry of "It's Agent Orange all over again!" has become the 
"Remember the Maine!" slogan of the GWS alarmists.  And they're right, 
but not in the way they would have us believe.
<p>
Both then and now there were wild, unsubstantiated tales of exposure.  
With Agent Orange, soldiers complained of being drenched with an 
orange-colored powder or liquid from the sky.  But the name comes from 
the color of the containing barrels. Agent Orange is clear and always 
a liquid. With GWS we hear of soldiers absolutely convinced they were 
hit by poison gas, even though during the whole of the war not one was 
ever treated for such exposure.  
<p>
Then and now there were wild rumors of miscarriage and birth defects 
among offspring of vets.  One case we keep hearing about is an alleged 
cluster of birth defects among National Guard families in Mississippi.  
But a health department investigation showed no more birth defects in 
that group than normal.  Wider studies have shown the same thing for 
both the offspring of Vietnam and Gulf War vets.  No study has ever 
shown them to have more birth defects or more miscarriages than vets 
who didn't go to war.
<p>
Then and now any symptom any vet got was blamed on the alleged 
illness. More than 75 symptoms have been attributed to GWS, ranging 
from bleeding gums to aching joints to graying hair to weight gain to 
heart disease. Even malaria and herpes have been attributed to GWS, 
though previously these were thought to have been spread by mosquitoes 
and sex.  If you have chronic back pains and didn't go to the Gulf, 
it's just chronic back pain. If you went, it's Gulf War Syndrome.
<p>
Then and now vets who got cancer automatically blamed it on the 
offending agent, as if vets who serve in wars are never supposed to 
get the disease. But one out of four Americans will eventually 
contract cancer.  Studies on Vietnam vets showed that they had no more 
cancers than among vets who didn't go to war, and the same has held 
true of Gulf War vets.
<p>
An on-going study of military personnel who actually did the Agent 
Orange spraying and who received far greater exposure than did ground 
troops indicates they are just as healthy as counterparts who received 
no Agent Orange exposure.
<p>
The same is true of studies of Gulf vets. The only illnesses they have 
to a greater degree than soldiers who didn't go to the Gulf are 
psychologically-related. These may be very real and debilitating, but 
they weren't caused by anything in the Gulf itself.  The prime cause, 
ironically, is probably being told they are being ravaged by a mystery 
illness.  Doctors have long known that if you tell people they are 
ill, they'll start sprouting numerous symptoms completely unrelated to 
their actual illness.
<p>
Then and now no purported link between illness and the alleged cause 
is considered too ludicrous. The first famous Agent Orange victim, 
Paul Reutersham, who died of cancer, was by his own admission 
completely enclosed in a supply helicopter at the time the area he was 
in was being sprayed.
<p>
The most reported-on death from GWS is Michael Adcock.  His mother 
claims a gas-laden Scud missile had exploded nearby 24 hours before 
her son developed his first cancer symptom. But cancers such as his 
usually take decades to develop and no cancer manifests itself in 
anything near 24 hours.
<p>
Then and now  the hysteria was driven by veterans lobbyists (most 
prominently the American Legion), by congressmen who opposed the war 
in question and who leap at any excuse to spend other people's money 
to show their compassion, by a media far more interested in selling 
terror than telling the truth, and (of course) lawyers.
<p>
Then and now, science was openly disavowed. In 1990, a veterans 
lobbyist said of Agent Orange, "we must now presume that the 
scientific community cannot be trusted [and] a political decision must 
be made on this issue to provide compensation to veterans."  In 1995 
President Clinton  leapfrogged over the heads of scientists in 
establishing a political panel to review GWS evidence, with Hillary 
Clinton serving as the Administration's point person on the issue.
<p>
Then and now, to question the causation-disease link was to be accused 
of being heartless and unpatriotic, as if it is compassionate and 
patriotic to mislead healthy people into believing they--and their 
wives and children--live under the shadow of a terrible disease.
<p>
Yes, then and now, vets have truly suffered, but not from any exposure 
they received during wartime. Rather it is exposure to those who claim 
to be their friends and allies that has caused their terror and even 
some of their symptoms.  With friends like those, who needs Ho Chi 
Minh and Saddam Hussein?

<title>Direct Lending Clunker is Already Running out of Gas</title>

<center><h2>Direct Lending Clunker is Already Running out of Gas</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<center>By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p> 
Picture a car salesman screaming at you from the television.  "My plan 
will save you billions, BILLIONS, in tax dollars by taking student 
loans away from the banks and cutting out the middleman's profits! But 
there's more! Students will save money, too, because I'm offering them 
lo-lo E-Z payments! I must be crazy to offer such a deal!  That's why 
they call me Crazy Billy!"
<p>
That, if you pardon a wee bit of rhetorical flourish, was President 
Bill Clinton of two years ago. And his pitch worked, as Congress 
enacted his student loan direct lending program.
<p>
And as is so often the case, the vehicle that on the lot looked so 
pretty has turned out to be little more than a bucket of bolts.
<p>
The timing on the direct loan scheme couldn't have been more ironic. 
At a time when former Soviet republics were privatizing everything in 
sight, our government was nationalizing a major industry. Still, two 
government studies, one by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and 
the other by the General Accounting Office, did calculate that direct 
lending could save money, about $4 billion over the next four years.  
The Clinton Administration made things look sweeter by arbitrarily 
doubling that to $8 billion.  What's a measly $4 billion among 
friends, right?
<p>
A pilot direct-loan program was already in the works, but in the 
atmosphere of arrogance that characterized those early Clinton months, 
the Administration decided there was no need to wait.
<p>
Now even government agencies are saying that this act of reinventing 
government is closer to reinventing the Edsel.
<p>
A new CBO study has actually reversed that agency's position and 
concluded that the best way for government to save money with direct 
lending is to scrap it.  This could save taxpayers $1.5 billion over 
the next seven years.
<p>
The reason for CBO's about face is that its original report compared 
the administrative costs of only a year of the direct lending scheme 
with the full administrative costs of the guaranteed student loan 
system.  When Congress directed the CBO to compare both programs on an 
equal footing, it became clear the result was a jump in government 
spending.
<p>
A new Congressional Research Service report also concludes that the 
Administration was not calculating fully the cost of taking over the 
administration of the program.
<p>
Also a fraud is the part of Crazy Billy's plan which was to help 
students, the E-Z payment part. All it actually does is to stretch out 
payments, the oldest trick in the car salesman's repertoire.  
Currently, students are given 10 years to repay, while under direct 
lending it's 25.  Sure, payments are lower.  But at the end of the 25-
year period a student borrowing the maximum amount allowed, $88,000, 
would end up paying back $167,723 in interest and principle instead of 
$128,400 under the existing plan.
<p>
Moreover you would also have students paying off  their college loans 
even as their own children were going off to college. Instead of a 
chicken in every pot, Clinton's promise is two generations of student 
loans in every family.
<p>
But there's one huge difference between Crazy Billy and other used car 
salesmen.  No one forces you to buy from a used car lot.
<p>
Crazy Billy says he won't force anyone to buy his plan, either.   
Repeatedly he's stated that direct government lending will be a matter 
of choice for schools.  As late as April of this year he spoke of 
making "the student loan program available to all the schools on a 
voluntary basis . . . "
<p>
Yet Clinton's current budget proposal indicates that all colleges and 
universities will be in the program by 1997-98.  Education Secretary 
William Riley has affirmed in a letter to Tennessee Democratic 
Representative Bart Gordon, a direct lending opponent, that under the 
presidents's plan, by the 1997-98 school year "all schools would be 
required to participate."
<p>
So much for "voluntary."
<p>
The obvious reason for this conscription is the same as for any--that 
volunteerism isn't working.  While the law allows up to 40% of loan 
volume by 1995-96, recent reports from the GAO and the Advisory 
Committee on Student Financial Assistance state that direct lending 
participation will actually be around 30%.  Far from flocking to join 
the program, institutions have been scrambling to get out.  Earlier 
this year the GAO stated that 104 institutions have abandoned their 
Crazy Billy direct lending vehicle by the side of the road. 
<p>
Yet while legitimate four- and two-year institutions have been 
steering clear of the government program, it has become a haven for 
hundreds of high-default trade schools with questionable credentials.  
Almost half the direct loans are to students of trade schools, with a 
third of all loans going to students of barber or beauty academies.  
The default rate for student loans from trade schools averages 30%, 
compared with only 7% for four-year colleges.  For all his trouble in 
taking over the student loan program, Uncle Sam is going to get stuck 
holding a lot of useless notes.
<p>
A recent poll sponsored by direct lending opponents indicates that 
almost three-fourths of the public believes that the pre-Clinton 
system of private industry making loans which the government 
guarantees is better than the Clinton program. Congress should tell 
Crazy Billy that taxpayers aren't the tire-kicking yahoos he thinks we 
are and that we want direct lending sent to the junk yard.

<title>FARM SUBSIDIES SUBSIDIZE WETLANDS DESTRUCTION</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr>
<center>
<h2>Farm Subsidies Subsidize Wetlands Destruction</h2><br>
By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Pesticides, those much maligned chemicals, can be wonderful things. 
Likewise for fertilizer, when it's not being used to blow up federal 
buildings.  They are both important tools in making the U.S. the best-
fed nation in the world, and in feeding tens of millions of citizens 
of other nations.<p>
But, as they say, you can have too much of a good thing. Agricultural 
run-off from these products are the biggest cause of waterway 
pollution in this country. Pesticides, which are primarily herbicides, 
can kill plants downstream.  Fertilizer run-off makes other plants 
grow at extraordinary rates. Together, fertilizers and pesticides can 
be a one-two punch against eco-systems.<p>
The single best example of such destruction is the nation's largest 
wetlands, the Everglades. Phosphorous fertilizer run-off from sugar 
cane has set off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria 
and algae and alsofosters the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails.<p>   
Because of such problems, pesticides and fertilizers are heavily 
targeted by government regulators. And it's seems only right that the 
government be involved because, you see, it's the government that's 
responsible for much of the problem.<p>
That's the conclusion of a new study from the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute (CEI) in Washington, D.C. <p>
The study analyzed data from six major farms states, and found that 
eliminating farm subsidies could reduce chemical use per acre by as 
much as 35%.<p>
This is because under the federal price support program, which applies 
to many types of crops, the government pays the farmer a guaranteed 
price for his yield. If, come harvest time, the crops don't bring in 
that minimum price the government pays the farmer the difference, 
called a deficiency payment.<p>
Naturally, this short-circuits the market. Farmers grow extra crops 
not because there are waiting mouths out there but because the 
government is paying a bounty. Extra crops require extra pesticides 
and fertilizer.<p>
But it gets worse. In order to try to limit these extra crops, the 
government encourages farmers--through additional payments--to keep 
part of their land idle. But farmers are terrific businessmen, and a 
heck of a lot smarter than your average bureaucrat. So the farmer goes 
to extraordinary lengths to get as many crops as he can out of the 
acreage still in use. This includes pouring on all the more fertilizer 
and pesticides.<p>
U.S. consumption of plant fertilizer is now close to an all-time high, 
while pesticide use per acre is at its highest point ever.<p>
Now we have too much fertilizer and pesticide in use and too much 
food. This surplus food practically guarantees that commodity prices 
will be low again next year and the cycle starts all over again. It's 
so ridiculous you'd think it was directed by Kevin Costner, except 
that this overblown budget is on a government scale. That puts farm 
subsidy prices at about $10 billion per year.<p>
Myself, I have better uses for my tax dollars than destroying precious 
wetlands. I also didn't give up the benefit of phosphorous detergent 
just to subsidize its use by farmers, who were always the greatest 
source of phosphorous pollution in any case.<p>
In the case of the Everglades, no deficiency payments are made. So the 
sugar lobby wants you to think it's not costing you anything. But 
instead of direct payments, the government has established a quota-
based tariff on sugar imports. In all, the sugar program is estimated 
to cost consumers $1.4 billion a year and, again, encourages excess 
crop growing.<p>
But if you, me, and the alligators and egrets don't care much for this 
whole business, you won't hear the bureaucrats complaining. Indeed, 
this is a jobs program for them.<p>
As study author Jonathon Tolman put it to me, "On one hand you have 
EPA doing everything it can to reduce pesticide use by any means 
possible, costing taxpayers a fortune.  And on the other hand you have 
the USDA using taxpayer money to get more of it." It's bizarre, which 
is to say business as usual for the feds.<p>
While CEI is often at odds with environmentalists, on this they have 
the full backing of the Wilderness Society.  "We think [the study] is 
indisputable," General Counsel Jim Webb told me. The nation is 
"investing a lot of national capital, in both dollars and critters, in 
keeping this subsidy going." <p>
Any one study needs to be seen as just that--one study. But other 
studies support  Tolman's findings.  One conducted on the North 
Carolina coastal plain, for example, found that elimination of farm 
programs would have reduced nitrogen leaching from fertilizer use by 
46%. And data from the 1991 and 1992 Cropping Practices Surveys shows 
that corn producers who participated in the USDA feedgrain program 
used nitrogen, herbicides and insecticides at greater rates than those 
who didn't participate.<p>
There is relief from all this in the former of legislation introduced 
by Democratic Rep. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Republican Rep. Dick 
Zimmer (N.J.) that would phase out most deficiency payments over the 
next six years (giving farmers a chance to adjust) and make other 
major cuts in federal farm subsidies. Other legislation before 
Congress would begin removing those sweet special privileges the sugar 
lobby receives.<p>
If alligators and egrets could lobby their congressmen--and why not, 
if dead people in Chicago can vote?--they'd surely be lobbying to get 
rid of farm supports.<p>

<h2>TIME TO MAKE AMERICORPS A CORPSE</h2><p>
By<br> <A href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Back in 1993 it was called "the best of Bill Clinton" and something 
"no one can quarrel with" except possibly to argue that "the whole 
thing isn't big enough." But a just-released Government Accounting 
Office report indicates that it is nonetheless big enough to be a fine 
example of Clintonesque waste in a time when far worthier programs are 
facing the budget-cutter's axe.<p>
"It" was the Clinton administration's proposed national service 
program, later dubbed "AmeriCorps," under which a person would 
received a stipend and a $4,725 college educational voucher for 
providing civilian national service.<p>
As part of an allegedly austere budget, Clinton wanted to spend $7.4 
billion on AmeriCorps over five years.  Congress gave its approval but 
scaled the program back to $1.5 billion for a three-year program.<p>
Now the Republican-dominated House has voted to cut off funding for 
the program as of October 1, with the Senate set to consider that 
proposal shortly.<p>
 Some criticism of AmeriCorps is unfair, such as making fun of their 
tag as "volunteers" because they are paid. Our "all-volunteer Army" is 
paid, as are members of the Peace Corps and other programs generally 
considered volunteer. Clearly the AmeriCorps members are volunteers in 
that they weren't forced into the program, as would have been if a 
number of both conservative and liberal pundits had had their way.<p>
Further, while the average stipend plus benefits value per hour, at a 
bit less than $7.50, is well above minimum wage,  no youth is going to 
get rich working for AmeriCorps.<p>
Yet, as is so often the case when the government is involved, much of 
the money allotted to the program somehow seems to be slipping through 
the cracks and crevices.<p>
The GAO report found that AmeriCorps cost $26,654 per participant. 
While AmeriCorps claims its overhead is only 5% of its budget, the GAO 
report shows that over half the average expense per member goes to 
something other than pay and benefits.<p>
In a July, 1994 letter to AmeriCorps critic Charles Grassley (Rep.-
Iowa),  Eli J. Segal, head of the Corporation for National Service, 
the parent organization of AmeriCorps, said that "the federal share 
[of the cost of supporting an AmeriCorps participant] should not 
exceed $13,000 on average."  In fact, the federal share was $20,806.  <p>
The more the federal involvement, the higher the cost.  For non-
federal agencies receiving AmeriCorps grants, the funding average was 
$25,797 while for federal ones it was $31,017.<p>
While 15% of AmeriCorp's budget was to come from private 
contributions, so far less than 7% does--though Eli  insists that with 
time that figure will improve.<p>
In a country in which 80 million people claim to be doing at least 
some part-time volunteer work (though of course there is always a need 
for more), are 20,000 more volunteers a year at $26,654 a head really 
worth it?  According to many pundits and editorialists, they are.<p>
To read some accounts of AmeriCorps, one wonders how the country could 
have survived over two centuries without it. There they are, combating 
inner-city drug abuse and crime, cleaning up beaches, fighting global 
climate change. So heralded are they in the media that when Tennessee  
AmeriCorps members decided to work on Martin Luther King day it made 
the pages of the Memphis Commercial Appeal. Such incredible dedication 
obviously deserves recognition.<p>
Some of the projects have been of dubious value. The San Francisco 
Chronicle profiled one participant who earned her pay and benefits by 
providing AIDS education to deaf homosexuals.  Apparently 14 years 
after the AIDS epidemic began, deaf San Francisco homosexuals remain 
ignorant of how the disease is spread.<p>
Other projects are more dubious yet. In Denver, AmeriCorps members 
earned their pay by handing out leaflets attacking a city councilman.<p>
But political activism is not so much the problem as plain old waste. 
A federal report on the Orange County, California AmeriCorps branch 
revealed that while the program was supposed to provide service 
programs for more than 1500 people in Orange County, none of the 
programs in the four participating cities ever had more than 25 
participants, with most ranging from five to 15.  Other Orange County 
AmeriCorps projects, such as knitting a memorial quilt for survivors 
of the Oklahoma City bombing, have a real air of make-work about them. 
By the way, the quilt was never finished.<p>
But the Orange County program is just one bad apple out of a big 
national barrel right? Actually, the federal evaluation report stated, 
"Overall, this is a good AmeriCorps program."  One shudders to think 
what a bad program is like. <p>
Clinton likens AmeriCorps to such projects as President Franklin 
Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and President Kennedy's 
Peace Corps. Indeed, in his State of the Union address last January, 
Clinton accidentally referred to AmeriCorps as "the Peace Corps."<p>
But both these programs had clearly defined goals.  The CCC planted 
trees, fought forest fires, dug drainage ditches. The Peace Corps 
brought medical care, sanitation, and new agricultural techniques to 
underdeveloped parts of the world.<p>
AmeriCorps's charge, on the other hand, is an amorphous "Go out there 
and do some good!"  Such a vague, feel-good, approach, some might say, 
is a nice metaphor for the Clinton administration in general.<p>

<title>NY Times Blows Hot Air Over Global Warming</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr><center><h2>NEW YORK TIMES BLOWS <br>HOT AIR OVER GLOBAL WARMING </h2>By Michael Fumento 
</center><hr><p> 

If you're like me, about twice a month you get a fat yellow envelope 
from this guy named  Ed McMahon, saying "YOU, JOHN DOE could already 
be the winner" of 9 million dollars or some such. If you're like me 
you toss the envelope away, realizing that here the difference between 
"could" and "are" is vast and virtually insurmountable.<p>

So, it is too, in the world of environmental doomsaying, which leads 
us to the subject of the New York Times front-page article by William 
K. Stevens: "Scientists Say Earth's Warming Could Set Off  Wide 
Disruptions." In that same edition a Times editorial decried possible 
congressional cuts in funding for global warming research.<p>

This article was intended as the knock-out blow, with the setup left 
jab having come a week earlier in the form of another Steven's front-
page article "Experts Confirm Human Role in Global Warming."  There 
Stevens began with a reference to a draft report by the U.N. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). "In an important 
shift of scientific judgment," he wrote, "experts advising the world's 
governments on climate change are saying for the first time that human 
activity is a likely cause of the warming of the global atmosphere."<p>

Actually, scientists have long acknowledged that human activity, 
through release of "greenhouse" gases that trap heat, would cause some 
warming. As Robert Balling Jr., Director of the Office of Climatology 
at Arizona State University says, "The issue all along has been how 
much warming and whether it would be countered by other cooling 
mechanisms."<p>

Any environmentalist will gladly tell you the interaction of various 
forces on the globe can be terribly complicated. Probably the main 
complication here has been the effect that the heat build-up would 
have on water vapor, which in turn could cause a cooling effect.<p>

Such complications have spawned a huge number of models estimating 
just how much total heat increase the globe would experience, ranging 
from "utterly insignificant" to the doomsayers' "extra crispy."<p>

The real news of the IPCC draft report, according to report  reviewer 
and University of Virginia climatologist Dr. Patrick Michaels, is that 
the doomsayers' model is kaput.<p>

"What Stevens completely missed is that the mid-point of the model 
which they are now touting shows far less warming than the model upon 
which they based the 1992 Rio de Janeiro agreement," he told me.<p>

That treaty committed the nations of the earth in principle to spend 
tens of billions of dollars to reduce greenhouse emissions.<p>

Yet Michaels believes that this latest warming projection could still 
be far too high while another respected researcher, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology climatologist and IPCC report reviewer Richard 
Lindzen, believes that warming will probably always be at a level 
difficult or impossible to detect above normal yearly fluctuations.<p>

Lindzen says newer projections show less and less warming than 
previous ones because they are being tweaked into doing so. The 
reason?  Real-life measurements are showing only slight warming. 
According to NASA scientist Roy Spenser, 17 years of satellite data 
show a rate of warming of about 7/100 of a degree per decade, or a 
rise of about 7/10 of a degree by the year 2100.<p>

That's "considerably less warming than climate models predict," he 
told me.<p>

Which leads us to part two of Stevens' attack, the potential 
catastrophe which is as likely as Ed McMahon showing up at your door 
with a check.<p>

It's not only that warming is far less than what was predicted. Less 
warming means fewer effects and less dire ones. More than this it 
seems increasingly clear that this warming is not a generalized one. 
Most of the warming it appears will be at night, when the temperatures 
are coldest.  Most will also be during the winter and in the frigid 
far north at that.<p>

"The season to season extremes are decreasing," says Michaels.<p>

Global warming-induced melting of the polar ice caps was the basis for 
Kevin Costner's embarrassing movie "Waterworld," in which virtually 
the entire earth is submerged. Terrified island nations are the 
strongest supporters of costly international sanctions against 
greenhouse gas restrictions.<p>

But, notes Michaels, if anything significant global warming could be 
expected to add to the polar caps by increasing precipitation above 
the poles. "Waterworld" flops again.<p>

Speaking of island nations, how about those predictions of vast 
numbers of  "super" hurricanes?  The Environmental Defense Fund's 
Michael Oppenheimer, an important source for Stevens, has predicted 
one of these as early as 1997,  killing 22,000 Floridians.<p>

But according to a paper by eight prominent researchers in the 
November 1994 Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 
Floridians can rest easy. They wrote, "year to year variations" in 
weather "are so great that they must effectively  swamp' any quite 
modest effect" of  global warming on hurricane frequency.<p>

It's true that the IPCC draft report on which Stevens based his dire 
story does mention the possibility of severe climate problems, but as 
Michael MacCraken, who is coordinating the U.S. governmental review of 
the IPCC report, explained to me, that's because it was just a first 
draft and the authors were obligated to mention any and all possible 
weather permutations, if only for later drafts to shoot them down.<p>

Tomorrow the earth COULD be invaded by flying saucers with tall aliens 
carrying cookbooks entitled To Serve Man. But idle speculations are 
best left for things like the O.J. Simpson trial, not matters of world

<center><h2>RACIAL POLITICS MAKE STRANGE ENEMIES </h2>
By Michael Fumento
</center>
<hr> <p>
 

Whoever said that lynch mobs are a thing of the past in this country 
hasn't seen the pack chasing Dinesh D'Souza with a rope.<p>

D'Souza is the John M. Olin fellow at the American Enterprise 
Institute (AEI) and author of the just-published book The End of 
Racism, which is the source of all the controversy.<p>

The book challenges the idea that racism is the primary cause of black 
problems, and says that the civil rights community, while once a boon 
to blacks, has become more of an albatross. D'Souza's ultimate target 
is failed liberal policies, which is why it's interesting that most of 
the early and very angry criticism of the work has come from the 
right.<p>   

Upon publication of the book, two AEI black conservative adjunct 
fellows, Glenn Loury and Robert Woodson, angrily resigned their 
positions. Loury also wrote a damning review of the book for the new 
conservative Weekly Standard.<p>

The resignations then became subject of an even more damning column by 
William Raspberry.  While not really a conservative, Raspberry has 
nonetheless shared the views of Woodson, Loury, and yes, D'Souza, that 
the liberal approach to the problems of the black community leaves 
much to be desired and that tagging all opponents as racists is 
generally counterproductive.<p>

Yet Raspberry tagged D'Souza's work as one "only racists could cheer" 
while Woodson went even further, calling D'Souza "the Mark Furhman of 
public policy."<p>

Can he really mean that? Can this be said of a writer whose book black 
conservative Thomas Sowell has called the best book on the topic in 
half a century?<p>

Would Mark Furhman have written a book former NAACP Chairman Margaret 
Bush Wilson has called "rich and provocative" or that a former 
chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said was "of  
stunning eloquence and power" with "a profound vision for transcending 
the pathology of race"?<p>

Part of the problem, no doubt, is that some people would rather attack 
a 742-page book than to bother actually reading it.<p>

Thus an article in USA Today says the book maintains "many people are 
racist for good reason." No, actually it says many people who might be 
accused of being racist are not; rather they act out of rational 
prejudice. Thus cab drivers--white, black, Hispanic, and Asian--are 
far more likely to shy away from young, black male fares because they 
know they are far more likely to be robbed and killed by them.<p>

Recall the Rev. Jesse Jackson's words about walking "down the street 
and hear[ing] footsteps and start thinking about robbery, then look 
around and see somebody white and feel relieved." <p>

Either the USA Today reporter is lying or hasn't read D'Souza's book, 
but in any case his readers will believe that D'Souza has said there 
can be a good reason for racism. Some of them repeat the charge in 
what may become a snowballing effect.<p>

Likewise, Raspberry concludes his column saying "D'Souza strives 
mightily to convince us there aren't any" racists. In fact, D'Souza 
has a whole chapter called "Bigotry in Black and White" which says 
that while the old style of racism is on the decline a new type is on 
horizon and may be on rise.<p>

As both author and book make repeatedly clear, the point isn't that 
racism is dead. Rather, D'Souza says,  "In a contemporary sense racism 
is no longer the prime obstacle raised by African-Americans or any 
other group.<p>

"If white racism ended tomorrow," D'Souza told me, "this would do 
little to improve black test scores, increase black savings rates, 
boost black rates of business formations, reduce black crime or 
strengthen black families. Those are the most serious cultural 
challenges facing black Americans, especially poor blacks. Racism is 
not the most serious challenge."<p>    

Do these sound like the ravings of a hooded skin-headed neo-Nazi Aryan 
Nation scumsucker? <p>

So why all this anger?<p>

Says D'Souza, "I think the hidden key to this thing is that I'm not 
black and that I'm discussing these things in public."<p>

That theory is certainly supported by the title of the column about 
D'Souza's book in the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times: "An Outsider's 
Arrogance." Ooh, feel the indignation!<p>

If D'Souza has been wrong about one thing it was in thinking that 
being "a person of color" would protect him from charges of messing 
with other people's business. As a native of Bombay, India, he is 
indeed a cultural and ethnic hodge-podge. He's Asian yet Caucasian 
rather than mongoloid; he's lighter than Clarence Thomas though darker 
than Whitney Houston and one hell of a lot darker than Michael 
Jackson.<p>

But black he ain't.<p>

Yet D'Souza was right in thinking that the debate over black problems 
must be open to all races and ethnic groups. It's a good thing that 
early women's rights advocates didn't have such a sectarian view. 
After all, by definition 100% of the people who gave women the right 
to vote were men.<p>

America is 88% non-black. It was white government policies that helped 
create the terrible problems so many blacks face today. Thus non-
blacks will have to play a major role in ending those problems. 
Disagree with D'Souza if you wish, but read him first. And salute one 
man with the guts to squarely confront one of our nation's most vexing 
problems.<p>

<title>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS -- Fumento</title>

<center><h2>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS</h2> <p> 
By Michael Fumento</center><p>
<hr>
 

Long before the current price-fixing scandal rocked the halls of 
Archer Daniels Midland, the self-styled "supermarket to the world," 
was a super rip-off for the public. And its co-conspirators in this 
scandal are the likes of President Bill Clinton and presidential 
wannabe Kansas Republican Senator Robert Dole.<p>

The tool used to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars yearly from 
the taxpayer to ADM is ethanol, alcohol distilled from corn. When 
mixed with gasoline, ethanol is called gasohol. About 55% of the 
ethanol produced in this country is manufactured by ADM, based in 
Decatur, Ill.  With sales of about $11 billion a year, ADM is the 
largest grain-processing company in the world.<p>

But gasohol has problems at the pump. First, it hurts mileage. Second, 
it's considerably more expensive than gasoline. Nobody is going to buy 
a fuel that both costs more and hurts mileage unless either A) the 
fuel is subsidized so that it doesn't cost more, or B) they are forced 
to. In this case, ADM has arranged through its friends in high places 
to make it C) both of the above.<p>

In addition to myriad state tax breaks, gasoline blended with ethanol 
is eligible for a federal tax credit of 5.4 cents a gallon, totalling 
an estimated $770 million a year. Over half that goes straight into 
ADM CEO Dwayne Andreas's coffers.<p>

Introducing that law was Dole, ADM's point man for its assault on the 
taxpayers. Dole has introduced over two dozen bills to help the 
ethanol industry and lobbied fiercely for it outside of Senate 
chambers as well.<p>

ADM needs people like Dole because ethanol is not only too expensive, 
it's worthless.<p>

Ethanol is touted as cleaner than gasoline. Indeed, it can reduce 
emissions of carbon monoxide, a fairly minor pollutant. While harmful 
in enclosed areas, it never causes serious health problems even at the 
very highest levels found in outdoor air.<p>

Moreover, ethanol only reduces carbon monoxide emissions from cars 
built before oxygen sensors were made mandatory in 1983 or whose 
oxygen sensors are broken. Repeated studies at the University of 
Denver using a remote testing device invented there have found that 
out of 250-300 late model vehicles tested, at most one will put out 
significant carbon monoxide emissions.<p>

Ethanol is also said to reduce ground-level ozone pollution, but a 
study by Sierra Research of Sacramento, California found that it would 
actually slightly INCREASE ozone production and increase smog. Indeed, 
in 1992 the EPA declared it could not be certified as a pollution-
fighting fuel for use in the nation's smoggiest cities. Immediately, 
as the Wall Street Journal put it, Dole "lobbied the administration 
from President Bush on down." Dole won, ADM won, and airbreathers lost 
as the EPA relented and certified ethanol.<p>

 Ethanol is also presented as a way to prop up corn prices by 
increasing corn demand. It does do that, but a by-product of its 
production is a corn mash sold as feed. That reduces the demand for 
soybeans, a crop corn farmers grow as part of crop rotation.<p>

In any case, it would be far cheaper to just funnel a subsidy directly 
corn farmers rather than funnel it through ADM.<p>

The real reason for ethanol's continued blessed existence isn't amber 
waves of grain but ample waves of cash. "Dwayne Andreas just owns me," 
former Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss once told the 
Washington Post. It turns out Andreas actually owns lots of other 
important people, too.<p>

Since just 1991, Andreas and his family, ADM, and the ADM PAC have 
contributed over $1.18 million to the Republican Party and $1.05 
million to the Democrats.<p>

But nobody has benefited from this largesse more than Bob Dole. To 
date, ADM has contributed over $85,000 to Dole's various campaign 
bids, along with various other perks.<p>

The most lucrative contribution to Dole was ADM's co-sponsorship of 
"Face-Off," a daily three-minute radio debate between Dole and 
Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy from 1984 to November 1987, 
when Dole declared his presidential candidacy. A spokesman for the 
show told me the value of this free advertising for Dole was about 
$840,000.<p>

Even while he denies being Andreas's chief  lackey, it is a position 
Dole jealously guards. In August, speaking of the ethanol industry, 
Dole told an audience at the Illinois State Fair, "So far, we've been 
shut out by this administration."<p>

Really?<p>

Last year, shortly after Dwayne Andreas served as co-chairman of a 
Democratic Party fundraiser and personally donated $100,000, the 
Clinton Administration, via the EPA, tried to mandate that about 10% 
of all gasoline sold nationally contain ethanol. But in May a federal 
appeals court declared the administration "exceeded its authority" in 
so doing.<p>

With that shot down, the ethanol lobby demanded a different gift, 
insisting that an ethanol-containing gasoline additive called ETBE 
receive the same tax break that pure ethanol gets. The Treasury 
Department quickly granted it. The ADM-supported American Corn 
Grower's Alliance then announced,  "Agriculture owes the President 
many thanks for seeing him continue to fulfill his pledge to be an 
advocate for ethanol, ETBE, and oxygenated fuels."<p>

(Note to the tobacco companies: If you want Clinton off your backs, 
just lace your cigarettes with a little ethanol.)<p>

The ADM executive who blew the whistle on its alleged price-fixing 
scheme says that the company's philosophy is: "The competitor is our 
friend; the consumer is our enemy." They could add to that another 
one: The politician is our lackey; the public is our sucker.<p>

<h2>Fatheads at FDA Opposing Best Interests of Fat Americans</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><b><i> Michael Fumento</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Unless you've been living in outer space or under a rock lately, 
you've noticed that our country has a serious problem with obesity. We 
are the fattest nation on earth. A recent British government report 
launched front-page headlines after it declared that if present trends 
continue 25% of British women and 18% of British men will be obese, 
meaning they are at least 20% fatter  than they should be. But in the 
United States already 35% women and 31% men are obese.  One 
contributing factor may be the faithful watchdogs of the Food and Drug 
Administration.<p>

Make no mistake, drugs are not the answer to the national problem.  
For some individuals, however, they have proven quite useful, 
especially one called dexfenfluramine. This is where our story begins.
<p>
Dexfenfluramine is no wonder drug.  Unlike the mercilessly hyped 
hormonal agent that you heard about in July, it doesn't promise that 
you can stuff your face till kingdom come and still maintain a figure 
that would put Kate Moss to shame.  On the other hand, dexfenfluramine 
works.<p>

At the September meeting, manufacturer Interneuron Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. said its drug helped 40 percent of patients in a study lose up to 
10 percent of their body weight, twice the amount lost with diet 
alone. Myriad other studies conducted over many years have shown the 
drug to be an effective weight-loss tool for those who really want and 
need it.<p>

Other studies, however, showed that when dexfenfluramine is given in 
ultra-high doses to animals, it can permanently alter their brain 
chemicals. But the level at which it causes this damage is 10 to 20 
times higher than that which humans receive.<p>

Nevertheless, in late September, an eight-member FDA panel voted 5-3 
against recommending approval of the drug for use in the United 
States. After some members left, those remaining voted 3-2 in favor of 
the drug but an FDA spokeswoman said the second vote could not be 
official and so a second meeting was ordered for November.<p>

In its caution, the FDA panel refused to weigh the slight possibility 
of harm of the drug versus the very real harm caused by obesity. It 
has been linked to heart disease, cancer, arthritis, gallbladder 
disease, gout, and a host of other nasties that includes even 
blindness.  The government estimates that 300,000 Americans will die 
prematurely from obesity this year, the second leading lifestyle-
related cause of death after cigarettes.<p>

Moreover, it's not like rats are our only guinea pigs, so to speak.  
More than a million people in more than 50 other countries are already 
using the drug. In some European countries they've had access to it 
for a decade.<p>

The refusal to approve this drug is just the latest example of the 
overweaning paternalism that characterized the FDA for many years but 
has now become quite onerous under current Commissioner David Kessler. 
It's not Kessler's fault that no new anti-obesity drug has been 
introduced in the last 22 years into this country that's splitting its 
collective seams, but it will be his fault if this amazing streak 
continues.<p>

But aren't there other drugs that can be used in the meantime? Yes, 
the second fiddle appears to be a combination of two drugs, 
phentermine and fenfluramine.  These, too, have been shown to be safe 
and effective. Like dexfenfluramine, however, they are treatments and 
not cures. The weight lost with them comes back at you like a steam 
train the day you stop taking them. But the FDA in its wisdom only 
allows doctors to prescribe them for three months.  In other words, as 
soon you get your weight down to a healthful level, as soon as you've 
glimpsed the towers of the Land of Oz, everything is taken from you.<p>

But how about those over-the-counter pills, phenylpropanolamine 
hydrochloride, mercifully shortened to "PPA." They appear to burn off 
about half a pound a week (though this amount can easily be 
overwhelmed by compensatory eating of even half a cheeseburger a day) 
but were shown much more effective when combined with caffeine.<p>

Indeed, caffeine itself has been shown repeatedly to speed up the 
metabolism and at high enough levels, especially when combined with 
ephedrine and small amounts of aspirin, to slowly induce weight loss--
again, unless the dieter ups his or her calorie intake even slightly.<p>

But amazingly, in 1991 the FDA placed caffeine on its list of 
ingredients banned from diet aids as being ineffective.<p>

What the heck is going on here? Is the FDA staffed at the highest 
levels by men who are into fat women?  Or women who are into fat men?  
Probably not.<p>

Instead, this is probably just another example of the FDA's obsessive 
paternalism and love of bureaucracy. I just happen to know about these 
abuses of authority and sanity because I happen to be writing a book 
on obesity. Were I writing a book on tennis elbow, I could probably 
rattle off for you how myriad examples of how the FDA impedes those 
seeking relief from that problem.<p>

Judith Stern of the American Obesity Association said that if the FDA 
panel recommends no on dexfenfluramine, "these doctors ought to be 
shot." That's a bit harsh.  How about we just force feed them until 
their shirt buttons pop off and they start developing that list of 
nasties that comes with obesity. A little bit of empathy never hurt 
anyone.<p>

<h2>Crime Study Doesn't Show Racism</h2>

One in three young black men is serving a criminal sentence, according 
to a new report that has received wide media coverage. Depending on 
your perspective, the timing couldn't have been more ironic or more 
fitting, coming as it did on the heels of the "not guilty" verdict in 
the O.J. Simpson case.
                                   <P>
Could this be what Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran was talking about 
when he urged the jury to "send a message"?  Was the message that 
blacks are tired of blacks behind bars?
                <P>
There are certainly a lot there, though perhaps not as many as you 
might think from the news stories. In the report, the Sentencing 
Project, an advocacy group that favors alternatives to prison, 
estimates that on any given day 32 percent of black men ages 20 to 29 
are serving a criminal sentence. 
                                                                             <P>
That's 827,400 young black men. But what most of the news stories 
didn't tell you was that the majority were not behind bars but on 
probation or parole. If you don't think that's an important 
distinction, then you've never been in jail or prison and have never 
talked to anybody who has.
                                                                 <P>
The Sentencing Project study quite deliberately blurs this 
distinction, as when it says that "about 3/4 of all offenders under 
supervision have been convicted of a non-violent offense." True, but a 
1991 Department of Justice survey of state prison inmates found that 
of those actually incarcerated, half had committed violent crimes and 
fully 94% had either committed a violent crime or had received a 
previous criminal sentence.  
                                                  <P>
It's a good thing that the Sentencing Project didn't actually focus 
just on prison sentences, because the reality is that they have become 
a joke. Consider the four original suspects in the killing of British 
tourist Gary Colley at a Florida rest stop two years ago. One already 
had at least 56 prior arrests by the age of 13; another had more than 
30 arrests and a third had at least two dozen. The 13-year-old was 
released for lack of evidence and most recently was arrested for 
kidnaping and robbing a pizza deliverer at gunpoint.
                                         <P>
But the media reporting on the Sentencing Project study didn't go into 
any of this. Nor did the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he cited it at his 
"Million Man March" speech. Instead they concentrated on the disparity 
between black and white sentencing, noting that only 6.7% of 20-29-
year-old whites were ending up on the wrong side of the law.
                                <P>
To its credit, the study did not simply scream about racism, although 
the media attempted to portray it that way. It doesn't accuse all 
cops, or judges for that matter, of being Mark Fuhrmans. Rather, it 
says, the great majority of the increase in sentencing for blacks in 
recent years has come about because of a disproportionate emphasis on 
jailing those involved with crack cocaine usage.
                      <P>
Crack cocaine, it notes, is far more of a black problem than is powder 
cocaine, therefore discriminating against crack users and dealers 
means discriminating against blacks.
              <P>
But there is good reason to discriminate between types of cocaine. 
Several studies have concluded, as did that of Rutgers University 
researchers Kolin Chin and Jeffrey Fagan, that "arrest and conviction 
data suggest that violence and participation in drug selling are more 
strongly associated with crack than with cocaine [powder].
                                                      <P>
"The evidence is quite clear," American Enterprise Association 
Resident Scholar Doug Besharov told me. "Crack is a more addictive, 
violence-creating drug than is powder cocaine. Period."
                                             <P>
Further, the charge of drug possession is often used when the offender 
has committed other crimes that are much more serious but harder to 
prove. It is also often used in plea-bargaining cases, wherein the 
accused agrees to plead guilty to the least serious offense with which 
he has been charged.
                                  <P>
Besharov says, "There's no doubt that crack has assaulted the black 
community." Indeed, so have black criminals. Ninety percent of their 
victims are black themselves. White liberal do-gooders such as make up 
most of the staff at the Sentencing Project have little to fear if we 
slacken our efforts at criminal enforcement.
                         <P>
There's no doubt there's something pathologically wrong in a society 
in which a third of the members of the second-largest race are 
involved in the criminal justice system.  Throwing young men in prison 
or putting them on probation or parole doesn't solve this problem. The 
ultimate solution lies in getting rid of government programs that 
break down the family, like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, 
in improving the quality of public schools, in fostering a culture of 
personal responsibility and in no longer blaming racism for every 
black problem.
    <P>
So long as business as usual goes on in the black inner-cities, they 
will produce vast numbers of criminals and many of these will wind up 
in the penal system. And business as usual, it is.  After the O.J. 
Simpson verdict, one Nation of Islam leader called on Simpson to 
become an active symbol for the nation's troubled black youth. Jesse 
Jackson gushed, "O.J. can now be a big force, in my judgment, in 
taking the lead against domestic violence."
                                                         <P>
Egad! And John Wayne Gacy should have opened a home for wayward boys 
while Jeffrey Dahmer should have become president of the National

No, putting away young black men doesn't cure the problem. But until 
we're willing to apply the cure, it can keep the problem from becoming 
that much worse.

<h2>Population Action Tells a Fish Story about Fish Supply </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

 
 

"A burgeoning population and the growing demand for seafood may make 
fish unavailable to nearly a billion of the world's poor in the next 
century, says a new report." If you read USA Today or any number of 
other papers that carried a similar story, you probably believe that. 
Which is too bad because the report, issued by the pro-population 
control Population Action International is just one big, well, fish 
story.
 <P>
There's one huge problem with the report.  See if you can pick it out 
by reading between the lines of report co-author Robert Engelman. 
"We're up against the wall," he said. "Since the end of the  80s, 
we've been catching the same amount of wild fish around the world, 
[but] there are about 90 million more people every year."
               <P>
Did you notice the qualifying word: "wild"?  Yes, the statement is 
true for wild fish but completely ignores the role of farmed fish, 
called "aquaculture."  Looking at data provided in a 1995 United 
Nations Food and Agricultural Organization publication, "The State of 
World Fisheries and Aquaculture," we see that for the earliest year 
provided (1984) there were 51,105 thousand tons of wild fish caught 
with 6,933 thousand tons raised on farms.  Wild fish capture peaked 
out in 1989 and has dropped slightly to 56,470 thousand tons by 1993, 
but aquaculture continued growing like gangbusters to 15,800 tons by 
1993.
     <P>
Cmbining both types of fish, there was far from a decline but rather a 
24% increase in the nine-year period, fueled by a 128% growth in 
aquaculture. At the same time world population increased by only 16%. 
Unless you just happen to hate fish, that's a mighty nice "wall" we're 
up against. Far from running out of the slimy things, we're 
practically swimming in them.
                    <P>
Unfortunately, neither USA Today nor some of the other papers that 
carried the story bothered to mention aquaculture. In fact, nobody who 
carried the story allowed any criticism of the report at all.
                              <P>
The Population Action International study does mention the growing 
aquaculture industry, saying it "compensates somewhat for declines in 
fish catches." It even depicts a chart showing its phenomenal growth. 
But it downplays the industry, saying "Cultivation of fish has so far 
proven too costly to provide large amounts of food to poor people."
   <P>
But the aforementioned U.N. publication, using the same data as 
Population Action International, says otherwise. "The balance of 31 
million tons in the supplies of food fish required by the year 2010 
would have to come from aquaculture, which has been expanding at a 
rate of one million tons a year, increasing to almost two million tons 
in 1993." Meanwhile, to continue feeding the world at the same rate 
would require "an overall average annual increase of less than one 
million tons a year."
            <P>
While Population Action says, "There is little prospect for major 
expansion of aquaculture in Africa, the U.N. report says aquaculture's 
phenomenal "growth should continue, recognizing the SIGNIFICANT 
POTENTIAL OF INCREASED FARMED FISH PRODUCTION IN AFRICA and Latin 
America." (Emphasis mine.)
                         <P>
Yet, the real powerhouse could be the United States. So far all of 
North America produces only 3.7% of the world's aquaculture.  The 
United States produces less than a 16th of China's output. The reason 
is that Americans are not big fish eaters and that, exactly opposite 
of what Population Action is telling us, those who are big fish eaters 
are finding or growing a plentiful supply. But if that ever changes, 
America's ingenious farming know-how combined with abundant lakes and 
waterways will combine to make us not just the breadbasket but also 
the fishbasket of the world.
                                    <P>
What we're seeing is a rapid transition from depending on wild fish to 
raising our own which parallels civilization's movement from hunting 
and gathering to husbanding animals and raising crops. The very reason 
that fish farming is catching on so rapidly is that it is so much 
cheaper and more efficient than setting out in boats and hoping for 
good fortune. Less romantic perhaps, but them's the breaks.
                                               <P>
The problem with all the population control groups and individual 
gurus like Paul Ehrlich is that they first decided they were against 
population growth and have spent the entire time since then trying to 
find evidence to justify their position, rather than forming their 
position based on the evidence. The result has been a stream of 
nonsense that essentially began with Ehrlich's 1968 book The 
Population Bomb which told us that "the battle to feed humanity is 
over."
                                                        <P>
In fact, except for the occasional politically-inspired famine such as 
Ethiopia's, humanity is much better fed today than it was in 1968. 
Man's ingenuity in providing new food supplies has readily outpaced 
his growth in population growth.  Now, even as population growth is 
already slowing on its own, we're beginning a new era of genetically-
designed foods that will make even progress to date look anemic.
                                                                    <P>
 My advice to the population controllers:  If you don't like having 
more people around in  the same sense a lot of American just don't 
like eating fish, then simply say so. Quit concocting false evidence 
to scare everyone who doesn't share your taste.
                                                                             <P>
As for the rest of us, just ask any mermaid you happen to see, "What's 
a big fib?" "The Population Action study."

<title>Fumento:  (W.R.) Grace Under Fire--For All the Wrong Reasons </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>(W.R.) Grace Under Fire--For All the Wrong Reasons </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

It's clearly a case of Grace under fire.  No, not the popular 
television show, but the Florida-based company W.R. Grace, the world's largest maker of speciality chemicals. Doing the firing is an activist group called the Foundation for Economic Trends (FET), headed up by the vociferous Jeremy Rifkin. Rifkin is leading a coalition of some of 200 groups and brandishing a petition signed by 100,000 Indian citizens.
<p>
Why the fuss?  To understand, you have to know a little about 
something called a neem tree.
<p>
The neem tree grows in a number of countries with tropical climates, 
but is especially plentiful and revered in India. Scientists call it 
one of the most helpful plants on earth, while Indians consider it 
sacred, calling it "the curer of all ailments." Its bark, leaves, 
flowers, and seeds are used to treat a variety of illnesses including 
leprosy, diabetes, ulcers, and skin disorders. The twigs are used as 
an antiseptic toothbrush while the seed oil is used to make toothpaste 
and soap. Oil from the seeds is a potent spermicide. The powdered 
leaves are used for facial cream.
<p>
In short, the neem appears to do everything but take your pulse and 
check your blood pressure. 
<p>
But what most appeals to the folks at W.R. Grace is that oil from the 
seeds is a powerful insecticide, repelling more than 200 species of 
bugs. The oil has long been used as such by Indians, but in its 
natural state the pesticide properties begin to decay within a matter 
of weeks or even days. Grace has developed a way of making this 
natural pesticide available to everyone by stabilizing it, thereby 
extending its shelf life for two years or more. The company has 
received a patent for the process.
<p>
"Foul!" cries Rifkin, who calls the patent "genetic colonialism" and 
is trying to get it revoked. "What we have here in broad terms," he 
told me, "is the beginning of worldwide discussion on who should 
control the gene pool."
<p>
I tried very hard to extract a valid point from Mr. Rifkin but failed.<p>  
First, he admitted that Grace's actions in securing a patent using 
Third World resources is hardly new or exceptional, but is just 
another case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic 
resources."
<p>
It's a bizarre accusation. Nobody should "control the gene pool," 
obviously, and Grace isn't trying. It didn't apply for a patent on the 
neem tree or its seeds or the oil from the seeds. The patent was for a 
process. To deny its patent because it involves a living thing is like 
saying someone can't get a patent for building a better mousetrap 
because the base of the mousetrap is made from wood.
<p>
Under U.S. law, a process or substance or invention may receive a 
patent--which is a temporary right of exclusive use and production--if 
it is novel, useful, and not obvious. You cannot therefore patent a 
gene, either here or abroad, since genes have always been around. <p>What 
you can do is patent a process you have developed using those genes or 
their product--in this case the oil from seeds.
<p>
All Grace's patent restricts is the ability to use the same 
stabilization method they have used. It doesn't even apply to 
extraction or processing of the neem extract prior to stabilization.  
<p>Nor does it even apply in India, since U.S. patent law doesn't extend 
there.
<p>
Rifkin says Grace's process isn't really even novel and that the 
patent should have been denied on that basis alone. Fine, let the 
Patent Office decide that.
<p>
Thus the "genetic" part of Rifkin's charge is obviously just a straw 
man.
<p>
What apparently rankles him is that some fat-cat Western company--no 
doubt headed up by porcine cigar-chompers--is once again exploiting 
Third World wealth. Rifkin complained to me that this was just another 
case of "northern countries" exploiting "native genetic resources."
<p>
The neem tree happens to be a convenient vehicle for his anti-
corporate crusade.
<p>
"Rifkin has cleverly picked an emotional issue because it's a 
religious tree in a Third World country," Says Henry Miller, a senior 
research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford, California and 
a former FDA official.
<p>
But again, the colonialism charge just doesn't stick with Grace.
<p>
Some 22 companies have obtained patents regarding the neem tree, of 
which three are Indian. Grace buys its neem seeds on the open market 
and purchases less than three percent of the crop, which is 
unfortunate since 84% of the neem crop falls to the ground unharvested 
and simply rots.  Grace's Indian operation is run through an Indian 
holding firm, of which Grace is just a minority owner.
<p>
If this is the best one can do these days in ferreting out Ugly 
Americans, we Americans must be pretty handsome these days.
<p>
Rifkin and the FET are right that just because something CAN be done 
doesn't mean it SHOULD be done.  We need industry watchdogs like FET. 
<p>But there are no real ethical issues involved here, much less any of 
the Brave New World variety that FET likes to talk about. 
<p>
There's just a tree, with some really terrific products to offer, and 
one American company that isn't about to let its nationality get in 
the way of offering them.

<P> 
FOX RIVER GROVE, ILLINOIS--
 
It's called "Seven Angels Crossing" now.  As I write this, it's still 
blocked off.  Wreaths of flowers lie next to a light pole at the 
track. Marquees in the area express the sentiments of local 
businesses: "Our thoughts are with you," "Our prayers go out to you," 
"Pray for the families," "Seven angels, now in heaven." And everywhere 
there are the blue and white ribbons that used to simply be the colors 
of Cary-Grove High School but now mean so much more.
<p>
In late October, a commuter train slammed into a bus here, killing 
five children more or less immediately.  Two more died in the 
hospital.  To say that everyone in the towns of Cary and Fox River 
Grove was touched by the killings sounds cliche, yet it is true. I 
have friends here.  Their own children are too young to be in high 
school, but the boy across the street from them was killed and the 
brother of a girl who plays with their children was injured.
<p>
And everyone is asking the same question: "Why?"
<p>
Current attention is focusing on the signal lights at the crossing, 
and the crossing itself. It turns out that in the two-year period 
before the accident, some 45 complaints were filed with Illinois and 
railroad transportation officials over the crossing and the lights, 
though whether that proves an exceptional number has yet to be seen.
<p>
If it turns out it was an unusually hazardous crossing yet nothing was 
done about it, this will prove to a great extent to be business as 
usual. If there's one thing I've learned about Americans' attitudes 
towards risk in the years I've written about the subject, it is that 
they don't really understand it.  The relationship between that which 
we should fear and that which we do fear is often tenuous at best.  
This goes likewise for expenditures to reduce risks.
<p>
Thus, for example, under a 1991 EPA drinking water regulation, we 
spend $653 million per premature death averted.  A 1988 hazardous 
waste land disposal ban of the EPA costs $4.19 BILLION. An asbestos 
occupational exposure limit laid down in 1986 cost business $71 
million per life while one for arsenic cost $74 million.
<p>
These are not the highest figures I could find, nor the lowest. 
Suffice to say that saving lives through environmental regulation is 
routinely measured in the millions per person.
<p>
By comparison, expenditures that would prevent accidental deaths come 
relatively cheap.  Since we don't know yet what went wrong here in Fox 
River Grove, we can't put a price on fixing it.  But a Harvard Center 
for Risk Analysis publication puts the price of installing flashing 
lights at railway crossings that don't yet have them at a mere 
$733,523 per life saved. Add gates to that and you're still looking at 
only $787,267.  
<p>
"It is an enigma," Book of Risks author Larry Laudan told me, that a 
society that allows so many risky activities in terms of accidents 
will, "at the same time, demand the expenditures of tens of billions 
of dollars [over $115 billion, actually] annually on pollution control 
measures."  Drunk drivers alone, Laudan said, "do far more harm in 
producing injuries and death than ALL known sources of pollution. The 
ultimate irony is that it is not even clear that pollution abatement 
efforts always do much good."
<p>
The explanation, perhaps, says Laudan, "is the remarkable success of 
the environmental movement in persuading us that pollution is one of 
the principal killers of Americans."
<p>
He also cites "the unthinking fear that invisible dangers induce.  
Like radiation, pollution generally cannot be seen or felt.  By 
contrast, most causes of accidents are tangible and palpable--even 
familiar.  Psychologists repeatedly have shown that this sort of 
familiarity breeds indifference, if not contempt."
<p>
Often we find out too late that society's familiarity and contempt 
becomes the undoing of us or our loved ones.  I found out three years 
ago when my car went careening off a cliff just south of Big Sur on 
California's notorious Pacific Coast Highway.  The car rolled several 
times before coming to a halt 350 feet down, just short of the rocks 
at the edge of the water. Despite wearing a seat belt, my girlfriend 
broke her skull and neck and I was told she would probably die.  I 
didn't feel so good myself.
<p>
The good news is that we both survived and are doing fine, thank you.  
The bad news is that when I went back to the accident site I found it 
marked by a cross for a young man whose car had also gone over but who 
hadn't been so lucky.
<p>
When I inquired at the state Department of Transportation to find out 
how much a guardrail at this literal dead man's curve would have cost, 
I was told $1,000. But in this, the most environmentally conscious and 
most environmental regulation-happy state in the country, there was no 
$1,000 to spare for a guard rail.
<p>
Of course, environmental regulatory costs are buried--passed on to 
private businesses--while guard rails require explicit tax 
expenditures. But eventually, we pay for both
<p>
A rich country can afford adequate rail crossings, guard rails, and 
good environmental laws.  But no country can afford indiscriminate 
spending inspired by political activists instead of by careful cost-
benefit analyses. Let's stop finding out the hard way what our 
priorities should be. I know seven sets of parents whom I think would 
want it that way.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Delaney Clause is Nostalgia We Can't Afford</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><i>11/20/95</i><hr><h2>Delaney Clause is Nostalgia We Can't Afford</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a></center><hr>
<P>
What would you say if your city's housing code dwelled at great length 
on the sturdiness and structure of thatched roofs? What if vehicle 
regulations required blinders on your automobile so that it doesn't 
shy when an emergency vehicle passes by?
<p>
If you like those ideas, you'd love the federal Delaney Clause.
<p>
The Delaney Clause prohibits any measurable residue (from, say, 
pesticides) that has been found to cause cancer in either animals or 
man, in any processed food. Back in 1958, when it was passed as part 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it seemed to make sense. 
But just as "Married with Children" humor has replaced that of "Leave 
it to Beaver" (sigh), science has long since passed by Delaney.
<p>
That's in part because back when Delaney was passed, residues could 
only be measured in parts per thousand. Now they can be measured in 
parts per trillion and sometimes even in parts per quintillion. Let's 
say you detect a part per quadrillion in a plum product. That's the 
equivalent of one plum in 73,511,000 tons.
<p>
Delaney is also outdated because it greatly preceded the use of 
maximum tolerated dose testing in laboratory animals which didn't get 
going in earnest until the late 1960s. Under such testing, about half 
of all chemicals--both natural and synthetic--have caused tumors, 
which makes them verboten under Delaney.
<p>
Critics say this makes such testing useless, because it can't possibly 
be that half of everything is carcinogenic.
<p>
The fact that the natural world is full of rodent carcinogens makes 
Delaney "absurd," says pre-eminent Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames.
<p>
"There are a thousand chemicals in a cup of coffee. Twenty-six have 
been tested and 19 have already proven positive, leaving about a 
thousand left to test," Ames told me. "The FDA would be laughed at if 
it tried to keep coffee from being added to ice cream. But there's no 
reason to think it's really a hazard."
<p>
In any case, decades after Delaney was passed, this rodent testing 
became its backbone.
<p>
Congress in 1958 could no more have predicted these new developments 
than the Continental Congress could have predicted the advent of 
warplanes, yet nobody claims we need to be restricted by language in 
the Constitution which only allows funding for an Army and a Navy. 
<p>
In addition to allowing natural rodent carcinogens while banning 
synthetic ones, Delaney encompasses another double standard.
<p>
First, more recent legislation does allow rodent carcinogens in 
unprocessed food, so long as the level is low enough under a certain 
formula to qualify as a "negligible risk." A fresh fruit could have a 
10 parts per billion of a pesticide and be allowed but if it's turned 
into a sauce or juice it might have only 1 part per billion and be 
banned.
<p>
But, some might argue, if Delaney has worked to date, why fix it if it 
ain't broke? In fact, it's always been broken but ignored. Because of 
the outrageousness of actually applying it, the EPA has simply chosen 
not to. But that's about to change because of a lawsuit the Natural 
Resources Defense Council won against the Agency, forcing strict 
compliance with the legislation.
<p>
Now, like it or not, the EPA has no choice but to ban 85 uses of 38 
different pesticide active ingredients. According to the Washington, 
D.C.-based non-profit research group National Center for Food and 
Agricultural Policy (NCFAP), this could result in increased production 
costs of $175 million over the next year and $212 million per year 
after that. The crops most affected would be potatoes, apples, and 
sugarcane, which account for 55% of the total potential costs. Look 
for your grocery bill to go up accordingly.
<p>
Said NCFAP Senior Research Associate Leonard P. Gianessi, ". . . the 
risks of the Delaney-listed pesticide uses are negligible, while the 
economic benefits that they provide are estimated to be $400 million 
per year."
<p>
The Delaney Clause was always too simplistic for its own good. 
Explains environmentalist and University of California biologist 
Garret Hardin, "The Delaney Act was passed because congressmen are old 
men. They are afraid of cancer. Because they're scared, they wanted 
zero tolerance. They did not get any scientific advice.  
Environmentalists who are scientists would never support a zero 
tolerance level for anything."
<p>
That's why even such ardent cheerleaders for pesticide regulation as 
regulation as New York Mt. Sinai pediatrician Dr. Phillip Landrigan 
and Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) have called for its 
replacement by something more workable.
<p>
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) has introduced a bill which would 
implement recommendations by the National Research Council, including 
a "negligible risk" standard for both processed and raw foods. This 
determination would be made by the EPA Administrator, assisted by a 
newly-created science review panel.
<p>
Current EPA Administrator Carol Browner has already agreed in 
principle to such a scheme.
<p>
Make no mistake. Nostalgia is a great thing within limits, and here's 
to bringing back "Leave it to Beaver"-type shows in prime time while 
pulling the handle on the toilet in which "Married with Children" 
swims. But when the health and safety of people are concerned, our 
regulations need to reflect present the latest scientific evidence, 
not the state of the art from 1958.

<P>
 "In California, everything is so-o-o-o touchy feeling," [sic] said 
actress and comedienne Tracey Ullman, in explaining why she was moving 
herself and her daughter back to the United Kingdom. "They are into 
this silly outcome-based education where it doesn't matter if she  
knew HOW to spell her name as long as she knew WHO she was.  And it 
didn't matter if she KNEW that two plus two was four as long as she 
had enough self-confidence to ASK how to get  to the conclusion of the 
problem.' What a crock! She was going to end up as a dumb as a 
mudflap. Had to get her out."
<p>
Europeans have long made fun of two major American products, its beer 
and its education. But we're making great progress--with our beer. 
Education, however, continues to decay, with our students routinely 
rating themselves among the highest in the world while scoring  among 
the poorest.
<p>
The latest indication came with National Assessment of  Educational 
Progress scores recently released showing that "don't know much about 
history" has gone from being the line of a song to being the American 
national anthem.  Only 11% of seniors, 14% of eighth graders and 17% 
of fourth graders are considered "proficient" in U.S. history.  
They're comparative geniuses when it comes to geography though, with 
31% of the seniors proficient.
<p>
Some defenders of the students' performance claim the questions were 
really tough. Sure, like the one that asked whether New York, 
California, Illinois, or Texas was one of the 13 original colonies.  
Thirty-two percent of fourth-graders got that right.
<p>
Of course, 200  years is a long time ago.  So another question asked 
which conflict--World War I, World War II, the Mexican-American War, 
or Vietnam--was fought to contain communism.  Even fewer fourth-
graders got that cranium-cracker.
<p>
Sadly, test scores have been in decline for decades now, and to place 
the blame entirely on anything new is somewhat unfair.  But they were 
SUPPOSED to be getting better.  Blame it on  "outcome-based 
education."
<p>
Sounds harmless, doesn't it? In fact, Ullman's summary was amazingly 
void of hyperbole. "Outcome-based education" is a stealth term.
<p>
"It was a hijacking of the idea that schools should have been made 
more accountable but it made them less," author Charles Sykes told me 
in an interview. "Some conservative reformers in the 1980s began 
saying schools should be judged on the basis of outcome instead of 
inputs. Lots of governors and legislators bought into it only later to 
find out it was holistic healing and environmental stewardship."
<p>
Sykes's newest book is a hard critique of outcome-based education 
called Dumbing Down Uur Kids: Why America's Children Feel Good About 
Themselves but Can't Read, Write, or Add.  
<p>
The book is replete with chilling "scenes from the front." Thus, 
hearing about the poor history scores is hardly shocking after reading 
that in the upscale Denver suburb of Littleton a principal freely 
admitted that it was not important for students to learn any specific 
historical fact, including the ability to define either the Holocaust 
or World War II. 
<p>
Naturally such "educators" aren't too keen on tests and grading. Many 
outcome based school districts have abolished traditional grading 
entirely, replacing it instead with such as "C" for "consistently," 
"S" for "sometimes" and "N" for "not yet."
<p>
Nationally we have seen the best indicator of the increasing dumbness 
of our children simply erased.  Last year the administrators of the 
SAT pushed up the scoring standard so that scores just above 400 would 
now be pushed up to 500. In one fell swoop, the ability to compare 
today's student scores with those of their predecessors was destroyed.
<p>
It's also now possible to get a perfect SAT score without getting all 
the answers correct.
<p>
"Recognizing they were under more scrutiny to raise academic 
standards," Sykes told me, OBE administrators "have simply decided to 
make the standards unmeasurable.  A lot of schools are abolishing them 
and others are making everyone a winner."
<p>
Thus many Colorado schools have multiple valedictorians, with Boulder 
High School producing an amazing 26. And to think poor, inner-city 
schools can only afford one.
<p>
OBE also incorporates the self-esteem movement that has been around 
for decades. In theory, since high self-esteem and doing well are 
linked, by increasing self-esteem we can increase performance.  But 
Sykes points out that they're probably putting the proverbial cart 
before the, that it's success that drives self-esteem and not the 
other way around.
<p>
The self-esteem obsession is not only a waste but probably 
detrimental, he says. "If having kids feel good is top priority, you 
will be afraid to ask too much of them. In the long run this is a 
fraud because kids eventually hit reality like a brick wall, in 
college or the work world."
<p>
But Sykes believes there will be an education revolution.
<p>
"Public opinion is pretty clear," he says. "And OBE is taking schools 
in exactly the opposite direction. Add to this that the stakes are 
higher than ever since kids need to be better educated than they used 
to be.  Old factory jobs no longer exist.  The education 
establishment's response to all this is denial, vilification of 
critics, and circling of the wagons. To me that's a description of an 
institution that's ready to collapse.
<p>
Let's just hope it happens before all our kids are dumber than 
mudflaps.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  Ignored Report Says EPA Wrong on Passive Smoking </title></head>

<i>12/7/95</i><hr><h2>Ignored Report Says EPA Wrong on Passive Smoking </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>

With a man who had torched three buildings  running around Boulder, 
Colorado city police were following smoke trails.  They caught their 
man, and he now faces a fine of $1,000 or 90 days in jail.  No, the 
perpetrator wasn't the arsonist (who was caught that same day); he was 
the owner of a bar  and a violator of Boulder's new anti-smoking law, 
one of the most draconian in the country.
<P>
The Boulder law goes way beyond mandating separate areas for smokers.  
Essentially it demands that smokers be kept away from non-smokers in 
hermetically-sealed rooms, as if they were the germ featured in the 
1971 movie The Andromeda Strain.  But a new report by the 
Congressional Research Service (CRS) finds that the basis for it, as 
well as all the other anti-smoking laws which have swept the country 
since December of 1992, is scientifically bankrupt.
<P>
This refutes a much-publicized 1992 study, conducted by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which claimed as many as 3,000 
Americans die each year of lung cancer from somebody else's cigarette 
smoke. The EPA based its findings on a combined study (called a meta-
analysis) of 11 separate studies, which between them found 119 lung 
cancers among non-smoking spouses of smokers where 100 would be 
expected. Epidemiologists call this a "risk ratio" of 1.19. 
<P>
At the time, many people including myself criticized the EPA report, 
saying that such a small apparently increased risk (so tiny, in fact, 
that the medical community has rejected much larger ratios as being 
conclusive on other potential carcinogens) that the tiniest problem 
could throw the whole thing off.
<P>
We also questioned the EPA's use of a 90% confidence interval, meaning 
that there was a 10% possibility the results had been arrived at by 
chance.  The gold standard in epidemiology has always been a 95% 
confidence interval, leaving only a 5% possibility of a result 
occurring by chance.  Curiously, the Agency rejected that, in what 
appeared to be a rigging of the results. It was like moving the goal 
post to the three yard line because the football had fallen two yards 
short of a touchdown.
<P>
The new CRS report, which you're hearing about probably for the first 
time here because with the sole exception of the Washington Times (and 
an editorial in Investor's Business Daily) the media decided you 
didn't need to know about it, says we were right and the EPA was 
wrong.
<P>
 That report was produced in response to a proposed Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration ruling that would ban smoking in 
federal workplaces.  It found no basis for such a ban.
<P>
Instead, it said the EPA's meta-analysis showed that, "Even when 
overall risk is considered, it is a very small risk and is not 
statistically significant at the 95% level."
<P>
The CRS also analyzed four other recent passive smoking studies.  Of 
them, only one--by Dr. Elizabeth Fontham--showed a significant 
increased risk.  Two others showed no higher risk and a third showed 
only a slight, statistically insignificant risk.
<P>
As is, that's something of a wash.  But even the Fontham study may not 
actually show an increased risk, said the CRS.  This is because of 
something called "smoker misclassification."  Surveys show that some 
people who claim to be nonsmokers are actually current or former 
smokers.  The EPA has recognized this phenomenon and has built in a 
small safety margin to account for it in the Fontham study.  But 
evidence indicates this safety factor was probably too small, and CRS 
says "a small adjustment could render the overall Fontham  results 
statistically insignificant at the 95% level."
<P>
So the only truly significant positive study would have been rendered 
insignificant.
<P>
Moreover, the CRS noted that the other three studies didn't allow for 
unidentified smokers. Had they done so, the lack of evidence for 
smoking's hazards to innocent bystanders would have been even more 
obvious.   
<P>
The ultimate purpose of the campaign that culminated in the EPA report 
was never to protect non-smokers but to harass and intimidate smokers 
themselves into quitting.  Now it could be said that smokers were in 
effect not just hurting themselves but murdering non-smokers.  So what 
if it's not true?  The end--getting active smokers to quit--justifies 
the means.  Right?
<P>
Such paternalism is obnoxious.  Anybody with two brain cells to rub 
together knows that smoking is harmful and can be fatal. More than a 
hundred years before the famous 1964 surgeon general's report, 
cigarettes were known as "coffin nails." Smokers may be irrational, 
but irrationality within limits is protected in our society.
<P>
Meanwhile, where does such paternalism end?  One of the arresting 
officers in Boulder, a female, was quite corpulent.  (Trendy towns 
like Boulder are willing to overlook beefy cops if it means beefing up 
the number of female officers on the force.) Obesity is considered to 
cause 300,000 premature deaths a year, 100 times the EPA estimate for 
lung cancers caused by passive smoking.  Perhaps that officer should 
arrest the next waiter who puts a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo before 
her.  "Boy, you in a heap  o trouble for heapin' that pasta so high!"
<P>
Perhaps I shouldn't give them any ideas.

<i>12/13/95</i><hr><h2>The Long Suppressed Truth About AIDS</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
You've heard it over and over in the media: AIDS is "an equal 
opportunity destroyer" that threatens all Americans "without 
discriminating."  Now a new study in Science magazine shows an 
epidemic both smaller than the government has claimed--and one that 
clearly does discriminate.
<P>
The media treated it as quite a revelation.  In fact, as we shall see, 
this same vital information was available seven years ago and was 
deliberately suppressed.
<P>
The Science study, by NCI statistician Phil Rosenberg, shows a 
tremendous disparity between infected groups. For example, while as of 
January 1993, only one in 2,000 American white females between the 
ages of 18 and 59 was living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, one 
in 204 white males was.  For black females the rate is one in 135, 
while black males have the highest infection rate of all at one in 44. 
Hispanics fall somewhere between, with one in 294 females and one in 
69 males.
<P>
While Rosenberg's data don't look at risk factors, the explanation for 
the disparities is that male homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse 
(which is primarily male) continue to account for the vast majority of 
new infections.
<P>
Rosenberg's calculations also put to the lie the official government 
estimate of one million current infections.  He finds instead a range 
of 630,000 to 897,000 American living with the virus. 
<P>
To come up with these figures, Rosenberg used a technique called 
backcalculation.  It simply requires looking at the number of current 
AIDS cases and then calculates back from them to when the infections 
must have taken place.  From there it projects a trend line.
<P>
It's such a simple technique that you may be wondering why it took 
somebody so long to apply it to AIDS.  And the answer is that it 
didn't.  Joel Hay, then of the Hoover Institution and now the head of 
the Department of Pharmaceutical Economics at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, first applied backcalculation to the epidemic 
in 1988.  The figures he came up with, allowing for new infections in 
the years since,  are in the same ballpark as Rosenberg's figures.  
Hay's estimate was that there were as few as 500,000 infections at the 
time.
<P>
Hay's calculations were so appealingly simple and straightforward that 
I didn't hesitate to use them in my 1990 book, The Myth of 
Heterosexual AIDS.  But when Hay presented his data to the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) at the international 
AIDS conference in Stockholm in 1988, the agency wanted nothing to do 
with them. 
<P>
At that time the CDC's official estimate was 1 to 1.5 million 
infections, which the media regularly shortened to "as many as 1.5 
million."  Ignoring Hay, the CDC relied on calculations by other 
modelers which had so many variables that they were virtual Rube 
Goldberg devices on paper.
<P>
That may have been part of their attraction.  Bureaucrats loathe 
simplicity.  But clearly a factor in the  CDC's decision was that 
Hay's numbers were just too darned low.
<P>
"They said, well, if the numbers just end up less than we say they 
are, we'll just pat ourselves on the back and say we helped prevent a 
major epidemic," says Hay now. 
<P>
Ultimately, as AIDS cases stubbornly refused to come in anywhere near 
as fast as the CDC had projected, the agency was forced to lower and 
finally abandon its projection of future AIDS cases and to lower its 
infection estimate to a flat one million.
<P>
Then last year its officials told the House Energy and Commerce 
Subcommittee on Health it was considering lowering that figure even 
more to 800,000.  But homosexual committee member Gerry Studds (D-
Mass.) threw a tantrum, and the officials ran away, tails tucked 
firmly between legs.  So the official figure remains at one million.
<P>
As for the tremendous disparity between male and female infections, 
and between those of whites and blacks, all that too was known long 
ago.  I emphasized these disparities in my first AIDS article way back 
in 1987 in Commentary magazine, adding that, "Every dollar spent, 
every commercial made, every health warning released, that does not 
specify [the actual risk factors for contracting AIDS] is a lie, a 
waste of funds and energy, and a cruel diversion."
<P>
Why then, in every year since 1987 has the CDC insisted on using its 
hundreds of millions of dollars allotted for "education" to air TV 
campaigns aimed squarely at white, middle class heterosexuals?  Quite 
simply to "democratize" the disease.  Specialty diseases get small, 
specialty budgets.  Diseases portrayed as threatening every last 
American get nice fat budgets, explaining why AIDS gets more research 
and education money than heart disease even though heart disease kills 
about 20 times as many Americans.
<P>
The media has eagerly played along, fearing that a disease which has 
<P>
homosexuals as its primary victims won't get the kind of attention the 
media has decided for us this disease deserves.
<P>
And still the propaganda continues.  The week after the Science report 
came out, ABC broadcast an afterschool special "Positive: A Journey 
into AIDS," featuring two soap opera actors whose characters have 
AIDS.  One is male, one female and both are middle class whites.
<P>
The result of denying the true risk factors? The people least at risk 
live in needless terror. The people most at risk become complacent and 
more likely to die before their time.

<i>12/21/95</i><hr><h2>The Government's Legal Theft Racket</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>
 
Think you've had a hard week? Consider what happened to Mrs. Tina 
Bennis back in October of 1988.  One day she finds out that her 
husband,  appropriately named John, was arrested by Detroit police for 
having sex in a car with a prostitute. Then a few days later, adding  
insult to injury, the city seized the car as a "public nuisance." And 
it didn't give it back, even though the car was half Tina's.
<p>
If that sounds a bit unfair to you, you'll be interested to know that 
this isn't just some aberrational Detroit statute like those laws you 
hear about forbidding eating cherry pie in the bathtub on Sunday or 
some such. Indeed, property forfeiture laws are routinely employed by 
states and localities around the country as well as by the federal 
government. 
<p>
Under the federal and most state civil asset forfeiture statutes, law 
enforcement officials can seize a person's property without a notice 
or hearing if they merely have probable cause to believe it has 
somehow been involved in a crime. Proceeding against the property, the 
government need not file criminal charges against the owner or anyone 
else.  
<p>
Because of the fiction that the property is guilty, not the owner, 
cases to retrieve forfeited items have such quaint names as One 1958 
Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania and United States v. 1960 Bags of 
Coffee. (No information available on whether Mrs. Olson was called to 
testify.)
<p>
"Involvement" may mean anything from a belief that the property is 
contraband to a belief that it represents the proceeds of crime (even 
if it is in the hands of someone not suspected of a crime), that it is 
an instrument of crime, or that it somehow facilitates crime.
<p>
In one famous case the oceanographic research vessel Atlantis was 
seized off the coast of Massachusetts because a single marijuana 
cigarette was found in the ship's crew quarters.  In another, 
authorities seized a Scripps Oceanographic Institute research vessel 
because a marijuana cigarette was found in the locker of a sailor who 
had long since been fired.
<p>
But it appears that most forfeiture victims are not big guys like 
Scripps who can afford attorneys to take back their property, but 
average Janes and Joes.
<p>
Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Michigan Association for the 
Preservation of Property found that in 1992 Michigan law enforcement 
agencies used civil forfeiture in 9,770 instances, confiscating an 
average of only $1,434 per seizure. Property taken included 54 private 
homes with an average value of only $15,991 and 807 cars with an 
average value of merely $1,412.  Poor Tina Bennis's car was worth only 
$660.
<p>
While these confiscations were probably crushing to those who suffered 
them, they are not enough to justify the thousands of dollars it would 
take to hire an attorney to get the property back.  You see, once the 
property is seized, the burden is upon the owner to prove its 
"innocence."
<p>
As Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) points out in his 1995 book Forfeiting Our 
Property Rights, "In more than 80 percent of asset forfeiture cases 
the property owner is not even charged with a crime yet the government 
officials can and usually do keep the seized property."
<p>
One of the most pernicious aspects of civil forfeiture law is that the 
property seized often benefits the seizer. During the Holy 
Inquisition, many a person went to his or her death because some 
official coveted their property. Unfortunately, that's not entirely a 
thing of the past as the Donald Scott case shows.
<p>
In 1992, federal, state, and local law enforcement officials raided 
Scott's Malibu home on his 200 acre ranch under the pretense that he 
might be growing marijuana.  Brandishing a gun to stave off what he 
thought were criminal intruders, he was shot to death.
<p>
In fact, Scott was passionately anti-drug. His "crime" may have been 
his repeated refusal to sell his scenic ranch to the National Park 
Service. The Ventura County district attorney concluded that "the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department was motivated, at least in part, 
by a desire to seize and forfeit the ranch for the government."
<p>
Civil forfeiture has allowed state and federal agencies to line their 
pockets with loot.  The amount deposited in the Department of 
Justice's Assets Forfeiture fund has increased from $27 million in 
1985 to $556 million in 1993. The Treasury Department's Forfeiture 
Fund took in $198 million in 1994.
<p>
Civil forfeiture needs to be seen for what it is, an end run around 
constitutional protections that begs for abuse. The notion that 
property can commit crimes is absurd. (Cars don't solicit prostitutes; 
people do.)
<p>
Forfeiture can be a valuable weapon in sucking the profits out of a 
criminal enterprise.  But the fair way to seize these is through 
something already on the books called criminal forfeiture. This 
procedure requires a criminal conviction before seizing property, 
eliminating much of the injustice of civil forfeiture.
<p>
True, this will eliminate those amusing case names like United States 
v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms. People who thumb through court 
reports in search of humor will just have to get their kicks some 
other way. We need to fight crime without taking the lives of Malibu 
millionaires or the clunkers of Detroit housewives.

<i>12/28/95</i><hr><h2>EPA Hides Behind Myths of Love Canal</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a>

</center><hr>

<P>
It closes a chapter in what has been called "the nation's most 
notorious toxic dumping case." The Occidental Chemical Corporation has 
agreed to pay $129 million to cover the federal government's cleanup 
costs at Love Canal, New York. The problem is that the federal 
officials, who like all victors are the ones who write the history, 
have written a history that has little connection with reality.
<P>
Under the settlement, the EPA Superfund will receive $102 and the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handled the relocation of 
Love Canal residents and initial cleanup, will receive $27 million. 
(Last year, Occidental agreed to pay New York $98 million toward the 
cleanup of the site. The state originally sought $630 million in 
damages.)
<P>
"Today we celebrate a transformation of an environmental disaster 
called Love Canal into a success story," Attorney General Janet Reno 
said at a press conference announcing the settlement. "It stands for 
the principle that when people make a mess, they should pay to clean 
it up." 
<P>
Hmm . . . Does that mean that Miss Reno is going to go to Waco, Texas 
and roll up her sleeves and start picking up debris?
<P>
Nobody questions that Occidental, or rather its predecessor, Hooker 
Chemicals & Plastics Corp., buried 22,000 tons of chemical waste in a 
half-dug canal from 1942 to 1953. Rarely mentioned, however is that 
Hooker tried desperately to convince the city of Niagara Falls (where 
Love Canal is located) not to build on the site.
<P>
As consumer advocate Eric Zuesse pointed out in a 1981 Reason magazine 
article, the city school board applied massive pressure to obtain the 
land despite Hooker's repeated warnings of potential health hazards.  
Finally Hooker gave in and sold the land for a symbolic dollar bill.  
It insisted, though, that the land was to be used for a school or 
parking lot or playground but was under no circumstances to be 
excavated.
<P>
Instead, the city decided to build a housing development on the site, 
digging into the protective clay covering and laying sewer lines 
through the waste.  Then it sold the plots to unsuspecting home 
buyers.
<P>
Hooker had no choice but to dump its toxic waste somewhere.  It was 
the city's choice to bring people to that somewhere. The bad guy 
wasn't the big faceless corporation, it was your friendly city 
government.
<P>
The second part of the Love Canal myth is that residents began 
suffering a health disaster in the late 1970s.  As I documented in my 
book Science Under Siege, nobody at Love Canal complained of any 
exceptional illnesses until a muckraking environmentalist reporter for 
the local paper began a series of articles telling the people that 
they were sitting on a toxic waste site.   Lo and behold, from then on 
every illness in the town was blamed on the ingredients brewing 
beneath the surface.  It even made national news when one family's dog 
began inexplicably vomiting.
<P>
The media descended upon the town and relayed to the outside world 
every sneeze, every cough, and every ache and pain experienced by Love 
Canal residents, making it clear that they could only be caused by 
toxic waste, which included the dreaded dioxin.
<P>
The EPA and the governor of New York swaggered around, condemning the 
chemical company and promising to make everything better, no matter 
the cost.  Ultimately tens of millions of dollars were spent 
evacuating the residents.
<P>
Only later did the truth begin to seep out. Study after study 
conducted by the federal government and the State of New York 
Department of Health found that Love Canal residents had no more 
illness than would be expected in any other area of similar size.  
Believe it or not, dogs who don't live on top of toxic waste dumps 
also vomit.
<P>
A New York Times editorial predicted correctly in 1981 when it said, 
"it may well turn out that the public suffered less from the chemicals 
there than from the hysteria generated by flimsy research 
irresponsibly handled."
<P>
Somehow, none of this was mentioned at the aforementioned press 
conference. Instead, EPA Administrator Carol Browner used the myths of 
Love Canal to blast congressional Republican efforts to cut back on 
enforcement of environmental laws. Love Canal led to the creation of 
the Superfund for the cleanup of environmental hazards.
<P>
In seeking to reduce environmental spending by $25 million, she said, 
"Congress is attempting to roll back the environmental health 
protections that Superfund brought to Love Canal." 
<P>
Since there was never any health threat at the Love Canal, obviously 
Superfund brought no protections there. In any case, it's too bad 
Browner didn't go farther to point out that Superfund, according to 
the Office of Technology Assessment, could soak up an amazing $500 
billion over the next few decades. While a few of these toxic waste 
<P>
sites may pose a real hazard to persons living nearby, most have posed 
no demonstrated threat as large even as making dogs upchuck.
<P>
Sometimes people fight back.  The citizens of Leadville, Colorado 
successfully fought the EPA's needless effort to scrape the lead out 
of Leadville's soil. (Anyone for "Ville" Colorado?). Like so much of 
what the EPA does, it was nothing but makework for a bloated and 
arrogant agency.

<center><h2>One Victim</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a> </center>
 <P>
 <hr>
 <P>
 

  
    Julie Welch, 23, didn't know that it was the last day of her life. 
She had plans for the future. She was preparing to quit her job as a 
claims agent for the Social Security department to take a job teaching 
Spanish at a local high school. 
<P>
     She was young and attractive. And, she was in love with a 
handsome, 24-year-old second lieutenant from a nearby Air Force base 
named Eric Hilz. They had talked about marriage, but that was still in 
the future. There was plenty of time -- they thought.
<P>
     The two had met at a Catholic prayer group for young adults at 
Tinker Air Force Base, according to news wire reports.  Last fall, on 
their first date, they went to the State Fair and rode the Ferris 
wheel. 
<P>
    On their final date, the Monday night before the Oklahoma City 
bombing, they went to dinner to celebrate Eric's 24th birthday. Julie 
gave him a prayer book, and they shared a bottle of champagne. The 
last time Eric saw her, after kissing her goodnight, she seemed happy, 
he said.
<P>
      Julie attended Mass every day, and went to Confession every 
week. She had a habit of praying the Rosary each evening, before going 
to bed. On the last night of her life, she probably didn't realize the 
full meaning of the words, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us 
sinners, now and at the hour of our death."
<P>
      She hadn't always been as ardent about her faith. Her father 
said she was lonely at college, and became depressed after living 
alone for the first time. That's when she started working on her 
relationship with God, praying daily, and frequenting the Sacraments. 
After graduation, she lost 40 pounds, and told her dad that she 
finally felt not only spiritually but physically fit.
<P>
     The morning of the Oklahoma City bombing, Julie attended the 7 
a.m. Mass at St. Charles, as always, before going to work at the 
federal building. 
<P>
     By 9 a.m., she was at her desk chatting with her supervisor. At 
9:02 she put down her glasses and went into the front office to greet 
her first customer of the day -- a Hispanic man who needed a 
disability check. 
<P>
     A moment later, the Social Security office was gone, demolished 
by a madman's bomb. About half of the 38 employees made it out alive, 
but not Julie.
<P>
     "She was too young," said her supervisor, Lorri McNiven, who woke 
up in darkness 30 minutes after the blast and was able to crawl from 
the twisted rubble to safety.
<P>
     Julie's parents got a call from the Coroner's office on Saturday 
morning. Their daughter's body had been identified. The grieving 
family said they considered themselves fortunate, because at least 
they can bury their child. Authorities say that some bodies were 
obliterated in the blast, and may never be recovered.
<P>
     To the world, Julie's life was unusual. Daily Mass, the Rosary, 
and weekly Confessions. She was happy, and at peace. It's not 
something the secular press can easily explain.
<P>
     At a time when the concept of womanhood has been redefined by the 
likes of Cosmopolitan Magazine to mean self-centeredness and self-
fulfillment, Julie was a contradiction.
<P>
      She kept her life God-centered, and wrapped herself in the 
Sacraments. She had her eyes on the ultimate prize: eternal happiness 
in Heaven.
<P>
     "We know there is no doubt her soul is in great shape. I feel a 
real sense of peace. I know everything is all right," her boyfriend, 
Eric, told reporters.

<center><h2>Fetal Tissue Consumption/Research</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley </a></center>
 <p>
 <hr>
 <P>
 

     News from the world of medicine: Chinese doctors think they have 
discovered something that cures asthma, restores health, and, at the 
same time, makes skin look years younger. 
<P>
     And, there's an abundant supply, which keeps the price down.
<P>
     Sounds too good to be true? Wait 'till you hear the rest. 
<P>
     The Eastern Express, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, 
broke the story on April 12, with details of the burgeoning practice 
of selling the bodies of aborted children, to be used as health food. 
Since then, the story has been picked up by the Wall Street Journal, 
the Washington Times, United Press International, and it's been shown 
on CNN. 
<P>
     Now, Republicans are demanding that the Clinton administration 
investigate, and they're planning to hold hearings in the House of 
Representatives.
<P>
     Rep. Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, said the new 
allegations could result in a Congressional call for the United States 
to revoke "Most Favored Nation" trade status for China -- a privilege 
granted by President Clinton despite the manifold allegations of human 
rights abuses in China.
<P>
     This is a nauseating topic -- true. But it's a story that needs 
to be told, just as the shocking crimes of the Holocaust needed to be 
laid bare for the world to see.
<P>
     Zou Qin, 32, a doctor at the Luo Hu abortuary in Shenzhen, China, 
told the Eastern Express reporter that she has eaten more than 100 
fetuses in the past six months, and described them as "highly 
nutritious." The story included a picture of her holding a jar 
containing the tiny body of an aborted child.
<P>
     The doctor said: 
<P>
     "They are wasted if we don't eat them. The women who receive 
abortions here don't want the fetuses. Also, the fetuses are already 
dead (when we eat them). We don't carry out abortions just to eat the 
fetuses."
<P>
     Sound familiar? That's the same argument used by Sen. Ted 
Kennedy, Rep. Joseph Kennedy, and cohorts, to justify fetal research 
in America. 
<P>
     So, before you allow the shock to settle in, ask yourself: what's 
the difference? The Chinese are eating unborn children as health food. 
We're cannibalizing their body parts in the name of "science." 
<P>
     And, during the presidential campaign, Clinton used the same 
logic as Dr. Zou Qin, almost verbatim, when he was asked whether he 
supported experimenting on aborted humans. 
<P>
     They'd only go to waste, Clinton said. Fetal research is going to 
help people and relieve their suffering, he said. No one bothered to 
ask him: at what cost?
<P>
     In fact, one of Clinton's first acts after being sworn in as 
president was to revoke the ban on using tax dollars to fund fetal 
research. That's right: your hard-earned money is being used, right 
now, to pay for it.
<P>
     But, when fetal research is reported on the network news in 
America, it's with a positive spin. The film footage typically shows 
sufferers who allegedly have been restored to health after undergoing 
treatment that involved the injection of fetal brain cells into their 
damaged brains. 
<P>
     Not one word about the tiny human beings who were used, without 
their consent, as donors.
<P>
     Like the Chinese, scientists in America prefer older, more 
developed fetuses. The Eastern Express story reported that full-term 
fetuses were more desirable and more expensive in China -- because 
they were considered more nutritious.  
<P>
     In the world of Western medical research, mature fetuses are more 
desirable, too, because the organs are more developed. 
<P>
     There's one difference, though. The Chinese use dead babies. In 
America, some of the experimentation involves removing parts from live 
babies, before killing and aborting them. 
<P>
     If you have a hard time believing that, read the scientific 
papers that describe the procedures. Or, just ask yourself: would any 
doctor inject dead fetal brain cells into the brain of a Parkinson's 
sufferer? No. The brain cells have to be living, or they're no good.
<P>
     Could any dead fetal organs be used in medical experiments that 
involve transplantation into living adults? No. 
<P>
     Or, ask yourself: would any fetal body parts be usable after 
being subjected to a standard abortion procedure? Once again, the 
answer is, no.
<P>
     So, before we get on our high horse and start pointing at the 
Chinese in disgust, let's remember what we tolerate in America.
<P>
     In the end, the blame doesn't rest solely with the American 
researchers who do the grisly deeds. It also rests on the people who 
allow it to happen, by looking the other way.
<P>
     If you're inflamed by what's going on in China, take some of that 
indignation and use it to combat cannibalism on our own soil. Speak 
for those who have no voice.
<P>

<title>When it Comse to Schoo, Mother Knows Best</title>

<h2>When It Comes To School, Mother Knows Best </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley</b>
<p>
I visited a friend recently, and was a bit surprised to see her nine- year-old son, Anthony, with his nose buried in a thick volume of Shakespeare's complete works.  
<p> 
"He's re-writing Hamlet in simpler language, and he's going to direct the play, with his sister and his cousins playing most of the parts," my friend explained.   
 <p>
Anthony looked up, for a moment, from his work.  
 <p>
"I'm going to be Hamlet," he said, with excitement.  
 <p>
But, of course. How silly of me to be even a bit surprised that a young boy's imagination would be captivated by the image of Hamlet -- the sword-wielding Prince of Denmark.  
 <p>
But, Shakespeare at nine? Or, even more astounding, a boy who voluntarily reads Shakespeare during his summer vacation?  
 <p>
My friend, who home schools both of her children, said Anthony was exposed to a bit of the classics as part of his English curriculum, and went galloping after the Bard on his own initiative during the school year.  
<p>
"It's nice that he has the freedom to really explore a subject that catches his interests," she said.  
 <p>
Other home schooling mothers have told me that their kids begin reading at an earlier age, and have a chance to learn in ways that fit their personalities. And, parents can choose a curriculum that gives their kids an education that emphasizes the basics, rather than the flavor-of-the-month approach to teaching.  
 <p>
Speaking as one who was interminably bored with the slow pace of the various public and Catholic schools I attended, I'm a bit jealous.  
 <p>
Home schooling is beginning to come of age. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that about 500,000 children -- more than one percent of all school-age children -- are schooled at home. Advocates place the figure at twice that. And, research shows that home schoolers are growing by as much as 40 percent a year -- fueled by the crumbing public school system, high tuition for private schools, and  
the increasing number of liberal Catholic schools that teach dissent to their young charges.  
<p>
Even the media is beginning to come around. Last October, Time Magazine ran a cover story that described the home schooling trend, albeit with a back-hand slap at Christians:  
<p>
"A movement once reserved largely for misanthropes, missionaries and religious fundamentalists now embraces such a range of families that it has become a mainstream alternative to regular public or private education," it stated.  
<p>
High profile examples, such as the Colfax family of Boonville, California, have helped to change the image of home schoolers. In 1987 Grant Colfax was accepted to Harvard University after being home schooled for his entire life. He graduated magna cum laude, became a Fulbright scholar, and graduated from Harvard Medical School. One-by-one, his home-schooled siblings followed in his footsteps to Harvard.   
 <p>
Advocates point to the fact that almost all of our early national leaders were home schooled. They'll tell you the kids get plenty of socialization, ranging from play groups where younger students mingle with other home-schooled children, to sports and theater groups for the older kids.  
<p>
What's more, in an age when family connections have never been weaker, they say that the one-on-one teaching inevitably strengthens the parent/child bond, and, as a result, imbues their kids with self-confidence and maturity.  
<p>
There is no doubt that home-schooled children have an academic  advantage over their group-schooled peers. In several studies over the last decade they score in the 65th to 80th percentile on standardized test. The national average is the 50th percentile.  
<p>
On the other hand, opponents such as the left-leaning National Education
Association, the union representing 2.2 million public school teachers, decry home schooling, saying it provides an "inadequate educational experience."  
<p>
In other words, no chance to tell the kids about condoms. No opportunity to show the students graphic pictures in their state-approved quest to promote sexual activity. No way to get the nihilistic message across that kids have no control over themselves.   
<p>
And, no opportunity to instill their version of values, meaning "yes" to recycling, and "no" to chastity, prudence, temperance, and faith.  
<p>
Do home-schooled kids miss out on something essential? Naw. I'd say it's the other way around.   
 <p>
It's the public school kids, who only get to be part of a family for the few hours between dinner and bedtime, who are missing out.

<title>Opus Dei</title>

<h2>Opus Dei</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley </b>
<p> 
<p>
It has always puzzled me that Catholics who believe and accept the 
full teachings of the Catholic Church are labeled "Conservative" or 
"orthodox," while dissenting members who support, say, only two out of 
every 10 teachings -- on a good day -- are just called plain, old 
"Catholic." 
<p>
If anyone deserves an adjective, shouldn't it be those who reject the 
Christ-given Magisterial teaching authority of the Holy See? Shouldn't 
it be the ones who proudly declare their opposition to the Chair of 
Peter? 
<p>
Well, that's not the way it works in the 1990s. If all you do is 
support the basic teachings of the ancient faith -- not one iota more, 
nor one jot less -- sooner or later, you're gonna get a negative 
label.  
<p>
Thus, it's no surprise that the Chicago archdiocese announced in May 
that it would refuse to sell an unused college seminary to Opus Dei 
for a reported $8.75 million.  
<p>
Opus Dei, a canonically-approved Personal Prelature of the Church 
established by -- and widely praised by -- John Paul II, wanted to use 
the facility as the new site of Northridge Preparatory School, an all-
boys high school. 
<p>
Several archdiocesan groups voted to reject the sale because, in their 
words, Opus Dei is an elitist, secretive organization that has too 
much power in Rome -- you know, all the things that people used to say 
about the Jesuits.  
<p>
Months later, there are no other interested buyers. Like many disused 
Catholic facilities, the seminary may eventually be sold to an Eastern 
sect, or a New Age group. Or, perhaps it will be sub-divided as 
condos, with the chapel that was once used for the Holy Sacrifice of 
the Mass turned into a club house. Just as long as Opus Dei doesn't 
get it. 
<p>
Admittedly, Opus Dei has an image problem. Secular newspapers 
regularly run negative stories about it. Liberals in the Catholic 
Church disdain the world-wide group, founded almost 70 years ago by a 
Spanish priest beautified in 1992.  
<p>
Why? In part, because Opus Dei doesn't preach dissent, or New Age 
theology, or goddess worship. All it does is urge its mostly-lay 
members to grow in personal holiness, and to serve the Catholic Church 
as it wishes to be served. 
<p>
It's a novel concept, isn't it? Rather than following the current 
fashion of insisting upon serving Our Lord according to our own whims, 
they want to do things His way. 
<p>
Opus Dei, Latin for the "Work of God," shares some similarities with 
the much older, but lesser-known, Congregation of the Oratory, founded 
in the sixteenth century by St. Philip Neri. 
<p>
Both stick to the basics of the faith. Both are unwaveringly in their 
fidelity to the Roman Pontiff. And, both focus on giving the working 
man and woman the spiritual food they need to bring the light of 
Christ into the world -- namely, the Sacraments of the Catholic 
Church. 
<p>
And, in modern times, both have been persecuted, because of it. 
<p>
If you're looking for an example, read "The Last Roman Catholic?" by 
James Demers. He recounts the smear campaign that led up to the 1989 
expulsion of the Oratorians from the archdiocese of Ottawa, in Canada. 
<p>
The congregation was asked by Archbishop Joseph Plourde to take over a 
crumbling church in the poorest section of Ottawa. They started 
rebuilding the church, beginning with the Mass. No more ad-libbed 
Consecrations -- just the liturgy of the Roman Rite of the Catholic 
Church.  
<p>
Within six months, the pews of the church were filled with Catholics 
who traveled great distances to experience the reverence and piety of 
the Mass. A local choir was trained in the singing of Gregorian Chant 
and polyphony. Several doctrine classes began meeting regularly, and 
an architectural restoration project was underway. 
<p>
As you might imagine, the liberals who dominated the archdiocese were 
inflamed. They had been slogging away, day in and day out, with their 
faddish twists to the Mass and their voguish theology. But, the pews 
of their churches, and their parish collection boxes, were slowly 
emptying out. 
<p>
The Oratorians were labeled "ultra-conservative" -- even though their 
only crime was to preach the full wealth of the Catholic faith. They 
were called "divisive" -- despite the fact that their only concern was 
their Father's business -- hearing Confessions, celebrating Mass, and 
instructing their parishioners in the basics of the faith. 
<p>
Eventually, the church was taken away from them, and their 
parishioners set adrift. 
<p>
It's too bad that Catholic liberals are so intolerant. But, they are 
correct to fear both the Oratorians and Opus Dei. Any group that helps 
Catholic laypeople lead lives of old-fashioned sanctity ought to be 
dreaded by the church-busters on the left. 
<p>
For, such is the stuff that builds faith, and spawns strong Catholic 
families, with offspring who have sound vocations and deeply held 
convictions -- just the attributes that it will take to restore the 
Catholic Church in America and defeat the apostles of Modernism.

<h2>Walt Disney Co. - Porn pushers</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><p>
<hr>
<p>
Wall Street was dazzled by the recent $19 billion merger of Walt 
Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC -- the second-largest take-over 
in history. 
<p>
Pundits said it was a good deal for the American entertainment 
industry. But, something tells me that 'ol Walt is rolling over in his 
grave.  
<p>
Not because ABC has a reputation for in-your-face bad taste. Yes, 
these are the people who gave us the jaw-dropping venom of Roseanne, 
and the steaming story lines of NYPD Blue, billed as television's 
first R-rated series. 
<p>
And, you'll notice that through it all, ABC continues to bill 
themselves as the "family station." 
<p>
But, the problem isn't with ABC. It's with Disney. 
<p>
When it comes to down-and-dirty porn pushers, you won't find many who 
have stooped as low as the Walt Disney Company has over the past year. 
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the R-rated anti-Catholic movie "Priest," 
described in one magazine as having "the best gay sex scenes in a non-
pornographic film."  
<p>
It's much worse than that. It's a movie called "Kids," recently 
released by Disney's wholly-owned subsidiary, Miramax -- the same 
people who gave us "Priest." 
<p>
It details the sexual experiences of 13- to 16-year-old New York 
teenagers. And, it's not a pretty picture.  
<p>
According to Reuters and the Associated Press, even a few hard-to-faze 
movie reviewers looked a bit taken aback as they left a pre-release 
showing at the Cannes film festival several months ago.  
<p>
One critic branded it "kiddie porn." The board who rates Hollywood 
movies agreed with him. 
<p>
They gave it an NC-17 rating, the new category that means not quite an 
X-rated movie, but almost. Miramax, fearing the stigma of an NC-17 
rating, chose to release the film unrated, which means it won't be 
running in as many theaters, but will still make the full rounds of 
video stores in its afterlife. 
<p>
The film opens with the main character, a promiscuous skateboarding 
teen named Telly, having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Later, he 
relates the entire scene in vulgar details to his buddy. As it turns 
out, seducing virgins is Telly's idea of "safe sex." 
<p>
It gets worse. Reviewers report that during a party sequence filled 
with explicit sex, a teenage girl passes out, high on drugs, and is 
raped by one of Telly's friends. 
<p>
Yes, that's right. This is the Walt Disney Company we're talking about 
-- the same people who created "101 Dalmations."  
<p>
Now, they've joined the lowest segment of the America media, intent on 
warping the minds of teenagers by linking sex with violence. 
<p>
"Kids" is showing in major cities across the country. And, it's a 
qualified hit. When it premiered, it broke the house records for 
weekend box office grosses at two New York City theaters.  
<p>
There have been a few naysayers, but most reviewers have been positive 
-- probably the same ones who praised "Priest."  
<p>
First-time director Larry Clark, 53, is getting plenty of media 
attention for "Kids." A July 26 profile in the New York Times 
reported: "The success of the film is allowing Mr. Clark to plan 
future movies."  
<p>
The profile doesn't mention Clark's well-documented background as a 
kiddie porn photographer. You have to read a publication such as the 
July issue of the "American Family Association Journal" to get the 
revolting details on that. (P.O. Drawer 2440, Tupelo, MS 38803) 
<p>
Clark is already talking about beginning his next film, which will 
focus on kids, sex, and suicide -- a theme that reoccurs in many of 
his porn photographs. He says he sees the new film as part two of a 
trilogy. 
<p>
So, why is Disney giving a platform to a psychopath? Because Clark's 
film is going to make money. That's why Disney dropped its standards 
almost a decade ago and began making R-rated films, hiding behind 
subsidiary companies. The long list of Disney-funded R-rated films 
seems tame, now, compared to their new ventures. 
<p>
Money. That's all that interests Disney chairman Michael Eisner, 
described by the New York Times as "one of the most ferociously 
ambitious people in Hollywood." 
<p>
Money enough to buy a television network, and create a media empire. 
Money enough to earn Eisner more than $10 million in salary and 
bonuses last year. 
<p>
Poor Mickey. Once, he was the most respectable mouse in the world. 
Now, he works for a porn pusher.

<title>UN World Conference on Women</title>

<center><h2>U.N. World Conference on Women</h2>
<p>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
Do you know the five genders? It's a widely-held tenet among 
radical feminists in America that there are at least five, if not 
more. And, they say, it's perfectly normal to flit between several of 
them during a course of a lifetime.
<p>
Typically, they are classified as: lesbian, male homosexual, 
transgender, and, for the less enlightened among us, male and female.
<p>
Geraldine Ferraro, the one-time Democratic vice-presidential 
candidate, is an ardent feminist and a radical pro-abort, yet she 
claims to have never heard about the new gender-speak -- despite the 
fact that it's standard fare in any run-of-the-mill college or 
university Women's Studies department.
<p>
Ferraro led the American delegation at the recent meeting to 
finalize the platform for the U.N.'s World Conference on Women in 
September -- where the definition of gender is guaranteed to be a 
ticking time bomb.
<p>
"I'm nearly 60 years old, and I don't know what the five genders 
are," said Ferraro, trying to deflect criticism about the feminist 
manipulation of the conference's lengthy draft statement.
<p>
In the official document, the word "gender" is mentioned more than 
200 times, often in a convoluted fashion, in sentences that beg for 
the use of the words "male and female." 
<p>
In fact, if you read the document, available on the Internet at 
the U.N. web site, it may raise the same suspicions that bothered 
delegates from Honduras, Guatemala and the Sudan. They were the first 
to object to the repetitive and somewhat odd use of the term, but 
later agreed to drop the issue until the main conference meets in 
Beijing.
<p>
You won't find the words "motherhood," "wife," or "family" 
mentioned in the official document, except for a handful of occasions, 
when they are referenced in a negative context as a means of 
oppressing women. 
<p>
Or, they've been put in brackets, which means that delegates 
objected to their use, and plan to remove them during the final 
revisions in Beijing.
<p>
The anti-fertility forces have had a spree during the drafting of 
the document. Abortion and the wide-spread use of dangerous chemical 
contraceptives, as well as sterilization, are held up, repeatedly, as 
among the most precious "rights" of women. 
<p>
Perhaps some day it will dawn on these meddlesome, middle-class, 
First World do-gooders that women from developing countries actually 
LIKE babies. I saw it with my own eyes, when I spent a year in West 
Africa.
<p>
They value new life. Not because it's another set of hands in the 
fields. But, because they believe that life is a precious gift -- and 
they don't have too many other bright spots in their difficult lives. 
<p>
I know such life-loving ideas are difficult for some First World 
brains to comprehend. We're always trying to think of new ways to 
relieve those poor women of the burden of motherhood. We, the minority 
of the world's population, believe that we know what's best for those 
underprivileged people who form the majority of the world's population 
-- in brief, we still believe in Colonialism.
<p>
But, they don't want our abortion clinics and our contraceptives. 
They want safe drinking water, simple drugs to help their children 
when they fall ill, and some economic opportunities for their 
families. 
<p>
And, there are many people in America who sympathize with them -- 
in fact, the majority. Sadly, the women from developing countries may 
never know this. 
<p>
Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for America, a 
conservative women's organization that is four times larger than the 
National Organization for Women, railed against the false image 
presented by the Clinton Administration's decision to send ultra-left 
Old Guard feminist extremists to Beijing..
<p>
"This conference is completely dominated by radical feminists. In 
the name of 'Equality, Development, and Peace,' this Beijing 
conference will be a taxpayer-funded promotion of abortion, 
lesbianism, and other left-wing crusades, such as disarmament, radical 
environmentalism, and socialism, that have nothing to do with helping 
women," she said.
<p>
We all know it's a travesty to hold a women's conference in a 
country that routinely practices forced abortions, mandatory 
sterilization of women, and female infanticide. It's a scandal to be 
the guest of a government that has a long record of imprisoning men 
and women in slave labor camps without trial, forcing them to make 
goods for export.
<p>
It's a joke to discuss the dignity of human beings in a country 
where possessing a Bible is a crime against the state, and where 
hundreds of Catholics priests have been imprisoned and tortured -- 
including three Catholic bishops who are still in prison, and three 
Catholic bishops who were tortured and beaten to death in 1991 and 
1992.
<p>
Yes, we know it's a travesty. But, the average woman in developing 
countries may not realize that the left-wing U.S. delegates do not 
speak for us. 
<p>
She'll be left to wonder about a world that sends her planeloads 
of contraceptives, but leaves her without access to simple anti-
malarial drugs.

<center><h2>Remembering V-J Day</center></h2>
<p>
<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a></center> 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
In all the controversy surrounding the 50th anniversary of the 
dropping of the atomic bomb on the weapons factories of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, there's been a bit of the human element that has been lost 
on one side of the debate.
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the fate of the 195,000 people who were 
killed or injured in those congested cities. Their tragic story has 
been told, as well it should. 
<p>
The world has not forgotten them.
<p>
But, what about the fate of the U.S. forces poised off the coast 
of Japan, ready to launch an invasion that was certain to produce the 
heaviest casualties of World War II?
<p>
It's easy, 50 years later, to disagree about projected fatality 
figures. Would there have been 80,000 American losses during the inch-
by-inch fighting for Japanese soil, or 180,000, or 300,000, or more? 
In recent weeks, the guests on the Sunday morning talk show seem to 
preen themselves as they dispassionately debate the issue. 
<p>
But, meanwhile, the men who were on those ships, and their 
families, have a different view of history. It's a more gripping sense 
of what might have been.
<p>
I know, because my father, Michael J. Howley, was part of that 
invasion force. He was, then, a somewhat-scrawny, 18-year-old Radarman 
First Class on the U.S.S. Akutan, an ammunition ship that was 
responsible for re-supplying the front-line battleships with shells 
and bullets. 
<p>
In the brutal, island-hopping campaigns that brought the U.S. 
forces to the shores of Japan, the Navy's job was to launch massive 
bombardments before each landing in an attempt to pave the way for the 
Marines. At the same time, the ships had to defend themselves against 
enemy fighter pilots and suicidal kamikaze attacks.
<p>
Dad enlisted in the Navy when he was 17, fresh out of Boston 
College High School. At first, his parents objected, saying he was too 
young. But, in the end, they signed the document required for under-
aged recruits, and sent their son to fight for their adopted country.
<p>
By August of 1945, he was a veteran of the Liberation of the 
Philippines, and, a more searing memory, the Battle of Okinawa, where 
the U.S. Navy experienced some of the heaviest losses of the war. 
<p>
He never had to worry about being crippled or maimed. All it took 
to incinerate an ammo ship was one well-placed bullet, or one 
successful kamikaze plane. 
<p>
In fact, in the final months of war, the U.S.S. Mt. Hood, also an 
"AE," or ammunition supplier, went down with all hands lost, with the 
exception of an officer and a squad of sailors who were on a nearby 
island. The explosion of the ship's 8,800 tons of bombs blew a 300-
foot-long crater in the ocean floor.
<p>
To acknowledge the awesome destructive power contained within the 
hulls of the AEs, the Navy named all of them, in the World War II 
years, after volcanoes.
<p>
When we were young, the only specifics Dad ever told us about the 
war were the funny stories, like the time he was on shore patrol and 
was ordered to arrest a group of sailors, who turned out to be his 
shipmates.
<p>
And, there was also the amusing detail about the "little white 
lie" he told his mother, who was home in Boston praying unending 
Rosaries for her two sons in uniform -- one, my uncle, in the Army, 
and, the other, my Dad.
<p>
"Mamie," an Irish name for "mother," spent the war years believing 
my father was on a low-level supply ship in the backwaters of the 
Pacific. To support this subterfuge, he filled his letters with 
imaginary details of how many blankets they had transported, and how 
bored he was.
<p>
"I didn't want her to worry more than she already did," he 
explained. 
<p>
Every year, at the anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and 
Hiroshima, the media focuses on one angle: the plight of the citizens 
of those two cities.
<p>
But the historical context, the backdrop for the decision to drop 
the bomb, seems to have been lost. 
<p>
There has been little mention of the fact that the Japanese were 
working on their own A-bomb, or that they had a habit of placing 
armament factories in residential areas, or that the citizens of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were warned by U.S. leaflet drops to flee their 
homes, or that our prisoners of war were starving to death as they 
waited for liberation.
<p>
Most of all, we seem to have forgotten the plight of the thousands 
of soldiers and sailors -- many of them teenagers -- who waited 
onboard the ships of the American invasion fleet.
<p>
Whether you believe the lowball figures put forth by today's 
revisionists, or the higher figures accepted as fact in 1945, the 
bottom line is: vast numbers of those young men would not have 
survived the Battle of Japan.
<p>
They would have have missed their chance to live their lives, to 
have families, and to grow old.
<p>
Surely, their stories deserve some mention.

<title>Did My Parents Want Me</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr>
<center>
<h2>Did My Parents WANT Me?</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">Kathleen Howley</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
A woman, in her mid-40s, recently told me that she grew up with the 
feeling that her parents didn't want her.<p>  
She said she overheard, one night, a comment made by her mother, who 
didn't realize that little ears were listening. It referred to the 
conception of her daughter as being the result of "one drink too 
many." <p> 
It was meant as a joke. And, my friend reports that all the adults who 
heard it laughed. But she wasn't laughing.  <p>
In fact, that one comment, with perhaps, the subtle reinforcement of 
other stray remarks, haunted her for years. <p>
Oh, sure, her parents fed her and clothed her and sent her to school, 
and even went to "parent/teacher" nights -- the things that to all the 
world make people look like loving and caring parents. <p>
And, for all I know, they could have been exactly that. My friend 
wouldn't have disputed that possibility.  <p>
But, she wasn't talking about the love that almost any normal adult 
can learn to feel about a cute and cuddly baby.  <p>
She was talking about the deep-down questions that all children ponder 
as they learn about the world they live in:  <p>
When I was called into being, when I was created, did my parents WANT 
me? When I was thrust into this strange, new world, was there someone 
yearning for my arrival?  <p>
Somehow, if the answer to that question is , "Yes," it makes 
everything else easier. It covers a multitude of later lapses and 
human failings.  <p>
I suppose that it's much like arriving at the door of an important 
party knowing that you are an invited guest, as compared to walking 
toward the front steps without an invitation.  <p>
Of course, we all know that the most important Being of all, the 
Creator of the Universe, wanted each and every one of us to be born.  <p>
In fact, it's more than that. The Father not only loved us and called 
us into being. He also gave each of us a crucial job to do during our 
lifetime on earth -- a job that, whether great or small, is infinitely 
important in His plan. <p>
In adult life, that fact can be a great comfort. But, it seems that 
children need more.  <p>
Today, we live in a world that is ruled with a contraceptive 
mentality. It's a stingy philosophy that says, yes, children are a 
good thing, but only give me, at most, two of them. Any more than 
that, and they become a bad thing. <p>
How, I wonder, do today's children feel, growing up in a family with 
the knowledge that they barely made it under the wire. Just two. No 
more. We have no more love to give. <p>
Even if you're number one or two, you know that the love you receive 
from your parents is conditional. "We love you, because you happen to 
arrive when you did." <p>
Someone was ranting to me, recently, that people shouldn't have more 
than two children. <p>
I asked her: <p>
"Where do you fall in the birth order of your family?" <p>
She answered: <p>
"I'm the fourth child." <p>
Good thing her parents didn't agree with her ideas. Else, she never 
would have existed. <p>
I'm the second child in my family. Lucky me. I would have been born, 
even if my parents subscribed to a contraceptive mentality. Although, 
my little sisters would have been left out in the cold. <p>
Fortunately, I have the great gift of knowing that my parents wanted 
as many children as God would give them. That gave us Howley kids a 
jump start in life. We were wanted, yearned for, rejoiced over. Every 
one of us. <p>
But what about today's children, who live in families that have a 
stingy attitude toward life? Maybe God wanted more. Maybe He intended 
that third kid to be one who introduced the first kid to the woman he 
would marry, or got a job for kid number two when he got out of 
college. Or, maybe it was that fifth kid who was going to care for the 
parents when they were elderly. <p>
The fact is, it's not unconditional love for a couple to use chemicals 
to ensure that only one or two children are born. You can argue that 
it shows greater love to have just two children, and be able to 
provide them with every material asset. The best kindergarten, the 
best college.  <p>
Problem is, maybe they won't want to go to college. Maybe they'd 
prefer to have a brother, rather than a new car for their high school 
graduation. <p>
Mother Theresa said it best. In news accounts, she was quoted as 
saying, "In America, children have every material thing, but they are 
very lonely, because they don't have brothers or sisters to play 
with." <p>
So, when you have that third child, or fourth, or more, and people 
start raising eyebrows, asking, "How MANY are you going to have?" -- 
just answer, " I don't know, you'll have to ask God. He has a plan." <p>

<title>Politics Makes Strange Bedfellow</title>

<center><h3>Politics Makes Strange Bedfellows</h3><br>
By<br><a href="townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a><p>
<hr></center> 
<P>
 
The fat lady has yet to sing. With Democrats continuing to desert 
their party in droves, especially on the state level, the political 
drubbing that began with the November elections is going into extra 
innings. 
<P>
Almost every week, the newspapers carry stories of Democrats who have 
decided either to switch, or to quit. 
<P>
The political concept of Liberalism -- spelled with a capital "L" -- 
is dead, at least for this millennium. No longer will government 
simply give handouts as the solution to every problem. No longer can 
the media merrily assume to represent the views of all Americans when 
they postulate that freedom in America equals life without values. 
<P>
But, before Republican leaders get too euphoric about the all-out 
rout, it would be wise to remember that politics makes strange 
bedfellows.  
<P>
Some of their staunchest supports today are people who don't really 
fit into the Republican party, or the Democratic party. They are 
called: Catholic voters. 
<P>
 Of the 250 million people in America, 95 million, or two out of every 
five, are Roman Catholic. Sure, some of them have fallen away from the 
faith, for now -- after all, the Church has not been immune from the 
devastating effects of the "Just-Me" philosophy that hit society in 
the 1960s.  
<P>
 But, despite the biased polls you'll occasionally see in the 
newspapers, most remain firm supporters of Catholic teachings 
regarding the value of life and the family. 
<P>
 At the moment, the Republicans are best representing their views. 
Forty years ago, it was the Democrats. The mass of Catholic voters 
switched once. They can switch again. 
<P>
 Probably, that doesn't make too many Republicans quake in their 
boots. Of the two parties, they are the most pro-life, they'll tell 
you. They have the best ideas for restoring the strength of the 
family. They have a common-sense and value-based approach to 
education.  
<P>
 But, every once in a while, an issue comes along that makes the 
typical Catholic voter extremely ill-at-ease with the standard 
Republican party line. 
<P>
Immigration is one -- in a big way. Most Catholic voters are 
descendants of turn-of-the-century immigrants. True, it makes good 
sense to secure our borders and to crack down on illegal immigration -
- as long as that doesn't mean punishing the innocent children of 
illegals. 
<P>
 However, many Catholics will tell you that America must never close 
her doors to legal immigration, or develop a stingy attitude toward 
it, lest we lose our vigor and make a lie of the Statue of Liberty: 
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath 
free." 
<P>
 And, here's another issue: immoral labor practices. 
<P>
 No, I'm not going to hop on the media bandwagon and tell you that the 
big, bad Republicans only care about making a buck. I'm not going to 
even mention country clubs.  
<P>
 But, the fact is, the Republican party seems ever-ready to put the 
laborer at the mercy of the corporate decision-makers. If they want to 
hold on to their Catholic supporters, they are going to have to knock 
it off. 
<P>
  During recent months, the National Labor Committee in New York has 
sponsored a cross-country tour for two teenagers to tell the world of 
their experiences in the garment sweatshops of Honduras and El 
Savador, assembling high-priced clothes for The Gap, Banana Republic, 
Eddie Bauer, Sears, and Gitano, a subsidiary of Fruit of the Loom. 
<P>
  In these tax-free factories, built specifically to produce goods for 
the U.S. and Canadian markets, children and young women work shifts 
that sometimes exceed18 hours, for below-subsistence wages. The abuses 
they recount are mind-numbing. 
<P>
 Of course, the corporate bigwigs deny all of it. But, if you ask me 
who I'm going to believe -- Donald Fisher, who was paid more than $2 
million last year to run the Gap empire, or Judith Viera, an 18-year-
old who made 56 cents an hour and was limited to two bathroom trips a 
shift --- hummm....who would you believe? 
<P>
Judith, by the way, was fired when she tried to help organize a union. 
For good measure, the big boss also threw out her three sisters, just 
because they were related. 
<P>
 On her last 18-hour shift on the production line, Judith said they 
were sewing Eddie Bauer T-shirts. The crew included two workers who 
were only 15 years old. 
<P>
 Earlier this year, the House's Trade Subcommitee approved a bill 
introduced by Republican Phillip Crane to increase the tariff breaks 
for products entering the U.S. from sweatshops in the Central American 
and the Caribbean by $240 million.  
<P>
 Remember the giant sucking sound? H.R. 553 means it will only get 
louder, with more American companies being wooed by the prospects of 
33-cents-an-hour wages and laborers who are vulnerable to 
exploitation. 
<P>
 Currently, the bill has been set aside. But, seeing as Fruit of the 
Loom is a six-figure contributor to the RNC, and The Gap lags not far 
behind with a hefty five-figure donation, H.R. 553 may not be dead for 
long. 
<P>
 Yes, politics does make strange bedfellows, indeed. 
 <P>

<center><h2>You Must Learn To Forgive You</h2><p>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

Only in this day and age could a magazine devote an entire, 2,600-word 
article to the subject of confession, and not once mention the word 
"God." <p>

Cosmopolitan did it, in their August issue. The gist of the story was: 
the highest aim in life is to obtain self-forgiveness. <p>

That's right. YOU must learn to forgive YOU. Confess your sins to 
yourself, or to a pal. No need to submit yourself to divine authority. 
Learn how to erase your guilt. Just get rid of it.  <p>

Silly you for feeling guilty in the first place.<p>  

Don't change your habits. Don't even consider the possibility that 
there is such a thing as absolute, immutable truth, or that some 
actions are intrinsically wrong -- or that feelings of actual guilt, 
as opposed to imagined or neurotic guilt, exist for a good reason. <p>

Don't ponder the idea that Hell could, indeed, be real, whether you 
believe in it or not. <p>

Just get to a good therapist, and work through your feelings.<p> 

I suppose that's a much easier route than asking for God's 
forgiveness, which requires an acknowledgment of His authority, true 
repentance, and an earnest resolution to try to sin no more. <p>

That would be life-changing. Earthshaking, in fact.  <p>

I'd wager a guess that the average Cosmo subscriber is nowhere near 
taking that first step. But, without God's absolution, they're just 
changing seats on the Titanic.<p> 

Forgiving yourself may, in fact, give temporary relief. But, until God 
forgives you, your deeds will always exist, if only in the deepest 
recesses of your mind, and, certainly, in your soul. <p>

Without His supernatural grace, dispensed through the Sacrament of 
Penance, they can never be cast "as far as the east is from the west." <p>

Sin, or "guilt," as Cosmo phrased it, "can torment you, make you sick 
-- even weaken your body's immune system." <p>

The article, titled "Are Guilty Secrets Haunting Your Life?" goes on: 
"People often become immobilized, whether they know it or not, unable 
to get on with their lives until they tell the truth." <p>

Ahh, is that all it takes? Having an honest chat with a friend, or 
spending $100 an hour for a therapist? Following Cosmo's logic, 
America should be the healthiest, happiest county in the world.  <p>

After all, is there any self-help route we haven't tried? Is there a 
new therapy technique we've passed up? <p>

Have we left anything unsaid? Is there any topic -- any? -- that 
hasn't been discussed in full detail on Oprah or other TV shows? <p>

And yet, America seems, on the whole, to be much more depressed, 
guilt-ridden, and lonely -- compared to, say, a time when we were a 
God-fearing country.<p> 

No. There's a lot more to healing the deadly effects of sin than just 
telling someone about it.<p>  

There's nothing wrong with therapy, or talking with friends. But 
neither will set us free.<p> 

Perhaps an easier way to explain this complex theological fact is with 
a simple story.<p>  

A man, troubled by his failings, confessed his sins to a Catholic 
priest, and received Sacramental absolution. Later, he spent time in 
prayer with God, and brought up the subject of his already-confessed 
sins.<p>  

The answer from God -- who, although all-knowing, may have been trying 
to make a point -- was, "I don't remember."<p> 

And, this gentle reminder was enough to give the penitent the feeling 
of elation that comes with true freedom. <p> 

I've felt that feeling too, as I've left a confessional. <p>

As Jesus told the Apostles: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are 
forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained." 
(John 20:23) <p>

About six years ago, after I converted from being an atheist and a 
lapsed Catholic, I spent some time with a college friend who was not a 
believer.<p> 

She was quick to say that I seemed much happier since re-embracing the 
faith. But, she also said that she could never go back to being a 
Catholic because she couldn't stand living with "all that guilt." <p>

"Do I seem guilt-ridden?" I asked her. <p>

"No," she said.<p> 

"That's because the whole point is that Jesus died for our sins, in 
place of us. So, we get off scot-free. No guilt. All I have to do is 
try to live as He wants, and when I fail, I go to Confession, ask for 
His forgiveness, and I leave with a clean slate," I said.<p> 

"A clean slate..." she said, thoughtfully. "That sounds kinda nice." <p>

<title>Pope John Paul II Come to America -- Howley</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Pope John Paul II Comes to America </h2><p>
By<br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

The arrival of Pope John Paul II makes me think, with a chuckle, about 
the last time his plane, nicknamed "Shepherd One," touched down on 
American soil. <p>

It was at Stapleton International Airport, in Denver, for the 
celebration of the 1993 World Youth Day. Then, as now, President Bill 
Clinton waited to greet the pontiff, arriving via Air Force One less 
than an hour before the pope. <p>

I was in the area reserved for the pack of journalists covering the 
event. As we waited for the arrival of the pope's plane, I discussed 
the story with a reporter from a Boston television station.  <p>

She told me, in a confidential tone, "He's not going to discuss 
abortion. I have it from a very good source."  <p>

I knew her source. No need to even say it. It was our own Raymond 
Flynn, hizzhonor, "Raybo," the former mayor of Boston. Despite his 
assignment to Rome, as the Clinton-appointed U.S. ambassador to the 
Vatican, Flynn and his staff still kept up connections with the Boston 
press corps. <p>

Boston journalists fondly refer to the former mayor as "Raybo," 
referring to the time, while mayor, when he ran -- Rambo-like -- into 
a burning building and carried out an elderly woman. The joke at the 
time was: Boston politicians will do anything to ensure another vote. <p>

Most Boston journalists tended to like the mayor, then and now, 
because he had all the trappings of a Irish Catholic politicians, with 
none of the baggage. Meaning, he used his religion to wring every last 
vote out of the predominantly Catholic populace, in true James Michael 
Curley fashion, but, he didn't support Church teaching with his vote, 
in true Kennedy fashion. <p>

Hizzhonor claimed to be personally opposed to abortion, yet he did 
everything in his power to elect our pro-abortion President Bill 
Clinton, who couldn't have won the White House without the Catholic 
vote. Flynn criss-crossed the country for months before the election, 
tirelessly campaigning for Clinton. <p>

And, in his own backyard, Flynn did nothing -- zero -- during his 
lengthy tenure as Boston's mayor to stop the hundreds of abortions 
going on in Boston City Hospital, which was under his control.  <p>

I shook my head, doubtfully.  <p>

"Naw, I think he's going to mention abortion," I said. "I think Raybo 
may be engaging in a bit of wishful thinking, on that one." <p>

My fellow journalist was confident.  <p>

"Nope. It's not going to come up, at least in public. I'd bet my last 
dollar on that," she said. <p>

Well, you know the outcome. It took the Holy Father all of three 
minutes to bring up the subject. In his arrival speech, on the airport 
tarmac, he exhorted Americans to "Defend life!"  <p>

Flynn, who on that occasion was holding the umbrella to shield Bill 
Clinton from the rain, looked more and more downcast, as the speech 
wore on. <p>

"All the great causes that are yours today will have meaning only to 
the extent that you guarantee the right to life and protect the human 
person," the Holy Father said, emphatically. <p>

At the time, I actually felt a bit sorry for our ambassador to the 
Vatican, as he stood in the rain with a dejected look on his face. It 
seems he tried to work some behind-the-scene angle that didn't, in the 
end, prove to be fruitful. <p>

You'd think the American media would be used to it by now, and expect 
John Paul to speak strongly about the issues that threaten modern 
society. After all, the Holy Father has often used his speeches to 
label abortion as "murder." <p>

Shocking, isn't it? In the stultifying atmosphere of today's American 
culture, everyone is supposed to toe the line. Even the Conservatives 
aren't willing to take a risk by accurately describing what happens 
during an abortion, or by verbalizing the forces that lie at the root 
of our anti-life society. <p>

Those who try to defend the modern status quo have worked to convince 
Americans that "words kill" -- particularly when referring to 
abortion. Of course, America is built on the premise that only free 
and robust debate will ensure our liberty. But, in large part, the 
other side has convinced most citizens that speaking too strongly on 
any issue is somehow a danger to us all. <p>

Ironically, the opposite is true. In truth, silence kills. 
Historically, we've seen what happens, again and again, when good 
people stay quiet.  <p>

We can all take a lesson from the Holy Father, who during all of his 
previous 67 trips outside the Vatican has never hesitated to speak the 
truth, with love. <p>

He doesn't flinch when condemning such things as chemical 
contraception, sterilization, en-vitro fertilization, feminist 
extremism, and sex outside of marriage, to name but a few hot button 
issues.  <p>

When was the last time an American leader had the guts to lay it on 
the line, like that? <p>

<title>Rockwell: The Farm Trick Reform -- 04/17/96
</title>

<h2> The Farm Trick Reform
</h2>



Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Hillary Clinton should have called her medical bill "Freedom 
To Heal." Then Congress might have passed it as restoring the 
free market in medicine. If you don't believe such a trick would 
have worked, take a look at the "Freedom To Farm" bill now 
sailing into law. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Official propaganda says this bill restores a free market in 
agriculture, ending 60 years of subsidies and planning. But ask 
yourself: if this were really true, wouldn't farmers on the dole, 
and the media, be in hysterics? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, and a close examination of the bill backs up this 
suspicion. The existing scheme, based on New Deal programs in 
turn modeled on the old Russian system, is retained in all its 
essentials. After this bill expires in seven years, the 1949 law 
that presently oppresses us will again be the law of the land. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not that the new bill is salt peanuts. With a $47 billion 
price tag, it allocates even more money to subsidies initially, 
and to crazy new liberal programs. But in seven years, we're 
told, price supports and subsidies will be "phased out." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This farm bill is typical of a Congress that can't bring 
itself to cut a dime of federal spending, yet passes reams of 
"revolutionary" laws promising to cut, slash, abolish, and 
otherwise establish a libertarian Heaven on Earth...sometime in 
the next millennium. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But in the here and now, the bill retains price supports for 
peanuts and sugar, as well as price-fixing for milk. It renews a 
program locking up 36 million acres. And it throws away $1.4 
billion on more regulations, $200 million on a Florida swamp, and 
$300 million on "rural development." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All in all, this bill could have been written by Bill 
Clinton, which is why he's glad to sign it. The Democrats 
particularly like the food stamp and school lunch provisions. 
Why, you may ask, are these part of a farm bill? Because those
who benefit, along with the "poor," are wealthy agribusinessmen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Why this bill? Why now? Crop prices are at a ten-year high, 
and under the current subsidy formula, payments would be low. So, 
by merest happenstance, this bill changes the price-based system 
into a flat subsidy. Three to four billion dollars more will be 
spent for farm welfare immediately. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The bill's supporters say it eliminates many set asides, 
acreage controls, and crop mandates. But that would only be a 
glorious thing if the industry weren't subsidized and protected 
from competition. "Freedom to farm"--with other people's money.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The farm program is one of the oldest federal scandals. The troubles
began a century and half ago, when U.S. tariffs were set 
to favor industry at the expense of agriculture. The policy 
culminated in an invasion of the agricultural South by former 
industrial lobbyist Abe Lincoln. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Then, in the first world war, the federal government pumped 
up the price of wheat and other products, and after the war, 
tried to keep them that way. That effort failed, and after two 
devastating post-war downturns, officials sought more 
protectionism and outright planning. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By the time of the Great Depression, the Jeffersonian ideal 
of the independent yeoman farmer was banished. As president, 
Herbert Hoover set out to keep prices high by subsidies, trade 
restrictions, and planting controls at the very time when market 
pressures were forcing them to fall. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But Mr. Hoover was small potatoes compared to farm dictator 
Franklin D. Roosevelt. As he forced farmers to slaughter their 
hogs and plow under their crops in order to raise prices, he was 
also flooding some of the world's best farm land for the 
Tennessee Valley Authority. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The "brain trust" that gave us those policies still runs 
agriculture. The sector has become a virtual ward of the state, 
with the feds holding more than half of all farm debt. There are 
still independent farmers, and they avoid Washington like the 
boll weevil. Agriculture is dominated by subsidized agribusiness, 
its lobbyists, and its pet politicians. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The victims of food socialism are consumers and taxpayers, 
who shell out billions directly and in the form of artificially 
high prices every year. Also harmed are the remaining independent 
farmers, whose livelihoods are threatened by subsidized 
competition. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That's why Congress should pass a real Freedom To Farm Act. 
It would abolish the whole of the existing system, and subject 
the sector to the same competition and price dictates that free 
industries face. Congress should also stop concocting tricky new 
ways to prop up big government with misnamed bills.

<title>Rockwell: Ending the Fed's Free Ride -- 04/09/96

<h2> Ending the Fed's Free Ride
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>


Today's civics test: what Washington institution can make or  
break elections, bail out entire foreign governments, send the  
stock market to the stratosphere, or bankrupt whole industries,  
yet operates with less oversight than even the CIA?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


One hint: the U.S. Constitution is useless as a cheat sheet  
(as it would be for any realistic civics exam these days.) The 
answer is the Federal Reserve, the most powerful yet least  
questioned any D.C. bureaucracy. Will that soon change?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


At issue is a new report on the Fed, released by Government  
Accounting Office just as Alan Greenspan seeks Senate  
confirmation for his third term. The report pulled back the  
curtain, just a smidgen, on the Fed's notorious secrecy. Now some  
Senators and pressure groups are gearing up to give the Fed the  
what-for.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Among other revelations in the report is the Fed's  
heretofore secret "contingency fund"--that is, slush  
fund--totaling $3.7 billion. It comes from money that the Fed has  
skimmed off the revenues gained from its open-market operations.  
Everyone thought revenues were turned over to the Treasury.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


And that's far from the only slush sluicing through the  
halls of the Fed's marble temple on Constitution Ave. From 1988  
to 1994, the Fed's spending on its own lifestyle grew at twice  
the rate of inflation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Mr. Greenspan protests the suggestion that the Fed is  
wasting taxpayer dollars. He's technically right. The Fed doesn't  
need our taxes any more than a counterfeiter needs to hold up the  
local gas station. The central bank using fancy finance to  
effectively print all the money it needs.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In its never-ending quest to expand money and credit, the  
Fed can lower the rate it charges member banks for loans, it can  
manipulate reserve requirements, or, most notoriously, it can buy  
Treasury securities on the open market.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's this last action that proves so profitable. The Fed  
purchases Treasury securities--either directly or through  
favorite brokerage houses--and holds this debt as an asset.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Working through its branches and member banks, it pyramids  
loans on top of these securities. The creditworthiness of the  
U.S. government--whose balance sheet would otherwise suggest  
Chapter 7--is entirely due to this power of the Fed.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The real oddity--and this is where the power to counterfeit  
comes in--is where the Fed gets the money to purchase these debt  
securities. It creates it out of thin air, a magic trick made  
easier as the current paper money system replaced the restrictive gold 
standard.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If anyone tries this at home, the Justice Department lands  
him in the pokey. When third-world countries are rumored to be  
circulating phony dollars, the military threatens to bomb them.  
To stop counterfeiting is why the Treasury says it redesigned the  
$100 bill. It could also be cracking down on the competition.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Now to the Fed's just-discovered $3.7 billion slush fund. It  
represents a small slice of the profits the Fed derives from  
exacting interest payments on the debt it holds. And who pays  
that interest? You and me, in the form of tax dollars. At the end  
of the year, the Fed gives some back and keeps the rest.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The original argument for creating the Fed is that it would  
eliminate banking crises that cause bank depositors to lose their  
money. Well, after 1913, the recessions increased in frequency,  
the government became vastly bigger, and the dollar lost about 97  
percent of its value. In one way or another, depositors have lost  
more money than ever.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Fed's fingerprints are all over these trends. Every new  
dollar created by the Fed's operations (all else being equal)  
waters down the value of the existing dollars circulating in the  
economy. And an ever-cheaper dollar redistributes money from  
savers to debtors, and from the tax-paying middle class to the  
banks and government contractors that spend the fresh money  
before prices rise.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


We hear that inflation is low, but look at the long-term  
trends. The dollar has lost three quarters of its value since  
Richard Nixon eliminated the last vestiges of the gold standard 
in 1971. Even at the present rate of inflation--and who believes  
that will last?--overall prices will have doubled when today's  
newborns enter the workforce.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


If we want to know why living standards are falling, the  
curtain needs to be pulled back even more. If we want to stop the  
fall, we need a truly redesigned money: a Fed-proof gold dollar.

<title>Rockwell: The Standard Bearer Returns -- 04/16/96

<h2> The Standard Bearer Returns
</h2>
Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
<p>

Taxpayers, it's no time to despair. The anti-government   
revolt that swept the Democrats out of power in Congress is still   
on. But in the newest twist, the revolt has exposed the   
Republican establishment's own compromises with government power.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The evidence comes from a dramatic political contest in the  
14th district of Texas. Former Congressman and intellectual  
firebrand Ron Paul won the Republican runoff for the House seat  
currently held by party switcher Greg Laughlin. The results have  
sent shock waves through Republican ruling circles.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a Democrat only yesterday, Mr. Laughlin had money,  
media access, the endorsement of the Republican elite, and the  
use of the party's biggest guns. Dr. Paul, in contrast, was the  
outsider who gained a stunning 9-point victory by stressing his  
independence, ideals, and pristine record.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In Washington, the race became a loyalty test. The House  
leadership prevailed upon 53 high-ranking Congressmen to send  
contributions to the Laughlin campaign. The party dispatched its  
own ample funds, along with Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay, the two  
George Bushes, and even Reagan-era leftover Ed Meese.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But bigshots couldn't muscle the voters in this largely   
rural district. The endorsements only confirmed Dr. Paul's claim   
not to be part of any machine. In fact, Phil Gramm's ads for the   
Laughlin campaign had to be pulled when they began to backfire.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The Laughlin strategy assumed, without evidence, that voters   
trust the Republican leadership to tell them how to vote. But the   
bloom was already off that rose. Republicans have run Congress   
for more than a year, and taxes are still high, spending is   
higher, living standards continue to fall, and our liberties are   
just as imperiled.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When Mr. Laughlin switched from the Democrat Party, the   
Republican leadership put him on the Ways and Means Committee,  
the best seat in the House for buying and selling special favors.   
But an insider deal couldn't erase Mr. Laughlin's voting record,   
which was Clintonesque to the core. His switch was not   
ideological, of course, but political. Throw in the  Roll Call    
scoop that he is Washington's number one junket taker, and he   
became the personification of double-dealing politics.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

  
The party claimed to support Mr. Laughlin because it wanted   
to show that converts can win elections. But that doesn't explain   
the timing. The switch occurred only after Dr. Paul told the   
House leadership of his intention to run. The deeper truth is   
that the leadership wanted to keep Dr. Paul and his   
uncompromising approach at bay.     
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul's voting record is a portrait of courage and of   
unshakable devotion to liberty. He worked against taxes,   
spending, foreign wars, and pork-barrel projects, even in his own   
district. In the ratings of the National Taxpayers Union, he   
holds the all-time highest score.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
When he was in Congress before, Dr. Paul never hesitated to   
buck the party leadership and vote against its hidden tax   
increases and unbalanced budgets. He tossed special interest   
groups out of his office. And he resisted personal pressure from   
Ronald Reagan to vote for IMF subsidies and military pork.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul was the first politician in this century to   
introduce term-limits legislation, not just for politicians, but   
also for federal judges and bureaucrats. He was the first to call   
for the abolition of Congressional pensions, and refused to take   
part in that giveaway. He was the first to call for the BATF to   
be abolished. And thanks to his efforts on behalf of the gold   
standard, the U.S. now mints the best-looking gold coins in the   
world.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
He is an eloquent spokesman for states rights and individual   
liberties against federal intrusion, for sound money against   
inflation and other Fed manipulations, and for self government   
against centralized power. His foreign policy views are those of   
George Washington: trade with all and belligerence toward none.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Dr. Paul combines his idealistic political philosophy with   
an impressive technical knowledge of economics. He is an exponent   
of the Austrian School, and knows more about such subjects as   
business cycles and central banking than most working economists   
and any sitting member of Congress.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a physician who has brought more than 4,000 babies into   
the world, he also knows that the biggest enemy the family has is   
our declining economy, thanks to excessive taxes and regulations.   
He knows that the government is also to blame for our failing   
educational system.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In his fight, Dr. Paul forged a coalition that included the   
religious right, economic libertarians, home schoolers, gun   
owners, land owners, businessmen, and anti-war isolationists.   
That is, people who want to be left alone by the government.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Ron Paul faces another hurdle in the general election. But   
if he makes it, he will once again be big government's biggest   
enemy in Washington. No wonder Republican power elites,   
especially those whose actions belie their rhetoric, are worried.

<title>Rockwell: "Public Sector" Racket -- 04/21/96
</title>
</head>

<h2>"Public Sector" Racket 
</h2>
Llewellyn Rockwell
<P>


The term "public sector" is highly misleading. It's supposed  
to refer to the government, that well-known public servant, in  
contrast to the "private sector," the greedy and selfish market.  

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
But the opposite is the case. In the "private sector," all  
activity is focussed on serving the public, people helping people  
get quality goods and services at the best price. A business that  
loses sight of its consumers is quickly outcompeted by one that  
serves the public better. The market is the true public sector.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On the other hand, government is obsessively focussed on  
itself and its private, internal, bureaucratic interests. It  
doesn't engage in productive enterprise, there are no regular  
consumers of its "services," it is owned by no one in particular,  
and it doesn't worry about profit and loss.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Government's primary if not exclusive function is to  
redistribute wealth from one group to another by force. The  
people, the very ones involuntarily funding the government, are  
seen as chumps and menaces, and used as pawns in social  
experiments and power grabs. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this comes clear when you compare the way any private  
company works with, say, the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development. In the most recent outrage, HUD decided it should  
blow up its housing projects in downtown Baltimore and move the  
residents to pricey homes in the suburbs, at fantastic taxpayer  
expense. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This demented scheme--which will drive down property values,  
increase crime, and unsettle whole communities--is at war with  
the public interest. That's why it's generated an explosion of  
resistance among homeowners in the Baltimore area. Especially  
peeved are new suburbanites, who worked hard to get away from the  
inner city.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Just who benefits from this scheme? Power-mad bureaucrats  
who see their mandate as tearing up the social pea patch, and the  
contractors and social workers who live off the ensuing  
destruction. These are private, not public, interests.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market, in contrast, is the peaceful and fully  
accountable public servant. Capitalists produce houses and  
apartments for every social group. If we were sticklers in our 
use of language, we would call what the market achieves "public  
housing," since its purpose is not to destroy, but to create  
housing options for everyone at the least possible expense.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Here's another example. Which is more anxious to serve the  
public: the government's mail operation, or the myriad of private  
delivery services? You don't have to be an expert to know. UPS 
and Fedex men toil with packages piled high, racing from place to  
place, competing to provide ever better service.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. Postal Service is so bad that it changed its name  
(it used to be Post Office) and logo (from a mailbox to an  
eagle's head) to avoid ridicule. The service gets worse (I'm old  
enough to remember twice-daily delivery), the price always goes  
up (especially on business), and the whining never stops. Can we 
imagine Fedex employees complaining about too much business, as  
the postal people do during the Christmas season?   
  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No, public service is not the Postal Service's strength. But  
it has mastered the art of lobbying. That's why, despite the  
blather about being "revolutionary," this Congress hasn't even  
considered repealing the unamerican laws that prohibit  
first-class mail competition.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like all government bureaucracies, the Postal Service has no  
real owners, and most of its "customers" have no choice. The  
offices are so unpleasant that one of last year's best performing  
stocks was a company that takes your letters and packages to the  
P.O. so you don't have to.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

So the Postal Service blows millions on ads designed to  
bamboozle. One new campaign claims it's "a very businesslike  
business." Why? Because it's so big, the 33rd largest "company"  
in the world, having moved up a notch after the Politburo was  
downsized.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the government claims that its private interests  
are really the public interest, it is busy destroying private  
industries that truly do serve the public. If the Justice  
Department brings suit against a business for "discriminating"  
against some privileged group, for example, it's as good as dead.  
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Worse, Congress has called on the nation's tax-collecting  
public servants to share their jobs with non-government lawyers,  
so they can scarf up more private revenue. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thanks to this perverse "privatization," a private-sector  
profession will be paid by a public-sector agency to loot private  
property for the private interests of phony public servants. Oh,  
for those simpler, better days before government ruined our  
language.

<title>Rockwell: China: Trade Yes, Aid No  -- 4/22/96
</title>

<h2> China: Trade Yes, Aid No 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.</a>
<p>
What's so difficult about China? The political class seems  
intent on reviving the Cold War, but every issue before us can be  
solved by a quick reflection on the basic principles of classical  
liberalism, which happen to coincide with America's traditions as  
well as common sense. The rule with China, as with every other  
country, should be this simple: trade, not aid.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trouble with Most Favored Nation status is that it  
conflates the two categories. It gives the recipient access to  
our markets and ours to theirs, with low tariffs both ways, which  
is as it should be. However, it also makes MFN governments  
eligible for grants, loans, and guarantees from the World Bank  
and the International Monetary Fund. Those are indirectly and  
primarily funded by U.S. taxpayers.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Have these grants and loans ever done any good in the long  
run? There's not a single case. Rich countries have gotten along  
without them just fine. Poor countries get strapped with debt,  
and have to accept the policy terms of the lending agencies. More  
often than not, that means Keynesian-style fiscal policy, heavy  
regulation, laborious labor laws, and tax increases. That is not  
a recipe for prosperity.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So by all means, end aid from these agencies to China, and 
everywhere else. At the same time, there is no good reason to  
impose trade sanctions. They merely restrict the rights of  
American consumers and producers to buy and sell in the most  
favorable places. If that's France and Germany, fine. If it's  
China and Cuba, that's fine too. With the Cold War over, it's  
time to separate economic policy and foreign policy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That the political class is suddenly ganging up on China is  
particularly ironic. Here's a communist government that has  
liberalized its economy to a striking degree. More trade will  
push the process further, and might even ensure some measure of  
political liberalization as well.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet the litany of reasons why China should be considered a  
"rogue state" grows ever longer. Its government squelches civil  
liberties. It doesn't enforce U.S. property rights. It encourages  
abortion. It threatens its neighbors. Bad, bad, China.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But by those standards, the U.S. government looks pretty  
roguish too. Federal police agencies are no well-known respecters  
of human rights. As for property rights, they took quite a  
beating on April 15 this year. The U.S. government routinely  
engages in land seizures in the name swamp protection, and it  
promotes abortion with tax dollars.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Is this, to use Cold War language, the horrible practice of  
seeing a "moral equivalence" between U.S. democratic and foreign 
authoritarian ones? Not at all. As Americans, we have  
a moral obligation to concentrate on the beam in our eye, not the  
splinter in someone else's.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The biggest problem is hypocrisy. We not only trade with,  
but give massive aid to, governments around the world that  
mistreat their own people, kill innocents outside their borders,  
and refuse to recognize even rudimentary liberties. Why single  
out China?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
China may tolerate the copying of films and compact discs.  
The question is: why should American consumers be denied access  
to goods from China because American exporters are unhappy with  
Chinese copyright laws? It is the business of U.S. exporters, not  
the U.S. government, to protect overseas profits.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All of this flows from a simple proposition, the very basis  
of the free enterprise system: economics is the business of  
business, not government. If the U.S. government has any role, it  
is to protect life, liberty, and property here at home. Forcing  
exports on others, punishing evildoers abroad, or centrally  
planning the world trading system only invites trouble.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But isn't China threatening Taiwan, and isn't that grounds  
to wage a trade war? We only started hearing about the grave  
threat to Taiwan a few weeks before the Taiwanese ruling party  
was up for reelection. The central point in its platform is that  
China is a grave threat. Is it? If holding war games off its own  
shores is a hostile act, what about U.S. war games with Japan and  
Korea off China? Indeed, on the threatening of small countries by  
big ones, Panama, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican  
Republic might have something to say.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But let's assume China is planning an invasion of Taiwan,  
highly improbable given the relative balance of military power.  
What then? As regrettable as that might be, the U.S. cannot  
guarantee every State Department-approved border in the world.  
Let Taiwan provide for its own security, as it has amply done. It  
is not up to Americans to be taxed, or die, for foreign regimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time the West tried to force its dominion and  
products on China, the issue was opium, and it led to vast  
unrest, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the eventual communist  
takeover. That brings us to another principle derived from the  
classical-liberal tradition: we cannot fully anticipate the bad  
consequences of government intervention, so we ought to prevent  
it where we can.

<h2>
Pat Buchanan's 'Old Right" Opposed Tariffs
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
 
What kind of conservative is Pat Buchanan? Supporters and  
opponents say that he's bringing back an older tradition, which  
rejects the cosmopolitanism of the National Review 
generation, and hearkens back to the "isolationism" and America  
First movement of the 30s and 40s.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Mr. Buchanan doesn't dispute this, and why should he? The  
Old Right, though widely misunderstood, was a principled band of  
intellectuals and activists, many of them libertarians, who  
fought the "industrial regimentation" of the New Deal, and were  
the first to note that, in America, statism and corporativism are  
inseparable.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, despite an otherwise appealing platform, Mr.  
Buchanan doesn't represent Old Right economic ideals. These  
writers ardently defended capitalism, including big business and  
corporations, celebrated the profit motive, and took a strict  
laissez-faire attitude toward international trade. They loathed  
tariffs, and saw protectionism as a species of socialist  
planning.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Frank Chodorov was a central intellectual figure on the  
Right from the 1920s to the 1950s, editing the early Freeman 
magazine and founding Human Events and the Intercollegiate  
Studies Institute. A prolific writer, Chodorov guided two  
generations of students and activists to the literature of  
liberty, and urged no compromise with the central state.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He proudly wore the label "isolationist" and, like Mr.  
Buchanan today, saw entry into the two world wars as a mistake  
because they bolstered militarism and big government in America.  
To Chodorov, isolationism was "not a political policy," but the  
proper and "natural attitude." People are rightly concerned with  
family and neighbors, he said, not foreign peoples and their  
troubles. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But, as he made clear, Chodorov's isolationism had nothing  
to do with international economics. Free trade with other nations  
is part of the normal working of the economy, which stems from  
being concerned with the well being of our families. Chodorov was  
aghast and angered when some people tried to make "America First"  
mean "Buy American": that is, "economic, rather than political,  
isolationism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Economic isolationism--tariffs, quotas, embargoes, and  
general governmental interference with international trade--is an  
irritant that can well lead to war," he wrote. "To build a trade  
wall around a country is to invite reprisals," and generates  
"misunderstanding and mistrust." To Chodorov, "Free trade is  
natural, protectionism is political."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

T. Flynn, the great journalist and leader of the  
America First Committee, agreed with Chodorov. "The last seventy  
years of American history," he wrote in 1944, "have been a struggle 
between the ideal of free enterprise and the determination to restrain 
and regiment it." Business "comprises the whole immense web of 
producing and distributing enterprises," but tragically, "some men, 
for various reasons, set out to interfere in the natural workings of 
this immense organism."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn condemns domestic industrial planning because it leads  
to trade barriers. "The first condition of a planned economy is  
that it shall be a closed economy," he wrote. That's why  
socialists want "an impenetrable wall around" the nation,  
"keeping out everybody and every kind of goods and striving for a  
complete self-sufficiency. Of course, this is not practical  
anywhere."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Though a nationalist, Flynn understood the difference  
between caring about one's country first and trade restriction,  
which he saw as having a socialist and fascist pedigree. The link  
between protection and planning, he pointed out, was not disputed  
even on the left. To Stuart Chase, the New Dealer who coined the  
term, "national planning and economic nationalism must go  
together or not at all."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Flynn's view, toughened with a right-wing anarchist edge,  
was also that of Albert Jay Nock, the social critic who inspired  
several generations with his biting attacks on collectivism,  
egalitarianism, and modernity. As a writer for Harper's, he  
helped make anti-statism the political center of pre-war American  
conservatism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

He too was against entering any foreign war, and could thus  
be fairly described as an "isolationist." But protectionist? "We  
all now know pretty well," he wrote in 1935, "that the primary  
reason for a tariff is that it enables the exploitation of the  
domestic consumer by a process indistinguishable from sheer  
robbery."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"By putting a tariff against the importation, say, of wool,  
the State permits the domestic wool-producing interests to levy a  
tax upon consumers of wool to the amount of the excess in price  
over the price determined by supply and demand in a free  
competitive market. These interests give the consumer nothing in  
return for the tax; the State gives them as beneficiaries, the  
privilege of levying it, and they accordingly do so."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Felix Morley was more of a traditionalist. He won the hearts  
of conservatives by defecting as editor of the Washington  
Post and later becoming editor of Human Events, as well as  
the author of brilliant books on federalism and foreign policy. 
He was an America Firster, an isolationist, and a right-wing  
populist to boot.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But when it came to free enterprise, there was no  
compromise: it must not stop at the border. "Unrestricted  
competition is essential to economic freedom," he wrote. "Indeed,  
it can be said that competition is freedom, as distinct from  
the personal attribute of liberty." "It follows that in an  
advancing civilization the objective with regard to the market will 
always be the removal of restrictions to trade."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is why Morley doubted that businessmen would be the  
best defenders of the market. They too often seek to protect  
themselves from competition in the name of free enterprise. "Time  
and again," he wrote, "those who argued for competition have, in  
practice, leaned toward monopolistic operations. Advocates of the  
free market have worked openly and surreptitiously for high  
tariffs and other governmental favors." As an example, he cites  
the industrial protectionism of the 19th century that Mr.  
Buchanan now praises.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The preeminent economic theorist of the Old Right was Henry  
Hazlitt. Kicked out of The Nation because he opposed FDR's  
National Recovery Act, he was made editor of The American  
Mercury by H.L. Mencken. During the heyday of Keynesianism,  
Hazlitt thrilled the free-market right with his editorials in  
Newsweek. He was also second to none in his hatred of all  
forms of government intervention, including protectionism and  
economic nationalism.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hazlitt's Economics In One Lesson, still in print after  
fifty years, devotes two chapters to the tissue of fallacies that  
is the case for protectionism and subsidized exports. As Hazlitt  
demonstrates, "The tariff--though it may increase wages above  
what they would have been in the protected industries--must on  
net balance, when all occupations are considered, reduce real  
wages." As a friend of Ludwig von Mises and F.A. von Hayek,  
however, Hazlitt might be considered one of "those damned  
Austrian economists" that Mr. Buchanan warns us against reading.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There were Old Rightists who worried about free  
international trade, but not on Buchananite grounds. Essayist  
Garet Garrett came to favor closed borders because he worried  
about the war potential of forcing foreign consumers to buy  
American products, another policy Mr. Buchanan favors. At the  
same time, big business never had a greater champion than  
Garrett. A biographer rightly called him "Profit's Prophet."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Whatever can be said of Mr. Buchanan's trade theories, they  
are not those of the Old Right. Their intellectual legacy is more  
likely British mercantilism, and that's one import we can do  
without.

<h2>
Hillary's Revenge
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

Hillary Clinton has won a victory in the Senate. The  
Senate's health care bill, which passed unanimously, is not as  
flashy and detailed as her failed legislation. But the central  
principle is the same: the government, one way or another, should  
guarantee health care to everyone.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Recall that Mrs. Clinton found herself on the receiving end  
of a propaganda blitz. She was denounced as a Marxist who wanted  
to centrally plan the economy, destroy small business, and take  
away freedom of choice.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This was sweet music to lovers of free enterprise. Was the  
Republican Party, which in the past has backed big government  
medical reforms, at last making principled arguments? Corporate,  
medical, and insurance lobbies--also soft on government  
intervention--even joined in the attack.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
People and publications not usually prone to criticize  
statism sounded like libertarian purists. Even the New Republic  
ran a detailed, point-by-point attack on the White House plan.  
Thanks to these efforts, we were spared a nightmarish plot to  
nationalize one-seventh of the economy.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And yet, ominously, several provisions--some of the most  
socialistic ones in the Clinton plan--escaped deep criticism. For  
example, insurance companies would be forbidden from refusing, or  
charging higher premiums for, customers who would drive them to  
bankruptcy. That is, insurers could not take account of  
"preexisting conditions," as the lingo has it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zoom forward one year. This provision ends up as the core of  
the Republican health care bill. If automotive or housing  
insurance couldn't "discriminate," costs would zoom and clients  
would have less of an incentive to care for their property. So  
too will this rule destroy the character of insurance in the  
medical industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Real insurance relies on actuarial tables, premiums that  
reflect risk (adjusted for any reason), and carefully grouped  
risk pools. A fat, cigar-smoking coach potato will have higher  
premiums than a member of the high-school swim team. If it is  
illegal to make a distinction, it's not business but welfare.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So title I, section 101 of this bill calls for "Guaranteed  
Availability of Health Coverage." Group health plans "may not  
establish eligibility, continuation, enrollment, or contributions  
requirements" based on "health status, medical condition, claims  
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of  
insurability, or disability of a participants or beneficiary." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is an insurance company supposed to do if it can't  
assess the risk? Just dish out the big bucks. But can an insurer  
discreetly avoid certain professions based on their preponderance  
of sick employees? Nope: an insurance company "may not decline to" 
insure a person or group that demands it.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this system, insurance companies cease to be market  
operations, working on the basis of profit and loss, and instead  
become middlemen in a socialist enterprise. But the Senate will  
take socialism only so far: pregnancy, unlike AIDS and other  
sexually transmitted diseases, is expressly excluded as a  
"pre-existing condition" (I,103,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If people's premiums can't go up and they can't be rejected  
based on bad behavior, there is less to be gained by preventive  
care. That's how the plan eliminates some of the incentives for  
people to take care of themselves and not overuse medical  
services.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The companies doing the insuring are even restricted in  
their ability to quit providing insurance. They have to give 180  
days notice if a plan is going to be discontinued (I,110(b)2).  
Then they have to wait five years before offering the plan again.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Remember the price controls implicit in the Clinton bill?  
You'll find them here too. The Secretary of Health and Human  
Services will devise "Federal standards that limit the variation  
in health insurance premiums" so that they will be "reasonably  
priced" (I,112,(a)).  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Remember the bureaucracies in the Clinton health bill? This  
plan instructs the states, as overseen by the feds, to create  
"Health Plan Purchasing Coalitions" to determine the size and  
demographics of each risk pool (I, 131). The burden of proof is  
on the Coalition to show that it is not "discriminating."  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, this bill differs from the Clinton plan in only two  
ways: it is less ambitious and less honest. The Clinton plan  
included specific provisions that tried to account for every  
possible contingency. The Senate bill asserts broad  
principles--cheap health care for all!--but doesn't bother to  
specify how it's going to come about.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both plans are crazy, but is it wackier to wreck a sector  
with specific socialist instructions or broad socialist  
principles? Is it worse to specify the outcome or rig the game to  
ensure a certain outcome? Both are intolerable, although--as it  
turned out--only one could be enacted.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The bill's unanimous support is a measure not of merit, but  
of hypocrisy. For a year, the Republican Party dragged Hillary  
Clinton's name through the mud. Fine. She deserved it. But she  
also deserves an apology from everyone who denounced her bill and  
backed this one.

<title>Rockwell: Oil in the Crossfire -- 4/30/96</title>

<h2>
Oil in the Crossfire
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>


Now that National Hate AT&T Month is over, it's time to  
despise the oil companies. Call them any name you want: gougers,  
extortionists, or greed merchants. Make them the national enemy.  
It's a human rights violation to raise a price.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The occasion of the newest anti-capitalist hysteria is a  
one-year, 10% increase in gasoline prices at the pump. Never mind  
the underlying economic causes. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary  
is investigating the oil industry to discover who's getting rich  
at the driver's expense.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not to be left out, Connecticut's two Democratic  
Senators--Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman--are demanding that  
Attorney General Janet Reno knock the heads of oil companies with  
a stump. Heaven knows she can do it, even without resorting to  
tanks and CS gas. Anti-trust law can be bent to make any price  
pattern appear illegal.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For his part, President Clinton has decided to deal with the  
national emergency by dumping 12 million barrels onto the market  
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All this reveals profound ignorance. Prices respond  
immediately to information about future demand and supply. If a  
credible announcement of a government oil sale didn't reduce the  
price, selling the oil won't do it either.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recall that this administration complains about foreigners  
dumping their goods on American markets at below cost. However, 
when it's our own government doing the dumping, it's not a  
vicious practice, but a responsible economic policy.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market specializes in allocating supplies over time via  
the price system. When supply is low and demand is high, prices  
rise to induce new drilling and distribution. In light of higher 
gasoline prices, consumers are already changing some summer  
travel plans, another market response.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The market's price system works so well it doesn't need  
management at all. We don't have a strategic shoe or chicken  
reserve, yet, somehow, we walk and eat. But it's not free-market  
logic that's driving Mr. Clinton's blue light special. He's  
looking to profit politically--we might even call it vote  
gouging--at the expense of private industry.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A far better response--if highly atypical given their sorry  
record this year--comes from Republicans who are demanding a  
repeal of Mr. Clinton's 4.3 cent gas tax increase.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Democrats say the savings from a tax cut won't be "passed  
on" to the consumer. These are the same people who said a tax  
increase would be "passed on" two years ago. Not only that, they  
hoped it would be. In those days, you see, liberals agitated for  
higher gasoline prices as a way of inducing consumers to less, drive 
less, and "pollute" less.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Liberals love oil price increases, especially when they're  
caused by taxes. It's the best of both worlds: people have less  
fun and government gets to siphon off new revenue.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The last time the nation went bonkers over gas prices was  
during the Gulf War. The U.S. government jeopardized imports from  
the entire Arab world, and President Bush (A.B. economics, Yale  
University) was amazed and alarmed to see prices go up. Like Mr.  
Clinton now, he attempted to jawbone companies into cutting  
prices. Corporate executives feared for their bottom lines.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There is always--as hard as government officials find this  
to accept--a purpose behind market-driven changes in price. If a  
good is more scarce, its price will rise so that people can know  
to use less of it. If it is more plentiful, its price will fall 
so consumers can know to live it up. Tampering with the system  
imposes unpredictable distortions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a country built by free enterprise, there is still mass  
ignorance on what accounts for a price increase in an industry.  
It's not greed, gouging, or illicit gas guzzling. It's either an  
increase in demand, a decrease in supply, or a response to money  
creation by the Fed. No use looking anywhere else.

Just how badly do we want prices to fall? The best and  
surest way is to have free trade in oil. And, yes, that includes  
with Iraq, a country whose people have suffered immeasurably from  
the U.S.'s cruel and unusual sanctions.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To end the war on the market before it escalates further, we  
need an end to embargoes, taxes, regulations, and inflation, all  
of which impede the right of Americans to determine their own  
strategic petroleum reserves.

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservative pundits are having the time of their lives 
blasting Bob Dole, with several calling on him to drop out before 
the convention. The stated reason: his lifetime of politicking 
and state-building has put him hopelessly out of touch with the 
public's desire for real change in Washington. If he becomes the 
nominee, they say, Republicans will lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps so. At the same time, it's not fair to single out 
Mr. Dole for such scrutiny, while the leaders of the current 
Congress get off scot-free. After all, Newt Gingrich, Richard 
Armey, and Trent Lott are as much creatures of Washington as Mr. 
Dole. Their reluctance to upset the system that created them and 
sustains their power is what dashed the early hopes that this 
Congress would do something extraordinary. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that the public has not been impressed, the 
Republican leadership is at last getting defensive about its 
record. Mr. Armey, the House Majority Leader, was particularly 
incensed when a news story from the <i>New York Times</i> suggested, 
without further elaboration, that this Congress "has not 
accomplished much else despite its grand early promises" other
than welfare reform.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While hardly anyone would dispute this (even if the welfare 
reform looks piddling), Mr. Armey has taken grave offense. In 
thinking this way, he says, we are ignoring "the truth about the 
accomplishments of this Congress." He proceeds with a strange 
list of items that merely remind us of the extent that this 
Congress has indeed squandered the opportunity of a century. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey says "we achieved more than $53 billion in 
discretionary savings." But this is only an "accomplishment" if 
you keep track of the new additions to Congress's Dictionary of 
Budgetary Wordplay. The term "savings" here does not mean cuts, 
which Congress promised, or even cuts in the normal rate of 
increase. It refers to the difference between two artificial 
forecasts that Congress itself controls. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can try this technique at home. List all the purchases 
you have made this month, no matter how frivolous or how much you 
had to borrow to make them. Measure that against how much you 
would spend if you had  really  splurged. The difference between 
the two is how much you "saved" last month. This budgetary device 
can make your savings rate skyrocket--at least in your own mind. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The term "savings" is smoke and mirrors, while the official 
record will show that this Congress increased total government 
spending at the usual rate. The Congressional leadership has 
accepted and reinforced the Washington rule that spending must 
always increase at the rate of inflation, plus the rate of 
growth, for a total of 5 to 6 percent per year.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sensing that some people may be on to this game, Mr. Armey 
turns to a page in the Art of Political Dissembling. He says 
Congress has balanced, by the year 2002, that "part of the budget 
that Congress controls." Let's say a three-pack-a-day smoker 
tries the same trick. If he announces "I have quit smoking by 
2002, at least the part I control," do you believe him?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Ronald Reagan was president, Republicans heaped scorn 
on the Democratic Congress when it claimed that it only 
controlled a portion of the budget. Now the Republican Congress 
uses the same implausible defense of its profligacy. If the 
Congress doesn't control the purse strings, who does?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While claiming not to control the budget, the Congressional 
leadership is also trying to evade other responsibilities. It 
passed an unconstitutional "line-item veto" which not only 
tramples on the separation of powers, but also vastly enhances
the political power of the next president, who will likely be 
Congress's supposed opponent. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other ways, Congress has stepped up government power, 
even over matters that should remain within its own internal 
purview. For example, in the words of Mr. Armey, the Congress 
made itself "subject to the same workplace standards and 
practices as the private sector." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sound good? In fact, there was a reason why Congress has 
never been subject to such laws. They are enforced by executive 
branch agencies like the Department of Labor, the Justice 
Department, and the EEOC. Private business knows how menacing 
these agencies can be, even to the point of determining workplace
composition with class-action lawsuits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already, individual Congressional offices are feeling the 
pressure to hire a "diverse" office, complete with quotas and 
affirmative action. This not only wrecks staff morale and 
cripples efforts to repeal these laws. It subjects Congressional 
offices to a subtle and corrupt domination by the president 
himself. Already, some offices have been pressured to end morning 
prayers for fear of violating the first amendment. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the New Deal, we have lived under an imperial 
executive that contradicts both the letter and spirit of the 
original Constitution (which instituted Congressional supremacy).
With these two acts--the line-item veto and regulation of 
legislative offices--executive-branch control is enhanced to 
dangerous new levels. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Armey claims that the agricultural bill represents 
revolutionary change, but here again is more bluster than 
substance. The farm bill merely changed the regulations to ensure 
agribusiness subsidies continue to flow in times when price 
supports has ceased to be profitable. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, there are the actions that Mr. Armey has pretended to 
forget about: tacitly approving the bailout of Mexico, a budget and 
power expansion for the BATF, and the authorization of privatized tax 
collection (tax farming, it was once called). Each case represents an 
increase in the degree and scope of federal government power, exactly 
the opposite of what this Congress promised. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now it appears that the leadership is accepting the newest 
conventional wisdom of media-land: Congress needs to pass some 
more legislation before the election to impress voters. Thus the 
leadership is conspiring to give us Hillary-lite in the form of 
new health insurance mandates and regulations, as well as an 
egregious increase in the minimum wage, guaranteed to raise the 
unemployment rate after this session closes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bob Dole deserves the aspersions being cast upon him, so 
does the entire Congressional leadership. If voters give them a 
whop on the nose this November, it won't be undeserved. It's time 
for men like Mr. Armey to 'fess up, so their coming political 
losses won't be interpreted as a verdict on the public's view 
that most of what the federal government does has outlived its 
usefulness.

An Insight Look
 By Thomas A. Schatz


The Oklahoma City tragedy was felt by every American.  Sympathy for 
the victims, particularly the innocent children, has hit hard.  The 
outpouring of emotion has been and will continue to be overwhelming, 
because Americans care and will do anything and give everything they 
can to help the victims and their families.

All indications are that some members of right-wing militias were 
involved.  Yet, even before all the victims were accounted for and 
properly mourned, some Americans began the "guilt-by-association" 
game.  First, all members of right-wing militia groups were at fault.  
Then, conservative groups of any kind were at fault.  The president 
implicated the radio talk show hosts and called for an end to "reckless 
speech" and  "loud and angry voices," asking Americans to speak out 
against "purveyors of hatred and division."  Then, heated anti-
government rhetoric was to blame for driving the fragile and twisted 
psyches of Timothy McVeigh and his cohorts over the edge.  Carl Rowan 
blamed Senate Majority Leader Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  
Radio talk shows and conservative politicians lashed back, accusing 
liberals of using the tragedy for their own political ends.  And the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation are said to share complicity because of the shootout with 
Randy Weaver and the Waco tragedy.  If anything, this display of 
shameful rhetoric and finger-pointing illustrates America's inability to 
deal with the issue of accountability.

In the wake of such sadness and grief, it is unseemly, grotesque even, for 
politicians and other public figures to make themselves the central figures 
in this tragedy.  And we should know from experience that blaming 
people simply because they hold similar views to those espoused by the 
alleged perpetrators is problematic.

Those who marched or otherwise protested against the war in Vietnam in 
an exercise of their First Amendment rights (including Bill Clinton) 
watched in horror when four students were killed at Kent State.  They 
shivered after learning of the Weather Underground campus bombings.  
After decades of oppression and discrimination, the Black Panthers 
became more militant and armed themselves.  Individuals from many of 
these movements committed crimes.  But in both of these cases, and 
many others throughout history, Americans didn't allow the misguided 
actions of a few extremists to annul or strip away the legitimate aims of 
the many.  

If one wants to make a connection between taxpayers, members of 
conservative organizations, radio talk show hosts, and the nuts that blew 
up the federal building in Oklahoma City, one must also make that same 
connection between taxpayers, members of liberal organizations, militant 
environmentalists, and the unabomber who struck again in California last 
week; or taxpayers, members of Christian fundamentalist churches, 
militant anti-abortionists, and the individual who shot the doctor in 
Pensacola, Florida.  The only real link in all of these examples is among 
the extremes on all sides and their willingness, for whatever twisted 
reasons, to resort to violence and murder.

The Oklahoma City bombing should neither be used as an excuse to 
attack the motivation of groups that seek less intrusive and more efficient 
government, nor as an excuse to perpetuate government programs which 
have simply become useless.  The budget debate, to take place 
imminently in the House and Senate, must go on.  In fact, if anything, 
that debate should be even more focused now on the proper role of 
government and the priorities that must be established for the future.

It's time to mourn, but it's also time to make decisions that will affect the 
standard of living for our children and grandchildren. 

Blunt talk, even when it seems harsh, has always been an element of 
American political discourse.  Tough action on the deficit must be taken 
on Capitol Hill.  Deliberating the merits of where and how to balance the 
budget will naturally evoke emotions on both sides of the aisle, especially 
now.  Eliminating obsolete programs, closing down entire departments, 
and reducing the massive increases in federal spending scheduled to take 
effect over the next several years is essential to the health and welfare of 
the American people and should not be inferred as a blanket abhorrence 
of all government, and certainly not the people that work within the 
system.

CAGW's Prime Cuts contains 651 recommendations to save $1.45 trillion 
over the next five years, including many that go back to the Grace 
Commission.  More than half come right from Congress' own 
Congressional Budget Office, and have been ignored.  President Clinton 
is right to call for increased law enforcement personnel and concentrated 
efforts to prevent domestic and international terrorism; that's an 
expenditure that CAGW can certainly support.  In fact, it's the sort of 
priority and choice that must be made on a much broader scale -- for 
every federal department, agency, and individual program.  That's what 
taxpayers are asking, and that's the task that must be carried out.

Keeping Congress on the Cutting Edge  
 By Thomas A. Schatz  
  
 
As the budget debate heats up on Capitol Hill, it is clear that  
sustaining the momentum of the first 100 days will be tough sledding  
for Republican leaders.  The rhetoric from the opponents of change has  
been and will continue to be harsh, unfounded, and misleading.  Inside  
the halls of Congress, the hand-wringing and whining at the undoing of  
years of wasteful and ineffective programs would make one believe the  
country will go down the drain in the near future.  
 
But taxpayers still want the revolution which began on November 8th of  
1994 with the election of a Republican Congress to be sustained.   
Outside the Washington beltway, support for reform remains strong.  
 
The truth is, without the changes being wrought in the new Congress,  
we will hit rock bottom and devastate the standard of living for  
future generations.  
 
The interest on the national debt is now almost twice as large as the  
budget deficit.  The president's budget projects a deficit of $192  
billion in fiscal year 1995 and an interest payment of $334 billion.   
In other words, without the interest on the national debt, there would  
be a surplus of $142 billion!  Over the next ten years, we could run a  
surplus every year if we did not have to pay the interest -- which  
will range from $330 billion to more than $500 billion -- and reduce  
the debt by $1,355 billion.  That, of course, is assuming that  
interest rates remain as projected.  If they go higher (remember a  
prime rate of nearly 21 percent in late 1980?), the results could be a  
Mexico-type disaster, where other countries will have to bail out the  
United States.  
 
But the forces of the status quo are doing everything in their power  
to fight the knights in shining armor -- both Republicans and  
Democrats -- who are rescuing the future of our nation.  
 
Here's how the truth is being twisted:  
 
During the debate on the balanced budget amendment (BBA), the  
naysayers claimed that Social Security must be exempt.  The real  
threat to Social Security, as expressed by Sen. John Breaux, a  
Democrat from Louisiana, is if it is not exempt.  Keeping the program  
out of the BBA would give Congress the opportunity to add any program  
it wanted to "Social Security," which would undermine the basic old  
age, survivors and disability payments now provided to beneficiaries.   
For example, Congress could set up a special fund for student aid  
under Social Security, or for farmers, or veterans.  Already, Social  
Security disability funds are being used for cash payments to drug  
addicts and alcoholics, a well-publicized abuse of our tax dollars.   
Do we really want to leave that program untouchable under a balanced  
budget amendment?  And if a program is included in the exemption under  
Social Security, it is likely to expand dramatically as has been the  
practice in Washington.  The red herring of Social Security in the  
debate over the BBA was the first major volley in the battle to turn  
around the effort to eliminate the waste and the deficit.  
 
Social Security doesn't have to be involved at all in the budget  
debate: Representatives Jerry Solomon (R-N.Y.) and Mark Neumann (R- 
Wisc.) have proposed a budget that would truly remove Social Security  
from the furor of how to rein in federal spending.  Their plan would  
not only balance the budget in five years by freezing all spending at  
current levels, it would eliminate the debt in thirty years by  
increasing spending by one percent less than revenues through the year  
2025 in their budget proposal.  Their list of options includes $70  
billion more than is necessary to balance the budget within five  
years.  
 
According to opponents, the provisions of the House welfare bill will  
result in millions of children being left in the streets, and massive  
homelessness and starvation.  But these alarmists failed to note that  
spending more than $5 trillion since 1965 in the war against poverty  
has not solved the problem.  The House bill moves in a new direction,  
which is apparently too much for the defenders of the status quo to  
handle.  
 
Spending on welfare will increase by only $60 billion less than  
projected in President Clinton's FY 1996 budget.  The school lunch  
program will increase by four percent per year instead of six percent  
per year over the next five years.  This is fiscal restraint, not  
heartlessness.  Claiming that children will be starving on the streets  
is just a little too melodramatic to hold water.  
 
The truth will win out, and the waste will be cut.  But the job is far  
from over.  We must preserve the future for our children and  
grandchildren.

DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT:  WHAT WENT WRONG 
 By: Thomas Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government Waste 
 

This past March, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste 
(CCAGW) held a regional taxpayers' conference in Denver.  It's ironic 
that the leading group fighting waste had to fly into a prime example 
of why America is currently strangled by a $4.8 trillion national debt 
-- the new Denver International Airport (DIA).  Assessing what went 
wrong with the Denver Airport is critically important.    

According to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation 
and the General Accounting Office (GAO), $685 million will be spent by 
the federal government on the Denver Airport through fiscal year (FY) 
2001.  Every single dollar of this $685 million will be wasted.   This 
is not an overstatement because this airport was not needed.  Plain 
and simple.  Stapleton Airport could have been upgraded to accommodate 
any larger planes that might land in Denver in the future.  Extending 
runways at Stapleton would have been inexpensive and quick.  But 
because this country has an edifice complex, a new structure had to be 
built.  When a family has a tight budget, they don't go to the opera 
or drive an expensive car.  The federal government has to realize that 
we cannot afford luxuries, especially when there isn't a need for such 
a luxury. 
 
Just as the federal government has become adept at deficits, so will 
DIA.  The GAO projected a cumulative operating deficit of  $230 
million by its February opening.  
 
The DIA is government waste -- at its worst.  DIA is not an example of 
pork-barrel waste.  The kind of government waste that occurred in 
Denver is more insidious.  The back-room politicking and the 
misinformation that occurred is an embarrassment to the federal 
government as well as the local government.   

The new 53-square-mile airport is larger than the District of 
Columbia.  The airport is 25 miles from downtown.  A cab ride will 
increase from $7 to Stapleton to $50 to DIA.  There is currently no 
supporting infrastructure to serve the new airport.  Access to rental 
cars and hotels is extremely difficult.  These are the general 
problems.  Here are the specific problems with DIA.   

The public was shut out of the process, and no user or public needs 
were defined or documented.  The politicians limited the vote to the 
core city, or about 10 percent of airport users.  Denver is a 
relatively small city of 460,000, down six percent in population in 
the 1980's.  Denver is not among the top 400 cities worldwide, yet the 
city set out to build the "World's Largest Airport."  Only about 70 
gates out of 200 are actually in operation at DIA.  A dozen or so 
gates are not in operation because of a lack of covered jetways.  Thus 
incoming flights are delayed.  
 
The Denver Airport has come to symbolize the reckless manner in which 
federal construction is carried out in America.  Because the airport 
is eligible for formula grants, money is not awarded based on merit.  
If this were a project that was being funded by a private financial 
institution, more scrutiny would have gone into the planning, 
implementation and construction of this airport.  The federal 
government should not be providing an open checkbook for construction 
based on the fact that it creates jobs.   The $685 million that the 
federal government will spend through 2001 could mean $1,489 in tax 
relief for every resident of Denver. 

There was no need for a new airport in Denver.  During the 1986-1989 
planning period, Denver's share of the U.S. air travel market dropped 
53 percent -- from 3.8 percent in 1986 to 2.57 percent in 1990 (1994 
is estimated at 2.6 percent).  However, during those years, the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Denver forecast that DIA 
would be the fastest-growing airport in the U.S., with 50 million 
passengers by 1995, and the second-busiest by 2000.  According to the 
Air Transportation Association (ATA), Denver also dropped from 8th to 
19th in U.S air cargo tonnage during the past five years.  The ATA has 
never included Denver in the "Table of Top 30 U.S. Domestic Air Travel 
Markets."  Top listings are high population cities and vacation 
centers.  Denver is neither. 
 
According to Mayor Pea in Volume I of the 1987 Airport Report, 
"Stapleton had the best history of low delays.  Stapleton was ranked 
number five in traffic and number nine in delays."  The Pea 
administration in 1988 decided to trash Stapleton, then one of the 
best airports in the world, to build a totally new airport for $1.5 
billion.  Mr. Pea's 1989 Airport Report claimed "Stapleton was grid 
locking the nation," and by 1996 "is expected to lead the delay list 
with 158,000 hours annually."   Federal funding for DIA was to be $500 
million, and the "Stapleton site would be disposed of over several 
years to raise more than a half-billion dollars."   The projected cost 
is now more than $4.9 billion.   

The bottom line is:  DIA is expensive and unnecessary.  The new Denver 
Airport should not have been built.  The way that it was built is an 
embarrassment to representative government at all levels.   
 
What will the real losses be at DIA?  How soon will the losses eat up 
the reserves set aside to pay the bondholders?  Who will pay for the 
bailout -- the city and county of Denver, Colorado's taxpayers, or the 
federal government?  Who will be left holding the bag when this 
airport fails?  The American taxpayer will be left in the lurch again.

The Long Hot Summer Ahead   
 Thomas A. Schatz 
 Citizens Against Government Waste
 May 18, 1995 
 

 Outsiders usually aren't surprised -- and often think it appropriate  
-- when they learn that much of Washington was built on a swamp.  
While that fact only partially accounts for the hot gases that tend to 
swirl here, this summer promises to be stickier than most, with 
rhetorical fireworks flying that could dwarf the pyrotechnics on the 
4th of July.    

 Freon will be in short supply as the battle of the budget burns 
through the summer and into September.  The deficit hawks, promising a 
balanced budget by 2002, will square off against the special interests 
and sentinels of the status quo, who, as one Republican leader has 
said, have nothing to offer but fear itself.  At stake are the hearts 
and minds of everyday Americans and the political high ground as we 
move into an election year.   

 While every battle seems decisive from the perspective of the 
interlocked combatants, this time it's no exaggeration.  The outcome 
will determine whether future Americans are born debt-free, whether 
the growth of government can be reversed, whether the will of average 
taxpayers can prevail over the more focused energies of special 
interests, and whether Americans are still capable of sacrificing in 
the short term to safeguard the future.   

 The balanced budget proposals recently put forward -- reductions in 
spending of $1.4 trillion in the House and $961 billion in the Senate 
over seven years -- provide a game plan only, establishing broad 
budgetary parameters.  The specific cuts and final shape of the 
package will be hashed out during the summer.  Which components live 
or die will be determined in part by the war of words, by the ebb and 
flow of public opinion.     

 Even if every cut or reduction in growth being proposed survives, 
government spending will still grow from $1.53 trillion this year to 
$1.8 trillion in 2002.  Social Security spending, the "third rail" of 
American politics, is off the table.  Medicare (which will be bankrupt 
by 2002 without reform) will grow as well, but at a more manageable 
rate than 10 percent a year, its current pace.  At least one and 
perhaps as many as three federal departments could be eliminated 
altogether.  Hundreds of anachronistic agencies and programs will fall 
by the wayside.  These, in short, are some of the most dramatic 
changes in the size and scope of government since the heady days of 
the Great Society.  Only this time, contraction is the goal, rather 
than expansion.   

 What avenues will be taken to arrive at a smaller, more affordable 
government?  The first is privatization -- as first proposed by the 
Grace Commission more than a decade ago.  As the late J. Peter Grace 
recognized, there are many public entities that could stand alone as 
private, profit-making ventures.  Capitol Hill budget cutters are 
looking to privatize the Federal Aviation Administration, the Naval 
and Strategic Petroleum Reserves, and the National Helium Reserves.  
Also likely to be sold off are the nation's five Power Marketing 
Administrations, which sell power generated by federally-built 
hydroelectric facilities.  To this list, Citizens Against Government 
Waste would add the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Weather 
Service, the space shuttle program, and the military commissary 
system.   

 Next is consolidation --  putting the government's self-duplicating 
and redundant functions under a single roof and reversing the 
politically-driven proliferation of cabinet-level agencies.  Should we 
do away with the Department of Energy, created in response to the 
energy crisis of the 1970's, its responsibility for nuclear weapons 
labs and facilities could easily be subsumed by the Department of 
Defense.  The Federal Highway Administration and the National Highway 
Safety Administration should be merged.  The military's four, separate 
health-care bureaucracies should be placed under single management.  
And there's much more consolidation that could be done.   

 When all else fails, there's always termination.  It's been said that 
there's nothing in the world more permanent than a temporary federal 
program.  The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is a prime 
example.  Thirty years after being launched as a component of Lyndon 
Johnson's Great Society, the ARC serves today as little more than a 
pork-barrel for opportunistic politicians.  Three-quarters of a 
million dollars in ARC "anti-poverty" funds will be spent this year 
helping to build a practice facility for the NFL Carolina Panthers at 
a private college in Spartanburg, South Carolina, one of the most 
affluent counties in that state.  The Economic Development 
Administration, another anachronistic agency that should be 
terminated, has chipped in $500,000 more for the stadium.  The 
Interstate Commerce Commission, the bureaucracy that wouldn't die and 
occupies itself today publishing pamphlets about how to start a small 
railroad, also begs for a wooden stake through the heart.  There are 
many others that need to be added to the Endangered Bureaucracies 
List.   

 Another concept gaining popularity in Washington is "devolution," 
which is short-hand for returning power, money, and responsibility for 
administering certain programs back to the states.  The states, each 
working as individual laboratories, or incubators for innovation, will 
manage these programs more efficiently.  If all goes according to 
plan, Medicaid will be delivered to the states as a block grant, 
letting them dispense it as they see fit, as will food stamps.  Other 
welfare reform measures will also be downloaded to the state level.   

 Finally, even if the size of the federal government is reduced, much 
more can be done to make it run more like a business.  While not very 
"sexy," financial management reform is essential if we want the most 
efficient government for the money.  Unless there is full 
implementation of the Chief Financial Officers Act, and the 
bureaucracy is compelled to deliver timely, trustworthy financial 
reports, the ship of state sails in a fog and our leaders have no way 
to know which reforms are working and which aren't.   

 The road to a balanced budget won't be without its potholes: the 
whole effort may succumb to politics as usual and break down before it 
even gets going.  To succeed, many sacred cows will have to be put out 
to pasture.  Many old ways of thinking about government will have to 
be discarded.  We'll have to forge ahead even when the Chicken Littles 
and special interests say that the sky is falling.  After decades of 
saying "Yes," Washington's political class will have to bring itself 
to say "No."  In turn, voters will have to reward those who have the 
courage to say "No," holding up fiscal prudence rather than 
piggishness as a virtue, and learn to stop turning to the federal 
government for the solution to every imaginable problem.  An America 
increasingly fractured into adversarial special interests, each 
fighting for a piece of the pie, will have to find a way to coalesce 
around a new set of affordable national priorities.   

 In short, the era of governmental limits and fiscal responsibility 
won't be born without a long, painful, and noisy labor.

<h3>HUD:  BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz </a><p>
<hr></center>
It is heartening to hear Congress is considering the elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  It is heartening to see that someone in Washington has figured out that 
Washington does not have all the answers and it is time to try something else.<p> 
HUD was created in 1965 out of several federal agencies concerned with housing, mortgage finance and urban issues.  HUD was formed to address an emerging urban crisis and a growing underclass, subject to squalid housing conditions, crime, unemployment, eroding families and limited educational achievement.<p>   
As originally conceived, HUD was an integral part of the "War on Poverty," which to date has cost $5 trillion.  Our urban problems have not markedly improved during the 30-year war, and many would argue that conditions have grown worse.  Life in the roughest parts of our cities is similar to Hobbes' state of nature:  nasty, brutish and short!  <p> 
Since the $8 billion HUD scandal in 1989, the words "financial mismanagement" and HUD have become synonymous.  In 1984, the Grace Commission warned of financial disasters stemming from HUD's fundamental flaw.  According to the Grace Commission, HUD is "a financial institution with a social mission," and the emphasis on its social goals "resulted in a higher priority on program execution at the expense of the internal management requirements normally associated with a financial institution."  Sound financial management is secondary to spending. <p>   
Since 1990, HUD has been featured prominently in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) "high risk" program, which lists by department the federal government's fundamental financial management weaknesses.  HUD's financial management systems for monitoring low-income housing assistance are so bad that HUD cannot assure taxpayers that their taxes are used for eligible recipients, or that there is adequate fund control for more than $100 billion in long-term contractual funding serving 3 million families.  The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance fund for single family housing loans may not be sufficient to cover losses.  Currently, FHA has in force $303 billion of insurance, but it may not be able to pay potential claims without seeking higher appropriations from Congress.  Also cited are 106 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), accounting for 17 percent of all PHA housing units, which have been identified as troubled.  Taxpayers cannot be "assured that public housing funds achieve intended purposes."  PHAs administer more than half of HUD's budget.   <p>
Not only is HUD wasteful and ineffective, it is a financial liability.  Any private corporation in the position of the federal government would have done something about the department long ago.<p> 
HUD's failure to resolve its 30-year internal conflict between its role as a financial institution and its social goals has prompted freshmen House Republicans, led by Representatives Sam Brownback (R-
Kan.) and Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), and a Senate task force, chaired by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) and Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), to recommend HUD's elimination. <p>  
The recently released House bill, known as "The Federal Housing Reform and Local Empowerment Act," proposes to replace the existing public housing and housing assistance with a voucher program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Under the proposal, state governments are given the options of participating in the HHS program, running their own voucher program, or setting up their own public housing program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would save $17 billion in budget authority over five years. <p>
The bill also consolidates many of HUD's programs into two block grant programs:  the Housing and Development Block Grant and the Special Populations Block Grant, both of which will be administered by HHS.  Other programs will either be eliminated, transferred to other government agencies, or privatized. <p>
Earlier this year, the Administration recognized that something had to be done to save HUD from the scalpels of Republican budget hawks.  As part of the vice president's reinvention program, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros laid out the administration's strategy for saving the department.  Cisneros proposed consolidating 60 HUD programs into three community and housing funds, creating a voucher system for public housing, and converting FHA into a government-owned corporation 
to reduce costs.  According to OMB, the administration's proposal would save $770 million over five years.  That's less than five percent of the savings from the congressional reform bill. <p>
The "reinvention strategy," which has become a trademark of the Clinton administration, is an attempt to protect favorite programs and departments from budget cuts and taxpayer criticism, under the guise 
of improving the federal bureaucracy.  For the Clinton administration, reinvention substitutes for true reform.  More often than not, the rhetoric of reinvention has become an argument for the status quo and 
an assurance to special interests that business-as-usual can continue.<p>     
This rearguard action was recently rejected by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who said that the "American people do not want to reinvent government, they want to reduce it."  He added that taxpayers, "[D]on't want to manage the bureaucracy better, they want to shrink the bureaucracy.  And they don't want people dependent upon government, they want people empowered." <p>
HUD has had its 30-year trial run.   It failed.   It's time to downsize, devolve, privatize and terminate HUD.

<title>The Peanut Shell Game</title>

<h2>The Peanut Shell Game</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b> By:  Thomas A. Schatz: President, Citizens Against Government Waste</b>
<p>   
Since the days of the Great Depression, American farming communities have lived under the umbrella of government subsidies.  These assistance measures, initiated because of unstable market conditions, create strong dependency as farmers cling to the benefits of government intervention.     
<p>  
As a result of these programs, the American farmer is enriched and capitalizes on his position, while substantially distorting the agricultural market.  Through quotas and government handouts, farmers receive above-market prices, crop failure relief, and engage in a feudalistic method of production.  For the taxpayer and consumer,   
agricultural subsidy programs increase prices and waste tax dollars through needless expenditures.   
<p>
Established in 1933 as part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the peanut subsidy program stabilized agricultural income through price supports and production control.  Subsidies were welcome because one-fourth of the U.S. population resided in rural areas and farm earnings were well below national average income statistics, constituting a mere 53 percent of a nonfarm family's salary.  In 1933, the Chairman   
of the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Marvin Jones (D-Texas), believed in the necessity of the bill, but noted that the President "would surrender such programs when the emergency (was) past."  In 1934, FDR's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, said, "The present program for readjusting productive acreage to market requirements is admittedly but a temporary method of dealing with an emergency.  It could not be relied upon as a permanent means of keeping farm production in line with market requirements."   
<p>
The emergency is over and the dynamics of farming have changed.  The number of farms have decreased by 69 percent, from 6.8 million farms in 1935  to 2 million farms today.  More importantly, the average income of a farm family now exceeds $39,000, higher than a nonfarm family's average income.  With the number of farms decreasing and the stabilization of agricultural income, programs such as peanut   
subsidies are relics of a bygone era.    
<p>
Peanuts are an important political and financial cash crop in the South.  The "Peanut Belt" stretches from Tidewater, Virginia to the New Mexican plateau and produces 5 billion pounds of peanuts, with an estimated value of $1.4 billion.  The political consequences outweigh the financial when it comes to eradicating the peanut program.   
<p>
Administered through the USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the peanut program consists of two mandates. First, the program controls the domestic supply of peanuts through a  poundage quota system.  This Soviet-style regulatory approach sets limits on production and allocates who should produce the specified amount.  Second, by restraining the domestic supply through the quota   
system, the government sets a minimum selling price for all domestic sales.  With a domestic support price of $714 per ton compared to a  world price of $494 per ton, domestic prices are 44.5 percent higher than the average world market price.  Domestic buyers must pay this higher price.  Subsidies are in direct contrast to the American ideal of free trade, which embraces the lowest cost and most efficient   
producer.   
<p>
The federal government is merely evoking a feudalistic system that benefits a few large farms while suppressing the rest.  Although anyone can grow peanuts, only those who have quota land can grow peanuts for domestic, price-supported use.  Thus, non-quota owners must either rent land that is part of the quota system, or settle for   exportation at the world market price.  Seventy percent of quota  
holders rent their land to peanut farmers, making $208 million a year in rental fees without growing one single peanut.  Contrary to popular political folklore, small farmers are not benefiting from the peanut program.  Currently, 80 percent of the quotas to grow domestic peanuts are owned by 20 percent of peanut farmers.   
<p>
To arrive at the appropriate price support amount, the government uses  the national average production cost.  Based on increases in the prices paid by producers for commodities and services, interest, taxes, and wage rates, the government then deciphers an increased fair price without considering the costs of producing peanuts.  In an  absurd twist of fate, if peanut production costs drop, the fixedsupport price still might rise, based on the entire U.S. average of  production costs.  Historically, the gap between quota support prices and costs has increased every year.   
<p>
Government control does not stop at the quotas and price supports. The USDA uses these two prescriptions for further market interruptions.  First, under law, peanut farmers may sell their peanuts directly to the government instead of market buyers.    
Regardless of crop conditions, peanut farmers have a guaranteed buyer-- the federal government -- at or above the inflated domestic price.  If the government cannot sell all of the collected peanuts to the public sector, then the rest will be sold for oil or meal at substantially lower prices.  In the end, the government picks up the price difference between the high price support and the market price.   
<p> 
Money spent by both the consumer and the government is not worth these results.  Every American farmer deserves a free market in which to develop efficiency and gain market share through his own right, not a government-given quota.  According to the General Accounting Office, consumers spend an additional $513 million a year for peanut products such as Peanut Butter and Kung Pao Chicken, excessive profits   
transferred to the peanut producers.  In the long run, these high   prices will hurt the peanut industry as consumers look to other lower-priced products.  In 1990, there was a 10 percent drop in the food industry's demand for peanuts.    
<p>
The $119 million spent by the federal government on the peanut program annually doesn't even take into account the administrative fees. The  price tag for the peanut program exceeds $200 million when administrative costs are calculated.     
<p>
This subsidy must end.  Consumers and taxpayers must not foot the bill   for this absurd manipulation of our strong hallowed market economy. This shell game of peanut subsidies must be cracked wide open and stopped.

<b>President, Citizens Against Government Waste By:  Thomas A. Schatz</b>
<p> 
Much of the nation has been under the oppressive grip of a heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.  These sweltering days of summer are no match for the oppressive burden of federal regulations that have gripped the nation for years.  Come October, the cool fall air will replace the stagnant heat, but unnecessary and ridiculous federal regulations will continue to cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion per year. 
<p>
In its unrelenting leadership role, the House of Representatives is actively trying to get rid of burdensome regulations and return the nation to common sense and fiscal freedom.  The Regulatory Reform Bill, which was signed on February 24, 1995, allows property owners to seek compensation when a federal regulatory action has taken place and improves the process by which federal regulations are developed and 
issued.   
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) again took on ridiculous regulations when he proposed "Corrections Days" earlier this year.  Corrections Days, which passed with a vote of 271 to 146 on June 20, 1995, is a mechanism to streamline the termination of silly regulations.  The House will be holding corrections days twice a month.  Among the many targets for corrections is the repeal of a provision that places costly safety requirements on ships carrying vegetable oil into or out of U.S. waters, even though the oil, if spilled, poses no threat to the environment or public health; and a federal rule barring the removal of trees surrounding an airport for safety purposes if those trees are in a wetland. 
<p>
In its first session of corrections on July 25, 1995, the House voted 269 to 156 to exempt San Diego, California from a water pollution regulation that would require the city to build a $2 billion sewage treatment plant.  Critics of the plant contend that discharging sewage into the Pacific Ocean four miles offshore would not affect sea-life 
and in some instances would benefit marine life.  This is an important first step in trying to bring the federal regulation leviathan under control.   
<p>
As the House catapults ahead with serious regulatory reform, the Senate has once again lagged behind.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kansas) set aside the GOP-sponsored regulatory reform bill on July 18, 1995, because of lack of support.  Senator Dole is unsure when and if the bill will ever come up for consideration in the 
Senate.  The Senate is too timid to attack the voracious appetite of federal regulations. 
<p>
Regulation reform is not an esoteric or vague concept.  Regulations affect everybody.  Government regulation dramatically increases the cost of doing business, which results in fewer jobs and lower salaries, and makes U.S. companies less competitive. 
<p>
Regulations extend their claws into all sectors of society including food and medicine, the environment, and the Department of the Interior (DOI). 
<p>
Probably the most powerful regulatory agency in the entire federal government is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   The expansion of the FDA is unparalleled in the federal government.  Growing from 4,470 employees in 1970, with a budget of $227 million, the FDA currently has 9,217 employees at a cost of $764 million.  This is a 106-percent increase in employees and a 237- percent increase in budget.  The FDA approves more regulations rather than drugs.  Drug approval averages 12 years and $359 million per drug.  The cost of this excessive regulation is passed on to the consumer at approximately 25 cents per dollar.  Critically needed drugs are delayed incessantly because of excessive regulations. 
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notorious for its overzealousness in regulating.  Initially established in 1970 to combat a real and growing pollution problem, the EPA has turned into a monolithic regulating monster.  Evidence of such heavy-handed regulations include a Pennsylvania couple being threatened with 
polluting a waterway by installing a tennis court on their land; a couple in New York being fined $30,000 for building a deck on their house because, among other things, it cast a shadow on a wetland;  and an auto parts store owner being fined $10,000 because he didn't post a sign, which was down because of window washing, stating that his store accepts waste motor oil for recycling.  Micro- managing the 
environment instead of fighting pollution is the new mission of the EPA. 
<p>
DOI weighs in with its own stupid and environmentally unsound practice of micro management.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Biological Survey (NBS) are examples of the DOI's misguided policies.  The ESA causes hardships for private property owners, businesses, and developers; it confers enormous power on unaccountable bureaucrats; and is costly to U.S taxpayers.   
<p>
The ESA has listed 853 species to be protected, while some 4,000 other plants and animals are official candidates for future listings.  According to Maura Dolans of the Los Angeles Times, blunders by the Fish and Wildlife Service may have contributed to an extinction.  The Service spent nearly $3 million  to buy a Florida habitat for the endangered dusky seaside sparrow -- and then neglected to manage the land properly.  The last bird died in 1987. 
<p>
The NBS was created to catalogue everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies around this country on public or private lands.  Critics say that the program will take years to complete, involve thousands of government scientists, and would clash with private property rights.  Because an area was designated under the NBS as a wilderness area, a lost Boy Scout was not rescued in a timely manner.  A rescue 
helicopter was not allowed to land in a sensitive area.  A note had to be dropped to the child.  The Boy Scout was eventually rescued by a second helicopter when the search party failed to find him. 
<p>
Needless regulations are shortsighted and stupid.  Some may seem humorous, but all are serious.  The increased presence of federal regulations erode away personal freedoms as well as our bank accounts.  The federal government should be for the people not against the people.

<h2>Tales From the Gypped</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><p>
</center><hr>
<br>
Medicare reform will be among Congress' top priorities after the  
August recess.  Those who are fighting any reform, their message is  
that each dollar spent in the program produces a dollar in benefits  
for America's seniors.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <p> 
The Medicare program is a sitting duck for con artists, thieves, and  
degreed opportunists.   Because of its size, diabolical complexity and  
lax management practices, this $177 billion leviathan has become the  
equivalent of a Gucci-clad matron sauntering down the street sporting  
a flashing neon sign that says "please rob me!"  Those with a notion  
to defraud Medicare know that these three factors alone guarantee that  
the risks of gaming the system are worth taking because Medicare is  
where the easy money is.<p>
In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed almost 700 million claims.   
That's nearly 2 million per day, about 250 million more than it  
processed five years earlier, and nearly six times the number of tax  
returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service.  Physicians, supply  
companies, or diagnostic laboratories have about three chances out of  
1,000 of having Medicare audit their billing practices in any given  
year.<p>
Medicare fraud is perpetrated by billing companies, providers,  
suppliers, even organized crime and drug dealers.  There are scams  
involving kickbacks, durable medical equipment, prescription  
marketing, nursing homes and home care providers, tampered medical  
supplies, ambulance and taxi services.  Medicare fraud is as varied as  
the imaginations of the criminals who game the system.  Citizens  
Against Government Waste's (CAGW) new report, Medicare Fraud: Tales  
from the Gypped, details more than one hundred examples.<p>  
Unless you've been away on the space shuttle, you surely are aware of  
the litany of waste that plagues the program.  But individual examples  
don't give the full picture.  It is heart-stopping.   At least ten  
percent, or $17 billion each year, in Medicare spending is irrevocably  
squandered.  That 10 percent is also, coincidentally, the annual  
growth rate that is leading the program to bankruptcy over the next  
several years.<p>  
Here are just a few of the countless examples:<p>     
** Several Michigan pharmacists obtained large supplies of expired  
drugs and dispensed them to nursing home patients, at full cost to  
Medicare.  One of the pharmacists who participated in the scheme  
quipped, "those people are old, they'll never know the difference, and  
they'll be dead soon anyway." <p> 
** A pharmaceutical salesman peddled $6 million in expired,  
mislabeled, unsterile, or second-hand pacemakers over an eight-year  
period, sometimes providing Hawaiian vacations or prostitutes as  
kickbacks to cardiologists who agreed to implant the adulterated  
devices in unsuspecting patients.  In his offices, authorities found  
"a number of bloody pacemakers, raising suspicions he was reselling  
devices surgically removed from other patients or even from corpses." <p> 
** In Florida, more than a dozen companies, claiming to supply  
Medicare patients with liquid nutritional supplements and feeding  
kits, defrauded Medicare of an estimated $20 million.  The "kingpin"  
of the scheme fled the country, but was found in Venezuela and  
extradited. <p> 
** A company in New York lured Medicare beneficiaries into disclosing  
their Medicare identification numbers in exchange for microwave ovens,  
air conditioners, or angora underwear.   <p>
** A Georgia health-care company is under investigation for allegedly  
pocketing more than $14 million in illegally obtained Medicare funds.   
Money allegedly went toward golf-course memberships, vacations, a new  
car for the CEO's son, $9.7 million for computer software, $84,341 for  
gourmet popcorn, and $18,600 for lobbying activities.  <p>
** A California supply company billed Medicare for $5 million worth of  
surgical dressings for patients who never underwent surgery. <p> 
There is no doubt that Medicare is in crisis.  We've heard from  
Medicare's Public Trustees that the program is faltering.  This year,  
the trustees have given us a date certain for Medicare's impending  
demise if its current rate of spending is not reduced: 2002.  They've  
told us that if we don't act today, never mind the long-range affect  
on baby boomers and their children, our parents and grandparents, who  
currently receive benefits, will be cut off in just seven years. <p>   
Rhetoric and denial are the postures of choice in Washington.  Some  
members of Congress, along with their outside supporters, claim there  
is no crisis.  Others argue that the federal government will never let  
the system run out of money, as if the American taxpayer is a never- 
ending source of cash for this out-of-control program.  And then there  
are those, like Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who can't  
resist the easy politics of intergenerational fear-mongering.    <p>
But Republican attention to Medicare's problems are not some partisan  
plot.  Mr. Gephardt ought to familiarize himself with the authors of  
the 1995 Trustees Report, which included such Republican "friends" as  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and Social Security  
Commissioner Shirley Chater.  <p>
If Medicare's centralized, non-competitive, single-payer system is at  
the heart of billions of dollars in wasted resources, eliminating  
waste and fraud requires that competitive, market forces be introduced  
into the Medicare system.  Free market forces and incentives would  
reduce Medicare's excessive costs and improve the quality of health  
care available for seniors.  By putting the onus for rooting out fraud  
and abuse on the private sector, and creating inescapable incentives  
to do so, risk-free opportunities to defraud the system would be  
greatly reduced.  Moreover, we would finally provide seniors with a  
medical system that develops greater quality rather than one that  
simply increasingly consumes more and more health dollars.  <p>
How we deal with Medicare's crisis will speak volumes about who we are  
as Americans and what kind of society we value.  At stake is whether  
today's senior citizens, not to mention those of us who are following  
close behind, will have a viable health-care system in the future.   
Waste and fraud will only rob us all of a better future if we continue  
to assume it is an unavoidable result of a well-meaning big government  
program.<p>

<h2>Stop Federalizing Local Crimes</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P>
                       
The hearings and report of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Terrorism,  
Technology and Government Information prove again the importance and value  
of Congressional investigations. This function of Congress operates as the  
best, and often the only, way to expose the misdeeds of government.  
  <P>
For three years, the news of the killing of an innocent women and child on  
a remote Idaho mountaintop by an FBI sharpshooter, and the subsequent  
coverup by the FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno, had been known only to  
readers of right-wing newsletters and surfers on the Internet. Newspapers  
and TV networks didn't find those actions worth reporting.  
  <P>
Finally, Senator Arlen Specter's subcommittee, with the C-span cameras  
rolling, laid the ugly story out for all to see. The 154-page subcommittee  
report just released assessed blame on everybody involved in the shootout,  
but the part that should concern us most is the outrageous actions of  
federal law- enforcement agencies.  
  <P>
The role of the BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) began with  
spreading false and defamatory information about Randy Weaver and concluded  
with continuing to defend inexcusable conduct. The FBI's role included  
firing the fatal shots, lying about who was to blame, defending the  
constitutional "shoot-on-sight" actions, and promoting the bureaucrat in  
charge of the mess.  
  <P>
Specter rightfully suggests that the BATF ought to be abolished. The FBI  
should be punished, too, since Director Louis Freeh's statement that the  
Bureau is now better prepared for "volatile situations like Ruby Ridge" is  
a totally inadequate response.  
  <P>
Former Attorney General Edwin Meese points out in the current issue of  
Policy Review that the Ruby Ridge and Waco (Branch Davidian) tragedies have  
fundamentally changed the way Americans view federal law enforcement  
agencies and have jeopardized public confidence in government itself. His  
recommendation is much more fundamental than a mere transfer of agency  
functions and suspension of several agents.  
  <P>
As Meese explains, Ruby Ridge and Waco were, constitutionally speaking,  
none of the Federal government's business in the first place. Neither  
incident involved interstate activity or posed a threat to the Federal  
Government.  
  <P>
The underlying problem is that so many criminal laws and laws regulating  
firearms have been federalized. Until very recent years, everything  
involved at Ruby Ridge and Waco would have been handled under state and  
local laws (if, indeed, there were anything to handle at all, since the  
Ruby Ridge sequence of events only started when a BATF agent entrapped  
Randy Weaver into committing a minor violation of a firearms law).  
  <P>
What has happened is that so many politicians, seeking to portray  
themselves as tough on crime, have passed so many laws creating new federal  
crimes and stiffer penalties. They should know that these laws are not in  
harmony with our Constitution and that crime is most effectively fought at  
the local level, anyway.  
  <P>
Meese explains that federalizing crime contradicts constitutional  
principles. The U.S. Constitution gave Congress jurisdiction over only  
three crimes: treason, counterfeiting, and piracy on the high seas and  
offenses against the law of nations. Responsibility for public safety rests  
solely in the domain of the states.  
  <P>
Now, however, Congress has created more than 3,000 federal crimes, many of  
them redundant with state laws. Hardly any crime, no matter how local, is  
now beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities.  
  <P>
A big part of the federalizing of crime is the criminalization of  
environmental regulations. Many of these federal environmental crimes are  
local in nature, and they are often so vague that some property owners  
violate the law without realizing it.  
  <P>
Meese accurately says that federalizing crime increases "the potential for  
an oppressive and burdensome federal police state." Ruby Ridge and Waco  
prove that proposition; the spokesmen for the two federal agencies never  
admitted that the government did anything wrong.  
  <P>
Another bad result of federalizing crime is the added jurisdiction and  
power this gives to the federal courts. Activist federal judges have  
greatly expanded the rights of criminal defendants, have further burdened  
law- enforcement agencies, and have virtually taken over the operation of  
80 percent of all state prison systems.  
  <P>
Since crime usually tops the list when voters are asked what they are  
concerned about, Republicans like to pose as law-and-order spokesmen. Its  
time for them to address themselves to the real problems that are properly  
Congress's responsibility, and admit that law-and-order is a state and  
local function.

<h2>Kudos For General Dan "SDI" Graham </h2>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><P>
Can one person really make a difference in this country of 250,000,000  
people? The life of General Daniel O. Graham, who passed away on New Year's  
Eve, gives a stunningly affirmative answer.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham, whose first love was the cavalry, liked to quote an old  
proverb. For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the  
horse was lost; for want of the horse, the battle was lost. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That proverb defines his place in history. For want of Dan Graham, Ronald  
Reagan would not have had the vision of a defense against ballistic  
missiles called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI); for want of  
Reagan's leadership, the United States would not have had a project called  
SDI; and for want of the SDI project and the threat of what it could do,  
the Cold War would have been lost.<br>  
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is now clear that we won the Cold War when Mikhail Gorbachev reluctantly  
concluded that he couldn't talk Reagan out of SDI (at Geneva or elsewhere),  
and that the miserable Soviet economy couldn't match U.S. expenditures for  
building a nuclear defense. When Reagan called on Gorbachev to tear down  
the Berlin Wall, the media laughed; but SDI turned that "pie-in-the-sky"  
prediction into reality.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democratic-controlled Congresses never voted the funds to deploy SDI,  
but they did tolerate limited funding for research and development.  
Fortunately that (combined with the collapsing Soviet economy) turned out  
to be enough to checkmate Gorbachev. <br> 
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had a much-decorated 30-year military career that included  
service in Germany, Korea and Vietnam and was capped by serving as director  
of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In retirement, he rejected lucrative  
offers from defense contractors and dedicated his life to American national  
defense.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Ronald Reagan's military adviser in his 1976 and 1980 campaigns, Dan  
Graham laid out for his candidate the folly and culpable negligence of the  
Federal Government's leaving America totally undefended against incoming  
nuclear missiles. Graham's coaching led Ronald Reagan to articulate the  
crucial question on March 23, 1983: "Would it not be better to save lives  
than to avenge them?"  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's national grand strategy, developed by Secretary of Defense Robert  
McNamara in the early 1960s, was still in 1983 totally based on killing  
Russians instead of on protecting the lives of Americans. This strategy,  
called Mutual Assured Destruction, was known by its appropriate acronym  
MAD.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This theory proclaimed the notion that the way to avoid nuclear war was (a)  
not to build any defensive weapons, but instead (b) to threaten the Soviets  
that, if they fired their nuclear missiles at us, we would retaliate with  
our offensive nukes and kill tens of millions of Russians. If this scenario  
ever took place, tens of millions of Americans would die because our  
government had done nothing at all to protect them.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;MAD was a suicide pact -- a strategy of revenge, rather than defense. Dan  
Graham said there must be a better way.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The better way developed by Graham was originally called High Frontier  
(because space is the high frontier of America's future), and was later  
called SDI. It is a plan for a layered defense, in which non-nuclear  
weapons shot from satellites in space and from ground bases in this country  
would destroy enemy nuclear missiles in flight before they incinerated  
Americans.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dan Graham had the vision that a defense was both essential and doable, he  
was the salesman who persuaded Ronald Reagan and other public officials and  
opinion makers that it was sound political and military strategy, he  
assembled the scientists and engineers who proved it would work, he raised  
the funds to do all of the above, and he was a veritable machine grinding  
out refutations of the attacks launched on High Frontier/SDI by those  
determined to mislead the public with deceptive criticisms.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;General Graham had to fend off the Ted Kennedy claque who tried to ridicule  
High Frontier as "Star Wars," and the liberal Democrats who are viscerally  
opposed to spending any money on defense. Graham had to withstand  
opposition from Paul Nitze and the internationalists who opposed SDI  
because they sought nuclear disarmament through international agencies, and  
from the arms control lobby, which had a vested interest in continuing  
their jobs attending international meetings where they tilted about arcane  
nuclear weapons statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A couple of weeks ago, President Clinton vetoed the defense authorization  
which funded SDI, claiming that it is "on a collision course with the ABM  
treaty." That document is a relic of the Cold War, which continues to  
impose MAD on us and restricts our constitutional right to "provide for the  
common defense."  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nuclear threat today is from attacks by the several rogue nations that  
now possess ballistic missiles. The ABM treaty cannot protect us against  
them, but SDI can.  <br>
  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where there is no vision, the people perish." General Daniel O. Graham had  
the vision for a "Defense that Defends." As a fitting tribute to a great  
patriot, let us work to make it a reality.

<h2>The Fraud and the Failure Called Welfare </h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>

<p><P>
The disaster called welfare was probably the biggest single issue that 
ousted the Democratic majority in Congress in the landmark election of 
1994. Even President Clinton said he wanted to "end welfare as we know it." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True to their Contract with America, the Republican Congress passed welfare 
reform. It wasn't a perfect piece of legislation, of course. There is no 
way this $5 trillion fraud and failure, with so many vested interests, 
could be perfected by one law in one year. But it was a giant step in the 
right direction. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill, so we're back to square one. 
The federal taxpayers will have to go on spending $234 billion annually, 
plus another $100 billion in state welfare spending.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lyndon Johnson's Great Society set up a grossly unjust and immoral system 
in the mid-1960s whereby millions of people were taught that they had an 
"entitlement." They became "entitled" to pick the pockets of lawabiding, 
taxpaying families if they met two conditions: they didn't work, and they 
were not married to someone who does work. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The major problem is that welfare pays better than jobs that welfare 
recipients can hope to get. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A recent Cato Institute study laid out comparative figures based on the 
cash payments and non-cash benefits paid by our welfare system to a single 
mother with two children. There are 77 different sources of welfare money, 
but the principal pipelines are AFDC, food stamps, medicaid, housing, 
utilities, WIC, and commodities. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, the average welfare mother receives cash and benefits 
amounting to $20,000 a year. In medium-level welfare states, she gets 
$17,500 per year. And it's all tax-free! 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 39 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to an $8 per hour job. In New 
York and Washington, D.C., welfare benefits are equivalent to a $12 an hour 
job, two and a half times the minimum wage. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In eight states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the salary of a 
first-year teacher. In 28 states, welfare benefits are equivalent to the 
pay of a starting secretary. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, all welfare recipients don't receive this much, but some get 
more. The conclusion is that it pays to be on welfare and there is no real 
hope of getting people off welfare until the benefits are less than a 
minimum wage job. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When LBJ started the current welfare system, it was called the "war on 
poverty." Indeed, it was a war against families, taxpayers, and even 
against the people it was supposed to help. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's bad enough that the war on poverty took so much spendable income out 
of the pockets of hard-working Americans. It's worse that it is a no-win 
war, initiated by the same Administration that gave us the Vietnam War. We 
are waiting for its perpetrators to admit, like Robert S. McNamara, that 
they were "wrong, terribly wrong." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the worst of it is that the liberal welfare system has perpetrated such 
horrendous damage on our society. It has broken up millions of families, 
prevented more millions of families from forming, produced seven million 
illegitimate children, created a pathetic underclass that will never 
achieve what we like to call the American Dream, virtually destroyed our 
great cities, and spawned the social problems that flow from illegitimacy 
such as drugs, delinquency, and dropouts. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare system tells a teenage girl, who is doing poorly in school, 
doesn't know who her father is, isn't getting along with her mother, and 
hates her surroundings, "We'll take you out of all this, set you up in an 
apartment of your own, send you a check every month, and give you your own 
food stamps, housing allotment, health care, and commodities. All you have 
to do to get all these goodies is have an illegitimate baby." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surprise, surprise, more illegitimate babies were born to teenagers. So the liberals offered another government "solution": "family planning." That's a 
euphemism for the massive distribution of contraceptives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Title X taxpayer funding started in 1970 for the purpose of reducing 
unmarried teen pregnancies. After 25 years, the result is total disaster; 
every measure of teenage health is dramatically worse. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Illegitimate births to teenagers have doubled, the teenage abortion rate 
has more than doubled, sexual activity rates are far higher and at a 
younger age, and sexually transmitted diseases have skyrocketed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the liberals whine about how the so-called Religious Right is 
"imposing its morals" on the rest of society, remember that they are like 
the thief who cries "stop, thief" to distract from his own thievery. 
Welfare is the prime example of the Irreligious Left imposing its lack of 
morals on the rest of society.
