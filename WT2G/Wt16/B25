   <H1>How to Beat the Supreme Court on School Prayer</H1>
   <H3>By Harry V. Jaffa</H3>

</center>

"We are a religious people, whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."

<p>
There is no better way to confirm the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William O. Douglas, 
than to take a tour through the state constitutions.  Forty-seven of the fifty states have preambles invoking the 
name of Almighty God.  A joint resolution of the Congress could declare that children in public schools might 
lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is 
present in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any of the other states.  When this resolution is 
signed by the President--and it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it--it could take effect 
immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution.  
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected branches of government, but also would 
require it, in effect, to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!


<p>
Consider the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental laws of the states:

<blockquote><i>We the people of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure the blessing 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and 
establish the following Constitution and form of government . . .</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We the people of the State of California, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and 
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted them 
to enjoy a free government . . .</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
This selection should be sufficient to illustrate the consistency in the patterns of all the preambles. Who could 
ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil 
and religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God to preserve and 
perpetuate it?


<p>
It is notable that the state constitutions have provisions equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice for present 
purposes is that of California:

<blockquote>
<i>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty of conscience does not
excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this it is apparent that the people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees of 
religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that 
freedom in the same constitutions.

<p>
American constitutions whether federal or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration of 
Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination of a legal positivism which is simply unable to 
understand the relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and human law on the other.  Yet 
this relationship was axiomatic for our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation--that 
is to say, a moral duty--to obey the laws, either of our State, or of the United States, there is only one answer.  
It is because those laws exist "to secure these rights," rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] 
Creator."  Constitutional governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights whose origin is 
altogether independent of human will, rights which are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God."  Through the ages many governments which did not respect the rights of the 
individual have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But the consent of the governed 
required by our republican constitutions is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human person.


<p>
Legal positivists deny to the Declaration any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according to the 
United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this 
is not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that every enabling act by the Congress for the 
admission of a State to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision.  


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>The Constitution of the State of ______ shall always be republican in form and shall not be repugnant to the 
Constitution of the United States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
It can be seen that the rights secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the United States, are 
means of implementing antecedent rights whose origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how we 
can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating in them an understanding of and a reverence for this 
origin.

   <H1>Transferring the USIA to the Department of Many Umbrellas</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>


<p>
The dismemberment of the Soviet Union has brought many in Congress to the conclusion that the United States can close or cut those foreign policy entities that took a lead role in the Cold War.  As a result, the United States Information Agency (USIA) may soon be slated for takeover by the U. S. State Department, with a commensurate and severe cut in the funds of USIA's radio arm, the Voice of America (VOA).  The VOA could then be virtually destroyed by the Chamerlainesque policies of State.  The hallways of the State Department are lined with dripping umbrellas, even when it isn't raining outside.

<p>
Is the USIA and its VOA still valuable with the Soviet Union gone?  Of course it is.  The death of the Soviet Union does not guarantee that democracy is the one and only outlook for Russia and other former Soviet Republics.  Nor does it mean that totalitarians around the world will applaud U.S. policy.  The VOA is the SDI of information.  Its stories about the United States have balanced the movies, rap songs, and gang activities which many citizens of the world would otherwise think consume this nation.  Its truth-telling of world news and events has encouraged the citizens of the world to accept nothing less than liberty.

<p>
On the sixth anniversary of the Tiananman Square massacre, the VOA's transmitters reached tens of millions of people in China despite their government's attempts at jamming it.  Would our State Department be so insistent?

<p>
When the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Ms. Saw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was released from house arrest this month, she told reporters that during those six years of confinement the VOA was her outside line to the free world.  Everyday at 6:00 PM she stopped everything to listen to its broadcasts.

<p>
The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahai's of the United States officially expressed its appreciation to the VOA for keeping the Teheran regime of Iran aware of America's commitment to the cause of the Bahai's human rights.

<p>
The representative of the Dalai Lama recently contrasted the truth of the VOA to the propaganda from the People's Republic of China media to Tibet.  He wrote, "The Voice of America's Tibetan Language News Service is the only independent source of news for the Tibetan speaking areas of the world."

<p>
What would our State Department say to Cuba, Burma, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Vietnam, Serbia, and Libya as it directs the Voice of America?  What would it say to Tibet?

<p>
There are areas of the USIA that I believe can be eliminated without risk.  The Fulbright scholarship programs should not be part of the workings of the federal government and the exchange programs should be served by private institutions.  But the USIA's libraries in 130 countries, its publications, its films and television programs and, of course, the Voice of America, are invaluable allies of those who want to know what the United States is all about, and what liberty is all about, and what truth is all about.

<p>
The 104th Congress is magnificently doing what has not been done since the birth of our nation. Its members, like our Founders, are acting against political nature by giving power to the states, the localities, and the people.  James Madison wrote that the federal government's duties "will be exercised principally on external objects," meaning foreign affairs.  The power now being surrendered by our federal government in foreign affairs will, of course, not revert to the states, the localities, and the people, as it will in domestic affairs.  

<p>
If the USIA is stripped of its influence, that power will not go to the people of California, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, and Delaware.  It will go to Kim Jong Il, Mu'ammar el-Qaddafi, Fidel Castro, Hafez al-Assad, and Deng Xiaoping.

<CENTER><H3> End Federally Funded Abortion</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  There are 13 appropriations bills that fund U.S. government agencies and pro-grams.  These bills are voted on annually, and they originate in the House of Representatives.  During the Clinton administration, federal money has been used directly or indirectly for abortion through various appropriations.  The 104th Congress, however, has the opportunity to delete this funding or restore previous restrictions on tax dollars paying for abortion.  Also, the House Leadership has instructed the appropriations subcommittees to cut funding for programs that have not been "reauthorized" or approved by separate legislative committees.  For example, the Title X family planning program has not been reauthorized since 1985, but it continues to receive funding through the appropriations process.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee is Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA).  However, legislative action takes place first in various Appropriations subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the particular department or programs.  The sub-committee chairman plays a key role and can include the desired language in the subcommittee "mark", or bill.  A subcommittee version goes to the full committee for consideration and then to the House floor.  The key subcommittees and chairmen are:  Labor/HHS/Education (Rep. John Porter [R-Ill.]); Treasury, Postal Service, General Government (Rep. Jim Lightfoot [R-Iowa]); and District of Columbia (Rep. Jim Walsh [R-N.Y.]).
	<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Since the government's new fiscal year begins on October 1, these bills will be in the forefront during the next few months.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>The current Hyde amendment applies only to programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, such as Medicaid.  The Hyde language was "expanded" in 1993 to include payment for abortions in the case of rape and incest.  The fiscal year 1995 Labor/HHS bill contained this language.
<P>
<LI>A key issue to be decided will be language introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) that blocks the Clinton administration's interpretation of the "expanded" Hyde language.  Under that interpretation, the state pays for poor women's abortions whenever the abortionist claims the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Many states have stricter policies, allowing payment only in the case where the mother's life is endangered.  Rep. Istook tried to offer this corrective amendment during the "first 100 days" of Congress, but was persuaded not to and was promised a vote later in the year.
<P>
<LI>Also, attempts will be made to cut funding via the National Institutes for Health for human fetal tissue research, human embryo research, and RU-486 research.  Furthermore, Rep. Tom DeLay may offer an amendment to eliminate Title X family planning, which funds Planned Parenthood and distributes contraceptives to teens without parental permission.   The Senate Budget Resolution recommended defunding the Office of Surgeon General.  If the Appropriations Committee follows through, Dr. Henry Foster will have no job as Surgeon General, whether or not he is confirmed by the Senate. 
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 appropriations for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government did not contain language prohibiting participating health plans from paying for Federal employees' abortions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) program.  FEHBP provides health care benefits for 9 million federal employees.  The government (taxpayers) pays about 60 percent of the cost and the employee pays the rest.  In previous years, the Smith/Ashbrook amendment had been attached which restricted FEHBP-participating health plans from funding abortion.  This language should be reinstated.
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 District of Columbia appropriations contains a prohibition on the use of  "federal" funds to pay for abortions, which is meaningless, since DC can use "local"  funds.  These funds are commingled with federal funds since DC's funds are appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  Language is needed to ban all congressionally appropriated funds, both "federal" and "local," for abortion on demand in the nation's capital, a city where the number of abortions is comparable to the number of live births.
</UL><P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Majority support should be there for these appropriations bills in the House, but that will not be the case in the Senate.  In the first test vote on abortion in the House on May 24, the pro-life position (an amendment offered to the foreign aid bill by Rep. Chris Smith) prevailed by 59 votes.  President Clinton must sign the appropriations bills if he wants the money to run the government for fiscal year 1996.  

<P>
<LI><B> Prohibit D & X Abortions</B>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To ban a particularly heinous method used to perform late-term "partial birth" abortions carried out on unborn children as early as 20 weeks of gestation and as late as 32 weeks.   
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will introduce legislation in early June to ban "partial birth" abortions, or as they are more commonly known, "dilation and extraction" or "D & X" abortions.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on June 15 which focused on the D & X abortion procedure, fetal pain, and a constitutional analysis of the legislation.   
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  American Medical News, (July 5, 1993) devoted a front-page article to the gruesome D & X abortion procedure.  The article explained the step-by-step procedure.  First, the unborn baby's legs are pulled into the birth canal.  Next, the abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.  The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's head, inserts a catheter and sucks the brains out.  The dead baby is then "evacuated."  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  As a starting point, this legislation seeks to build public support for further prohibitions and an ultimate ban on all elective (non-life-of-the-mother) abortions.  While specifically intending to prohibit late-term abortions, this legislation and corresponding Congressional hearings will educate the public about the humanity of the unborn child and the horror of abortion.  Sadly, this basic public education is still greatly needed.  There should be widespread support for this measure, although some will argue that abortion is legal and that this is not a common procedure because late-term abortions are "rare."
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Retain Forced-Abortion Asylum Policy </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Language included in the pending foreign aid and State Department reauthorization bill (H.R. 1561) would reinstate a Reagan-Bush policy that provided asylum to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution for resisting the People's Republic of China's grotesque and coercive population control program. 
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) added this language to the foreign aid bill when it was before the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee in May.  Rep. Smith is the subcommittee chairman.  The provision remained intact throughout the full committee's deliberations and became part of the foreign aid bill, known as the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561), to be considered by the House of Representatives. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Col.) will likely seek to delete this key provision on the House floor when the House resumes consideration of H.R. 1561.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Despite fears by some anti-immigration groups that the number of immigrants entering this country will soar, it is important to note that from 1987 through 1993, when the forced-abortion asylum policy was in effect, less than 200 people per year were granted asylum on these grounds.  This is a humanitarian policy and should be reinstated.  President Clinton revoked this pro-life policy soon after he took office.  This policy has real implications for Chinese families living in the U.S. who face imminent deportation and persecution, if it is not adopted quickly.  On Good Friday (April 14), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) moved 13 Chinese women to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, Calif.  Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions.  Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortions and/or sterilization.  It appears that their deportation is imminent unless Congress passes H.R. 1561 with the forced-abortion asylum provision intact.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The anti-immigration lobbyists are stirring up some fears, but the fact that a militantly "pro-choice" Member of Congress (Rep. Patricia Schroeder) is their champion undercuts their ability to appeal to the pro-life majority in the House.  Rep. Schroeder will be hard-pressed to explain why she isn't more sensitive to the fact that Chinese women don't have any "choice" about abortion.  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto H.R. 1561 for other reasons, mainly because it significantly cuts foreign aid.  If the House cannot override the veto, Rep. Smith would have to find another vehicle to enact the forced-abortion asylum policy.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit </H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to reduce some of the financial obstacles associated with adopting a child.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit was a primary component of the House GOP's Contract with America.  The provision -- adapted from Rep. Chris Smith's (R-N.J.) Omnibus Adoption Act, H.R. 1066 -- was passed by the House as part of H.R. 1215, the tax cuts package sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and unveiled before an FRC audience.
<P>
<B> BUDGET RESOLUTIONS</B>:  In order to make the $5,000 adoption tax credit a reality, the provision must be included in the budget for each fiscal year.  The first step in that process is the budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for the appropriating of funds in the final budget.  The House recently passed an historic budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).  The resolution balances the budget by the year 2002, and includes the $5,000 adoption tax credit in its proposed tax cuts.
<P>
In contrast, the Senate's budget resolution would balance the budget by 2002 but failed to include the adoption tax credit (or any other tax cuts).  Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) tax relief amendment (which included the adoption tax credit) was defeated by a vote of 69-31.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House and Senate versions of the budget resolutions will now be melded together to produce one budget known as reconciliation.  It remains to be seen whether the $5,000-per-child adoption tax credit will be maintained in the final version.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  This provision would make adoption a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing them to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for quali-fied adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs, and attorney fees, among others.  This provision is important because it reduces the financial obstacles that might otherwise hinder middle- and low-income families from adopting.  [The average cost of an adoption is between $10,000 and $15,000.]  It is also an important step in encouraging the adoption choice -- a choice which benefits the birth mother, the adopted child, and the adoptive parents.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Much depends upon the reconciliation of the two budget resolution versions.  If the Senate and, most especially, the members of the House-Senate conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for the passage of the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
<CENTER><H3> Coercive Abortion Training Threatens Accreditation of Hospitals </H3></CENTER>
<P>
On February 14, 1995 the 23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents expressing moral and/or religious objections to abortion would, presumably, be able to opt out of the abortion training, but common sense suggests that they will face strong pressure to undergo the new "standard" training.  Medical schools with a religious affiliation that oppose abortion would not be required to provide abortion training directly, but they would be required to arrange for such training for those students who do not object.  Many religious medical schools currently reject any affiliation whatsoever with abortion providers.  
<P>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing their accreditation.   However, over the last 20 years, the number of medical schools offering elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In 1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either on a routine or optional basis.  In 1991, 68.8 percent of medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training.  About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or legal reasons. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to offer legislation in June that would reverse this coercive directive.  The legislation would "protect individuals, entities and programs from discrimination on the basis of their refusal to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training in the performance of induced abortion."  Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) is prepared to introduce similar legislation in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Oversight and Investigations subcommittee examined this issue during a hearing on June 14.  Witnesses included several medical directors of OB/GYN departments at public universities or hospitals who oppose the new requirement and a representative from ACGME.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Congressional action is necessary to reverse this coercive policy.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement (from Medicare and Medicaid) for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified as competent in their specialties.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Rep. Hoekstra's legislation may be attached as an amendment to health care legislation, such as the Health Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act.

</CENTER><P><CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Disestablishing the U.S. Education Department</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Education has been traditionally -- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.  But since the U.S. Education Department was founded in 1979, it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand its range and influence.  Legislation is needed to take educational decisions from the hands of federal bureaucrats and return them to parents, teachers, and communities.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 24, 1995, the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill was introduced.  This bill's main sponsors are Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), 
and John Boehner (R-Ohio).  Members of the House Education Task Force are among the cosponsors.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Within one year of passage, this bill would shut down the U.S. Education Department.  Many programs, including Goals 2000, would be repealed, while general funding for elementary/secondary and higher education would be converted to two block grants for the states.  The only stipulation is that 98 percent of a state's block grant be passed on to the local level.  Authorization for the block grants would last just three years, at which time the bill proposes that a tax cut for families replace the block grants.  A few functions of the Department would be transferred to more appropriate agencies:  Impact Aid to the Department of Defense, Indian Education to the Department of the Interior, Civil Rights to the Department of Justice, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and student loan programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.  The proposal goes beyond talk of shuffling offices and putting a new sign on the door; it takes a serious step towards removing the federal government from our schools.  The proposed tax cut would further reduce the government's influence over education.  Increased revenue for parents would empower them to make more decisions about their children's education.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  President Bill Clinton has already promised the National Education Association (NEA) that he would "remember who put me here."  He will clearly veto legislation that eliminates the NEA's primary representative in the federal government, the Education Department.  However, the executive office cannot authorize expenditures which have not been appropriated by the House.  The House Republican Budget Resolution zeroes out funding for the U.S. Education Department by 2002.  That improves the prospects for the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill.
<P>


<P>
<CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Repealing Goals 2000</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Ignoring parental pleas for education to get "back to the basics," the 103rd Congress adopted Goals 2000, a program which further centralized education, increased bureau-cracy, and added a host of new non-academic programs.  It was described by supporters as a new pattern for local-state-federal partnership in education.  The debate has now shifted to limiting the federal role in education.  Goals 2000, representing the height of federal intrusiveness into schools, should be the first program to be dismantled.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 10, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered an amendment in 
the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee to repeal Goals 2000.  The committee did not vote on the motion at that time, but Rep. Graham plans to raise the issue again later this year.  That same day, the committee voted in favor of H.R. 1045, a bill to abolish the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), which was created by 
Goals 2000.  Opportunities Committee chairman Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) is sponsoring the bill. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  H.R. 1045 was introduced on February 24, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House passed H.R. 1045 soon after the bill was reported out of committee.  Legislation to remove the opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards from the law may be introduced later this summer.  A bill to repeal the whole law should appear later this year.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  NESIC would have functioned much like a national school board by reviewing and certifying state and national standards.  There is a general consensus that this is an inappropriate function for the federal government.  OTL standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, which requires increased spending.  We know that spending does not drive academic performance.  OTL standards should be removed from the law.  However, the Goals 2000 agenda will carry on as long as block grants to states continue.  Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in American schools and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students the basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.     
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  H.R. 1045 should see minimal opposition, but the U.S. Education Department will fight fiercely to maintain its new conduit for imposing policy on the local school:  Goals 2000.  But the department is on the defensive.  Gov. George Allen of Virginia has announced that he will not accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  Across the nation, parents are outraged by the implentation of Goals 2000 in their local schools.  The U.S. Education Department's new partnership has turned against them:  it is being attacked from all sides -- federal, state, and local.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Promote Parental Choice in Education </H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  As evidence of the academic failure of our monopoly public school system mounts, legislation is needed to help parents choose a safe, academically successful public, private, religious or home school for their children. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) have introduced S. 618, a bill to spend $30 million on 10-20 demonstration projects.  It would allow low-income parents of students in inner-city schools to choose among public, private, and religious schools.  In addition, FRC is considering alternative legislation to grant a tax credit to parents who choose private, religious or home schools or who select a public school different from the one to which their children have been assigned. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  March 24, 1995 (Coats-Lieberman).
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Coats-Lieberman is in committee. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Sens. Coats and Lieberman offered this legislation in the 103rd Congress.  It was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year (52-41).  Their proposal has since gained the interest and support of prominent columnists, such as neoconservative Ben Wattenberg and E.J. Dionne, writer for the liberal Washington Post.  The purpose of the bill is to fund what are called demonstration projects.  Sponsors believe that when poor parents choose schools, the evidence we gain from this experiment will be so positive and so compelling as to clinch the argument for parental choice in education.  Because this bill would benefit low-income, inner-city students, who are disproportionately minority children, its backers believe that the idea will overwhelm the usual liberal case against parental choice.  Advocates of the public school monopoly generally argue that parental choice in education is elitist, that it will "re-segregate" the public schools, that private and religious schools merely "skim off" the best students.  Some pro-family advocates, however, argue that the Coats-Lieberman bill would expand the federal role in education at a time when the goal of dis-establishing the U.S. Education Department is a higher priority.  A better solution at the federal level may be tuition tax credits.  FRC is considering legislation which would allow all parents to retain a portion of their earnings for the purpose of selecting safe, excellent schools for their children.  This legislation would enable parents to select among public, private, religious or home schools.  It would protect the integrity of independent schools since there would be no cash transfer from the government to the schools. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Despite arranging for quality private schools for their own children, Bill Clinton and Al Gore will vigorously oppose parental choice legislation which includes non-public schools.  Coats-Lieberman therefore faces a veto threat.  Tuition tax credit legislation would face a gauntlet of liberal opposition and senators who stubbornly regard any family tax relief as a "giveaway,"  but it could benefit by being referred to a more friendly committee.

<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $500 Per-Child Tax Credit</H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to relieve some of the tax burden on parents.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit was an integral part of the American Dream Restoration Act, the "crown jewel" of the Contract with America, which passed as part of H.R. 1215 (sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer [R-Tex.]).  The credit is non-refundable (meaning that it only reduces taxes; it does not provide cash welfare to those with no tax liability).  This serves to target the bulk of the tax savings to middle-income families in the 15 percent tax bracket.
<P>
The House recently passed its fiscal year 1996 resolution, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), to balance the budget by the year 2002, and it includes the $500 per-child credit in its proposed tax cuts.  The Senate's resolution, though it also balances the budget by 2002, included no tax cuts, as Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) amendment to add the per-child tax credit to the budget resolution was rejected in the Senate.  It remains to be seen whether or not the $500 per-child tax credit will survive once these budget resolutions are melded into one budget by the two houses.   
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The fate of the $500 per-child tax credit is uncertain.  While Sen. Gramm's amendment to the budget resolution was defeated, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has indicated that he intends to secure a significant per-child tax credit in the budget resolution conference committee meeting with the House.  In addition, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) have pledged to offer amendments on the Senate floor calling for the $500 per-child tax credit if the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oreg.), continues to balk at offering pro-family tax relief.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  FRC has been calling on Congress to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average family of four contributes 25 cents on every dollar in income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government, compared to 2 cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of this, the per-child tax credit is designed to help offset the extraordinary erosion in per-child income tax benefits over the last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief should be a top priority in the ensuing months of Congress.  
<P>
Streamlining government spending and permitting families to keep more of their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the budget and make government more efficient.  In the months to come, it will be interesting to see if the Congress as a whole and the Senate in particular heard Americans last November and will give American families the opportunity to keep more of their own money.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  At this point, the fate of the per-child tax credit is uncertain.  However, if the Senate and, most especially, the members of the conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for passage of the $500 per-child tax credit.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Broaden IRA Eligibility to Non-Employed Spouses</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To help alleviate the financial burden on families in which one spouse stays at home.  Legislation to allow expansion of IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would help provide relief for families who choose to have one spouse stay at home and would recognize the important contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production of employed spouses -- an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce settlements.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Family Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1040), introduced by Rep. Bill Baker (R-Calif.), allows full-time homemakers and wage-earning spouses a deductible IRA contribution 
of up to $2,500 each; this was passed in the House as part of the Contract with America.  (Furthermore, this legislation permits families to borrow from their IRA for education expenses or to buy a home, with the provision that the funds be paid back to the family with interest.)  Similar legislation, the IRA Equity Bill (S. 287), has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) and allows deductible contributions of up to $2,000 by non-employed spouses.  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  It is important that the Senate pass legislation to help relieve the tax burden on families.  The House bill was passed as part of the Contract with America.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Along with the attractive idea of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free-up family finances (e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education, and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility of IRA's to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the eligibility of IRA's in general would primarily benefit upper-middle- and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily to middle-income families with children -- those most in need of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim almost twice the benefits as single-earner couples, penalizing those families who choose to stay home with their children and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker makes to the income production of the employed spouse.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief to American families.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle for IRA benefits for non-employed spouses must be won in the Senate, as pro-family House legislation has been passed already.  It is crucial that the Senate give priority to measures that promote pro-family tax relief. 
Support Medical Savings Accounts
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In the ongoing effort to reform health care, it is important to support any positive measures which would make health care more cost-effective for families.  Medical savings accounts, or Medical IRAs, are one such measure.  Making the option of medical savings accounts available to employees and unemployed individuals would encourage more prudent use of health care dollars and promote greater family autonomy in health care decisions.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Reps. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) have formulated legislation promoting medical savings accounts.  The proposal would amend the existing tax laws to create cost-effective incentives for employers to offer, and for employees to choose, medical savings accounts.  Rep. Archer expects to introduce his bill in mid-June and has said that many of his colleagues in the House have expressed great interest in cosponsoring such legislation.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The bill is currently being "scored" by the Congressional Budget Office to see what impact, if any, the reform will have on the overall budget, e.g., whether it is budget-neutral,  whether it will save money, or whether it will require the allocation of additional federal funds.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit may be set aside for lower-level medical expenses to be controlled by and used by families.  MSAs usually supplement catastrophic health insurance coverage, helping to cover medical expenses before the insurance deductible is reached.  Because individuals are directly responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, individuals reap the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of practicing good habits, for any monies not spent by the end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income, or kept in the account for future health care needs.
<P>
MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those not expressly covered within the insurance deductible, an individual has more flexibility to choose health services and providers and more portability of coverage (i.e., ability to keep coverage even when changing jobs).
<P>
Furthermore, evidence indicates that MSAs work well.  Golden Rule Insurance company recently conducted a survey of their employees who are covered under MSA plans.  The results show that (1) MSA enrollees saved money and reduced overall health care spending, and that (2) MSA enrollees were highly satisfied with their plan -- fully 88 percent prefer the MSA plan to other health insurance plans they had in the past.
<P> 
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The idea of MSAs is not new; therefore, many members of Congress are already familiar with and support the concept.  MSAs should have a good chance of passage in the 104th Congress, especially considering the fact that MSAs were a key component in many Republicans' health care reform proposals last year.

<CENTER><H3> Implement the Gay Ban</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved with the passage of a law.  Wrong.  The Clinton Administration ignored the law when it wrote the implementing policies and lifted the ban anyway.  Now, the Administration is using the courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a case that will lose in the Supreme Court.  That's why new legislation is imperative.
<P>
Pentagon and Justice Department officials have told FRC that what we thought was an exclusion policy is really an accommodation policy which permits homosexuals to serve.   So far, Congress has ignored this swindle by failing to exercise its constitutional responsibility to enforce military regulations.
<P>
The Pentagon policy that took effect February 28, 1994 differs in several ways from the law it purportedly implements:
<P>
<UL><LI>The law carries the statement, "homosexuality is incompatible with military service."  The Clinton regulations omit it. 
<P>
<LI>The law forbids service by homosexuals.  The Clinton regulations permit service by homosexuals.  At least 15 avowed homosexuals are now serving openly.
<P>
<LI>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.  But the Clinton regulations create a "criminal-like" standard.  According to Secretary of Defense William Perry, if soldiers attend gay pride parades, frequent gay bars, and possess gay materials, this does not constitute "credible" evidence to initiate an inquiry.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to 200 years of military experience and practice, Clinton's Defense Department no longer acknowledges homosexual behavior as a marker for increased security risk.  Information discovered during a security investigation cannot be used without high-level political permission.
<P>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation at the point of admission and whenever appropriate, the Clinton Administration refuses to do so.</UL>
<P>
In the first court test of the new law, the Clinton Justice Department failed to use key arguments and called no witnesses.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York ignored volumes of case law precedents and struck down the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  The case is<I> Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.
<P>
The Justice Department did not bother to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Dispute biased research and testimony by "expert" pro-homosexual witnesses.
<P>
<LI>Present well-documented physical and psychological problems with homosexuality.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual "lifestyles" and "values" jeopardize morale and unit cohesion.
</UL><P>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP), with senior advisors former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas M. Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert H. Barrow, is lobbying Congress to amend the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.  Should the <I> Able </I>case be heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before the law is changed, irreparable damage may be done.
<P>
FRC's MRP wants the following changes included in the 1996 Act:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to ask all potential recruits whether they are a homosexual or have engaged or intend to engage in homosexual acts.
<P>
<LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to revoke current policy and issue regulations consistent with the law.
</UL><P>
TheDefense Authorization Act will come to a final vote in early August.  Some members want to avoid another debate over homosexuals in the military and will try to torpedo any amend-ments.  However, without legislation the courts will have the final say on an issue which  constitutionally belongs to the Congress.  And the Clinton Administration will continue to keep more homosexuals in the military, thus undermining combat readiness, legal defense of the ban, and the moral fabric of the nation.  The stakes are extremely high.  If the military falls, federal power will be used to validate the rest of the homosexual agenda, including gay "marriage" and adoption of children.
<P>
Senators Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.) have both expressed concern and may take legislative action.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Cable Porn</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Some cable TV operators include channels featuring pornographic material in their basic cable subscriptions.  This increases access to pornography, particularly by young people.    
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) introduced the Family Viewing Cable Television Act of 1995 (H.R. 1540) on May 2, 1995.  The bill forbids cable operators from including pornography in basic cable packages.  
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> H.R. 1540 is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee but no hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Currently, many consumers are forced to accept channels featuring pornography as part of their basic cable package.  This makes it more difficult for them to protect their children.  The bill would secure the right of parents to keep their television safe for family viewing.  It would not outlaw pornographic material on cable television.  Rather, the bill would merely prohibit operators from automatically including it in basic cable packages.  Consumers wishing to have pornographic channels on their cable systems would be free to do so, but they would simply have to request them from their cable company.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The bill is facing opposition from industry lobbyists and advocates of unrestricted free speech.  Supporters may offer it as an amendment to another bill if hearings are not scheduled soon.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Promote Porn-Free Technology</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The growth of technology has created many exciting opportunities.  Unfortunately, it is also being used to expand access to pornography.  Many on-line computer networks such as the Internet operate largely unregulated and are a virtual no-man's land where material is exchanged without regard to laws on obscenity and indecency.  Legislation is needed to bring computer networks into compliance with obscenity and pornography laws.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314) introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.)  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  February 1, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The bill has been incorporated as an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).  The telecommunications bill has been reported out of committee and is awaiting floor action. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Communications Decency Act amends current dial-a-porn laws regulating obscenity and indecency to include computer technology.  Without questioning Sen. Exon's intentions, many pro-family groups, including the Family Research Council, fear that the bill in its present form might actually create more problems than it solves.  Computer industry lobbyists have hit Sen. Exon hard, resulting in significant weakening of S. 314 since February.  FRC and other groups are working with Sen. Exon and other senators to develop a strong law that incorporates the original goals of  S. 314.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  FRC will continue to work with Sen. Exon to try to restore S. 314.  Meanwhile, several alternative proposals are in the works.  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to add an amendment to the telecommunications bill which would instruct Attorney General Janet Reno to "study" the problem of computer porn.  Sen. Leahy's approach is a do-nothing approach which pro-family groups will oppose.  If Sen. Exon's bill does not improve, parents might see help from Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) or Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who are working on solutions that are more in line with pro-family concerns.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Military Profits from Pornography</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition for "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of Miller v. California.  At present, the services oppose removing so-called "soft" pornography from exchange shelves because of  the perceived threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
<P>
Obscenity was legally defined by the Supreme Court in the Miller v. California decision.  According to this ruling, something is obscene and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment when it satisfies the following criteria:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex.
<P>
<LI>Depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner.
<P>
<LI>Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.
</UL><P>
These criteria were written to protect freedom of speech and expression.  But there are kinds of speech and expression not protected by the Constitution: slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, copyright violations and child pornography.  The military has determined that certain "soft" pornographic material is protected (not obscene) and should be sold to uniformed patrons in government stores.
<P>
Pornography is sexually explicit material intended to arouse the consumer.  It is addictive and very often leads men to sexual crime.  This fact should persuade military leaders to judge wisely between two competing outcomes: the damage attributable to addictive pornographic material versus an ACLU lawsuit.  For now, the government is more fearful of an ACLU lawsuit.  
<P>
The government has much experience selling addictive merchandise to military patrons.  For example, it has sold alcohol, a potentially addictive substance, to servicemembers for most of the military's 200-year history.  Admittedly, most alcohol users avoid addiction, but enough do become addicts and they cost the services dearly -- productivity losses, personal injury, judicial expenses and property damage.
<P>
Pornographic material is much like alcohol; it is a very powerful stimulant.  The consumer begins with limited exposure -- "soft" pornography sold in military stores.  In some cases a  desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more explicit, more deviant images for the consumer to reach a previous level of sexual stimulation.  Gradually the addict is desensitized to the more explicit material.  Finally, he may act out sexually his pornographic fantasies prompted by the material.  These activities may include compulsive promiscuity, exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, having sex with children, rape, or sadism.
<P>
Serial killer Ted Bundy stated just before his execution for the sexual assault and murder of many women, "You are going to kill me, and that will protect society from me.  But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."  Bundy blames his addiction to pornography for his mental state that led to his murdering as many as 31 women.
<P>
No pending legislation mandates the removal of pornographic materials from military exchange shelves, but President Clinton has the unilateral authority to do so.  Military consumers can purchase the material without the government's help.

<CENTER><H3> Combat Illegitimacy in Welfare Policy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE:  </B> The current welfare system promotes family breakdown by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits even if one engages in irresponsible conduct.  Moreover, the bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer those benefits supplant voluntary organizations that offer real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.  Any legislation that attempts to reform welfare must end the entitlement status of numerous welfare programs, including AFDC cash benefits, and afford states the maximum flexibility to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral requirements (charitable alternatives, in particular).
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  House bill, H.R. 4, "The Personal Responsibility Act."  Senate floor action is expected.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  In March, the House passed The Personal Responsibility Act as part of its Contract with America.  The welfare reform bill will reach the Senate floor later this summer.  While the Senate Finance Committee did vote to eliminate the federal guarantee of cash assistance in favor of a strategy that "block grants" money to the states, the committee bill fails to ensure that illegitimacy remains a prominent focus of the debate on the floor.  The House bill, H.R. 4, included three essential provisions to strengthen families:  a prohibition on cash payments to mothers under age 18 who bear children out of wedlock; a freeze on benefits for mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and incentive bonus payments to states that reduce illegitimacy rates -- without increasing the number of abortions.  While the Senate bill does not include any of the essential provisions that were incorporated in the House bill, at least four senators have indicated that they will fight to restore the focus on family breakdown.  Family groups expect either Senator Bob Dole (R-Kans.) or Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) to lead the  initiative.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot be regarded as a morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to promote such activity by subsidizing it.
<P>
"The task," Charles Murray concludes, is to "neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else."  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, though not sufficient, to restore the integrity of the family unit.  
<P>
Frances Perkins, chief architect of Franklin Roosevelt's welfare policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member of the Roosevelt Administration, because they rejected that intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  While Congress is almost certain to pass a welfare bill this session, the fate of the illegitimacy provisions is uncertain.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Zero Out Title X</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning projects throughout the country.  The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental consent.  Having received over $193 million from taxpayers last year, funding for this unauthorized and failed program should be eliminated altogether.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act receives its funding through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes before Congress for a vote every year.  Neither the House nor Senate budget resolutions included a proposal to zero out Title X funding.  However, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) has promised to bring an amendment to the House floor to defund Title X if funding is not eliminated in committee.  Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and his state's Congressional colleagues, Reps. Ernest Istook and Steve Largent, are also working to zero out Title X funding.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> Efforts to defund Title X are in progress. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill will be considered by Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title X should not continue to receive funding because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired in 1985.  Secondly, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.  There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical family planning program when state governments have the capability to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative block grant.  Finally and most importantly, Title X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and sexually-transmitted diseases have all risen dramatically, especially in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Expect a huge fight pitting pro-abortion, pro-contraception groups intent on saving Title X against pro-family, pro-life groups working to defund the program.  Because Planned Parenthood receives a good portion of Title X monies, expect them to launch a campaign to save the program.  Outcome of a floor fight is uncertain.
<P>
Another approach, which may or may not prevent a floor battle, could be far more effective.  Overall grant reform may eliminate Title X funding without targeting any specific program.  For example, Congress could pass a law saying that no funds shall be appropriated to any program unless that program is currently authorized.  This is a justifiable reform in light of the efforts to balance the budget and the recently passed law eliminating unfunded federal mandates to states.  Thus, Title X funding might be eliminated on the basis of its unauthorized status.  However, if such grant reform passes, it is probable that pro-abortion members of Congress may try to bring Title X up for reauthorization.  Prospects to successfully reauthorize Title X are slim.  However, without such grant reform, funds could still be appropriated to unauthorized programs.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Derail the AIDS Gravy Train</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The federal government, all told, is spending $7.1 billion on AIDS through several government agencies in fiscal 1995.  The Public Health Service alone spends about $2.9 billion yearly ($91,355 per AIDS death contrasted with $1,060 for every cancer death).  Other federal expenditures come from HUD, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.  Legislation is needed to bring AIDS spending in line with money spent on other terminal diseases such as cancer.  And AIDS funds should not go toward the promotion of homosexuality in the guise of  "AIDS education."  Time-tested epidemiological responses such as early diagnosis and partner tracing should be employed.
 <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Congress seems prepared to take a business-as-usual approach to AIDS.  On April 3, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kans.) Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (S. 641) provides $4.3 billion over the next five years, beginning in fiscal 1996, and allows for "such sums as may be necessary," a budget-busting possibility.  Other sponsors include Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kans.).  A House version was introduced by Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) on January 4, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Senate bill was passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has put a legislative hold on the bill.  No hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Much AIDS money goes to legitimate activities, such as HIV research and care for AIDS victims.  A significant amount, however, goes to politically active groups that promote the radical homosexual agenda.  Congress needs to hold hearings to examine how the money has been used so far.  All funding to groups that promote homosexuality should be cut, leaving more money for groups that deal with AIDS in a medically responsible fashion.  Current AIDS education funding should be terminated, since the money is going toward promotion of condoms and the myth of  "safe sex" instead of documentably successful abstinence education.  And spending formulas should be changed:
<P><OL> 
<LI>Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive benefits.  Formulas based on "AIDS prevalence" distort funding needs, because they count the dead along with the living.  More of the money should go to under-served minority communities.
<P>
<LI>People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they currently live, not where they were diagnosed.  Someone might be diagnosed in a large city but return home elsewhere for care.
<P>
<LI>Means testing for AIDS dollars should be introduced.  Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with those who truly have no other means of payment.</OL>
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Fifty-five senators have signed on as sponsors, but hearings could result in positive changes.  Sen. Dole's role is pivotal if the bill's abuses are to be addressed.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Defund Federal Promotion of Homosexuality</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Clinton Administration mandated AIDS/Awareness Training for all Federal employees.  Some of this training is used to promote homosexuality.  Legislation is needed to defund this training.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS: </B>  S. 25 -- To stop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by government agencies to encourage their employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a legitimate or normal lifestyle.  Sponsor: Senator Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
<P>
H.R. 862 -- To prohibit the use of Federal funds to promote homosexuality.  Sponsor: Represent-ative Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.)
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  H.R. 862 -- was introduced February 8, 1995, and was assigned to the Subcommittee for Human Resources and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
<P>
S. 25 --  was introduced January 4, 1995, but is unlikely to be voted on until late summer or 
early fall.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Congressman Dornan's strategy is to amend all appropriations bills to include this language.  H.R. 862 will not likely be passed as a stand-alone bill, and thus, the Senate strategy is likely to be similar.
<P>
<B> OVERVIEW</B>:  President Clinton directed all federal departments to provide HIV/AIDS training.   According to many federal employees, the mandatory training promotes homosexuality and includes unnecessarily graphic explanations.  A Defense Department worker complained that her training included a slide show of  "sex toys" and flavored condoms.  Other workers were lectured that their grandmothers probably had engaged in sodomy as a form of birth control.
<P>
Two supervisors and 41 employees in the Federal Communication Commission's audio services division chose not to attend mandatory "AIDS Awareness Training."  An FCC employee stated, "The classes are basically an adult version of high school sex ed., with the modern-day sensitivity training thrown in."
<P>
Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary created "Walkin' the Talk" AIDS training materials for three-hour, mandatory training sessions.  A memo from the Department's Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator states, "All employees are required to complete this training."
<P>
The training includes a brief history of HIV and a discussion of symptoms, prevention, and risk reduction.  There also is a discussion of needle-sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing "safer sex" by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic wrap, and latex gloves.  The manual states, "A dental dam 
(a small, square piece of latex) or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact.  All types of barriers (condoms, dental dams, and plastic wrap) are effective against HIV transmission only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to finish."
<P>
The Energy Department makes a disclaimer: "HIV is transmitted without regard to gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or identification with any group.  For this reason, we avoid referring to high risk groups."  Not identifying "high risk groups" is irresponsible.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report shows that at least 87 percent of AIDS victims either contracted the virus from homosexual encounters or by sharing needles.
<P>
Probably the most outrageous example of government-sponsored AIDS training was done for the Forest Service.  It took place in the Forest Service's Tahoe Region on May 6, 1994 and was conducted by a local health official with degrees in sexology, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist (individual who draws blood), and an HIV-positive woman from the community.
<P>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk "homophobic" misconceptions.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when sharing hypodermic needles.
<P>
The Forest Service also has a training booklet entitled, "Valuing Diversity."  Inside the booklet are statements such as: "Fact: Psychological and social influences alone cannot cause homosexuality....Fact: A biological (genetic, hormonal, neurological, other) predisposition toward homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual orientation is present at birth in all boys and girls."  No source for these "facts" is provided, nor could there be.  So-called genetic studies on homosexuality are flawed and typically conducted by homosexual activists.
<P>
AIDS/HIV awareness training and diversity training have become vehicles for promoting homosexuality in the federal government.

<CENTER><H3> Restore Combat Exemptions for Women</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton administration has removed 250,000 combat exemptions for women.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The Administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness. 
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Perry promises, "Our over-arching goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.  By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility in the development and use of human resources."
<P>
The Clinton Administration has not explained how liberalization of the female assignment policy will accomplish the goal of maintaining "a high-quality, ready and effective force."  According to Mr. Perry, these changes are intended to expand "the opportunities for women in the military."
<P>
The Administration's decisions to end more exemptions for women have no justification in military necessity and will hurt readiness:
<P><UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient number of male recruits, especially now that the military is downsizing.  
<P>
<LI>No new scientific studies refute the findings of the 1992 Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended that "military readiness should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
<P>
<LI>The American people still support a go-slow approach to expanding military roles for women.
<P>
<LI>America's likely adversaries still assign only men to their militaries because they know that national security interests cannot be sacrificed to social experimentation.</UL>
<P>
On October 6, 1994,  Representative Ike Skelton (D-Missouri) of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel hosted the only hearing since 1991 to consider assignment policies for women.  Although Mr. Skelton began the hearing by stating, "Women should not serve in direct ground combat," and, "I'm of the opinion that second place does not count on the battlefield," he limited the two-hour hearing to one three-member panel which supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had asked to hear dissenting views from a panel of commissioners from the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.  His request was denied.
<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to "raise and support armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and their assignments.
<P>
The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to reverse the Clinton administration's current course.  No hearings or bills are pending.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Off The Dole: No Taxpayer Support for Special Interests</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In Washington, DC some of the most intensive lobbying is done by recipients of taxpayers' money.  Using the funds received from awards, grants and contracts, these government-created special interests lobby Congress for continued, and often increased, taxpayer support.  Moreover, many of the programs created are hostile to the values of the citizens whose money is used to fund them.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On March 3, 1995, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) introduced the Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), which would prohibit recipients of taxpayer money from lobbying for continuation of their funding.  The bill is currently cosponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Rep. Mel Hancock (R-Missouri).  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Integrity in Government Act is currently before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The bill is designed to keep taxpayer money out of lobbyists' hands.  It is carefully worded so that it applies only to lobbying for continued support of various programs and agencies.  It does not apply to recipients of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.   Nothing in the legislation restricts or interferes with individual citizens' ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  
<P>
The Integrity in Government Act does not have many friends among the special interest groups that are so prevalent in Washington.  Many Members of Congress do not want to support the bill for fear of the money and power of these groups or because they like the idea of taxpayer money being used to lobby Congress for causes they favor.  
 <P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Although no hearings have been scheduled for the bill, supporters say they want to move forward with plans to attach similar legislation to each appropriation and authorization bill that comes up in Congress.  It is believed that attaching such an amendment to each appropriation and authorization will make it more difficult for special interests to oppose efforts at reform.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Stem the Resurgence of Drug Abuse</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to the culture's pro-drug influence, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The Administration's national drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" --  treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress may cut drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership. 
<P>
A nationwide survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th (36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.
<P>
The largest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is perceived differently from the "hard" drugs.  Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a "drug,"  Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, "There is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does."
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, "Young people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects."  Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.
<P>
Shalala calls for "strong and comprehensive solutions....Young people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.  They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media -- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are o.k."
<P>
These strong words are not echoed by other Administration officials.  President Clinton has been virtually silent on the topic.  And his national drug strategy focuses on a new philosophy entitled "harm reduction," which provides and supports programs to reduce the danger of drug use-related risks, like HIV infection.  Needle exchange is a key component.  The strategy is geared at changing but not eliminating drug-using behavior, in order to reduce the threat of disease due to drug use.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration has cut drug interdiction efforts and increased efforts to treat chronic abusers.  The hope is that having more abusers in treatment will reduce demand -- a step toward ending the plague.
<P>
Unfortunately, the pop culture glamorizes drugs, and there are few alternative cultural icons warning teenagers to "just say no."  Additionally, there is no sign that drug production and distribution are declining.  In fact, there continues to be an ample supply.
<P>
The 104th Congress may cut school-based drug prevention programs believing they don't work.  There are some ineffective programs, but others have good track records and should be kept.  
<P>
The House rescissions bill (H.R. 1158) cut most of the FY 95 drug prevention money.  Pending legislation in the Senate may recover some of the funds.   
<P>
The national drug crisis requires committed parents and community leaders to join forces.  At the national level, leadership such as that provided by President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan is needed to curb the drug glamorization messages and boost effective prevention programs.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Free Public Broadcasting</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 during Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" to meet a perceived need for taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial networks.  Congressional authorization for CPB is due to expire at the end of 1996.  The 104th Congress should let authorization expire and decline to appropriate any more taxpayer money for CPB.  Instead of giving more taxpayer support to CPB, Congress should let it thrive on its own, as it has shown it can do.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) takes the first steps by providing a three-year phase out of funding for CPB.  The resolution passed the House on May 18 by a vote of 238 to 193.  A weaker Senate budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) was passed on May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42.  It includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Col.) to bring commercial sponsors to CPB in order to offset possible reductions in taxpayer subsidies.  The Senate resolution includes no explicit cuts in funding and falls short of the goal of privatization.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Budget resolutions in both houses of Congress provide a starting point for privatizing CPB, but more action is needed.  Budget resolutions are only suggestions for how to spend taxpayers' money.  Bills dealing with the appropriation of CPB funds will be making their way through the Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The CPB should be privatized for several reasons.  First, the federal government should not be in the broadcasting business.  The basis for CPB's existence is the assumption that for good television programming to exist, the government must provide it.  This $285.6 million a year, anti-free market philosophy insults the intelligence of the viewing/listening public because it assumes that they won't support good programming.
<P>
Second, CPB has been a regular launching pad for attacks on the family.  Independent Television Service's Television Families, Dottie Gets Spanked, and Terminal USA ridicule traditional families and glorify non-traditional households.  A PBS documentary What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children as young as 8 years old.  The role of parents in the education of their children as well as the moral and familial ramifications of sexuality are almost invisible.  PBS's Tales of the City and Tongues Untied are offensive and graphic promotions of the homosexual lifestyle.  Both programs contain gratuitous nudity, lewdness and foul language.  Religious bigotry is also common in CPB programming. National Public Radio's The Politics of Bigotry was billed as an "in-depth investigation of the Christian Right."  It was actually an ugly smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.
<P>
Finally, in a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars so that the government can run a television network that could survive on its own anyway.  As any family knows, serious budget cutting must start with non-essentials. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Defunding CPB is a priority for conservatives.  But these efforts are being met with stiff opposition from CPB supporters in both parties who argue that opponents are trying to kill "Big Bird."  It is hoped that the merits of privatization will drown out such scare tactics.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Free the Arts and Humanities: Defund the NEA and NEH</H3></CENTER>
<P>

<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Over the years, a total of more than $5 billion in taxpayer money has gone toward the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  These federal agencies disburse millions of dollars each year in grants to institutions and individuals, most of which are not controversial.  But continued revelations of wasteful spending, public sponsorship of blatantly anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-business, pro-feminist and pro-homosexual "scholarly" projects and "art works" may finally motivate Congress to defund the endowments. 
  <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House Budget Resolution (H. Con.Res. 67), which passed 238 to 193 on May 18, provides no funds to either of the endowments.  A separate reauthorization bill, however, sponsored by Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Penn.), passed the Education and Economic Opportunities Committee on May 10.  That bill would phase out NEA and NEH by 1999 and is awaiting floor action.  In the Senate, the budget resolution sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Ariz.) would cut the endowments but not phase them out.  Senators Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kennedy, et al. have introduced S. 856, the Arts, Humanities, and Museum Services Act of 1995.  This bill would reauthorize both endowments.  Introduced on May 25, it was referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Most legislation on the NEA and NEH seeks to trim funding.  But merely reducing the budgets for the endowments would be breaking faith with American voters who want government to cut back on non-essentials now.  And leaving the endowments bleeding but still very much alive guarantees several years of shrill politicking by subsidy-seeking arts and campus groups.  It also ensures an easier renewal of spending if Congress falls back into 
liberal hands.
<P>
The NEA is budgeted $162.5 million in fiscal 1995 (down $4.5 million from $167 million because of an earlier rescission bill).  NEH is budgeted $172 million (also trimmed by $5 million from $177 million).  The House bill would also place a 5 percent cap on administrative expenses, thus gutting the Washington operations of the endowments, and send 80 percent of the grant money to the state arts councils in block grants.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  An attempt to zero out funds for NEA and NEH failed in the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee, which settled for the phase-out.  But the House Budget Resolution calls for no funding.  House negotiators will have to choose whether to do the right thing (zero out the agencies) or succumb to pressure from liberal colleagues and the more liberal Senate to retain the agencies in some fashion.  The latter course will earn budget cutters no love from the arts and humanities crowd, and will only ensure more conflict in the years ahead.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Religious Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Although the First Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the right to freely exercise religion, the ultra-broad interpretation of the provision prohibiting government from establishing a religion has nearly nullified the free exercise right.  A restorative amendment is needed to return to citizens their full First Amendment rights.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a coalition of congressmen and pro-family groups in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) may cosponsor the amendment.  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The amendment has not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Before any proposed language is introduced, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings around the country on the topic of  "Religious Liberties and the Bill of Rights."  The first hearing was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on June 8, 1995, followed by hearings in Harrisonburg, Va., Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, New York City, and Philadelphia.
  <P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The starting point for this legislation was H. J. Res. 424, introduced October 7, 1993, which contained the language discussed in the Senate during the Reagan Administration.  The premises upon which this effort is based include the following:  that a constitutional amendment approach is necessary due to existing court decisions on constitutional grounds; that participation in prayer should not be compelled; and that neither a moment of silence nor government-mandated language is acceptable.  While the language of the amendment is not yet final, it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other religious expression where non-religious expression is permitted, and from discriminating against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  This amendment will see heavy opposition from the ACLU and like-minded groups.  It is unclear whether the "super-majority" (two-thirds) needed for the amendment to pass is possible. 
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Parental Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Increasingly, parents' efforts to teach their children morals, values, and discipline are frustrated by government bureaucrats who claim a superior role in the development of the child.  A law is needed to restore to parents the right to direct the upbringing of their minor children without governmental interference.

<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are each drafting legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The bills have not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:   Both bills are on hold while the Family Research Council and other pro-family groups hammer out appropriate language.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Parental Rights Act is designed primarily as a response to parents' inability to control important aspects of their children's education.  The Act would, for example, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.   However, the Act not only protects parents' rights vis a vis education, but also prohibits government interference with regard to medical decisions for their children, reasonable corporal punishment of their children, and the direction of, or provision for, religious teaching for their children.   Some pro-life groups have some concern that the medical decision provision of the Act would prohibit governmental intervention in cases where parents attempt to coerce a daughter into having an abortion.  Similarly, there is currently some doubt as to whether the Act would indeed provide a counterbalance to privacy arguments against parental consent statutes, as it was originally envisioned.  The concept of statutorily restoring parents' rights is a good one, and, once the wording issues have been resolved, the Act will need support from pro-family citizens.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:	The bills will likely be introduced and debated this term.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation is a federally-funded program created in 1974 to provide poor people with access to expensive legal services.  In actuality, LSC serves as a deep well for anti-family litigation.  Each year hundreds of millions of dollars in legal services are donated to the poor from the private sector.  This $415 million a year pot of gold for the anti-family movement is not needed and should be abolished.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  There is no pending legislation dealing narrowly with Legal Services Corporation, but the House and Senate budget resolutions each call for rolling back LSC funding.  Thus, legislation which at least reduces funding of LSC is likely to come out of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees later this year.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Although there is no current legislation on LSC, pro-family groups, including FRC, are working on strategies for abolishing it.  These efforts include a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling for the defunding of LSC.  In mid-May, Sen. Phil Gramm's Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies held hearings on LSC.  Sen. Gramm pledged to fight the appropriation of money for LSC in the upcoming appropriations bill.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation has operated for 15 years without Congressional authorization.  Yet it continues to be one of the most powerful weapons in the anti-family arsenal.  LSC has played a major role in expanding abortion, divorce and the homosexual agenda.  It has spent $5 billion since 1974 on outrageous litigation ranging from providing cable TV for prisoners to forcing states to fund sex-change operations.  LSC has been a major combatant against welfare reform.  Supporters of LSC claim that it balances the scales in a system where poor people are at a disadvantage because of the high cost of legal services.  But state and local governments as well as bar associations and individual lawyers already provide a great deal of legal aid to the poor.  Instead of helping poor people, LSC often joins the efforts of well-funded anti-family groups such as the ACLU and the National Organization for Women.  Moreover, LSC lacks oversight.  According to Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) oversight has dropped significantly during the Clinton Administration.  Two years ago over 150 on-site audits took place, compared with fewer than 10 this past year.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle to defund the Legal Services Corporation will be a hard one.  Like many expensive government programs, LSC has appeal because it appears to help people in need.  Supporters will try to play to the public's sympathy for the poor, portraying those who want to cut the program as cruel.  But LSC's 21-year track record of radical anti-family activism will be brought to light during the debate.  Also, the deficit-conscious 104th Congress is more
likely to take a serious look at whether such programs are really necessary.

   <H1><i>United States v. Lopez</i></H1>
   <h2>Restoring a Constitutionally Limited Government</h2>
   <H3>By Edward J. Erler</H3>

</center>

<p>
For the first time in more than sixty years, the Supreme Court has put restrictions on Congress' 
use of the Commerce Clause.  Under the Constitution, Congress is delegated the exclusive power 
to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the states.  Since the New Deal 
revolution, the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to regulate those purely state and local 
matters that substantially affect commerce between states either directly or indirectly.  


<p>
Accordingly, in <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i> (1942) the Court upheld a fine assessed against a farmer who 
planted 12 acres of wheat in excess of the allotment permitted under the federal Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938, even though the excess wheat was used only for private consumption.  
As the Court noted, the wheat supplied a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be 
fulfilled by purchases in the open market.  Homegrown wheat in this sense competes with wheat 
in commerce.  


<p>
In the intervening years, the Court has routinely deferred to the judgment of Congress whether 
the regulated activity, although on its face not obviously related to interstate commerce, 
nonetheless substantially affected interstate commerce.  The result has been a tremendous 
expansion of centralized federal power over the states.  


<p>
The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Lopez</i> signals that Congress may no 
longer have unlimited discretion to expand its power under the Commerce Clause.


<p>
At issue in <i>Lopez</i> was a challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a 
federal offense for any individual to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows is a 
school zone.  Almost all states have laws prohibiting guns in or near schools, and in the Lopez 
case a state indictment was dismissed in order for federal charges to be brought.  


<p>
Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 5-4 majority, declared the act unconstitutional because it 
neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be 
connected in any way to interstate commerce.  In oral argument, the government maintained that 
the presence of guns in schools so disrupts the quality of education that economic activities are 
affected.  Future citizens will be less educated and consequently less productive; the cumulative 
affect on the nation's economic well being will thus be  substantial.


<p>
The danger of accepting such a weak causal argument was pointed out by the Chief Justice.  It 
would allow Congress to regulate <i>any</i> activity that it found was related to the economic 
productivity of individual citizens; including family law (marriage, divorce, and child custody).  
Indeed, the Chief Justice rightly concluded that under the Government's theory it would be 
difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law 
enforcement or education where states historically have been sovereign.


<p>
The appropriate constitutional argument was detailed in Justice Thomas' incisive concurring 
opinion.  Thomas noted that in adopting the substantial affects test the Court has drifted far from 
the original understanding of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed, taken to its logical extreme, the 
substantial affects test would give Congress police power over all aspects of American life.  


<p>
Thomas notes that the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence comes close to turning the Tenth 
Amendment on its head.  The Tenth Amendment generally reserves the powers not delegated to 
the federal government to the states or to the people.  This is a confirmation of the fact that the 
Federal Government is limited to the exercise of constitutionally delegated powers or to those 
that are reasonably inferred to be a necessary and proper exercise of delegated powers.  


<p>
As Thomas rightly points out, the Commerce Clause that emerged from the New Deal revolution 
allows Congress to exercise all powers not specifically prohibited, thus reversing the federal 
relationship contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution.  The New Deal interpretation of 
the Commerce Clause was explicitly calculated to allow the federal government to extend and 
magnify the reach of its regulatory powers.  


<p>
<i>Lopez</i> is a welcome reevaluation of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, and it may 
well presage the beginning of a series of decisions that will reestablish the federal relationship as 
envisioned by the Framers.  The threat posed to the administrative state by the Court's decision 
may be gauged by President Clinton's frantic reaction.  Not only has the President severely 
criticized the <i>Lopez</i> decision, but he has also ordered the Attorney General to find a way around 
the ruling!

   <H1>Restoring  Conservative  Unity</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

The radical change of the 1994 election was produced by a unity of conservatives as strong as in the days of Reagan.  All the elements of the Reagan coalition functioned together magnificently in the congressional races and a forty-year lock on the Congress was broken.  Economic and social conservatives stood arm in arm.

<p>
Now, that harmony strains and threatens to break.  Last week, a long report on the <i>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour</i> presented a parade of conservatives chastising one another and threatening to break ranks.  Social conservatives threaten to walk away from the coalition if the moral agenda is not given priority.  Economic conservatives claim that religious zealots are attempting to control politics in the name of a faith they do not share.  Of course, the liberal journalist reported all of this with delight.

<p>
The correspondent for <i>McNeil-Lehrer</i> drew the obvious conclusion:  If this division deepens, the chances of the new majority will be ended.  Real reform requires an enduring majority, a majority broadly-based and stable over time. 	

<p>
The warning signs are then apparent, and we can avoid the danger they portend only if we recover the foundation upon which all stable majorities in America must stand.  That foundation lies among the simple truths that were the basis of our country at the beginning.  When our nation stood upon that foundation, no one divided the "economic" from the "social"  issues, and no one fought about the difference between them.

<p>
These simple truths are the central principles of our country.  They address themselves to our status as human beings and citizens, and cover all of our rights and all of our duties. Conservatives should understand that these principles apply just as much and in the same way to the economic as to the social issues, and just as much to the protection of the family as to the defense of private property.  

<p>
These truths receive their finest expression in the Declaration of Independence, where they are described as certain "self evident truths."  They stem from something called "the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God."  What are these truths, and what are these laws?  They have a lot to do with common sense.  They tell us that we are free and equal citizens.  They tell us that we are on the one hand entitled to our liberty and on the other responsible for our own actions.

<p>
First of all, these principles provide the strongest foundation in history for what we now call "economic liberty."  The authors of the Declaration and of the Constitution assert this belief with simple eloquence.  Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1812 that "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who...have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."  In the <i>Federalist</i>, James Madison writes that the "chief object of government" is to "protect the different and unequal faculties of acquiring property."

<p>
The right to property is then a sacred right, no less firmly established than the right to speak one's mind or worship God in one's own time and way.  The right to property gives a vital assurance that these other rights can be secured.

<p>
What do these principles say about the importance of moral behavior?  Consider the Virginia Bill of Rights and its assertion "That no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."  

<p>
A conservative movement built upon these ideas would then encourage moral behavior.  It would reform the welfare system for example, because it encourages young women to conceive children out of wedlock.  It would not tax more heavily those who are married than those who are not.  It should support the authority and responsibility of parents over children and the obligations of husband and wife.

<p>
A conservative movement united upon the ideas of the founding would also encourage religion.  George Washington affirmed the importance of religion during his farewell address when he said that "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports...reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."  

<p>
A conservative policy on religion would respect the freedom to practice any religion that encourages good citizenship.  It would not supplant the role of religious and other charities in social welfare.  It would encourage prayer in school and upon public occasions.

<p>
A conservative movement united under these policies would act under the principles of our founding.  It would adhere to the Constitution and those higher laws, the laws of nature and of nature's God, upon which that Constitution stands.  

<p>
Such a conservative unity can lead America from its troubles.  Such a unity can be built only by a people who know as well as Jefferson the meaning of their country, and who fight as bravely as Washington for its principles.

FRC's staff of public policy experts -- and extramural family experts recommended by FRC -- are frequently called to testify before Congressional committees debating pending legislation or seeking guidance on vital family issues.  FRC also routinely submits unsolicited testimony to House and Senate Committees open to informed public opinion.  Topics range from the mundane and technical to the speculative and controversial.  Congressional testimony represents one of FRC's prime educational functions as a nonprofit organization located in the nation's capital.

Liberal Republicans in the Senate are at it again, doing their best to derail the conservative
revolution -- and if you don't call or write today, they'll get away with it!<p>

Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced and passed an appropriations
bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that reverses the hard-fought
gains we made during House consideration of the measure last month.  <p>

The bill as it came out of the House was the single most dramatic example of the conservative
revolution at work.  Among other things, the House version of the Labor-HHS appropriations
bill:<p>
<ul>
     <li>Ended welfare for lobbyists by placing new restrictions on taxpayer funding for political
     advocacy groups;<br>
    <li> Terminated funding for the Office of the Surgeon General;<br>
     <li>Ended taxpayer financing of abortions through Medicaid;<br>
     <li>Abolished the liberal Goals 2000 Program;<br>
    <li> Overturned President Clinton's executive order barring the use of striker replacements by
     federal contractors;<br>
    <li> Established tough new restrictions on the regulatory authority of OSHA and the NLRB.<br>
</ul>
But Senator Specter stopped the train in its tracks!<p>

Senator Specter -- who has a lifetime ACU rating of just 39, making him the 4th most liberal
Republican in the Senate -- decided to sabotage the work of his party's members in the House,
and refused to even consider any of these tough legislative riders.<p>

As you read this, the Specter version of the appropriations measure may already have passed the
full Senate -- but it's not over yet, because the two competing versions will still have to be
reconciled in a House-Senate Conference Committee.<p>

Call,  write or fax Senator Specter today, and let him know what you think of his arbitrary and
capricious decision to abandon his party's principles and support higher spending, more
regulation, and other failed liberal policies.<p>

You can reach him at:<br><br>

     SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER<br>
     530 Hart Senate Office Building<br>
     Washington, D.C.  20510-Concord, N.H. 03301<br>
     Phone:  (202) 224-4254   FAX (202) 224-1893<br><br>

Or, if you'd like, email your thoughts directly to the Senator at <a href="mailto:Specter@bizserve.com">Specter@bizserve.com</a>
<p>

Remember, it's not too late to act -- but to have an impact on this debate, you must call or write
Senator Specter today!<p>

Tell him you want him to support the original House-passed language in the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill.  Demand that he do his part to further the progress of the conservative
revolution, and overturn four decades' worth of failed liberal policies.<p>

Call or write Senator Specter TODAY and let him know just you think about his decision to
become a turncoat Republican.<p>

Together, we can fight Senator Specter's plan to let business as usual reign on in Washington. 
We'll keep putting the pressure on him here in Washington, but we need the help of good
conservatives like you to make it work at the grass-roots level.  <p>

So contact Senator Specter TODAY, and we'll be able to get a good, tough Labor-HHS
appropriations bill, like the one they originally passed in the House.<p>


Remember -- Senator Specter is running for President. If he has a campaign office in your state,
call there, too.<p>

An Article By Gracie S. Hsu

<p>

Since joining the Family Research Council in September 1993, Gracie 
Hsu's research skills -- honed at the Johns Hopkins University -- 
have served as an asset to the work of the pro-family advocacy group's 
policy department.  In her current position as policy analyst, she is 
responsible for managing the Family Research Council's efforts in the 
fields of adolescent sexuality and life issues.  As part of FRC's 
outreach to the academic, media and legislative arenas, Miss Hsu's 
work consists of tracking, analyzing, and writing critical essays on 
new research, policy trends, and legislative initiatives concerning 
teen sexuality and abortion issues. She also represents FRC, 
explaining pro-family policy to audiences from capitol hill to the 
<i>CBS Evening News</i>. Her craftsmanship with the written word is 
a special skill she brings to FRC. As an op-ed writer, Miss Hsu 
(pronounced "Shoe") has been published in the <I>San Diego Union 
Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Orange County Register</I>, and 
other leading publications.

<p>

Miss Hsu began her work at the Family Research Council as a research 
assistant for health policy issues during the crucial first phases of 
health care reform.  Her project opposing abortion in health care 
reform contributed to U.S. Senate hearings on the subject. Prior to 
joining the Family Research Council, her research experience included 
work at Johns Hopkins on health issues and at the University of 
California at Los Angeles in a study of urban poverty.

<p>

Work in adolescent issues is also a task to which Miss Hsu comes 
well-prepared.  She served as a student health advocate under the 
University of California's Department of Student Health Services 
from 1990-1991, advising her peers on an individual basis regarding 
their various emotional and physical health concerns.  She also 
gained experience by participating in California's Watts Public 
Library Literacy Program, in which she worked as a tutor for inner 
city youth.

<p>

Miss Hsu graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with College Honors from 
the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English.  She went on to graduate <I>summa cum 
laude</I> with a Masters of Health Sciences degree from the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, 
Maryland.

   <H1>Fatherlessness</H1>
   <h2>The Central Social Problem of Our Time</h2>
   <H3>By Tom Lowe</H3>

</center>

<p>
For most of our history, a child growing up in the United States of  America could reasonably expect to grow up with a 
father at home.  Today, he can reasonably expect not to.  Fatherlessness is fast replacing fatherhood.  Never in our nation's 
history have so many men decided to abandon their children.  And never have the effects of that abandonment been felt so 
ubiquitously.


<p>
Divorce; child poverty; youth violence; the failure of education; unsafe neighborhoods; domestic violence; the weakening of 
parental authority--all are most directly attributable to the scourge of fatherlessness.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless 
America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in 
which their fathers do not live . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social 
problems."


<p>
Our ancestral understanding of fatherhood, which in many ways was responsible for early American success and survival, is 
under siege.  Men in general, but fathers in particular, are viewed as superfluous--America is now unable to believe in 
fatherhood as an inherent domain of males that absolutely effects the well-being of children and society.  

<p>
A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty.  In married-couple 
homes as of 1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty, while in single-mother homes an 
unbearably sad 66 percent of young children lived in poverty.  And consider that in married-couple homes with pre-school 
children, median family income in 1992 was approximately $41,000, while in single mother homes, median income was 
about $9,000.  America cannot address its child poverty problem without first addressing its most powerful determinant--fatherlessness. 


<p>
After protection and provisional responsibility, the central task of fatherhood is cultural conveyance.  As described in the 
Book of Genesis, paternity does not just mean males providing food and shelter for children, it also means that they ensure 
that the child grows up to be a <i>certain type of person</i>.  Biological paternity means producing a child--fatherhood means 
producing an adult.  For boys, the most insidious manifestation of fatherlessness has been juvenile violence, and for girls it 
has been out of wedlock childbearing.  


<p>
Studies show that girls who grow up without fathers are at much greater risk for early sexual activity, adolescent 
childbearing, and divorce.  Among white families, one study finds that "daughters of single parents are 111 percent more 
likely to have children as teenagers, and 164 percent more likely to have a pre-marital birth."


<p>
These studies also confirm that boys who grow up without a father at home are three times as likely to get in trouble with the 
police.  Historian James Q. Wilson reminds us that, "Neighborhood standards may be set by mothers, but they are enforced 
by fathers, or at least by adult males.  Neighborhoods without fathers are neighborhoods without men able and willing to 
confront errant youth, chase threatening gangs. . . The absence of fathers. . . deprives the community of those little platoons 
that informally but often effectively control boys on the street."


<p>
Frighteningly, an entire generation of young people is now growing up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or 
responsible males.  As of 1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, and in certain welfare-infested inner city 
neighborhoods over 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.  <i>Over 80 Percent.</i>


<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments to out-of-work mothers usurp a man's traditional role 
as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner unnecessary, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He 
turns to the super-masculine world of the streets:  drinking, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties 
that bind men to their children explains much of the rampant pathology from the city streets to small towns across America.


<p>
What is the solution to fatherlessness?  Laws strengthening the traditional family are part of the answer.  There should be 
firm public endorsement of healthy families, especially in textbooks written for schools.  Divorce should be made more 
difficult.  So-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our childrens well-
being.  State legislatures could reaffirm the value of two-parent families by passing laws to prohibit sperm banks from 
selling sperm to unmarried women.  The tax codes, which are unfriendly, if not downright hostile to families, must be 
changed to promote two-parent families and the raising of children at home.


<p>
As Blankenhorn insists, the most urgent social challenge for America as it heads into the twenty-first century is the re-
creation of fatherhood as a vital social role for males.  Does every child deserve a father?  The current answer in American 
society is "no" or "not necessarily."  The only answer that can save our children's future is an unabashed yes, but today, few 
ideas could be more radical.

<title>Current Proposals</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<font size=5><strong>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE TAXATION OF 
SAVING</strong></font><br>
<hr>
</center>
The Flat Tax (Dick Armey), The Sales Tax (Bill Archer), The USA (Unlimited
Savings Allowance) Tax (Domenici-Nunn), and The Individual Investment
Account Act (Breaux-McCrery)
<p>

All four revolutionary tax proposals have identical prime objectives:  (1)
totally <i>eliminating</i> the double tax on saving; and (2) greatly
<i>simplifying</i> the tax system.  These objectives are entirely proper
and achievable.  What it takes is sound judgment, good leadership, and the
guts to stop the "hand-wringers" from conjuring up ghosts that drag out
and obfuscates sound analysis and action. 
<P>
Appropriate comments follow.  But first, please recognize that
the League focuses on the taxation of <i>personal saving</i>.
Corporate tax changes, while relevant, are not commented upon herein.
<P>

<b>Flat Tax</b>:<br>  

We applaud it, because it totally removes the double tax on saving.  It
has undeniable attraction via simplicity. It is challenged by some,
because they claim it is less "progressive" than they prefer.  It suffers
due to the prospective elimination of tax deductions for home mortgage
interest, charitable contributions, and certain other embedded, existing
tax provisions. 

<P>
<b>Sales Tax</b>:<br>  

Again getting rid of the double tax on saving is a major attribute.  The
champions of the sales tax stress that it removes the whole income tax
structure and effectively removes the need for any IRS-with its legions of
tax collectors.  Further, the sales tax can be adjusted to correct the
present tax imbalance on foreign imports and exports.  Some commentators
fear that the sales tax will eventually evolve into a value-added tax,
with many levels of taxation that are masked from the public.  The sales
tax concept is simple, but faces a need for public acceptance due to its
perceived regressiveness.  The states, many who rely upon sales taxes, may
fight a national sales tax. 

<P>
<b>Domenici-Nunn (N-D) USA Plan:</b><br>

The centerpiece of the USA Tax is the Unlimited Savings Allowance from
which the new tax system for America's future derives its name" (4/25/95
N-D memo).  This plan has been endorsed by the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The N-D plan, insofar as the taxation of personal saving is concerned, is
virtually identical to in concept, and is derived from, the Individual
Investment Account Act.<p>

<b>The Individual Investment Account Act (S. 159 and H.R.
328):</b><br> 

Described by knowledgeable economists as ... "one of the boldest, most
imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth tax initiatives in many
years," this plan zeros in solely on the major fault with the existing
income tax system:  the senseless double tax on saving.  <p>

The simple, effective substance of this legislation creates an IRA-type
account for every person into which unlimited, fully tax-deductible
contributions may be made.  All assets accumulate on a tax-free basis. 
There is no penalty tax, nor forced distributions at any age.  There is no
income tax nor estate tax at death, and beneficiaries have the same tax
basis as the benefactor.  All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax
rates.  The net effect of this legislation is, like the other more complex
legislation above, a zero tax on <i>after-tax income </i> that is saved
and invested.  Additionally, this act provides a simple, most desirable
"home and account" rollover procedure that helps people not only purchase
their home, but also sell their home on a sound, tax-deferred "investment

   <H1>What Welfare Should Be</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn & Thomas G. West </H3>

</center>

What should welfare be twenty-five years from now?  The current system and everything like it should be a faint memory.  In its place should be a system that is local in administration.  This new system must support family and work.  It must respect marriage, disdain illegitimacy, and distinguish the deserving poor from the pretenders.  It must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and 
organizations, in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy.  It must be fair and good.

<p>
During the 1960's, 70's, and 80's the public debate over welfare consisted mostly of money talk.  Can we afford welfare?  Who should have to pay for it?  Much, however, has changed over the past decade. Now, thanks to the accumulation of bad experience, and the clear heads of a wise few, we are reaching to the fundamentals.  We see now that a vast treasure of ill targeted relief has bought us only more misery.  We see that the poor have been hurt even more than the tax payer has been bilked.

<p>
Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per year; an increase of 750 percent.  The reasons for this dependency are many and complicated, but consider that in 1992, for example, a welfare mother of two living in California with a Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax amount she could have earned at a full-time minimum-wage job.  Why should she work when welfare prices work out of the market?

<p>
The percentage of poor Americans has not been reduced since modern welfare began in the mid-1960s.  On the contrary, these programs have in truth worked against economic growth and opportunity for the poor.  Before the big 1960s increases in welfare spending, the poverty level had actually been <i>declining</i> rapidly.  According to government figures, 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has stubbornly remained ever since.

<p>
The stubborn immobility of the poverty numbers is bad enough, but it is not the worst.  The nature of poverty has changed insidiously.  Prior to the 1960s, most poor Americans were poor because their work brought them a paltry income.  But since the middle of the 60s there has been a sharp and ominous increase of social pathology in urban, welfare-infested communities.  Poverty has increasingly become a problem stemming from a new underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  Many of them, especially males, reject the qualities that most Americans admire:  self-control, sobriety, duty to family, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.

<p>
The new underclass, mired in government dependency, rejects the ethic of hard work and self-reliance.  Low-paying jobs--where many Americans have traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time and getting the job done--are scoffed at.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as "chump change."  For this urban underclass, many of whom have spent care-free years not working, hanging around smoking reefer and drinking 40-ounce beers, the reality of trying to hold down a regular job is too much.  In this world, the drug dealing thug is lionized and the man who sweeps floors is scorned.  Welfare has taught our poor all the wrong lessons.

<p>
If today's welfare policies are not working, what then is the alternative?  Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago, at least 90 percent of Americans were desperately poor by today's standards.  By the 1960s a majority of Americans had moved into the middle class.  The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program was simple: 
<ol>
<li>Establish free markets and opportunity for all who can work.
<li>Provide strong governmental support for the traditional family and for a morality of self-control, industriousness, and basic decency.
<li>Provide individual support in local communities for the deserving poor (orphans, the elderly, and the disabled), and temporarily for the wayward able who desire to pull themselves out from poverty.
</ol>


<p>
Let us assume that the federal government is acting on the new prevailing intellectual consensus about poverty programs by handing over to states and local governments the authority to set and administer their own assistance programs for the poor.  With that in mind, here are characteristics of programs and ideas that can help in the transition away from the disastrous federal welfare state.

<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Political and community leaders should again talk candidly about virtue, vice and shame.</i></b></ul>

<p>
We know destructive and immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us and there is no reason to refrain from pointing out the truth.  One of the most frustrating problems in trying to resolve the current poverty question, as <i>Newsweek</i> pointed out in a cover story last fall, is the fact  that "shame" has all but disappeared from American society.  Thirty years ago, it was considered shameful to be on the government dole.  But beginning in the 60s, as Marvin Olasky points out in <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, the poor were taught by welfare organizers that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Before that, he says, poor mothers had  "a sense that welfare should be avoided."  But, "the constant repetition of <i>rights</i> got through."  The result was "a changing outlook among many poor and the near poor."  The deceptive notion that there was "dignity" in accepting government aid was widely promulgated in these years.  Accordingly, within a few years a much larger proportion of those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.  

<p>
When the stigma of accepting hand-outs is lost, so then is much of the self-reliant spirit it takes for people to pull themselves out of poverty.  Society must not be afraid to cast shame upon laziness, and leaders must affirm with renewed vigilance the duties and responsibilities of citizenship:  hard work, honesty, duty to family and self-sufficiency.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Understand that fatherlessness is the central social problem of our time.</i></b></ul>

<p>
It is in fact the key to solving poverty and crime problems.  While we know children do better with a father at home, and while it is damaging for a child to grow up without one, an almost incomprehensible disaster happens when an entire generation of young people grows up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or responsible males.  As of  1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, but in certain welfare-infested inner city neighborhoods 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.

<p>
The problem, however, has spread far beyond the inner city.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live. . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy. . . . A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty."  These studies indicate that in married-couple homes as of  1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty; while in single-mother homes a deplorable 66 percent of children lived in poverty.  

<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments usurp a man's traditional role as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner superfluous, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He turns to the masculine world of the streets:  drinking, gang banging, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties that bind men to their children explains much of today's rampant pathology.

<p>
Cash payments to underage girls who decide to have children without bothering to get married put the government in the indefensible position of encouraging reckless sexual behavior and illegitimate births.  Laws supporting family integrity need strengthening.  There should be firm public endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and mother raising their own offspring.  Divorce should be made more difficult; and so-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our children's well-being.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>A serious response to the crime that plagues poor neighborhoods is required forthwith.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the urban quagmire most poor now find themselves trapped in, there is a clear and present need for an efficient system of arrest, prosecution, trial (not plea bargains), rigorous adherence to stiff sentencing, a crackdown on youth violence, and imprisonment for the first violent offense.

<p>
The most pressing purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  That purpose is subverted daily and pervasively in every major city in America, where flagrant piracy is a way of life.  The law-abiding poor need protection more urgently than the law-abiding middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer neighborhood.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>The failure of public schools must be acknowledged and repaired.</i></b></ul>  

<p>
In the immediate term, tax credits or vouchers for school expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to private schools, something that is an affordable option today only for the middle class and the wealthy.  In the longer term, public schools need radical overhaul.  Control over schools should be returned to local communities, and large numbers of administrative positions should be canceled.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Private charity must be supported and not supplanted by the government welfare system.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the current "division of labor" in welfare, private charities provide few "on-line services," which means giving direct help to the needy.  That job is done by government.  Private action is forced to the sidelines, where it spends its time conducting experiments, running model programs, and giving expert advice to the government.  Private charity must be liberated so that it can flourish in America as it once did. We should invest private groups with the responsibility to do the main work in assisting the poor.  

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Separate the deserving poor from the lazy at the local level--make welfare less generous and 
more burdensome.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Olasky describes how local assistance programs in the nineteenth century separated the "idle" from the "truly needy" by using "work tests" to discern the character of those seeking assistance.  Charities and shelters had "wood-yards" attached to their property.  "Transients willing to chop were given two meals and a nights lodging."  Not surprisingly, a commentator in 1894 noted that, "when the managers of a Boston charity attached a wood-yard and announced that relief would be given to no able-bodied man, unless willing to do a certain amount of work, the daily number of applicants fell off at once from one hundred and sixty to forty-nine."  Today, and in the future, of course, the wood-yard would be some variance on "workfare," but the idea remains the same:  To provide basic sustenance consistent with the apostle Paul's common-sense injunction, that able-bodied men who do not work are not entitled to eat.

<p>
The first steps in replacing the welfare mess should focus on turning assistance into a temporary safety-net instead of the entrapping spider web it is today.  For instance, people in dire need whose families cannot help them should have to live in local communal arrangements, with requirements for long hours of work, and  with strict rules of behavior (no overnight guests for the unmarried).  Getting tough on dependency is the only solution.  Benjamin Franklin said of welfare, "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it." 

<p>
America needs to discover again, as we once knew well, that true compassion calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than as mindless children who will never grow up.

   <H1>Imagineering a State Budget</H1>
   <H3>By Tom McClintock</H3>

</center>

In Anaheim, California, the creative technicians at Disneyland use the term, 
"Imagineering" to describe the process of letting their imaginations run wild and then 
trying to engineer fantasy into reality.  In Sacramento, California, the creative politicians 
at the Capitol use the term "budgeting" to describe a similar exercise.  The principal 
difference is that the Disney folks are good at it.

<p>
The Imagineers in Sacramento have once again produced a budget that fantasizes much 
higher revenues than the state will receive, much lower expenditures than the state has 
authorized, with virtually no budget reserve.  Thus, every miscalculation will 
immediately translate into red ink, piling on to the already staggering debt load 
shouldered by California's taxpayers. 

<p>
Since 1990, California's economy has significantly <i>under</i>-performed the rest of the 
nation--dragged down by one of the heaviest tax and regulatory burdens in the country.

<p>
Nevertheless, California's new budget is based on predictions of a miraculous economic 
explosion in 1996, including a 33 percent jump in building permits. 

<p>
Last year, Californias personal income grew only half as fast as the rest of the country, 
but next year, the budget requires an economy growing a 33 percent faster than the 
nation.  Last year, Californias employment grew at only one third the national rate.  Next 
year, it must grow 25 percent faster than the rest of the country.  Taxpayers will make up 
the difference between fantasy and reality.  Meanwhile, the budget counts on a $500 
million federal gift that Washington has not even agreed to give.

<p>
In their defense, Sacramentos Imagineers are quick to point out that the budgets 
economic forecasts are "mid-range estimates, when compared to other forecasters."  
That's an important distinction, since the "other forecasters" they use for comparison have 
been very good at over-estimating the states performance in past years.  Economists like 
Arthur Laffer, who have been consistently correct in predicting Californias economy, are 
far more pessimistic.  Laffer observes that Californias economy now drags along at the 
bottom of national numbers, on its way to becoming "perpetual West Virginia."

<p>
On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social 
welfare spending.  But theres a hitch.  The cuts cant take effect until waivers are granted 
from the federal government, or federal laws are changed.

<p>
Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a 
deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  Thats a very likely 
scenario.  The state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made last year.  The same 
imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit.

<p>
In addition, a number of court cases are pending against the state for past fiscal 
gimmicks.  For example, past budget games have shorted the state's pension system of 
nearly $1 billion. Court cases challenging state raids of this nature--which are part of the 
state's structural deficit--are very likely to add $2 billion to the states obligations, yet no 
reserve has been set aside.

<p>
A press release from the budgets author boasts, "Without any gimmicks, tricks, or smoke 
and mirrors, the proposed 1995-96 budget is balanced and even has a small reserve of $41 
million."  "Small" is putting it mildly. It amounts to 95/1000ths of one percent of the 
state general fund.  The Imagineers may not have relied on "smoke and mirrors," but their 
new budget will only fly with ample quantities of faith and trust--and a little of Tinker 
Belles pixie dust.

<p>
The difference between the fantasy of this years state budget and the reality of the states 
ailing economy will be measured by a growing deficit that future taxpayers will bear.  
Meanwhile, the state continues to carry at least $2.5 billion of debt from past years, or 
about $300 per family, which California taxpayers must eventually pay. 

<p>
Kudos to those few legislators who stood in the face of intimidation and pressure to vote 
against this wasteful and irresponsible budget.  The fact that this years budget was 
passed by a bi-partisan vote should not be hailed as a breech in "gridlock".  Instead, 
support for this business-as-usual budget, which will continue to drag California to its 
knees, should be seen for what it is: a sad commentary on the quality of political 
leadership in California.

   <h1>Tom McClintock</h1>

</center>
 
<p>

Tom McClintock serves as Director of Economic 
and Regulatory Affairs for the Claremont 
Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies 
in Sacramento.  He is the foremost spokesman 
in California on conservative fiscal policy and state 
government waste.

<p>

Mr. McClintock is the author of the most 
comprehensive survey of state government waste 
available and has published numerous articles 
on the state's finances. He is regularly quoted in 
budget and fiscal stories from Sacramento.  
Of his work, Dan Walters of the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> has 
written that Tom McClintock has "consistently 
been one of the very few legislators who's been 
right about what California is experiencing."  
In May 1993, Tim Ferguson of the <i>Wall Street 
Journal</i> observed, "Mr. McClintock remains 
about the only man in California who has 
consistently projected correctly the magnitude of 
the budget crises of the 1990s."  The <i>Orange 
County Register</i> said,  "Former Assemblyman 
Tom McClintock has consistently been among the 
most accurate forecasters of the effects of state 
tax and spending policies."

<p>

McClintock was first elected to the California Legislature 
in 1982 at age 26, and 
immediately earned a reputation as a freshman who 
was unafraid to stand up to legislative 
leaders.  Within two years, he became Assembly 
Republican Whip, a leadership position he held 
for five years.  In 1987 he jointly authored the 
Mello-Condit-McClintock Tax Rebate Act, which 
returned $1.1 billion of tax over-collections to 
the taxpayers of California.  In 1992, he authored 
California's current lethal injection death penalty law.

<p>

For a period of four years, beginning in 1978, 
McClintock wrote a newspaper column which 
he syndicated nationally in 1980.  From 1980-82, 
McClintock served as Chief of Staff to Senator 
Ed Davis.  He is a recognized expert in parliamentary 
law and is designated as one of the fewer 
than 2,000 Professional Registered Parliamentarians 
in the United States by the National 
Association of Parliamentarians.

<p>
Active in Republican politics since 1972, he served 
from 1973-1974 as president of the 
California Student Republican Organization; from 
1979 to 1981 as Republican County Chairman 
for Ventura County; and from 1985 to 1992 as Resolutions 
Chairman for the California Republican party.

<p>

In 1984, McClintock was named one of five 
outstanding young Californians by the 
California Jaycees and received the civilian 
Medal of Merit from the Ventura County Peace 
Officers Association for rescuing an elderly man 
from a condominium fire in 1985.  He has been 
honored by numerous taxpayer associations around 
the state for his leadership on state budget issues.

<p>

From 1992-1994, McClintock served as Director 
of the Center for the California Taxpayer, a 
project of the National Tax Limitation Foundation.  
In 1994, he overwhelmingly received the 
Republican nomination for California State Controller, 
narrowly losing the general election by one and a half points.

<p>

Tom McClintock and his wife, Lori, have two children, ages 3 and 5.

</center>

Once a gladiator in the trenches of the National Football
League, now a pro-family advocate, Phillip V. Olsen joined the
Family Research Council in 1992 where he is Vice President for
Resource Development.  In his new capacity, the former professional
athlete directs his energies into marketing the pro-family, policy,
lobbying and educational organization.  As FRC takes its analysis
of pro-family policy to our nation's leaders and lawmakers, Mr.
Olsen and his Resource Development team broadcast the news about
FRC to its supporters nationwide.  His work involves the coordination
of resource development and grass roots networking as well as
the oversight of programs, activities and events that deliver
the message of FRC.

<p>

Mr. Olsen may be best known as a consensus first team collegiate
All-American Defensive End who was also a first-round NFL draft
choice in 1970. From there the two year All-American went on to
play nine years in the NFL, until his retirement in 1979.  A highly
decorated athlete during his athletic career, he was inducted
into the State of Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.  He was also
named to Utah State University's All-Century football team in
1993 and was inducted into it's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994.

<p>

As a concerned professional athlete, Mr. Olsen, and his brothers
Merlin and Orrin, originated and operated the Olsen Brothers All
Sports Camps throughout the western U.S.  He has also initiated
a number of student/athlete enhancement programs to promote athletic
and academic achievement. Mr. Olsen has continued his career
in sports through his work as a color commentator covering college
football on radio and as a member of the NBC TV broadcast support
team covering two Super Bowls and numerous other college and NFL
football games.

<p>

In business, Mr. Olsen has more than twenty years experience
in commercial/industrial real estate.  His experience includes
expertise in real estate finance, development, brokerage and investor
equity funding.

<p>

Active in community service, Mr. Olsen has served as chairman
of the NFL Players Association Men's Committee for Childhelp USA,
a national not-for-profit organization serving abused and battered
children.  He has also been actively involved with a number of
other charities and volunteer organizations such as Life to Life,
Sigma Chi Fraternity, the California Care Coalition, the Billy
Graham Crusade, &quot;Men at the Marriott&quot;, Friends of the
Family Research Council, and South Coast Community Church.

<p>

Mr. Olsen graduated from Utah State University in 1970 with a
Bachelor's degree in business and economics. He and his wife Connie
and their two daughters live in Maryland.

<p>

</center>

Just prior to the 104th Congress, Catherine A. Deeds joined the 
Family Research Council in 1994 as a lobbyist to both the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her responsibilities 
include developing legislative strategy, meeting and working with 
key decision makers on Capitol Hill, and tracking current policy 
developments. With a broad understanding of the legislative 
process, Miss Deeds focuses on specific family issues that 
incorporate her policy skills and background.

<p>

Formerly a Legislative Assistant in 1993 for freshman U.S. 
Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Miss Deeds followed 
a number of domestic policy issues such as health care, labor, 
veterans, senior citizens, religion, and family.

<p>

Miss Deeds gained key legislative experience with family policy 
issues in several different arenas especially during a political 
appointment in the Bush Administration. In 1992, Miss Deeds 
assisted the management of the Office of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation in the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. She served as a liaison and political appointee 
in the Bush Administration to over two hundred Congressional Offices 
on public health issues.

<p>

On Capitol Hill in 1991, Miss Deeds worked as Policy Analyst for 
the House Republican Study Committee where she performed extensive 
research and writing on issues including health care, civil 
rights, labor, family, and education.

<p>

In 1989, Miss Deeds established her expertise on family issues as 
she served on a House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and 
Families. This position included not only the reporting on various 
topics affecting children and families but also the screening 
of witnesses for Congressional hearings.

<p>

From 1987-1989, Miss Deeds served at Free Congress Research and 
Education Foundation as Managing Editor of the monthly Family 
Protection Report and later, Associate Editor of the twenty-four 
page, monthly Family, Law & Democracy Report.

<p>

Cathy Deeds currently serves on the board of directors at a crisis 
pregnancy center and Advisory Board for American Collegians for 
Life, has volunteered for five campaigns for pro-life candidates, 
and founded the Arlington chapter of the Virginia Society for Human 
Life.

<p>

In 1986, Cathy graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Journalism.

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage 
is &quot;the foundation of the family and of society, without which there 
would be neither civilization nor progress.&quot;

<p>

Because of its crucial role, marriage has a special status within
the culture and the law.  Its essence -- the joining of one man
and one woman in an exclusive legal, sexual, economic and spiritual
bond with the procreation of children as a desirable and common
result -- had not been seriously challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

<center><h3>Hawaiian Havoc</h3></center>

<p>

Now, a tiny segment of a tiny fraction of the population -- the
homosexual activist community -- is on the verge of radically
redefining marriage and family.  If they succeed, all distinctions
based on sex may fall, and the worst aspects of the rejected Equal
Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals will gain the &quot;right&quot;
to adopt children; schoolchildren will be taught that homosexual
sex is the equivalent of marital love between husband and wife;
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships;
churches will be pushed outside the civil law; and government
power will be wielded against anyone who holds the biblical view
of homosexuality.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  The
case, <i>Baehr v. Lewin,</i> was brought by three same-sex couples
who charged the state with &quot;discrimination&quot; for not
granting them marriage licenses.  Despite widespread opposition
within Hawaii (recent polls show that 71% of Hawaiians oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;), homosexual activists hope to impose
their agenda through compliant courts.

<p>

Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause calls
for states to honor each other's laws, homosexuals are planning
to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to the mainland
to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  About 25 states now have
efforts underway to protect marriage, and three of them -- Hawaii,
Utah and South Dakota -- have enacted new laws protecting marriage.

<p>

In Washington, a bill is being drafted to bind the federal government
to a &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition of marriage.  Tentatively
titled the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the bill would protect
the military, Social Security,  and all federal agencies from
radical redefinition of wedlock.

<p>

<center><h3>Full Court Press</h3></center>

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several other key cases
involving homosexuality are being decided in the nation's courts.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a key Colorado
case in which voters had passed a constitutional amendment to
bar any city or county from enacting special rights based on sexual
orientation.  About a dozen cases challenging the military's ban
on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.

<p>

In Georgia, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian
fired from her job at the state attorney general's office after
she announced that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  Bear
in mind that the attorney general is required to defend Georgia's
sodomy law.  In  New York, the state's high court opened adoption
proceedings to homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexual couples,
thus devaluing marriage and jeopardizing children.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
TWENTY-FIVE STATES MOVE TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The pattern is clear:  homosexual activists are using the courts
to get what they cannot achieve through democracy.  But the courts
do not operate in a vacuum.  U.S. Supreme Court justices noted
that one factor that affected the <i>Casey</i> decision upholding
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was the court's public image.  Amherst legal
scholar Hadley Arkes notes that if Americans boldly defend marriage,
the courts may hesitate to radically redefine it.  If the states
pass marriage protection bills, and Congress enacts DOMA, the
judicial assault on traditional morality could falter.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call your Congressman and Senators and ask that they cosponsor
the coming Defense of Marriage Act.  The Capitol Hill switchboard
is 202-225-3121.

<p>

Call state legislators and ask them to support your state's marriage
protection bill, or if there isn't yet such a bill, ask them to
sponsor one.

<p>

Educate yourself about the threat to marriage today -- from mistaken
public policies and cultural decay.  Consult the enclosed reply
card for information on new resources that defend this embattled,
but essential institution.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Border Order.</b>  H.R. 2202 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),
and two competing Senate bills, Alan Simpson's (R-Wyo.) S. 1394
and Spencer Abraham's (R-Mich.) S. 1535, each seek to reform immigration
policy.  FRC deplores nativist rhetoric and supports provisions
which reflect the following principles:  (1) Illegal immigration
must be halted; America should not reward those whose first act
in this country is to break the law, and (2) America must remain
a country that welcomes legal immigrants, with appropriate safeguards
for our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Red Letter.</b> President Clinton went on record in a Feb.
28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
saying he will veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it
reaches his desk.  Mr. Clinton claims the legislation is unacceptable
because it does not protect a woman's life or &quot;health.&quot;
FRC responded by saying, &quot;That President Clinton would veto
a ban on a procedure characterized as four-fifths infanticide
and one-fifth abortion shows his clear disregard for the value
of human life.&quot;

<b>Gambling Gambit.</b> On March 5, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to establish the National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission.  The nine-member commission would conduct a
two-year study and report its findings to states, Congress and
the president. &quot;[T]his legislation creates no new regulations
and imposes no new mandates on gambling or state and local governments,&quot;
said its sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.).  The sole purpose,
he added, is to help communities make informed decisions on gambling
questions.  Senate consideration is next.

<p>

<b>Healthy Debate.</b> On April 18-19 the Senate will debate
a health insurance reform bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.).  The bill, which President Clinton
supports, does <I>not</I> contain medical savings accounts (MSA's),
and would give Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
the power to ensure that state health insurance plans conform
with the &quot;goals&quot; of the bill, including &quot;comprehensive
coverage.&quot;  A related House bill, sponsored by Rep. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), is expected to contain MSA's, no new taxes,
and no defined comprehensive benefits package.

<b>Teens and AIDS.</b> A new study released by the White House
advocates more efforts to reduce the spread of AIDS among teenagers.
Twenty-five percent of Americans infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education and HIV testing without parental notice.  Meanwhile,
a House-Senate conference committee on the Ryan White Care Act
reauthorization is deadlocked over an amendment by Reps. Tom Coburn,
M.D. (R-Okla.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to require AIDS testing
of newborns.  The Clinton administration opposes the requirement.
FRC supports it.

<b>Wing and a Prayer.</b> The Department of Transportation is
at odds with a DOT employees' group over whether a prayer and
fellowship group can label homosexual behavior a sin.  The 50-member
Christian organization has waited more than 14 months for official
status because it rejects a &quot;nondiscrimination&quot; clause
that includes sexual orientation.  Group leaders say they welcome
homosexuals, but cannot agree to give them leadership positions
or sanction actions they consider sinful.  Meanwhile, DOT has
already given preferential treatment to GLOBE, the Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual Employees group.

<p>

<b>Court-Assisted Suicide.</b> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled March 7 that Washington state's ban on assisted
suicide is unconstitutional.  The next day, a Michigan jury acquitted
Dr. Jack Kevorkian on charges of assisting in the suicide of two
individuals, the second time he has been exonerated.  Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, writing for the Ninth Circuit's 8-3 majority, directly
linked the ruling with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the 1973 case that
established abortion on demand.  Decision by Washington state
officials on an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.

<p>

<b>Damsels in Distress.</b> A new Population Reference Bureau
study confirms what Massachusetts and California have already
found:  about two-thirds of births to teenage girls are fathered
by men age 20 or older.  In addition, a 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute
report found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were
coerced by males an average of six years their senior.  As more
girls grow up without fathers to protect their honor, their search
for a father figure leaves them more vulnerable to predatory males.

<p>

<b>Grave But Stable?</b> Another Population Reference Bureau
report reveals both positive and negative trends among U.S. families.
Good news is that the divorce rate has leveled off, the growth
rate of single-parent families has been halved, and more two-parent
families with children have formed. However, the report also shows
that the U.S. still has the world's highest divorce rate and that
single-parent families are increasing three percent annually.
Census reports such as these sometimes reflect only a change in
demographics, not a genuine attitudinal shift.

<h3>FRC Soldiers On</h3>

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) was present on March 4
in Seattle, Washington when the ACLU and the Clinton Justice Department
once again misrepresented the military's homosexual law.  In the
case of <i>Philips v. Perry</i> which involves a homosexual sailor
who admitted to misconduct, Justice's attorney told a three-judge
appeals court panel that what the military has is a &quot;homosexual
accommodation law.&quot;  In fact, it has always had an exclusion
policy.

<p>

The government cited as evidence the fiction that some homosexual
service members have successfully convinced administrative boards
that being homosexual does not mean that they will engage in
illicit conduct.  At the hearing the ACLU asserted that homosexuals
can legally serve, and then argued that the <i>Philips</i> case
was really about discrimination.  Unbelievably, it took a judge
(a Bush-appointee) to highlight the fact that Philips had admitted
to homosexual sex with &quot;a dozen&quot; men.

<p>

The MRP has participated in five federal appeals court cases.
Most recently, on March 15, it joined the <i>Richtenberg v. Perry</i>
case which involves an Air Force captain who declared himself
a homosexual.  Like the others, he seeks to invalidate the law
and the Pentagon's regulations.  This case may present another
opportunity for the MRP to make oral arguments, as it did last
December in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. The MRP will defend the
underlying law, and the Clinton Justice Department will defend
the faulty &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.

<p>

Two cases soon to be decided, <i>Abel v. U.S.A.</i> and <i>Thomasson</i>,
are competing for the attention of the Supreme Court.  Decisions
in both cases are expected this spring, and one of them will be
appealed to the high court this summer with oral arguments likely
during the court's next term.

<p>

Meanwhile, a new administration could discard Clinton's faulty
&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; regulations and require the
Justice Department to defend the law before the Supreme Court.
In any event, major news on this issue is only months away.

<h3>Rx for the Drug War</h3>

<p>

On Feb. 15, FRC hosted a national drug abuse prevention strategy
meeting.  Nationally known experts from diverse backgrounds and
regions came together to develop an eight-part action plan.  The
participants agreed:  the drug scourge is getting worse, and something
must be done to reignite grass-roots anti-drug efforts.

<p>

The strategy has a two-part prevention focus:  use of mind/mood-altering
drugs is dangerous to the individual and society, and comprehensive
community-based prevention is the most viable solution to the
drug crisis.

<p>

Drug education must begin at home.  The strategy calls for drug
education resources to be tied to accountability.  Drug abuse
messages must be congruent and consistently broadcast through
every educational setting (homes, schools, workplaces, communities
and media).

<p>

Law enforcement must identify all users and impose consequences
on abuse.  It must also create systematic accountability for funding
and success rates.  Key to the strategy is leadership.  Leaders
at all levels must speak clearly and serve as role models.

<p>

Grass-roots citizen action is vital.  Accountability for drug
abuse prevention must be locally based, and citizen groups must
have power over funds to make their programs work.  The media
must stop glamorizing drugs and provide truthful alternative messages.
The strategy calls for an annual report on media handling of
the drug prevention message.

<p>

Treatment for abusers should be delivered at the point of need
with accountability.  This includes providing appropriate long-term
treatment.  Finally, the strategy calls for reallocating available
drug funds with strict standards.  This year the federal government
will spread $13 billion across 140 programs with little accountability.

<p>

FRC wants the strategy to influence each political party's presidential
platform and all future drug-related legislation.   It provides
a federal model for the drug war that focuses the government on
supply interdiction and passes responsibility and fiscal authority
for prevention and treatment to local communities.

<p>

FRC's short-term goal is to have drug abuse recognized as a national
crisis. America must aim to cut current abuse levels at least
in half by the year 2000.  The long-term goal is the eradication
of drug abuse.

<font size=+2><b><i>Bashers, Bombers and Bigots</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

Several years ago, radical homosexual members of the ACT-UP group
invaded St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and desecrated
the Host.  Millions of Christians around the world believe that
Christ is really present in the sacrament of communion.  America
has had, tragically, anti-Catholic riots in its history.  &quot;Know
Nothing&quot; mobs even dumped one of the stones intended for
the Washington Monument into the Potomac because it had been generously
donated by the pope.  But Act-Up's church invasion set a new low
for efforts to offend the deeply held religious beliefs of a whole
community.

<p>

In suburban Washington, D.C., the Montrose Baptist Church has
twice been the site of suspicious fires.  No one has been charged
with arson, but church members have cited the congregation's strong
pro-life stance and its high profile during the 1992 Maryland
abortion referendum as making it a likely target in liberal Montgomery
County.

<p>

Now we have even more disturbing evidence of hatred in action.
At least 25 black churches have been hit in a new wave of arson
in California and a number of southern states. This form of bigotry
cannot be tolerated. That is why I have joined with a group of
black, Jewish, Catholic and evangelical Christian leaders to call
for prompt hearings by the Judiciary Committees of the House and
Senate.

<p>

The current wave of church bombings began on April 4, 1993.  That
was the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.  The pace of these attacks has picked up since January,
1995.  There is evidence of a pattern here, a pattern that suggests
a conspiracy to violate our civil rights laws. There is every
reason for the federal government to act.

<p>

It does not matter what motivates the haters.  Whether it is a
<i>Hamas</i> suicide bomber who catches Bus No. 18 in Jerusalem,
or a racist who wants to terrorize black Christians peacefully
worshipping here at home, terrorism is evil and we must mobilize
against it.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>WE MUST MOBILIZE AGAINST<br>
TERRORISM.</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

This is also a good time to reassert the real meaning of the First
Amendment. The right of the people to the &quot;free exercise&quot;
of religion is a precious one, bought with the blood of patriots
and martyrs.  Millions of our American ancestors came to this
country seeking this right above all others.

<p>

It does not help the cause of religious tolerance when the federal
government itself treats religion as a suspect classification.
Christian employees of the Federal Aviation Administration are
still finding their request to start a prayer group stiff-armed
by bureaucrats who welcome gay activist groups (see 
<a href="#news"><I>Newswatch</I></a>).

<p>

Moreover, the Clinton administration has recently moved to squelch
tuition assistance which has been provided since 1929 for Americans
serving in Ecuador.  The parents who chose the Alliance Academy,
a Christian school, were evidently pleased with the quality of
education provided and the spiritual and moral guidance their
children received there.  But now, with the opening of a completely
secular private school in Ecuador's capital, Quito, parents have
been told to enroll their kids in this private school or forego
the assistance the U.S. government has long provided.

<p>

Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism and racism have no place in our
sweet land of liberty. Nor does the disdainful view of too many
that religion itself is to be discouraged. As Irving Kristol has
wisely noted:  &quot;The real danger is not from a revived Christianity...but
from an upsurge of antibiblical barbarism that will challenge
Christianity, Judaism and Western Civilization together.&quot;
To which, I say: &quot;Amen!&quot;

</center>

Robert H. Knight examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and 
are affected by cultural values.  Of special interest are federal 
policies relating to arts funding, sex-related topics and education, 
censorship and freedom of expression, as well as the role of public 
interest groups and the media.  Mr. Knight wrote, produced and 
directed the 1994 FRC video documentary about Alfred Kinsey, <I>The 
Children of Table 34.</I>

<p>

Prior to joining FRC, Mr. Knight headed a similar program as Senior 
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.  
That program examined federal policies that undermine the traditional 
values of family sovereignty, religious freedom, property rights, 
individual responsibility and the idea of limited government.

<p>

While at Heritage, Mr. Knight authored studies on the 
<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95a1cu.html">National Endowment for the 
Arts</A>, the U.S. Labor Department's regulatory disputes with the 
Salvation Army, the federal role in early childhood education, and 
the debate over the exemption of women from military combat roles. 
He testified before the U.S. Senate's Labor and Human Resources 
Committee in July 1994 as well as the Presidential Commission on the 
Assignment of Women in the Armed Services in 1992, and was an expert 
witness in the 1993 Colorado legal case dealing with Amendment 2, 
which barred cities from extending special civil rights protections 
based on sexual orientation.  He also testified in January 1995 before 
a House Appropriations subcommittee concerning the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting and at a CPB public hearing in Washington in 
January 1994.

<p>

Before joining Heritage in September 1990, Mr. Knight was a Media 
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where he 
researched and began writing a book on cultural relativism.

<p>

Mr. Knight was a news editor and writer with the <I>Los Angeles 
Times</I>, where he worked for seven years prior to his Hoover 
fellowship.  During his 15 years in journalism, Mr. Knight has 
written for <I> The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Chicago 
Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Washington Times, 
San Francisco Chronicle, Orange County Register</I> and other 
publications.  He has appeared on the <i>CBS Evening News, NBC 
Nightly News</i>, ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, NPR's <i>All Things 
Considered</i>, CNN's <i>Sonya Live</i>, CNBC'S <i>McLaughlin</i>, 
NBC's <i>A Closer Look</i>, NPR's <i>Fresh Air,</i> a PBS special 
on the arts and other television and radio broadcasts.

<p>

Mr. Knight worked for the <I>Fort Lauderdale News/Sun Sentinel</I> 
as a weekend project coordinator and copy editor, with the 
<I>Maryland Gazette </I>as assistant editor and the <I>Annapolis 
Evening Capital</I> as a reporter, and as a reporter and later 
editor of the <I>Maryland Coast Press</I>.

<p>

Mr. Knight has a Master's degree and a Bachelor of Science degree 
in political science from American University in Washington, D.C.

<font size=+3>F</font>rom defending marriage to fighting to prevent the 
killing of the unborn late in pregnancy to presenting an unprecedented
balanced budget with family tax relief, the 104th Congress took
historic steps for America's families, according to Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Missions Met</h3></center>

<p>

To be sure, the 104th Congress did not achieve all of its
objectives.  But the addition of a large group of conservative
freshmen substantially changed the legislative agenda.  These
freshmen apparently had an impact on national policy even before
they took office.  On Nov. 10, 1994 -- two days after the election
that reversed control of Congress -- the Justice Department abandoned
its two-year effort to weaken the interpretation of a child pornography
statute.  According to a new book by former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders, the election results also prompted the administration
to reverse a decision to provide clean needles to drug addicts.

<p>

The new chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the
Constitution, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), was in the forefront
of congressional initiatives to defend the traditional definition
of marriage and ban partial-birth abortions.  Canady held very
illuminating hearings in his subcommittee, helping to set the
stage for overwhelming House approval of the Defense of Marriage
Act and the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.

<p>

Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the Senate sponsor of the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), fended off an effort by Sens. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others to attach the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and other pro-homosexual
amendments to DOMA.  The Human Rights Campaign, a major homosexual
rights advocacy group, took credit for developing this amendment
strategy to &quot;derail&quot; the Defense of Marriage Act, which
they alleged was &quot;hate-driven.&quot;  Nickles and Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) negotiated an agreement that provided
for a clean vote on DOMA, followed by an up or down vote on Sen.
Kennedy's ENDA proposal.

<p>

An overwhelming majority of senators agreed with the argument
that marriage was not instituted to 'discriminate' against homosexuals,
but rather to unite one man and one woman and provide a strong
foundation for the nurturing of children.  President Clinton signed
DOMA into law at 12:50 a.m. on Sept. 21.  Despite last-minute
phone calls from the president to wavering senators, the Kennedy
homosexual jobs proposal came up one vote short, 49-50.

"THE 104TH CONGRESS<br>
TOOK HISTORIC STEPS."

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Congress produced strong majorities in favor of the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban, but on Sept. 26 the Senate fell eight votes short
of the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
Despite administration objections, Congress did succeed in enacting
five pro-life provisions as amendments to spending bills.  One
of these measures protects medical schools from the loss of federal
funds if they refuse to provide abortion training. Another restores
a limitation on funding of abortions through federal employees'
health insurance programs.

<p>

<center><h3>More Vetoes</h3></center>

<p>

Several new anti-pornography bills were enacted and signed
into law by the president, but they will face difficult battles
in the courts.  Congress passed a balanced budget and family tax
relief package, but it was vetoed.  A modified welfare reform
package was enacted into law after stronger measures were twice
vetoed.

<p>

Line-item veto authority was provided to the president, effective
January 1997.  Vice President Gore suggested on a weekend news
program that this would give the administration leverage to press
Congress to liberalize welfare policies.

<p>

Since every new Congress starts with a clean slate, the policies
enacted during the past two years will be subject to revision
by the next Congress and president.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>FDA Checks Parents.</b> House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) recently held hearings into why the FDA
refuses to allow the marketing of an Atlanta mother's drug testing
kit to parents who want to test their children.  FDA regulations
label the kit (a plastic cup and a shipping box) as a &quot;Class
III&quot; medical device, equivalent to an MRI or  pacemaker.
Even though businesses and athletic teams use the same kit, the
FDA claims it &quot;is concerned about issues such as anonymity,
confidentiality, coercion, and family discord.&quot;  Will the
same considerations govern FDA rulings on RU-486?

<p><a name="ex-gay">

<b>Hope for Homosexuals.</b> On Oct. 10, FRC co-sponsored a press
conference for the Second Annual Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
(Oct. 11) and the new support group, Parents, Family and Friends
of Ex-Gays (PFOX).  Hosted by Michael Johnston, a former homosexual
who is HIV-positive, the event was taped for C-SPAN.  FRC Cultural
Studies Director Bob Knight also spoke, along with <I>Lambda Report</I>
editor Peter LaBarbera, the Philadelphia Family Policy Council's
Bill Devlin, Tom and Ann Taylor, who have a homosexual son, and
ex-homosexuals Anthony Falzarano and Jane Boyer.

<p>

<b>Refuge for Abortion Victims.</b> Several immigration provisions
were rolled into the FY 1997 Omnibus Appropriations package, including
a humanitarian measure which allows people fleeing from coercive
abortion policies to seek asylum in the United States.  Effective
immediately, asylum may be granted for up to 1,000 people per
year who have been forcibly aborted or involuntarily sterilized,
or have a well-founded fear of persecution under coercive population
control policies. This restores a similar policy which was effective
under the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<p>

<b>Immigrants and AIDS Treatment.</b> Congress dropped a provision
in its immigration legislation preventing taxpayer-funding of
HIV-AIDS treatment for legal and illegal aliens.  Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), chairmen of House and
Senate immigration subcommittees, said the change could encourage
&quot;thousands of HIV-infected aliens to seek asylum in the U.S.&quot;
Despite a 1993 law barring admission of HIV-positive immigrants,
earlier this year the White House directed the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to consider granting asylum to HIV-positive
individuals.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Elders on Drugs.</b> As Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders called
for a drug legalization study, favored giving needles to
addicts and advocated marijuana as medicine.  On Oct. 9, she blamed
the new teenage drug epidemic on easy-to-get marijuana and then
said pot &quot;probably causes very little problem to anyone.&quot;
Marijuana can be addictive, damages the immune system, causes
respiratory diseases and mental disorders, and impairs coordination
and judgment.

<p>

<b>Gagging Chaplains.</b> Air Force Reserve chaplain Fr. Vincent
Rigdon has filed a federal lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense
(<I>Rigdon v. Perry</I>) for interfering with his religious liberty
and free speech by issuing a &quot;gag order&quot; that bars religious
leaders from discussing specific legislation in sermons or counseling.
In June, a Pentagon directive to Catholic military chaplains
prohibited them from &quot;participating or urging others to participate&quot;
in a nationwide postcard mailing to Congress which supported a
vote to override the veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

<b>Bork's Beatitudes.</b> Will America survive?  Not without
strong churches, says Robert Bork, respected jurist and author
of the controversial new book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah: 
Modern Liberalism and American Decline.</I> Bork contends that
the loss of reliable standards of right and wrong has resulted
in a &quot;loss of nerve, which means the community cannot summon
the will to suppress&quot; many social ills such as pornography
and crime. &quot;The Church which ought to be shaping and influencing
culture is instead being influenced by culture,&quot; Bork says.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Insulting Hispanics.</b> Apparently, the Enola Gay controversy
taught the Smithsonian Institute little.  Hispanic Heritage Month,
which ended on Oct. 15, featured Andres Serrano, best known for
his vulgar and anti-Christian art.  (His creations include a crucifix
immersed in a jar of urine.)  The Hispanic community lacks not
for serious artists.  Selecting Serrano &quot;because of the body
of his work&quot; reveals the politically correct values of the
Smithsonian.  Such art merits no taxpayer money.  The real irony
is that Serrano would receive no support if his works glorified
Christian symbols.

<p><a name="pentagon">

<b>PX Porn Challenge.</b> Now that the sale of pornographic materials
at military stores has been prohibited, <I>Penthouse</I> publisher
Bob Guccione is challenging the 1997 Defense Authorization Bill,
claiming it is unconstitutional.  Guccione's magazine alone earned
$1.16 of the $4.6 million in 1995 sales at the Pentagon's worldwide
chain of tax-supported stores.  Mr. Guccione's real gripe with
the new law may be its threat to his revenues.  Getting the U.S.
government out of the porn business has been an accomplishment
10 years in the making.

<p>

<b>BULLETIN --</b> In education news, the CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)
died with the closing of the 104th Congress.  The issue of job
training reform will most likely be raised again in the 105th
Congress next year.

<h3>Katy Bar The Schoolhouse Door To Parents</h3>

<p>

Parents effectively lose their right to direct the upbringing
of their children when they drop them off at school, according
to one federal court judge.  Earlier this year, Judge Melinda
Harmon, appointed by President Bush, ruled that Katy Independent
School District in Texas did not violate parents' rights by allowing
Child Protective Services to interrogate a student without notifying
his parents, nor by instructing him to lie to his parents about
the incident.

<p>

Take, for example, the case of 6-year-old Jonathan Prevette,
who last month kissed a classmate in Lexington, N.C.  Such incidents
have a long history in schoolyards across America and, until now,
were brushed off as childhood innocence, or reprimanded by teachers
and principals after discussing the situation with parents.  But
this time it was called &quot;sexual harassment.&quot;  The &quot;culprit&quot;
was suspended for a misdemeanor he can't even spell.

<p>

What prompted such a response?  Perhaps it was a nudge from
the U.S. Education Department, which this summer distributed guidelines
urging schools to set up sexual harassment policies.  Schools
were warned that under Title IX &quot;gender equity&quot; provisions
for federally funded programs, they may be held liable for letting
&quot;sexual harassment&quot; among students go unnoticed.

<p>

With even admiring looks now considered &quot;sexual harassment,&quot;
it is no wonder a school would seek cover from lawsuits by laying
down a blanket prohibition against anything remotely affectionate.
Ironically, the very same federal Education Department has promoted
sex education schemes that push condoms and the like on boys and
girls at even younger ages.

<p>

Such cold, heavy-handed responses to children like Jonathan
Prevette will continue if federal court decisions shut parents
out and let a remote and liberal federal education bureaucracy
hand down one-size-fits-all policies.  Embracing parents, on the
other hand, would result in the improved discipline and academics
many schools now seek in vain.

<h3>A Duty to Die?</h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court has accepted two important cases concerning
doctor-aided suicide.  In <I>Glucksburg v. Washington</I>, the
Ninth Circuit federal court &quot;found&quot; a constitutional
&quot;liberty&quot; right for terminally-ill patients to be killed
by their doctors.  Judge Stephen Reinhardt explained that his
reasoning is &quot;identical&quot; to the Supreme Court abortion
cases of <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>.
These poisonous precedents live on, defending the destruction
of life.

<p>

The other case creates a constitutional right to be killed
by a doctor, not based on &quot;liberty&quot; but &quot;equality.&quot;
The Second Circuit federal court in <I>Vacco v. Quill</I> declared
that the New York law against causing or assisting suicide was
unconstitutional because it discriminates among terminally-ill
people.  According to the court, refusing artificial life support
and getting a lethal injection are equivalent, and since the former
is permitted, the latter may not be prohibited.

<p>

If these decisions are not overturned by the high court,
a &quot;right to die&quot; may soon become a &quot;duty to die&quot;
for those most in need.

<p>

A recent report on the Netherlands euthanasia experience
by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) provides a compelling context
for the current debate on doctor-assisted suicide in America.
Euthanasia of the terminally ill in the Netherlands has been
expanded since its inception in 1973 to permit the killing of
healthy people experiencing psychological distress.  Voluntary
euthanasia has given way to involuntary euthanasia, called &quot;termination
of the patient without explicit request.&quot;  In 1990, 1,000
people in the Netherlands were killed without their consent, 140
of whom were fully competent.

<p>

FRC is part of a broad coalition of groups urging the Court
to overturn the lower rulings, drafting <I>amicus</I> briefs detailing
the right of society to forbid euthanasia, and recounting the
tragedy of pre-Nazi Germany, where mercy killing was thought to
be the compassionate response to the plight of physically or mentally
disabled people, &quot;life unworthy of life.&quot;  Germany has
learned from its horrific mistakes, and now calls mercy killing
a crime against humanity.  Pray that the Supreme Court will not
sacrifice the lives of the infirm as they have done the lives
of the unborn.

<font size=+2><b><i>An Exercise of Citizenship</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>veryone needs to belong, to identify with something 
larger than self.  For some it is religion, for some it is a social 
construct, and for virtually all, it is national identity, citizenship, a
precious commodity involving rights, duties, and privileges.
I for one cannot imagine what it would be like to be the fabled
&quot;man without a country&quot; -- a man without citizenship.

<p>

Millions of people have left friends, family and their native
lands to immigrate, often at great personal risk, to the United
States.  Why?  Inscribed on the Statue of Liberty are the words,
&quot;Give me your tired, your poor; your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free. ...&quot;  That's it.  They come here for freedom.
Freedom of opportunity, of religion, from oppression, to raise
their families, to educate their children, to associate with friends
of their choice, and to achieve the American Dream.  They have
come because America is the land of the free.

<p>

Becoming an American involves more than a labeling process.
It implies adopting our language, customs, and national as well
as historical traditions.  It requires swearing allegiance to
the Constitution of the United States, renouncing fidelity to
any foreign state, and expressing willingness to serve this nation
as required by and under the law.

<p>

Recently, however, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen
has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  In the last 12 months, according
to published accounts, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
has conducted a full-court press to naturalize more than 1.2 million
new citizens.  Congressional hearings reveal that in the process,
longstanding rules have been bent, the citizenship test has been
simplified, citizenship has been granted to people who could not
speak English and, in many cases, criminal background checks may
have been bypassed.

<p>

Despite denial by the INS, evidence suggests that in at least
one case, hundreds of tests were submitted all of which were completed
in the same handwriting.  Extensive testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration alleges a White House-initiated,
election-year effort to dramatically accelerate the naturalization
of new immigrants prior to Nov. 5.

<p>

The blessings of this land have not been bought cheaply.
Millions have paid the ultimate price while defending our way
of life.  To grant citizenship cheaply to anyone who applies or
for political advantage is an insult to those who have served
this nation.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

"THE BLESSINGS OF THIS<br>
LAND HAVE NOT BEEN<br>
BOUGHT CHEAPLY."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Every American is endowed with the God-given right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Among the privileges are
the freedom to participate in the social, economic, political,
religious and cultural aspects of the community.  No wonder people
around the globe aspire to come to our shores!

<p>

Rights are important, but there are obligations crucial to
the survival of a free society.  Citizenship imposes broad responsibilities
on our nation, our community, our neighbors and our families.
One of the most cherished of these is the obligation to vote.
This democratic republic will survive only if it is truly representative
of all the people, and that requires broad participation in the
political process.

<p>

Sadly, far too few Christians go to the polls.  Abraham Lincoln
believed elections to be so important that he offered furloughs
to soldiers who wanted to vote. Edmund Burke said, &quot;All it
takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
Now is not the time for any of us, whatever our heritage, to
lower the standards of good citizenship.  After all, we are men
and women <I>with</I> a country -- a country that needs us more
than ever.

<center><h3>From the Editor</h3></center>
This month marks a departure from the usual format of <i>Washington Watch</i>. While most families are beginning summer vacations from school, Congress is entering the heart of its regular legislative schedule.  This special issue of <i>Watch</i> is designed to bring you up to date on what FRC regards as the most important pro-family policy measures pending on Capitol Hill.
<p>
On the inside pages, you'll find a convenient "scorecard" on the legislative achievements of the 104th Congress.  You may want to keep a copy handy for future reference.  Feel free to duplicate copies of these pages as you see fit for your neighbors or your church.
Bulk copies of this issue of <i>Watch</i> are available on request.  Just dial 1-800-225-4008 for information.
<p>
And remember -- for current pro-family legislative information, updated every Friday, dial FRC at 1-202-783-HOME (a toll call).
<p>
<i>Watch</i> will return in its regular format in July.  In the meantime, drop me a note and let me know how well <i>Washington Watch</i> is serving your need for timely facts and findings about how the family fares in national policy.

<font size=+2><b><i>Dear Reader:</i></b></font>
<p>Late last year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> asked me to write an essay on what pro-family Americans expected from the new Congress.  I was happy to do so, even though I had to begin my article with a concession.  The concession was this:  the new Congress should keep the promises made in the Republican Contract with America -- most of which involved economic and structural reforms -- then turn to the social agenda:  reversing the breakdown of the family, defunding our grossly mismanaged (and too often simply gross) arts agencies, protecting the sanctity of human life, reforming the education mess.
<p>
In the last four months, the pro-family movement has helped to implement a lot of reforms related to the budget and the economy.  Now it's time to deal with issues related to our families and values.  Patience may be its own reward, but in public policy, too much patience can be poison.  In my two decades in Washington, I have witnessed only a handful of opportunities for progress on a pro-family platform.  We are now in the midst of such an opportunity.  We can move forward and see dramatic policy change to strengthen the family unit morally, socially and economically.
<p>
Or we can see the opposite.  Because just as this opportunity is upon us, so too is there unprecedented danger to the family.  Every parent in America senses this fact.  To read a daily newspaper is to be bombarded with a hail of horrors.  To look at our nation's illegitimacy rate -- and to understand its correlation with youth crime -- is to recognize that America may be just a decade away from an explosion of street violence.  To see the staggering toll of abortions, the pressures on our court system to sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, and other anti-life trends, is to know that the nation is perilously close to complete dissolution of the Judeo-Christian consensus that has sustained it through the centuries.
<p>
A wise veteran on Capitol Hill put our situation to me bluntly.  For the first time since it has been his job to understand the pulse of the American people, he cannot tell which way this nation is headed.  In the next five years, he said, anything seems possible, from a religious and pro-family renaissance to an utter collapse of traditional values that brings on drug legalization, homosexual marriages, and all-pervasive pornography.  
<p>
Life and death truly have been set before us.  Which way we will choose?  What follows in this special edition of <i>Washington Watch</i> is an effort to lay out an agenda for <i>the way of life</i> -- an American way of life.  My hope is that you will share these pages with your friends, your neighbors and those with whom you attend church.  Each of us has the responsibility to take a clear look at the alternatives that lie before us -- before the window of opportunity is shut.

<p>
<i>Introduction:  The architecture of family freedom is no accident, even if, once upon a time in America, government officials almost instinctively adopted policies to protect family stability and promote civic character.  Today, both deliberate and unintentional assaults upon the family have multiplied.  But the structure of the family is written on the heart of humanity.  Lawmakers can ignore that God-given structure, but they cannot erase it.  Here are ways that the 104th Congress can help to restore family-friendly public policy</i>.
<p>
<a name="life"><center><h3>Restoring the Sanctity of Human Life</h3></center>
<p>
<b>1. The Civil Right to Life.</b> Four members of the House, two Democrats and two Republicans, have introduced constitutional amendments to restore the right to life of children before birth.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has introduced S. 320, the "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act."  It would put Congress on record as declaring, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion and that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was improperly decided.  It would also bar any federal funding or promotion of abortion, and provide for an expedited right of appeal to the Supreme Court when any abortion restriction is found unconstitutional by a lower court.  These proposals do not merely "modify" the abortion right, they would give protection to unborn children for the first time in 22 years.
<p>
<b>2. Members Against Dismemberment</b>. As a first step toward providing constitutional protection for unborn children, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will offer legislation to ban "partial birth abortions," which involve the heinous D&X procedure performed on unborn children 20-26 weeks of gestation.  Hearings are scheduled this month in the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution.
<p>
<b>3. "Lady Liberty" Means No to Forced Abortions.</b> The Clinton administration has shown blatant disregard for fundamental human rights by overturning previous administrations' asylum policy for families fleeing China's coercive "birth quota" system, with its forced abortions and sterilizations.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) recently attached language to the foreign aid bill (H.R. 1561) to restore the previous policy.  By record vote of  240-181 on the same bill, the House voted to deny U.S. foreign assistance dollars to non-governmental groups that perform or provide abortions, or that lobby other nations to repeal their laws restricting abortion.  The same measure would also require the United Nations Population Fund to end its involvement in China's draconian family planning program -- or lose all U.S. funds.  H.R. 1561 should pass the House as is, and the Senate should agree.
<p>
<b>4. Adopt Adoption Assistance.</b> In an effort to encourage adoption by lowering financial obstacles, the House of Representatives has passed a budget provision which allows taxpayers a $5,000 credit for qualified adoption expenses.  The Senate did not include the adoption assistance measure in their budget measure, passed on May 25.  An amendment offered by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) that included the credit was defeated on May 23 by vote of 69-31.  The differing budgets now go to a House-Senate conference, and FRC will be working to ensure that the adoption credit survives in the final bill.  Adoption is the <i>option of choice</i> for dealing with crisis pregnancy.
<p>
<b>5. No Abortion Mandate</b>. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) will introduce legislation to prohibit the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from requiring hospital ob/gyn residency programs (including religious hospitals) to train or refer medical students to perform abortions, lest they lose accreditation.  At stake are federal  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.  Subcommittee chairman Hoekstra also scheduled a June 14  hearing in the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to examine ACGME's coercive policy.
<p>
<a name="education"><center><h3>Empower Parents for Education</h3></center>
<p>
<b>6. Be True to Our Schools.</b> At last, serious efforts are under way to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.  The House budget resolution withdraws funding for the department.  In addition, the House Education Task Force's "Back to the Basics Education Bill" returns authority to the state and local level.  This is a high-priority issue for FRC; action could come in Congress within several months.  The decline in American education parallels the rise of the Department of Education; it's time to test the linkage in reverse.
<p>
<b>7. Be True II.</b> The House has taken one small swipe at Goals 2000, the omnibus education legislation that transferred unprecedented education authority from localities to Washington, D.C.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 1045, which would eliminate NESIC, the equivalent of a national school board set up by the law.  Congress should now repeal <i>all</i> of the intrusive programs instituted by Goals 2000.  Kudos to Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has raised the issue in the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and to Gov. George Allen of Virginia, who has refused to accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  We have to free our children from the control of the national education bureaucrats and their allies at the National Education Association.
<p>
<a name="purse"><center><h3>Protect the Family Purse</h3></center>
<p>
<b>8. Pro-child Tax Credits.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit helps relieve the tax burden on American families.  The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes the $500-per-child credit and has also included it in its budget resolution.  Unfortunately, the credit's fate in the Senate is uncertain:  key Republican senators are raising doubts about the bill, and the Senate budget resolution passed on May 25 omitted it.  The Senate should change course and act to protect the family budget as it works to fix the federal budget.
<p>
<b>9. Don't Forget Health Reform.</b> Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) has drafted legislation, not yet introduced, to change the income tax code to permit individual Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  These MSAs would give individuals and families greater control over their health care decisions, resulting in your family having coverage even if you change jobs, decreased costs, and broadened access to health care services.  FRC has joined a coalition of pro-family groups to promote such legislation.  The effort in 1994 to turn over health care to the government -- socialized medicine -- was defeated.  Sound reform is more critical now than ever.
<p>
<a name="wilderness"><center><h3>Tame the Cultural Wilderness</h3></center>
<p>
<b>10. Ban Homosexuality in Uniform.</b> Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved when Congress passed a reform bill in 1993.  Wrong.  The Clinton administration ignored the text of the law when it wrote the implementing regulations, effectively lifting the ban anyway.  Now the administration is using the federal courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a losing case in the Supreme Court.  New legislation is imperative.  None is pending, but FRC's Military Readiness Project, with senior advisers former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow, is seeking Congressional support for appropriate amendments to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.
<p>
<b>11. Porn-Free Cable TV.</b> With the encouragement of FRC, Reps. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) have introduced legislation that would require cable TV operators to provide basic cable packages free of pornography.  Meanwhile, pro-family groups are working on alternatives to Sen. Jim Exon's (D-Neb.) Communications Decency Act of 1995, S. 314.   Exon's bill is a well-intentioned attempt to restrict transmission of pornography via computer, but may actually make it more difficult to prosecute.
<p>
<b>12. Porn-Free PXs</b>. Under current policy, military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether or not it fits the definition of "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of <i>Miller v. California</i>.  The services oppose removing so-called "soft-core" pornography from exchange shelves because of the threat of legal action from the ACLU.  President Clinton has the unilateral authority to remove pornographic material from military stores.  He should do so, and Congress should adopt a resolution urging that action upon him.
<p>
<a name="misguided"><center><h3>Reform Misguided Federal Programs</h3></center>
<p>
<b>13. True Welfare Reform.</b> The full Senate should vote on a measure to restore the anti-illegitimacy provisions that were adopted by the House but then eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee on May 25.  The critical provisions are:  a restriction on federally funded cash benefits for adolescent unwed mothers; a "cap" on benefits  to mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and bonus payments to states that succeed in reducing their illegitimacy rates without increasing the number of abortions.
<p>
<b>14. X Out Title X.</b> Title X of the Public Health Service Act -- a program which funds family planning projects throughout the country -- has been a dismal failure, especially among teenagers.  Since it began in 1970, out-of-wedlock births, pregnancies, and abortions among teenagers have all risen sharply.  Sexually transmitted diseases have multiplied in variety and are on the rebound as well.  Last year, Title X received $194 million in your tax money.  This summer, FRC will work to change that figure to zero.  Planned Parenthood will be poorer, but adolescent well-being should flourish.
<p>
<b>15. Cures, Not Activism.</b> Federal taxpayers spend billions on AIDS through the Ryan White Care Act. Unfortunately, much money now goes to groups promoting homosexuality to school-children through "AIDS education." The Act is the single largest source of funds for homosexual activism. A Washington, D.C., recipient, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, endorses "safe" bathhouse sex (with condoms) and holds gay political seminars. Basic reform is needed.
<p>
<a name="ideas"><center><h3>Other Family-Friendly Ideas</h3></center>
<p>
<b>16. Women at Arms.</b> The Clinton administration has conducted an aggressive campaign to thrust women into military combat.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness.  Congress should convene hearings and prepare legislation that puts readiness first.  If they don't, someday soon your daughter could be drafted.
<p>
<b>17. Off the Dole.</b> The Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), sponsored by Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.), would limit federally funded persons or organizations, such as contractors and advocacy groups, from lobbying Congress for more funding.  It would also prohibit lobbyists from receiving federal funds.  The legislation would not apply to recipients of entitlements and would not restrict the ability of individual citizens to communicate with their elected representatives.
<p>
<b>18. Revitalize Drug Abuse Prevention.</b> Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to a resurgence of pro-drug sentiment in popular culture, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The administration's drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" -- treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress is considering cuts in drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership.  New legislation is needed to address this plague. 
<p>
<b>19. Liberate the Arts.</b> The House passed a budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) on May 18, providing no funds for the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The resolution also ends funding for public television after three years.  A separate bill (H.R. 1557), passed by a House committee on May 10, would phase out the endowments by 1999.  Meanwhile, several senators have introduced S. 856, a bill that would keep the NEA alive.  FRC and other pro-family forces favor total defunding.  Artists need their freedom -- and so do taxpayers.
<p>
<b>20. Restore Religious Rights.</b> Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a congressional coalition in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  The language of the amendment is not yet final, but it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other forms of religious expression wherever non-religious expression is permitted.  The amendment is also likely to ban discrimination against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.  No more second-class status for this First Amendment freedom.
<p>
<b>21. Restore Parental Rights.</b> Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) are working on legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Such a law would, for instance, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.  State constitutional amendments to protect parental rights have also been introduced in over half of the states.  Public policy cannot put families first if it does not empower parents.
<p>
<b>22. Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism.</b> Pro-family groups are calling for defunding of the Legal Services Corporation.  The $415 million per year program purports to provide legal services to the poor but often engages in politically motivated legal assaults on the family.  Since 1974, taxpayers have given LSC $5 billion, some of it used for things like obtaining cable TV for prisoners, fighting welfare reform, seeking public abortion funding, and forcing states to fund sex-change operations.

<a name="meaning"><center><h3>The Meaning of Family</h3></center>
<p>
On the grounds of the U.S. Capitol there is a small cluster of crab apple trees, one of the most moving monuments in all of Washington.  The cluster was planted on June 12, 1952 in memory of the Sullivan brothers, five sons of Iowa who died in 1942 during an attack upon the <i>U.S.S. Juneau</i> in the Solomon Islands.
<p>
After this devastating tragedy, the U.S. Navy changed its policy allowing service by family members on the same vessel.  Never again would a single American family lay, simultaneously, so "costly a sacrifice on the altar of freedom." (A. Lincoln)
<p>
In 1942 the contributions of American families -- the meaning of <i>family</i> -- to our nation's well-being and survival were never in question.  Today, as the accompanying <i>Blueprint</i> shows, our nation is at grave risk of forgetting all that the courage and faithfulness of families have given this land.
<p>
As Americans commemorate the family during this month of June -- from  
celebrations honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, to Father's Day -- Congress could give the nation no greater gift than to make pro-family legislation a priority.
<p>
FRC's writers and analysts are working overtime to bring the best family policy analysis to print.  Our recently expanded Government Relations staff is responding to an over-rising tide of requests for information.  Your partnership with us in this effort is essential.  FRC deeply appreciates your prayers and financial support.  If you can remember FRC with an additional gift this month, thank you.  Please use the enclosed reply card.

<a name="budget"><center><h1>KEEPING BUDGET<br>
REFORM ON TRACK</h1></center>
<font size=+3>W</font>hite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor
George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today
the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully
maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his &quot;no new
taxes&quot; pledge. Today, they decry &quot;a train wreck&quot;
they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. 
<p>
First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996
Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months
paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future
wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.
<p>
House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution
that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut
federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period,
but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton
and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the
proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. 
<p>
<center><h3>Media's False Picture</h3></center>
<p>
Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and
the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget
in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional
Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found
a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that
he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal
also produces <i>$2 trillion in new federal debt</i>.
<p>
Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming
that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They
claim the tax cuts will &quot;explode the deficit,.&quot;  But
more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief is
dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately
three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families
with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families
at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes.
Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition
of the tax package will be very &quot;family friendly.&quot;
<p>
Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending
programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending
is projected to <i>increase at twice the rate of inflation</i>
even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.
 The argument that tax cuts &quot;explode the deficit&quot; is
answered by pointing out that <i>tax revenues</i> actually increased
by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending
increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a
budget surplus today. 
<p>
Not a penny can be spent unless both houses approve. This gives
the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers'
money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal
subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal
activism. Congress has an obligation to use its &quot;power of
the purse&quot; to protect the legitimate interests of the American
family.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>BUDGET "TRAIN WRECK"<br>
WON'T HAMPER ESSENTIAL<br>
SERVICES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>A Contest of Wills</h3></center>
<p>
Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may get
through October by short-term "continuing resolutions," but by early November,
the Treasury's authority to borrow money will expire.
 Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling. 
If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash will occur. But 
<i>essential services</i> like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social
Security checks will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will
be a great hue and cry from the liberals who see their funds disappearing.
<p>
A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest
groups.  What happens if a few weeks go by and the public
doesn't miss the &quot;services?&quot;  That would provide a very
powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national
debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of
several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a
 liberal &quot;train wreck&quot; to get our country back on track,
that may be a small price to pay.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<a name="porn"><b>Calculating Moves.</b> The cyberporn debate has gone behind closed
doors during Congress' recess.  FRC has participated in several
meetings to work on a package to address this menacing aspect
of exciting new communication technology.  Later this month, Congress
will make final decisions about bill language.  Lawmakers should
stand firm in their commitment to enact strong laws against this
exploitative material, and not be swept in by the liberals' false
promise of &quot;parent-empowering&quot; software.  The software
might help, but it is no more a substitute for strong pornography
laws than bullet-proof vests are a substitute for laws against
homicide.
<p>
<b>Saving Health Care.</b> The Clinton health care plan is dead but the
issue of health care reform is still alive.  Escalating health
care costs are one of the biggest threats to the current system.
Congress is likely to consider  H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps.
William Archer (R-Texas) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.), to allow
tax-free medical savings accounts in which families or individuals
set up a special account for lower-level health care expenses,
typically around $2,500.  The benefit is the account is tax free,
portable, and can carry over from year to year for future health
needs. HR 1818 has 90 cosponsors. In the Senate, Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) has taken the lead in pushing the medical savings account
concept.

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Quarterback Kemp.</b> The 14-member commission on taxes headed by
former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, is
expected to give its report to the congresssional Republicans
 in October.  The commission examined a flat tax plan (with no
deductions), a national sales tax, and other proposals to simplify
the tax code.  Pro-family advocates will be especially interested
in how the commission handles tax treatment of families, charitable
contributions, and home ownership.
<p>
<b>New Security Order.</b> President Bill Clinton Aug. 4 signed an Executive
Order barring the federal government from denying security clearances
to homosexuals.  The 13-page order &quot;establishes a uniform
Federal personnel security program&quot; for all federal employees
to include members of the military and commercial contractors.
 It states, &quot;No inference...may be raised solely on the basis
of the sexual orientation of the employee.&quot;  Homosexuality
has long been a red flag for national security officers performing
background investigations  because it is so often linked to known
security risks, such as drug and alcohol abuse, promiscuity and
violence.
<p>
<b>Gay Asylum, Yes. Moms, No.</b> While Mrs. Clinton talked about advancing
women's rights during the Beijing conference, 13 Chinese women
were being imprisoned by the United States and awaiting deportation
back to China. Their crime?  Fleeing China's forced abortion policies.
 Even though these Chinese women will face extreme punishment
in slave labor (Lao Dai) camps or even death if they are returned
to China, Bill Clinton has refused to grant them asylum.  In a
reversal of the Reagan-Bush immigration policy, Clinton declared
that forced abortion was no longer grounds for political asylum.
He has instead extended asylum to homosexuals fleeing &quot;persecution.&quot;
<p>
<a name="polls"><b>Polls Go South.</b> Recent public opinion polling suggests 
that Americans are not altogether pleased with Congress. A <i>Wall Street 
Journal/NBC News</i> poll found that 53 percent of respondents <i>disapprove
</i>of Congress' performance and only 36 percent approve, while
a <i>New York Times/CBS News</i> poll found a 56 percent disapproval
rating and a 31 percent approval rating for Congress.  Interestingly,
however, according to a <i>Times Mirror</i> poll, the Republican
party is ahead of the Democratic party by a greater margin than
when they swept Congress last November -- 50 percent to 43 percent.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Americans are less
satisfied with the pace of change than the direction of change.

<h3>Children's Defense?</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hile President Bill Clinton's anti-smoking campaign grabbed
headlines, his administration went to court against a South Carolina
university hospital's very successful mandatory drug testing/treatment
program for pregnant cocaine-addicted women. Mothers who refuse
treatment for themselves and their unborn children would face
arrest and jail time. The program works. Most women stayed drug-free
during their pregnancy. Still, Clinton's aides charged that South
Carolina's program was punitive and violated the addicted mother's
&quot;privacy rights.&quot;  Is the health and well-being of unborn
children less important than those who already born?
<p>
<a name="aids">Then there is the issue of 7,000 deliveries per year in U.S.
to HIV-infected women. About 2,000 of these infants are infected
with HIV. Rep.Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who is a medical doctor, and
Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) plan to offer an &quot;infant testing&quot;
amendment to the Ryan White Care Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) that would
require states -- in order to qualify for federal Ryan White Care
funding -- to pass laws requiring every newborn be tested for the
HIV virus if mother does not (voluntarily) undergo prenatal
testing.  The amendment would require the test results to be told
to mothers, and it also encourages HIV counseling, testing and
treatment of pregnant women.
<p>
According to Dr. Coburn, his amendment is an important step in
combating AIDS.  &quot;In fact, studies have shown that the rate
of transmission of the virus from mothers to children can be reduced
by two-thirds if the drug AZT is administered during pregnancy,
labor and the first six weeks after birth,&quot; Coburn explains,
&quot;Knowing the status of the baby right away would allow treatment
and counseling to begin immediately and prevent an uninformed
mother from transmitting HIV to her baby through breast feeding.&quot;
<p>
Presently, 45 states require up to <i>nine</i> mandatory generic
newborn tests, such as syphilis and hepatitis, but not HIV. As
a public health issue, the incidence of AIDS in infants requires
that common sense become public sense.

<h3>Defending our Defenders</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>RC has filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> (&quot;friend of 
the court&quot;) brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Amendment 2&quot;
case.  Media reports contend that <i>Romer v. Evans</i> will decide
whether the Constitution allows Colorado to &quot;discriminate
against&quot; homosexuals. Wrong. The case is really about
whether the people of Colorado may decide not to grant special
protected legal status to this &quot;class&quot; of persons.
 The Supreme Court justices will hear oral argument in the case
 Oct. 2.    
<p>
<a name="gay">In the military, homosexual servicemen have begun filing lawsuits
to block their discharge.  FRC is working on the following cases:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Philips v. Perry</i>, FRC filed the winning brief calling
for the dismissal of a case filed by a homosexual sailor seeking
to block his discharge.  In the case, Philips admitted past sexual
misconduct and his intention to engage in future misconduct. 
The federal district court dismissed Philip's case, and FRC is
preparing another brief arguing against his appeal.  
<p><li>A federal district court June 9 upheld the military's policy
on homosexuality in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>.  The ruling was
based upon the pre-1993 exclusion policy, not on the Department
of Defense's  (DoD) new &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; regulations.
 This is significant.  The Clinton administration has argued that
its 1993 change in policy was necessary to avoid constitutional
problems, but the Thomasson ruling shows that the &quot;old
rules&quot; were constitutionally sound.  Thomasson has appealed
this ruling to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and FRC has
filed a brief supporting the constitutionality of the old policy.
</ul><p>
The <i>new</i> DoD regulations were the subject of a challenge
in the case of <i>Able v. U.S..</I> The federal district court
judge in Able ruled that six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their open admission they were
homosexuals, and ruled that the Pentagon was enjoined from discharging
them.  Attorney General Janet Reno has appealed the ruling, but,
given the Justice Department's  lackluster performance so far,
FRC does not anticipate a vigorous effort at the appeals court
level.  FRC has filed an <i>amicus</i> brief setting forth all
of the key arguments for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals
which the Clinton administration has ignored. FRC's efforts have
been undertaken by the Military Readiness Project, a joint task
force of FRC and senior retired military leaders.

by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
School's back. The bumper stickers on buses remind us to be careful
of the youngsters. Time was when accidents going to and from school
were the main worry of parents. No more. Today, we have concerns
about violence and drugs in schools. Many parents are troubled
by efforts in school to undermine the values and beliefs the kids
are taught at home. And, of course, there's OBE. Outcome-based
Education is the latest in a long line of educational fads that
have dumbed down American classrooms. 
<p>
<center><h3>&quot;Re-structuring&quot; SATs</h3></center>
<p>
Now, it seems, even the SATs have been affected. The Scholastic
Aptitude Tests have been  an important measure of how well our
young people are doing.  I remember during my service as President
Reagan's Undersecretary of Education how we pointed to the 85-point 
skid in SAT scores (1960-80) as indisputable proof of educational
decline. We even prodded a sluggish education establishment to
cough  up the extensive data we published as &quot;the Wall Chart.&quot;
That chart demonstrated that many of the states which spent the
least per pupil nonetheless produced students with the highest
scholastic aptitude. Was I unpopular with the bureaucrats!
<p>
Despite a 93 percent spending hike in the 1980s, the education
establishment continued to crank out under-prepared graduates.
So the SATs have been subjected to steady criticism from liberals.
Finally, the College Board has responded. With great fanfare,
education leaders announced that this year's scores were -- UP!
That <I>would</I> be great news except for some inconvenient truths.
First, this is a new and improved SAT test. They call it SAT I,
but its real name should be <i>SAT-lite.</i> It has fewer
questions, but it allows students 30 minutes more to finish. The
designers of SAT-lite have thrown overboard the more challenging
antonyms section, making it easier to score high on the the verbal
portion of the exam. Oh, and it's now OK to use a calculator.
No more unfair advantages to those grinds who memorized their
times tables! 
<p>
Test-makers say  they have changed the SATs in order to keep
up &quot;with what and how students are learning today.&quot;
What and how students learn today is increasingly determined by
President Bill Clinton and Education Secretary Dick Riley under
their ill-conceived &quot;Goals 2000&quot; legislation. Of course,
the College Board disclaims any attempt to dumb down the SATs.
But they are funded by the U.S. Department of Education. We could
hardly expect them to bite the hand that feeds them. With these
new SAT-lite test results, the Clinton administration will be
able to reassure concerned parents: &quot;See, our reforms are
working!&quot;  But this is the same team that called the State
of Ohio on the carpet last year for requiring high school graduates
to pass an eighth grade-level test. The Clinton administration
said those tests might be racially discriminatory.

COKE: YANK IT!</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>Excellence the Goal</h3></center>
<p>
Make no mistake: pro-family Americans don't want kids
to fail in school. We believe that a stress on solid academic
basics, giving special needs children the extra help they may
require, is the best way to progress. We believe in competition
and a commitment to excellence. We know that parents are the key
to real education progress. And we think parents should be able
to choose the safe and challenging school that meets their childrens'
needs. We don't believe it helps anyone artificially to try to
build up a child's self-esteem by lowering the standards. Minority
children, as well as special needs kids and rural kids, can achieve.
The pursuit of excellence helps everyone.

<center><h1>THE LEAST OF THESE</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>oes increased social spending equate with better 
childhoods? For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats 
have been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Social spending by the
federal government for children and families has increased dramatically
since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.  Yet, almost
all indicators suggest that child well-being today lags behind
what it was three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates expect government to substitute
for mothers and fathers.  But noted child psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
has written that what a child needs more than government programs
is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot; of fiercely
loving parents.

<p>

It's time to acknowledge that government can't buy love for
children any more than money can buy happiness for adults.  What
children really need are a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>Parents, Not Programs</h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children.
The new law would simply protect parents' rights to decide what
is best for their children without excessive interference from
Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents.  One good
example is &quot;Megan's Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed
and the President has signed.  The new law requires states to
notify local law officials when convicted sex offenders are released
from prison and requires the police to notify the public when
a dangerous sex offender moves into the neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3>Yes to Adoption</h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents of their own.  But the importance of parents
remains the same -- or is even greater -- for children who are
alone.  The best government can do is to speed these children
into loving homes where loving parents are waiting.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet by the Senate, offers
hope for vulnerable children currently free to be adopted.  In
the United States alone, there are over 50,000 foster children
awaiting adoption.  Over 20,000 children have been waiting for
a family for years.  The new legislation includes a $5,000 
non-refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses (for both 
domestic and international adoptions).  In order to eliminate unnecessary 
waiting periods for minority children in foster care, the legislation
also prohibits the use of racial considerations if they cause
a delay or denial of an adoption placement.

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children; but Conna
Craig, President of the Institute for Children, argues that only
an overhaul of the foster care system will save children like
John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was three, John's childhood is fast slipping
away.  He needs policymakers to understand that every child needs
a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>It Takes a Pro-Family Village</h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities
to help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When
so many children are languishing without families of their own,
community becomes all the more important.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
STAND FOR CHILDREN?<br>
STAND FOR FAMILIES.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Republican Congressmen James Talent (Mo.) and J. C. Watts (Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout
ever could by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public
housing reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle
economic development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding
communities, we will strengthen the hands of parents -- and restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's fair to admit that it takes a village.  Just as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal fiefdom that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.  Standing for children means
standing for families first.

<p>

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Senate Shake-Up.</b> Robert Dole leaves the Senate on June
11, freeing him of the need to navigate the Senate's procedural
obstacles.  Dole's departure has also set off a chain reaction
of races for top leadership posts in the Senate.  Majority Whip
Trent Lott and Republican Conference Chairman Thad Cochran are
vying to succeed Dole, with most insiders predicting a Lott victory.
GOP Policy Committee Chairman Don Nickles is running unopposed
to succeed Lott in the number two position of Whip.  Both have
advocated limited government, traditional family values, and the
sanctity of life.

<p>

<b>Suicide with Dignity?</b> The House Judiciary Subcommittee
on the Constitution recently held a hearing on assisted suicide.
The hearing followed two new federal circuit court decisions
legalizing &quot;physician-assisted suicide.&quot;  Witnesses
discussed the legal and moral ramifications of the rulings.  The
Ninth Circuit based many of its arguments on the <I>Roe</I> (1973
abortion decision) interpretation of &quot;privacy,&quot; overturning
a law approved by Washington State voters to ban assisted suicide.
The Second Circuit overturned a similar New York law. Several
members of Congress are writing legislation to reverse or restrict
these flawed decisions.

<p>

<b>Aiding Babies.</b> Congress has passed a measure under the
Ryan White Care Act to reduce the transmission of AIDS from pregnant
women to their babies.  The provision promotes voluntary counseling,
testing and treatment for pregnant women and the testing of newborns
for HIV.  Testing of newborns for HIV will be required if states
have not reduced the number of infected infants by 2000.  This
issue had been in deadlock for months because of opposition by
certain homosexual and feminist groups.  They argued that it could
lead to expanded mandatory AIDS testing and infringe on a woman's
&quot;right to privacy.&quot;

<p>

<b>PX Porn.</b> The House of Representatives' 1997 Defense Authorization
Act bans future military sales of pornography.  Last year the
Pentagon sold 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines, earning $4.3 million.  Military customers pay less
than the market price and pay no tax.  Government vending of pornography
sends the message that profiting from material that demeans women
is okay.  But common sense and science show that readily available
porn encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook.
Senate action is next.

<p>

<b>Gambling Loses.</b> Pro-family forces, overcoming a well-financed
gambling industry campaign, secured Senate committee passage
of legislation to create a Gambling Impact and Policy Commission
(S. 704) on May 14.  The House passed similar legislation (H.R.
497) on March 5.  The unanimous Senate vote eases the way for
final congressional approval.  The Gambling Commission, which
has been granted subpoena power, will evaluate the industry's
impact on families, businesses and society.  The Commission will
submit recommendations for Congress and the states and will provide
insight into the consequences of legalized gambling.

<b>Bioethical Lapse.</b> President Clinton will soon appoint
15 members to his National Bioethics Advisory Commission.  The
commission's role is to &quot;identify broad principles to govern
the ethical conduct of research.&quot;  A White House office released
a revealing list of potential nominees.  Among the extreme views:
a Harvard Medical School professor who advocates legal changes
in the definition of death so that organs can be harvested for
transplantation before brain death occurs, and a Yale lawyer who
argues that parents who withhold birth control from their adolescent
children commit child neglect.

<p>

<b>Racial Reconciliation.</b> Family Research Council recently
hosted a meeting of African-American leaders in Washington, D.C.,
to discuss projects for racial reconciliation.  Among the goals
of the meeting was to reaffirm FRC's desire to address the specific
needs and concerns of all families, regardless of race or culture.
Participants explored how FRC and other family organizations
can more effectively fulfill the pro-family mission and help to
heal ethnic divisions in modern America.

<b>Sleet, Snow, and Frosty U.S. Attorneys.</b> On May 9, the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service successfully busted a nationwide
child pornography ring, despite the refusal by U.S. Attorney Janet
Napolitano and others to cooperate.  Napolitano, a Clinton appointee,
reportedly refused to authorize a search warrant for the operation
because she felt it improperly targeted homosexual men.  However,
inspectors were able to obtain the search warrant from local authorities.
Senators Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have asked
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Napolitano to determine
whether she wrongly impeded the sting.

<p>

<b>Pro-life Planks.</b> Twelve Catholic and Protestant pro-life
leaders (including Gary Bauer) have signed a public pledge supporting
the current Republican platform language on legal protection for
unborn children.  While most media stories have focused on 
&quot;inside-the-beltway&quot; Republican skirmishes over this language, 
many pro-life Democrats are disturbed about their party's entrenched position 
favoring abortion on demand. Some 40 pro-life House Democrats are urging
party leaders to rewrite the 1996 platform to support at least
some protection of prenatal life.

<h3>FRC: Friend of the Family</h3>

<p>

The battle for pro-family policy is increasingly being fought,
not only in the halls of Congress, but in the courts.  In many
cases, groups opposing pro-family policies take advantage of liberal
courts, avoiding public and congressional debate of controversial
issues.  FRC has filed amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;)
briefs in many cases, several of which are highlighted and described
below.

<p>

FRC has been active in defending anti-pornography laws in
cases like <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>.  In this case, FRC acted
as co-counsel defending the Communications Decency Act.  Our brief
defends the constitutionality of the Act, which is designed to
prohibit the knowing distribution of pornography to children.
No matter the outcome, all parties anticipate that the case will
ultimately go to the Supreme Court.

<p>

FRC has also been vocal in pro-life cases around the country.
Most recently, FRC filed an amicus brief in <I>Shenck v. Pro-Choice
Network</I>, a case to be heard in the Supreme Court in October
debating the constitutionality of court-ordered, 15-foot &quot;floating
bubble zones&quot; around patients entering and exiting abortion
clinics.  These &quot;zones&quot; are specifically intended to
prevent peaceful demonstrators from talking to anyone going in
or out of an abortion clinic.

<p>

In <I>United States of America v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>,
FRC has co-sponsored a brief defending the right of the Virginia
Military Institute to admit males only and to continue receiving
government funds.  This case holds implications for all publicly
supported single-sex schools, whether military or not, across
the country.

<p>

<I>Romer v. Evans</I> (the &quot;Amendment 2&quot; case)
was decided on May 20.  FRC filed an amicus curiae brief asserting
that the Supreme Court of Colorado wrongly negated the people's
right to pass laws that deny special rights to homosexuals.  The
6-3 Supreme Court decision means that pro-family voters are effectively
precluded from winning on this issue at the state level, at least
insofar as a measure binds lower political jurisdictions.

<p>

Melinda Paras, spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, commented that the decision drives a &quot;stake through
the heart&quot; of ballot measures sponsored by pro-family groups.
FRC is examining options for a legislative response to <I>Romer,</I>
and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution has
promised to hold hearings.

<h3>Free Needles for Junkies?</h3>

<p>

A major media push is under way, using government reports,
to prove that giving clean needles to drug addicts slows the 
spread of the AIDS virus without encouraging illegal drug use. 
But the evidence is inconclusive and should not be used to 
start dangerous needle give-away programs.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the leading and much-cited
government needle study say that needle exchange programs (NEPs)
&quot;are not the panacea their supporters hope for.&quot; They
favor more drug treatment rather than exchanges.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to
support exchanges if they can be scientifically shown to slow
the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  So far, however,
needle studies are problem-plagued.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
and a former needle researcher, has expressed concern that NEPs
&quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  There are
75 NEPs now operating in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.
These programs provide free drug-injecting supplies, condoms,
advice on shooting drugs properly, warnings about bad heroin,
and counseling that sometimes leads to treatment.

<p>

Lee Brown, President Clinton's first drug czar, said he &quot;can
find no compelling reason&quot; to fund NEPs.  Barry McCaffrey,
the nation's new czar, has said, &quot;The problem is not dirty
needles; the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer
way to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists
and pro-drug legalization forces to pressure the federal government
to approve funds for NEPs.

<font size=+2><b><i>Renewing Our Vows</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n announcing his support for the just-introduced 
federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana had
this to say:

<p>

&quot;The definition of marriage is not created by politicians
and judges, and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in
our history, our laws, our deepest  moral and religious convictions,
and our nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and
one woman.  This fact can be respected or it can be resented.
But it can't be altered.&quot;

<p>

If someone had told me five years ago that we would find
ourselves in 1996 defending marriage as the union of one man and
one woman, I would have asked him if he wanted me to take him
to my leader -- jokingly, of course.

<p>

Yet this idea of opening marriage to homosexual couples,
which seems more suited to another planet, is stalking the land.
Prompted by an impending court decision in Hawaii, legislators
in more than 30 states are rushing to protect their marriage statutes.
As of this writing, 11 states had enacted marriage protection
laws. 

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
ELEVEN STATES HAVE ACTED TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

At the federal level, the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced
in the House on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob
Barr (R-Ga.) and in the Senate on May 8 by Don Nickles (R-Okla.).
It is being endorsed by a slowly growing list of Congressional
sponsors, but many more are needed -- and swiftly, as the Supreme
Court decision in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> illustrates (<I>See</I> 
&quot;Courtwatch,&quot; page 3).

<p>

This is the most important pro-family legislation in many
years.  If marriage falls, it will begin a domino effect that
will totally redefine families within the law and culture.  For
starters, children will be taught in school that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, businesses will be forced
to subsidize homosexual relationships, and churches that uphold
biblical morality will find themselves outside the civil law.

<p>

On Mother's Day, I debated Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) on
<I>This Week With David Brinkley.</I>  I reminded Mr. Frank that
it was fitting that we were discussing this on Mother's Day, since
our celebration of motherhood is one of the most powerful expressions
of just why the idea of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; is so
dopey.  But it is more than dopey; it is dangerous.

<p>

If unelected judges in Hawaii are able to impose their will
on the rest of the nation through the Constitution's Full Faith
and Credit Clause (which compels the states to recognize each
other's licenses and records), then what's safe?  If two men can
marry, why can't three men?  Or two men and a woman?  Or a man
and a boy?

<p>

During our debate, Frank made the usual unfounded charge
that his opponents are motivated by &quot;hatred&quot; and 
&quot;prejudice.&quot; He repeated what has become homosexual activists' 
key argument against DOMA:  it is unnecessary.  Homosexual 
&quot;marriage&quot; is still illegal all over the U.S.  In other words, 
Barney Frank and friends want us to wait for a judicial defeat before we 
take the field in defense of marriage.  I'm sorry, but that's not good
enough. Marriage is the God-given foundation of society, and if
we let it be ruined, our children will rightly hold us responsible.

<p>

During the Battle of Britain, when things looked darkest,
Winston Churchill told the English people to &quot;never give
up.  Never, never, never, never give up.&quot;  Well, friends,
not only won't we give up defending marriage, we cannot give up.
I urge you to call or write your senators and congressman now
and press them to sponsor DOMA. Next Mother's Day, I don't
want to be debating a triumphant Barney Frank and his newly married
&quot;spouse.&quot;

<p><hr width=50%><p>

On May 19, the Family Research Council placed a full-page ad in 
<i>The Washington Post</i> with the tag line, "Let's Save Marriage, 
Before the Whole Cake Crumbles." The ad summarized the arguments for 
preserving the institution of marriage as a legally binding 
relationship between one man and one woman. <b>For a copy of the ad,

<center><h1>TYRANNY IN ROBES</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling 
whose destructive power may rival the infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> 
(1973) decision.

<p>

In <I>Romer v.  Evans</I>, the court voted 6-3 to strike
down a voter-approved amendment to Colorado's constitution that
would have prevented homosexuality from being added to civil rights
laws by the state and local governments.  The people of Colorado
had voted for Amendment 2 in response to adoption of homosexual
rights laws in several cities, including Denver and Aspen.  The
amendment took no rights away from homosexuals, merely ensuring
that homosexuality would not receive preferential treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>800,000 Bigots?</h3></center>

<p>

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, concluded
that the voters were motivated only by &quot;animus&quot; toward
homosexuals, seeking to deny them access to the political process.
In effect, he called more than 800,000 Coloradans &quot;hate-filled
bigots&quot; for withholding a powerful legal weapon from homosexual
activists.

<p>

In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the ruling
has &quot;no foundation in American constitutional law and barely
pretends to. ... Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration
of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans ... striking
it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political
will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia noted that under the court's reasoning, polygamists
could demand redress because they are disadvantaged by state laws
prohibiting polygamy.  He asked whether the court had somehow
concluded that polygamy was a greater social harm than homosexuality.
Scalia also noted that the majority had completely ignored the
1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> case, which established that states
can criminalize sodomy.  If states can do that, he wrote, then
surely they can deny &quot;preferential treatment&quot; to a class
that defines itself solely by its willingness to engage in that
behavior.

<p>

Homosexual activists celebrated the <I>Romer</I> ruling.
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich and Colorado for Family Values
President Will Perkins called for impeachment of the six majority
justices, who include Reagan appointee Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
(Reagan), David Souter (Bush), John Paul Stevens (Ford),  Stephen
Breyer (Clinton) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Clinton).  Other leaders
raised the question of judicial term limits and of activating
Congress' constitutional power to limit which cases the Supreme
Court can rule upon.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"NOT JUDICIAL JUDGMENT,<br>
BUT POLITICAL WILL."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The court did stop short of elevating &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to the same level of protection as race, ethnicity and other traditional
civil rights categories.  But the legal effect may be less than
the cultural effect.  Within hours of the decision, a lesbian
attorney in Florida said the court had ruled that homosexuality
could not be taken into account in child custody cases.  The court
did no such thing, but such broad interpretations can now be expected
to be routinely advanced in homosexuality-related cases.

<p>

<center><h3>Pass DOMA Now</h3></center>

<p>

Citizens who believe in traditional morality and the rule
of law must now rally around the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
a federal bill that defines marriage as &quot;the union of one
man and one woman as husband and wife&quot; and allows states
to ignore out-of-state marriage licenses issued to homosexual
couples.

<p>

Liberal judges in Hawaii are expected to legalize homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; as early as September, and homosexuals are
preparing to fly to Hawaii, get &quot;married,&quot; and claim
marital status in their home states.  Given the Supreme Court's
usurpation of power in Colorado, passage of DOMA (H.R. 3396) and
(S. 1740) is imperative.  DOMA will reassert the constitutional
authority of Congress, send the courts the message that America
will not surrender to homosexual activists, and secure marriage
against radical redefinition.  So far, 11 states have passed bills
protecting marriage, but DOMA is needed immediately to protect
the federal code and state marriage laws.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and congressman and urge them
to sponsor DOMA, not merely pledge to vote for it.  The Capitol
Hill switchboard is 202-225-3121.  Addresses:  U.S. Senate, Washington,
D.C.  20510; U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
20515.  Also, ask your state representatives to pass a marriage
protection law at the state level.

<b>Medicare Package.</b> The Medicare trustees issued a report
on June 5 indicating that Medicare Part A (payment for hospital
costs) may become insolvent by 2001.  The Part A trust fund lost
$2.6 billion in 1995.  The trustees recommended that an independent
commission develop a long-term strategy. Congress passed a budget
last year which limited projected increases in Medicare spending
to an annual average of 6.4 percent.  President Clinton vetoed
that plan and insists that Congress enact his more limited proposal.
An election year resolution of this issue is unlikely.

<p>

<b>No Relief in Sight.</b> Family tax relief continues to receive
consideration on Capitol Hill, even as the presidential candidates
float various tax cut plans.  Congressional leaders may include
the child credit in a package with welfare and Medicaid reform,
or include it as part of a separate tax package.  President Clinton
threatens to veto any bill that contains the Republicans' proposed
Medicaid reforms, but it does not appear that he will sign the
tax cuts without comparable cuts in spending.  Sounds like another
&quot;Catch-22&quot; situation.

<b>Preventing Predators.</b> The Children's Privacy Protection
and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996 was introduced by Congressman
Bob Franks (R-N.J.) on May 22. The purpose of this bill is to
empower parents to further protect their children from child predators.
The bill would allow parents to learn what information commercial
vendors have obtained about their children, where the information
originated, and where it has been distributed.  People who prey
on children should not be able to purchase, receive, sell, or
in any way handle personal information about children.

<p>

<p>

<b>No Federal Cradle.</b> Many news stories on the Stand for
Children rally sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund asked
the same questions FRC raised at a press conference the day before
the event:  Is more spending on failed federal programs really
helping children?  Or are liberal advocacy groups just using children
as props to make one last stand for big government?  FRC argued
that strong parents are still the best advocates for children.
Society's role is to help rebuild healthy communities that strengthen
the hands of those who rock the cradles.

<p>

<b>Dues Under Duress.</b> A new House Republican task force on
labor policy has recommended legislation that would protect union
members from being forced to pay dues to fund partisan politics.
In the 1994 election, 40 percent of union members voted for conservative
candidates while union chiefs generally backed liberals.  Giving
workers an option to restrict their dues to collective bargaining
purposes is an obvious way to protect the integrity of representative
government while protecting workers' interests -- and putting
hard-earned dollars back in the pockets of American workers.

<p>

<b>Justice Denied.</b> Some black youngsters in a Washington,
D.C. suburb were almost denied the chance to see how faith and
hard work can pay off in America.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas was publicly disinvited to speak at a student awards ceremony
in early June when a school official threatened to disrupt the
event.  Although the school board ultimately voted to reinvite
Thomas, the whole spectacle sent a troubling message to students,
who, fortunately, ultimately got to hear Thomas's powerful message
of personal virtue and equality before the law.

<p>

<p><a name="beijing">

<b>Costly Habitat.</b> From June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey, Habitat
II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, built
on the anti-family agendas of previous U.N. conferences, this
time focusing on the environmental and economic challenges of
rapid urbanization.  Urging more efforts to implement that agenda,
Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher called for a moratorium
on further U.N. world conferences.  And none too soon.  A recent
General Accounting Office study found that the U.S. Government
spent a whopping $5.9 million on the U.N. Conference on Women
held last September in Beijing, China.

<p>

<b>Rewarding Tyranny.</b> On June 3, President Clinton formally
announced his intention to extend &quot;most favored nation&quot;
(MFN) trade privileges to China.  Unless Congress quickly opposes
Clinton's stand, China will continue to enjoy low tariffs on exports
to the U.S.  FRC opposes extending China's MFN status not only
because the U.S. runs a trade deficit of $34 billion every year
with China, but especially because of China's myriad human rights
abuses, such as forced abortion and sterilization policies, exploitation
of prisoners as slave laborers, and systematic persecution of
Christians.

<p>

<b>Wirth Stumbles.</b> During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing June 4, chairman Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) put two questions
to witness Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Citing Hillary Clinton's speech during the U.N. Beijing conference,
where she strongly denounced sex selection abortion and mandatory
abortion, Helms asked Wirth if the Clinton administration would
support legislation outlawing sex selection abortion in the U.S.
and admitting refugees fleeing China's coercive abortion policies.
Wirth could not answer either question directly, saying there
were &quot;other implications&quot; which needed to be considered.

<h3>Parental Rights Vote Near</h3>

<p>

The recent pro-big-government &quot;Stand for Children&quot;
rally in Washington, D.C. had little in common with the growing
grass-roots parental rights movement, except for its focus on
children.  The Family Research Council's message to rally participants
was that government programs can never provide what children vitally
need -- parents raising them with love and direction.  Which is
to say, parents are irreplaceable.

<p>

With public school officials handing condoms to pre-teens,
it is no wonder that the parental rights movement has captured
the public's attention.  Parents across the country are finding
their voice against intrusive state and federal governments.
At the state level, parents are supporting constitutional amendments
which protect the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children without unwanted government infringement.
At the federal level, parents are supporting the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act of 1996 (PRRA), which simply codifies
Supreme Court rulings that parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children which the government must respect.

<p>

That parents, not government, should have the primary responsibility
and authority in raising their children seems beyond dispute.
Yet, the ubiquitous ACLU and their education counterpart, the
National Education Association, have weighed in with heavy protests.
They are fond of presenting hypothetical &quot;horror stories&quot;
of child abuse they claim the PRRA will permit, yet the bill specifically
excludes abusive parents from its protection.

<p>

In contrast to these theoretical concerns, real-life instances
of outrageous government violations of parents rights persist.
If the PRRA were law, parents in Pennsylvania would probably
not have had to file suit against the East Stroudsburg public
school for forcing their sixth-grade daughters to undergo vaginal
examinations without their knowledge or consent and over the tearful
protestations of the girls.  This flagrant usurpation of the right
of parents to make health care decisions for their children would
not be tolerated under the PRRA.  Without it, the Pennsylvania
parents have little certainty of success.

<p>

A vote on the PRRA is expected before August.  Call 202-225-3121
and urge your congressman and senators to vote for the PRRA (H.R.
1946; S. 984).  For information on state initiatives, contact
Of the People at 703-351-5051.

<h3>Indecent Opinion</h3>

<p>

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
has ruled against provisions of the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), the first major anti-pornography legislation for cyberspace.
This is a sad defeat with ominous implications for the burgeoning,
new &quot;global community.&quot;  The Clinton Justice Department
will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

<p>

The CDA was passed as part of the Telecommunications Reform
bill in February 1996.  It seeks to protect children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet by prohibiting adults from knowingly
sending or displaying &quot;indecent material&quot; to kids.
It imposes criminal penalties for violation of the law.

<p>

The ACLU and a coalition of liberal groups and on-line service
providers filed the challenge to the CDA in Philadelphia.  A similar
challenge was filed in New York and is still pending.  The Family
Research Council and the National Law Center for Children and
Families submitted 400 pages of legal argument and exhibits on
behalf of anti-pornography groups defending the CDA.  Judge Delores
Sloviter, a Carter appointee, headed the Philadelphia three-judge
panel which heard testimony this spring from ACLU and government
witnesses.

<p>

The CDA uses the time-tested standard of &quot;indecency&quot;
to draw the line between material that is appropriate for adults
but not for children.  &quot;Indecent material&quot; is defined
as material depicting or describing sexual or excretory activities
or organs which, in context, is presented in a patently offensive
manner.  The Supreme Court has ruled that adults have a First
Amendment right to receive indecent material and share it with
other adults, but no right to foist it upon children.  The indecency
standard has protected children in the broadcast television, radio,
and telephone media.

<p>

At closing arguments in Philadelphia, it was clear that the
ACLU was not simply quarreling with this particular law, but was
advocating no restrictions whatsoever on the dissemination of
computer pornography to children.  The Philadelphia court was
openly hostile to the Justice Department and its defense of the
CDA, and its ruling absurdly implies that the advancement of Internet
technology depends upon unfettered exhibition of sexual material
to children.

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>e got a postcard from Air Force Captain Dave Panzera 
the other day.  That's not so unusual, since we receive many calls
and letters from active duty military.  But Captain Panzera's
card came to us from <I>Antarctica.</I>

<p>

That's a dramatic example of how far and wide the
message of FRC is traveling these days.  It's not at all unusual
for us to host meetings with pastors from Southern Africa, champions
of religious liberty from Russia and pro-family leaders from Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The international interest in Family
Research Council is a reflection of the global nature of the threat
to the family.

<p>

I always try to give encouragement to our friends from abroad.
They often report feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by a tide of
pornography, drugs, abortion and sexual misconduct.  I share with
our allies some of the expanding array of communications tools
we use to get our message out.  In trying to support them, I find
that <I>I</I> am uplifted. Let me share with you, a regular reader
of <I>Washington Watch,</I> the growing array of devices we have
used in the fight for faith, family and freedom.

<p>

As Americans reduce their reliance on the liberal talking
heads of TV network news, radio has filled the gap.  Sure, there
are the Howard Sterns and Don Imuses, but well-informed pro-family
callers to radio talk shows shatter the media myths about our
movement.  My nickname for conservative programs broadcast from
our nation's capital is &quot;Radio Free Washington.&quot;  I'm
proud that Focus on the Family's news and information feature,
<I>Family News in Focus</I> (FNIF), is broadcast to hundreds of
religious stations every day.  FNIF's Washington bureau, and its
veteran chief, Carl Ramsey, are good neighbors to FRC.

<p>

My daily radio commentary, which bears the same title as
this newsletter, keeps many of you informed of late-breaking
stories and my perspective on the issues.  You can call our FRC
toll-free line at 1-800-225-4008 to obtain a listing of 
participating stations in your community.

<p>

FRC's <I>Legislative Hotline</I> is easily reached by dialing
1-202-783-HOME.  It's available 24 hours a day and is put together

FRC's staff includes some intrepid &quot;cybernauts&quot;
who are using the latest technology to make sure we are represented
on the Internet.  Our site is located at: http://www.frc.org.
I confess I'm a bit &quot;low-tech.&quot; My word processor is
located under my hat, and I carry my printer around in my shirt

a keyboard, our Internet site should please you.

<p>

When David Brinkley's producers called me recently to appear

horns with Rep. Barney Frank).  And CBS-TV's <I>Face the Nation</I> 
gave me yet another opportunity to tout the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).  As gratifying as these major media appearances are,
it's good to know that FRC isn't dependent on others to spread
our message.  We have our own means of getting the word out.
And that word is clearly reaching the ends of the earth.

<center><h1>A NATION MOURNS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n April 10, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBA).  With a stroke of his pen, Clinton 
continued to authorize abortion on demand, leaving to the abortionist 
the gruesome method of his choice.

<p>

And gruesome it is. In a partial-birth abortion, a child between
five and nine months of gestation is delivered -- all but the head --
and living brain tissue is vacuumed out after the child is stabbed
at the base of the skull with surgical scissors.  A top physician
testified before Congress that babies subjected to this process
most certainly feel pain.  Strangely, if a &quot;mistake&quot;
were made and the child slipped out of the mother, he would be
legally human and fully protected from being killed.

<p>

<center><h3>Broad Support</h3></center>

<p>

The brutality of this technique seemed capable of delivering a
first -- the first federal restriction of abortion since the 1973
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> Supreme Court decision.  In fact, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) fought to keep pictorials of the procedure
off the House floor, but the pro-life side carried the day, winning
the votes of House and Senate members who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their careers.  Winning margins in the House were 288-139
and 286-129, and in the Senate, 54-44.

<p>

When the bill went to the White House on Good Friday, it included
an exception allowing the procedure if necessary to save a mother
whose life &quot;is endangered by a physical disorder, illness
or injury.&quot;  The bill also received important symbolic support.
Many national leaders called for the President to approve it,
including liberal columnists and prominent clergy.  Several Catholic
bishops, including two cardinals, endured a soaking rain on April
1 to pray outside the White House.

<p>

When Bill Clinton vetoed the bill, beside him stood five women
who had experienced troubled pregnancies.  The setting was designed
to suggest that PBA had been the only answer to their trauma.

<p>

But it was not even clear that the women beside him had undergone
PBA, according to transcripts of the President's remarks and
media accounts.  The President said, &quot;The emotional power
of the description of the procedure -- which I might add did not
cover the procedure these women had ... was so great ...&quot;
He also cited the bill's omission of an exception for the &quot;health&quot;
of the mother -- a term defined so broadly by the courts that, PBA
supporters say, it means unrestricted abortion.

<p>

<center><h3>Feeling Pain</h3></center>

<p>

Many myths have been reported as fact in the PBA debate.  Among
the cruelest is that anesthesia kills the baby before the procedure
is carried out, a falsehood that, dangerously, only scares many
pregnant mothers needing legitimate surgery.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
MANY MYTHS HAVE BEEN<br>
REPORTED AS FACT.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The decision on whether to attempt an override of the President's
veto rests first with the House leadership.  Since PBA began in
the House, the vetoed bill has been returned there.  If two-thirds
of the House votes to override the veto (a margin previously achieved),
then it would go to the Senate. The initial vote in the Senate
was short of the two-thirds margin needed for adoption.

<p>

The veto comes at a time when recent polls show that more than
two-thirds of Americans support either restrictions on abortion
or an end to PBA altogether.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who know that our nation
has more to offer than abortion,&quot; Family Research Council
President Gary L. Bauer said.  &quot;This is a time for us to
pray for the return of a respect for life, born out of our Judeo-Christian
heritage and honored by our nation's founders.  Our future depends
on it.&quot;

<p>

of birth has reason to tremble -- and to mourn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Omnibus Riders.</b> A new omnibus spending bill (H.R. 3019)
may include several pro-family provisions.  The Coats amendment,
which passed the Senate 63-37, would protect medical schools from
losing federal funds if they ignore an abortion mandate issued
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 
The mandate requires medical students specializing in obstetrics
to be trained in performing elective abortions.  House and Senate
conferees on the bill are also expected to maintain restrictions
on District of Columbia abortion funding and on international
population assistance to groups that perform elective abortions.

<p>

<b>Health Savings.</b> The House recently passed a health reform
bill (H.R. 3103) by a vote of 267-151.  FRC supported the bill,
which includes 100 percent tax-free medical savings accounts for
families and individuals.  MSA's allow working families to choose
their own doctors and make their own health care spending decisions.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole to include MSA's in the Senate
bill, cosponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), was defeated, 52-46, under a veto threat from President
Clinton if MSA's were adopted.

<p>

<b>Et Tu, Newt?</b> House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a speech
on March 24 endorsing a candlelight AIDS march that benefits pro-homosexual
organizations. Among them are the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which
treats AIDS victims but also runs homosexual activist workshops,
promotes lesbian parenting, and places &quot;safe sex&quot; ads
in a Washington homosexual newspaper that promotes strip clubs
and bathhouses.  The newspaper noted that Gingrich credited Rep.
Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) for asking him to publicize the march.
Gingrich also credited Gunderson's homosexual partner.

<p>

<p><a name="fda">

<b>Rubber Stamp.</b> After experimenting on 2,100 pregnant American
women, the Population Council recently filed a petition with
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for
the abortion drug, RU 486. FDA Commissioner David Kessler had
earlier suggested that the FDA would put RU-486 on a fast-track
review process, perhaps approving the drug within six months.
FRC condemns any action by the FDA that would legitimize, for
the first time ever, a drug that would have no other use except
to kill innocent human life.

<p>

<b>Fostering Failure.</b> Dr. Henry Foster, head of a new Presidential
teen pregnancy task force, appeared with several pro-teen contraceptive
advocates at an April 10 Capitol Hill briefing.  The panelists
criticized abstinence-only programs, despite their proven effectiveness
in reducing teenage sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases.
The panelists stressed instead more vigorous sex education programs,
increased use of contraception, and self-esteem programs. A hand-out
they distributed claimed that &quot;abstinence until marriage&quot;
programs and programs to produce &quot;secondary virginity&quot;
have not been shown to work.

<p>

<b>MIT Saber-Rattling.</b> On March 20, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology faculty task force announced that it wants to open
the college's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program to
avowed homosexuals.  The task force encourages universities nationwide
to rethink their relationship with the ROTC and their adherence
to its homosexual policy. MIT risks losing $56 million, 16 percent
of its annual research budget, because of a 1996 law that denies
Pentagon dollars to any institution that has an anti-ROTC policy.
Last year, ROTC commissioned 7,200 officers, barely reaching
the Pentagon's goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p><a name="marriage">

<b>States of Matrimony.</b> Kansas has become the fifth state
to enact a law protecting marriage, joining Hawaii, Utah, South
Dakota and Georgia.  Other states are also acting against an expected
Hawaiian court ruling that may legalize homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
licenses, which could then be imposed on other states under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In Hawaii,
the Senate also voted 24-0 specifically to ban same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; The vote boosts the state's case in the suit 
brought by three homosexual couples that triggered the controversy.

<p>

<b>Ornery.</b> The Republican and Democratic political establishments
were both thwarted by insurgent candidacies in the April 9 Texas
primary runoff.  Former Congressman Ron Paul beat incumbent Republican
Greg Laughlin, a recent party-switcher.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich
was among those who campaigned vigorously for Laughlin. Both
candidates had vied for the support of pro-family activists.  In
the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, school teacher Victor Morales
defeated veteran Congressman John Bryant despite Bryant's support
from former Gov. Ann Richards and labor unions, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers.

<p>

<b>Revisionists Revise.</b> Revisionist historians missed the
U.S. landing on the moon and the presidency of George Washington
in their first, politically correct attempt back in 1994 to devise
national history standards. Now the latest revision, just released,
re-defines the family as &quot;a group of people from whom we receive
love and support.&quot;  The standards also endorse President
Clinton's embattled Goals 2000 plan and, for good measure, put
in a plug for equalized school funding nationwide.  Some conservative
critics were assuaged, but the standards remain a biased political
document.

<h3>Implementing Beijing</h3>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have
children at some point in their lives, the family remained a non-issue
at the 40th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status
of Women (CSW) which met in New York in mid-March.  The CSW is
planning the implementation of the Platform for Action of last
autumn's Beijing Women's Conference.

<p>

There was no statement at the session that the family had
value, no effort to protect or shore it up now that it is under
siege, not even an invocation of the UN's usual definition of
the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot; 

<p>

Most of the meeting revolved about the issues of &quot;women
and poverty&quot; and &quot;women and child and dependent care.&quot;
Noting that women constitute the majority of the world's poor,
the Commission urged governments to undertake education and training
programs and to adopt legislation promoting women's rights to
inheritance, land ownership and political decision-making.  The
&quot;dependent care&quot; debate urged redistribution of responsibilities
in the home and more part-time work, child care services and elder
care.

<p>

The session ended with the adoption of strong resolutions
condemning traffic in women and girls (a growing problem especially
in some developing countries) and wartime violence against civilians.
The Commission also approved the UN's System-Wide Plan of Action
(known as SWIMTEP) for implementing the Beijing Platform, including
its controversial provisions for health and &quot;reproductive
rights,&quot; which many UN advocacy groups hold to include abortion
and contraceptive programs for girls.

<p>

Among the tasks which SWIMTEP assigned regarding reproductive
rights were: a directive for the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF and UNESCO to report on promotion of these rights to the
UN Population Division; a directive to the WHO 
and the UN Fund for Population to provide governments with technical
guidelines on methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives; and a directive to UN agencies to provide special
programs for youth regarding sexual behavior.  (These directives
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.)

<h3>FRC's Day in Court</h3>

<p>

On April 5, FRC received good news from a federal appeals
court in a pace-setting military homosexual case, <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both
the law passed by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations
on homosexuality in the armed forces.

<p>

The full court of 13 judges heard oral argument in December,
including argument presented by FRC's Military Readiness Project.
The MRP had filed two briefs in this case, both of which thoroughly
exposed the administration's failure to implement the law.

<p>

The law Congress passed is very clear:  no homosexuals in
the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the administration from creating
regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only could
serve, but could serve openly in the military.

<p>

In <I>Thomasson,</I> the majority federal judges said, &quot;no
way.&quot; They cited FRC by name as they ruled that the Clinton
regulations on homosexuals are invalid.  The judges declared that
the administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly how the White House was implementing the new
statute.

<p>

Meanwhile,  the MRP was in court April 8 to hear <I>Richenberg
v. Perry</I>, a federal appeals case involving a homosexual Air
Force officer.   Predictably, the government mischaracterized
the law, but for the first time a government lawyer spoke of the
increased risk of AIDS posed by homosexuals serving.

<p>

Government counsel quoted a gay activist, &quot;I didn't
fight all my life to remain celibate&quot; and used an illustration.
If an airman identifies himself as an F16 pilot, can't the military
reasonably infer that he flies?  The counsel said the military
excludes homosexuals for a similar reason.  After all, soldiers
who identify themselves as homosexuals will engage in illicit
behavior. The court in <I>Thomasson</I> found this logic compelling.

<font size=+2><b><i>The &quot;Big Blue&quot; Summit</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>&quot;A</font>t the end of today, give me your badge, your 
desk key and everything that belongs to IBM,&quot; Charlene Mitchell
remembers her manager saying to her.  &quot;Go home and don't
come back.&quot;  Mrs. Mitchell told <I>The Washington Post</I>
how she was &quot;surplused&quot; in 1993 by the computer giant,
known for decades as &quot;Big Blue.&quot;  It was a bitter pill
for Mrs. Mitchell to swallow.  She was the third generation in
her family to work for IBM.

<p>

Charlene Mitchell was just one of 12,500 layoffs by IBM in
the Washington area since 1987.  Nationally, more than 3.2 million
Americans have gotten pink slips from large multinational corporations
over a recent six-year period.  Many layoffs are inevitable, of
course, but controversial firing practices have become &quot;business
as usual&quot; under the leadership of a new crop of corporate
high-rollers.

<p>

IBM's chief, Lou Gerstner, Jr, bluntly told the nation's
governors in 1995 that they should &quot;confront and expel&quot;
anyone they saw as a barrier to achievement of the national education
goals. He invited them to a summit last month at IBM's New York
conference center:  &quot;We'll pull it all together,&quot; he
said.  Pull it he did.  Gerstner ruled discussion of parental
choice out of order, even though he conceded that the &quot;public
education system is broken.&quot;

<p>

Gerstner clashed with Gov. George Allen (R-Va.) behind closed
doors when the conservative opposed national curricula and national
tests.  How could Gerstner force the governors to accept his edicts?
He pointedly reminded them and the press that IBM is already
the largest employer in North Carolina and Vermont.  He enlisted
other corporate bigs into making the same threat: reform our
way or face a hiring boycott of your states.

<p>

It's ironic to be battling over education standards now.
Pro-family conservatives were among the first recruits for the
education reform movement of the 1980's.  We cheered when my boss,
Bill Bennett, called for &quot;Content, Character and Choice.&quot;
We battled the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American education.
We wanted teachers who can teach and school curricula that emphasize
the basics:  reading, writing, math, history and reliable standards
of right and wrong.  Instead, we've seen the education reform
movement hijacked by people who have given such &quot;triumphs&quot;
as vague, behavioral Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and anti-American
history standards.

<p>

Nobody has greater concern for the future economic success
of America's young graduates than their own parents.  But it's
a mistake to look at education as just a matter of work force
preparation. Education is primarily about family, faith
and freedom.  It must pass on the heritage of Western Civilization.
When we concentrate on basics, when we respect parents' rights
and the authority of locally elected school boards, excellence
will follow.

<p>

One corporate executive at the IBM summit admitted as much.
He described his state of New Hampshire. They still have New
England town meetings to discuss school issues, he said, and parents
are actively engaged in their children's education.  The result:
top scores for New Hampshire kids on national tests, even though
the state spends very little per pupil.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>&quot;I LIKE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE<br>
MODEL.&quot;</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

I like the New Hampshire model, not the German model that
is increasingly put forward by Marc Tucker, a liberal education
theorist and close associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  In
the same issue of <I>Newsweek</I> (April 8) where Jonathan Alter
touted the German model for education and job training, the magazine's
&quot;Business&quot; section reported a German unemployment rate
twice ours. Mercedes-Benz is building factories outside Germany
for the first time in its history.  There is serious division
in German society -- East-West splits, anti-immigrant violence,
and skinhead, directionless youth.

<p>

We can have excellent schools if we respect parental rights,
institute parental choice and uphold our free institutions.  We
should not try to make our kids over in anyone else's image: 
Let Americans be Americans!

<a name="un"><h2><i>UN:  Bound for Beijing</i></h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>rom Sept. 4-15, 1995, the United Nations (UN) will hold
its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.  The United
States will be sending a delegation to the conference -- despite
the objections of pro-familiy advocates.  First Lady Hillary Clinton
was originally slated to attend, but at latest word will not,
due to China's imprisonment of American human rights activist
Harry Wu.
<p>
<center><h3>Bracketing the Family</h3></center>
<p>
This conference purports to advance women's rights.  However,
many pro-family groups, including FRC, oppose the Beijing conference
agenda for the very reason that it denigrates women and families,
reflecting a radical feminist agenda.  For, not only is the conference
being hosted by a country with a long track record of abusing
women (e.g., female infanticide, coercive abortion policies),
but the platform document:
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"<font size=+3>M</font>OTHER" IS BRACKETED<br>
FOR REPLACEMENT.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<b>Denigrates motherhood and traditional family life.</b> For example,
the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout the
entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed for
change to &quot;household.&quot;  Bracketed sections indicate
that delegates could not agree in advance on the text.  These
sections are to be debated in Beijing.  In addition, the word
&quot;family&quot; almost always appears in a negative context,
i.e., in relation to domestic violence or female oppression.
<p>
<b>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power play.</b>
  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform:  &quot;Inequality in
the public arena can often start within the family when power
relations between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal
power relations also limits women's potential...&quot;  Thus,
rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are never used.
<p>
<b>Leaves the term &quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</b>
 &quot;Gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform
document.  But when asked to define the term, the UN rejected
the suggestion that there are two genders: &quot;male&quot; and
&quot;female.&quot;  The UN also rejected the definition of &quot;gender&quot;
as &quot;the socially-constructed roles which society assigns
to men and women.&quot;  In feminist literature, this definition
means that gender is subject to change and there exists a spectrum
of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual, female
heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual).  Instead,
the UN decided that &quot;gender&quot; was to be understood &quot;in
its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  The definition battle will
be a major focus in Beijing.
<p>
<b>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</b>
 The platform repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling[.]&quot;
 While occasionally mentioning the legal responsibility of parents
for their children, the platform refuses to recognize parental
authority regarding their children's reproductive health.
<p>
<b>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</b>
  In the tradition of previous UN conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen,
the Beijing platform urges governments to &quot;take action to
ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized
and respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  In fact, the platform elevates
reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating
that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Contact your representative and senators, either in Washington
or at their in-state office.  Tell them to speak out against the
Beijing conference, publicizing its violations of women's fundamental
dignity.

<h3>On The Hill</h3>
<p><a name="issues">
<b>The House Holds.</b> Before adjourning for its August vacation, the
House of Representatives passed two amendments to curb U.S. promotion
of abortion overseas.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) led the fight
to prevent U.S. funding of groups that seek to overturn the anti-abortion
laws of sovereign nations.  The Smith amendments would also deny
U.S. aid to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) if it continues to
participate in China's coercive population control program.  Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) intends to offer the same amendment to S.
908, the State Department authorization bill.
<p>
<b>Pro-Family Sendoff.</b> U.S. delegates to the Beijing Women's Conference
received pro-family instructions from the Senate on August 1.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) offered an amendment which
called on the U.S. delegation to promote a representative perspective
on the value of motherhood and the traditional family.  The amendment
also urged the delegates to define &quot;gender&quot; classically,
as in &quot;male and female, the two sexes of the human being.&quot;
 Pro-family delegates and observers participating in pre-conference
negotiations at the UN headquarters in New York were energized
by passage of the resolution.
<p>
<b>Pop Aid Bust.</b> The foreign aid bill passed by the House in July
will make it more difficult for the Clinton Administration to
carry out its population control agenda.  The &quot;development
assistance&quot; account, which has traditionally provided hundreds
of millions of dollars each year for international population
projects, was substantially reduced and a separate account was
dedicated to child survival and disease prevention efforts.  Pro-family
forces will now try to persuade the Senate to go along with the
reduced anti-population money.

<center><h3>The United Nations at Half-Century: A Primer</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he messages of congratulation poured in from all over the
world.   President Truman thanked Almighty God for bringing the
world community so far in its search for peace.  South African
Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called its Charter &quot;not
a perfect document, by any means . . . But at least it is a good,
practical, workmanlike plan for peace.&quot;  As he presided over
the final vote to create the United Nations, taken on June 25,
1945, Britain's Lord Halifax expressed the hope that the delegates
had taken part &quot;in one of the great moments of history.&quot;
<p>
To carry out its charter, the United Nations has, over time,
created an alphabet soup of commissions and agencies.  Some of
these entities have social and economic missions; others have
military missions.  Recently, peacekeeping activities by UN agencies
in such trouble spots as Somalia (UNISOM), Haiti (UNMIH) and the
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) have raised serious questions about
the world body's effectiveness and its proper role.  
<p>
The UN has grown with the decolonization of major European
powers and the breakup of the Soviet empire. The major bodies
of the UN have different functions. The UN's annual budget is
$4 billion. The U.S. contribution, according to our Mission to
the UN, is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.  UN documents
are printed  in the five official languages: English, French,
Spanish, Chinese and Russian.   Unless otherwise indicated, the
UN body described below is headquartered in New York.
<p>
<b>The General Assembly.</b>  The largest UN body, the General Assembly
is comprised of 185 member states.  Each member has one vote in
the General Assembly.  The General Assembly has authorized many
of the key UN agencies which have a direct impact on families.
 These include the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
<p>
<b>The Secretariat.</b> This body is headed by the Secretary-General,
who reports to the General Assembly.  He supervises executive
functions of the UN.  The Secretary-General has traditionally
been selected from the ranks of the &quot;non-aligned&quot; nations.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) currently serves in the post.
<p>
<b>The Security Council.</b>  The Security Council consists of 15
members.  Five of these -- Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and
France -- have veto powers over council actions.  The Council
is charged with responding to threats to peace.
<p>
<b>The Economic and Social Council.</b>  The 54 members of this
body are elected to terms by the General Assembly.  It is responsible
for UN efforts in the economic and social areas.  It includes
many specialized agencies.  Among them are the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, Rome), the World Health Organization (WHO,
Geneva), the International Labor Organization (ILO, Geneva), the
very influential International Monetary Fund (IMF, Washington),
the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,
Paris). 
<p>
<b>The International Court of Justice (World Court, The Hague,
Netherlands).</b> The 15 judges are elected to nine-year terms by
the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Questions are
decided by majority vote.  All members of the UN are members of
the World Court, as are non-members Switzerland, San Marino and
Liechtenstein.

<center><h2><font size=+3>P</font>OLICY <font size=+3>U</font>PDATE</h2></center>
<p><a name="convention">
<font size=+3><i>The</i></font> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC) was approved by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 20, 1989.
 It was in force on Sept. 2, 1990 after the 20th nation ratified
it.
<p>
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, signed the treaty on Feb. 16, 1995.  President Clinton
has said that the U.S. will spell out its interpretation of the
Convention with a statement of  &quot;reservations and understandings&quot;
that will go to the Senate.
<p>
A treaty becomes law in this country if the U.S. Senate ratifies
it by a two-thirds vote (67 Senators, if all are present).  This
has not yet happened and seems unlikely because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
<p>
In fact, on June 14, Helms introduced S. R. 133.  This resolution
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators are cosponsors.
<p>
As an international treaty, the UNCRC would be co-equal with
federal statutes, and possibly the United States Constitution.
 If the United States were to ratify the treaty as it stands,
it would become not only an international obligation, but also
a domestic obligation potentially regulating the most intimate
details of American family life. 
<p>
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
 Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
 Conceivably, taking a child to church, when he would rather not
go, could be a violation of the child's right to freedom of religion
(Article 14); telling a child to turn off the television could
violate the child's right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information&quot;
(Article 13), and so forth. 
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is a risk America's
families do not need -- and cannot afford -- to take.
<p><hr><p>
<a name="march"><center><h3>The UN and the Family: Major Documents</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he United Nations was founded in the shadow of the Second
World War, a renewed attempt by the victorious democracies to
establish an international body to safeguard the peace and promote
human rights.  From the beginning, with the drafting of the UN
Charter and related documents such as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the UN has attempted to give voice to the common
aspirations of the world's people.  Only within the past two decades
has the UN expanded its agenda in ways that pose direct threats
to the traditional family.
<p>
Here are some major landmarks in the history of UN advocacy
regarding marriage and the family:
<p>
<b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</b> Article 16 asserts
the right &quot;to marry and to found a family,&quot; provides
that marriage must be entered into &quot;freely&quot; by the spouses,
and defines the family &quot;as the natural and fundamental group
unit of society . . . entitled to protection by society and the
state.&quot;  The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly
in 1948.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</b>
 The Covenant, which is in treaty form, promotes special measures
to protect the family, mothers, and children.  Article 10 repeats
the definition of family in the <b>Universal Declaration</b> and calls
for &quot;the widest possible protection and assistance&quot;
to the family. Addresses such issues as family leave and child
labor.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> Article
23 of the Covenant uses the same definition of family as the <b>Universal
Declaration</b>, and requires nations that have ratified the Covenant
&quot;to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses
as to marriage[.]&quot;
<p>
<b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.</b> Article 12 introduces language requiring nations
to ensure access to health care, including family planning.  Like
the <b>Universal Declaration</b>, it speaks clearly of &quot;men&quot;
and &quot;women&quot; in these contexts.  Article 16 enumerates
eight specific rights as regards marriage, with emphasis on equality
of rights regarding children and property and the &quot;right
to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children[.]&quot; The United States has not ratified this
Convention.
<p>
<b>International Year of the Family (IYF).</b> First proposed in
1987, the year was actually celebrated in 1994.  In the best modern
UN mode, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali announced that &quot;[t]here
is no single definition of a family.  There is no one model.&quot;
 An IYF document, &quot;The Changing Family Structure,&quot; lumped
together everything from &quot;polygamous&quot; and &quot;community&quot;
families to &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;adoptive&quot; families.
 &quot;Same-sex&quot; families also get equal footing in the document.
<p><hr width=65%><p>
<h3><center>NGO: FRC and the UN</center></h3>
<p>
&quot;NGO&quot; is one of the most commonly heard terms in
UN-speak.  It stands for &quot;Non-Governmental Organization,&quot;
and refers to private associations specifically recognized and
consulted by the United Nations.  Examples include the International
Red Cross, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Planned Parenthood.
 NGOs are first mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945 as important
resources for the General Assembly and the various commissions
it creates to address specific issues.
<p>
NGOs may be international or merely national in scope.  Their
number is large (some 1,500) and growing.  The presence of UN
Headquarters in New York City has given New York-based NGOs a
considerable advantage in lobbying the UN on a daily basis.  Some
NGOs, like WEDO, led by former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and a
major participant in UN conferences on population and the environment,
are almost fully funded by foundation money.  Others are grassroots-oriented.
<p>
NGO status can be permanent or temporary, allowing a group
access to the UN generally or merely to specific conferences.
 The Family Research Council was granted NGO status for the world
population conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994.  FRC has
also obtained NGO status for Beijing (<i>see earlier article</i>).  This status
does not allow FRC to vote on the Beijing Plan, but it <i>will</i> make
us more effective eyes and ears for the American family.

<center><b><font size=+2><i>What So Proudly We Hail?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
Americans have historically sacrificed for peace. We went
to war twice in this century for the peace and freedom of Europe.
 Americans fought and died defending the independence of Korea,
Vietnam, Grenada, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Most recently, Americans
have shouldered the burden of famine relief in strife-torn Somalia.
The American people and their government respond generously to
natural disasters. 
<p>
America has taken a leading role in supporting the United
Nations, too.  From 1945 on, the U.S. provided the greater part
of UN funding and support.  President Kennedy defended the world
organization when the Soviets tried to hamstring it with a three-man
troika in place of its single Secretary-General.  That formula
would have guaranteed paralysis -- which is what the Soviets really
wanted.
<p>
Despite this record, the UN has often been a three-ring circus
of anti-Americanism.  The U.S. has regularly been denounced as
&quot;imperialist&quot; and a &quot;war monger&quot; during what
passed for UN debates.  Efforts to empower the nations of the
&quot;South&quot; by levying confiscatory assessments on the free
industrial democracies of the &quot;North&quot; have been popular
among all too many members of the General Assembly.  Third World
delegates have cheered the so-called New World Information Order,
which is nothing more than a dignified name for press muzzling
by tinpot despots. 
<p>
Still, Americans have remained largely willing to tolerate
the UN as an important forum for international discussion.  For
the sake of peace, we have gone the extra mile.  Recent stories
about UN diplomats who have run up thousands of parking violations
in New York City and who have stiffed the Big Apple's merchants
to the tune of millions have struck nerves, however.  No warm
and fuzzy talk of &quot;cultural disparities&quot; should cover
the obvious truth:  a ripoff is a ripoff.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+3>UN E</font><font size=+2>XPANSION</font> 
 <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+2>HREATENS</font><br>
<font size=+3>U.S. S</font><font size=+2>OVEREIGNTY</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
This corruption is far less troubling than the new trend
toward building an army of &quot;blue helmets&quot; to police
the world.  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has moved
aggressively since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assert
a new doctrine of sovereignty. <i>Sovereignty</i>. That's a key word
and concept.  Americans recognize it better by referring to our
founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  That document
set forth our right to stand &quot;among the powers of the earth&quot;
as a free and equal nation.
<p>
The Secretary General's expansive view of UN authority is
not just an opinion.  The UN fielded only two peacekeeping missions
in its first five years, but it has dispatched the blue helmet
19 times in the past four years.  Many have greater ambitions
still.  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a communist, is
pushing a worldwide environmental initiative which sees a major
role for the UN.  Former French President Francois Mitterand,
a socialist, advocates the creation of a &quot;UN Legion&quot;
to give military teeth to the UN's resolutions. 
<p>
Veteran liberal Ronnie Dugger would go even further.  He
writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that if the member states are unwilling
or unable to man a UN Legion, the UN should accept volunteers
from the recognized Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These
private groups are playing an increasing role in UN activities.
 The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>, the Greenpeace ship that has confronted
whalers and nuclear test personnel, might be the first of a whole
fleet under the Dugger plan.
<p>
All of these suggestions come at a time of growing UN military
focus.  The UN Department of Peacekeeping has expanded from a
staff of 23 to more than 350 today, with a modern &quot;situation
center,&quot; staffed 24 hours a day.  What are the limits to
this mushrooming role?
<p>
As we watch the UN's Beijing Conference on Women, we should
each ask ourselves:  what if an army had the power to enforce
the resolutions passed by these delegates?  Would Americans remain
free and independent? I once considered such questions idle speculation.
 Not anymore.

<a name="family"><center><h1>Family Hopes</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the impression left by the recent O.J. Simpson 
trial, a large majority of black Americans support get-tough efforts to combat 
crime.
<p>
According to FRC's newly released Family Issues Survey, 82 percent
of blacks favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals to work while serving their 
sentence.&quot; Seventy-seven percent favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals 
to pay their victims and their victims' families financial compensation for the
pain, suffering, and economic hardship they caused.&quot;  Moreover,
85 percent of blacks favor &quot;requiring criminals to undergo drug tests to show 
that they are drug-free before completing their sentence.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>Choose Life</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC poll, conducted by the Voter/Consumer Research Firm, also
found that:
<p>
<li><b>Adoption is considered the best response -- and abortion the
worst response -- to an unwed pregnancy.</b>
<p>
When asked what is the best response to an unmarried pregnancy,
29 percent choose adoption, 24 percent say marrying the child's father, 11 
percent choose single motherhood, eight percent opt for abortion, and the 
rest either volunteer that &quot;it depends&quot; or say they &quot;don't 
know.&quot; Conversely, when asked which of these options would be worst, 55 
percent say abortion, 13 percent say single motherhood, 12 percent say marrying 
the child's father, and six percent choose adoption.
<p>
<li><b>Most Americans -- including rank-and-file pro-lifers -- strongly
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.</b>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock.&quot; 
Two-thirds (66 percent) say they &quot;strongly&quot; oppose such
increases.  Another 18 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare
benefit increases for illegitimacy. 
<p>
Only 13 percent say these increases are justified. Among those
who &quot;strongly&quot; favor laws against abortion, 70 percent 
&quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap, and another 16 percent 
&quot;somewhat&quot; support this measure.
<p>
<li><b>The religiously devout are more apt to give and volunteer --
and say they would do more if government welfare programs were dramatically 
cut or abolished.</b>
<p>
People who attend worship services at least once a week report
higher levels of giving (97 percent) and volunteering (79 percent) than any 
other demographic group. Frequent churchgoers are also more likely to say they 
would give and volunteer more if &quot;government welfare programs
were cut back dramatically, or abolished.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Even young people think today's popular culture encourages
teen sex, violence and drug use.</b>
<p>
When asked to assess the degree to which today's movies, television,
and music lyrics encourage teenage sex, 63 percent of young Americans say 
&quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Fifty-six percent
offer identical responses to a question about the entertainment
industry's role in encouraging violent crime, and 47 percent say the same 
about pop culture's contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Moreover, 75 percent 
of Americans aged 18 to 30 either &quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; 
agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in today's movies,
on TV, and in music lyrics do not represent my own views.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Single parents say families need help shielding kids from harmful
cultural influences.</b>
<P>
Only 36 percent of all single parents -- and 33 percent of divorcees
-- say parents can adequately shield children from violent or sexually-explicit 
material by themselves.  Better than 60 percent of single parents agree 
with the statement, &quot;These days, it is too difficult for parents to deal

Roughly four out of five Americans (79 percent) favor tax relief
for families raising children. Sixty-one percent say they would rather have 
&quot;a permanent tax cut beginning next year&quot; than &quot;a

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Partial Victory.</b> Accommodating the request of a majority of senators,
a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held on the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act (H.R. 1833) on Nov. 17. The bill passed the House by vote of 288-139 
on Nov. 1, drawing the votes of such infrequent supporters of abortion limits 
as Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and freshman Rep.
Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.).  Nurse Brenda Shafer told the Senate
committee that she assisted an Ohio abortionist with several partial-birth 
abortions, but was repulsed and then quit.  Senate floor action is likely 
before Dec. 7.  The Clinton White House continues to signal a veto.
<p><a name="gambling">
<b>Gambling Scourge.</b> Rep. Frank Wolf's bill (H.R. 497) to create
The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission is gaining momentum. The 
bill, which has broad bipartisan support, does not outlaw, tax, or regulate 
gambling, but recognizes its growing influence. In 1993, Americans
made more trips to casinos than they did to major league ballparks.
 Today, casinos operate in 23 states, and 37 states have lotteries.  Studies 
show that gambling increases public corruption and other criminal activities. 
It cannibalizes legitimate businesses, and government's gambling-related
costs for regulation, lost productivity and family disintegration
outstrip the economic gain.
<p>
<b>Budget Break?</b> The battle between Congress and the White House
moved to the next stage Nov. 19 with an agreement to enact a balanced budget 
within seven years, using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic estimates. 
President Clinton reversed course and agreed to negotiate legislation by Jan. 
1 to achieve the zero deficit goal. Republican concessions on
spending control are likely.   FRC will work hard to keep the
$500-per-child tax credit in the GOP bill, as well as real spending limits 
to avoid leaving our children a legacy of debt.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Playing the Odds.</b> Gambling industry political action committees
(PAC) are influencing legislation such as proposals to tax gambling revenues 
and regulate the American Indian gaming boom.  Gambling is projected to grow 
to an $80-billion-per-year industry this decade. According to the Federal 
Election Commission, PACs gave $321,942 to the major political parties in 
1993-94, and four non-PAC industry gifts totaling $690,000 went to the 
Republican National Committee in 1994. Columnist William Safire warns 
that state-sponsored gambling is a &quot;cancer ravaging society, corrupting 
public officials and becoming the fastest-growing teenage addiction.&quot;
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown Sweeps.</b> According to a new Census Bureau report,
America is experiencing a rise in the number of Murphy Brown-style moms. 
The study, released in early November, shows that the proportion of 
college-educated, never-married women who have given birth has more
than doubled in the past 10 years, while the proportion of young,
single, black women giving birth has dropped. The report also says that 
the illegitimacy rate among all never-married white women rose from 6.7 
percent to 12.9 percent.  The greatest rise in this group was, indeed, among 
women who are managers and professionals.
<p><a name="divorce">
<b>Divorce, American Style.</b> The U.S. divorce rate dropped slightly
in 1994, but <i>The Economist</i> magazine reports that divorce is still more 
common in America than anywhere else in the world. To combat this problem, 
a growing number of pro-family state leaders are working to reform
divorce laws to protect individuals who want to save their marriages
rather than promote the interests of individuals initiating divorce proceedings. 
By a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans support such reforms, 
according to FRC's newly-released Family Issues Survey.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>FRC Intervenes.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Fourth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals granted a motion Nov. 20 that will permit FRC to present 
oral arguments in a key case involving homosexuals in the military. The 
case <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i> is likely to reach the Supreme Court next 
year. FRC sought to intervene in the appeals court to argue that the
Clinton administration regulations at issue do not faithfully reflect 
Congressional intent and will result in allowing declared homosexuals 
to serve.  Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, will represent 
FRC at the Dec. 5 hearing.
<p>
<b>Young Guns.</b> A quarter of those arrested on weapons charges are
juveniles, and such offenses are the fastest growing crime among adolescents. 
Juvenile weapons cases have grown 86 percent since 1985 to more than 61,000 
arrests last year, and teen gun violence has risen steadily even
though the number of teens has declined.  Weapons offenses include
illegal use, possession, importing or exporting of guns, ammunition and the 
like.  Attorney General Janet Reno warns, &quot;If the last decade's trends 
continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the
year 2010.&quot;
<p>
<b>Money Talks.</b> A record turnout of Maine voters narrowly rejected
a proposal on November's ballot to deny special rights to homosexuals.  Four 
hundred thousand voters took part in the 53 to 47 percent outcome.  
Pro-homosexual rights forces spent an unprecedented $1.2 million, 10 times 
more than those who oppose special rights.  Despite the close vote, 
homosexual activists are pushing ahead with their plans to introduce gay rights 
bills into the Maine legislature for the 10th time.  None has passed to date.

<h3>The Bare Non-Necessities</h3>
<p>
Did local schools notice the difference when 89 percent of the
U.S. Education Department's 5,500 employees were sent home as 
&quot;non-essential&quot; federal workers during the recent budget show-down? 
Equally unnoticeable is any improvement resulting from Washington D.C.'s 
recurrent attempts at top-down education reform:  National Education Goals,
the Goals Panel, Goals 2000, the National Standards for U.S. History.  With all 
the rhetoric and frenzy over initiatives with such visionary titles, you'd 
expect to see some results as 1995 draws to a close.
<p>
But when the National Education Goals Panel met in November to provide a 
halftime report on progress toward the eight National Education Goals, set in 
1990 for the year 2000, they could point to no significant improvement. 
&quot;Progress is spotty at best,&quot; said Albert Shanker, President of 
the American Federation of Teachers union.  The panelists urged patience; 
Americans put up $3 million this year to hear the Goals Panel stall for time.
<p>
Americans are growing increasingly impatient with dismal academic
test scores year after year. Recently released results from the 1994 
National Assessment of Educational Progress remain poor: less than a 
third of the students tested were proficient readers; 57 percent of high 
school seniors scored &quot;below basic&quot; in their knowledge of U.S.
history.  Writers of the National Standards for U.S. History released last 
year thought they could improve performance by imposing an official body 
of knowledge.  However, if the 30,000 copies already distributed make their 
way into classrooms, students will continue to know more about Madonna,
whom the standards mention, than they do about Robert E. Lee, whom the standards 
ignore.
<p>
Regrettably, our millions earmarked for education reform over
the past five years have been ill-spent on bureaucracy and systems management. 
Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, suggested in 1989, &quot;I'd 
give the education reform movement another five years.  If we're not able
to get our schools back to where they were in 1963, after spending
40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare bankruptcy, give the people 
back their money, and let them start their own schools.&quot;  Time's up. We 
want our money back.

<h3>We the Parents</h3>
<p>
FRC has taken its battle for parental rights to the Supreme
Court.  FRC joined forces with the Of the People Foundation and asked the 
high court to hear the case of Massachusetts students and parents who oppose 
a school district's program of condom distribution to junior high and high
school students.  A &quot;friend of the court&quot; petition was
filed on Nov. 15.
<p>
In early 1992 the Falmouth School District adopted a policy
whereby school nurses were instructed to distribute free condoms to students 
as young as 11 years old -- even over their parents' objections.  Condom 
machines were also installed in high school student restrooms. FRC's brief 
argues that the program violates the parents' right to direct the upbringing 
of their children as well as the right to free exercise of religion.
<p>
In 1993, New York's highest court ruled that an identical public school 
condom distribution program violated the right of parents to rear their children 
as they see fit.
<p>
This dispute highlights the need for legislation to acknowledge
and solidify parents' fundamental rights.  To accomplish this, Sen. Charles 
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) have introduced the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 (H.R. 1946).  The
act establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and
provide for the education and religious teaching of their children, and also 
addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline. Importantly, 
the act allows the government to intervene when it has a compelling interest 
to do so, and has specific allowances for cases of child abuse and neglect.
<p>
Support this much-needed legislation by calling or writing
your representatives today.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Looking for Lincoln</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>G</font>en. Colin L. Powell has declined to run for President in 
1996. He has also said that he will not accept the Vice Presidency, though 
time may change this decision. Finally, he is joining the Republican party. 
These are crucial decisions.
<p>
As everyone knows by now, Powell had described himself as 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion during an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters on the eve of his national book tour.  That position, 
combined with the warm reaction to his candidacy among some conservative
leaders in Washington, raised the real possibility that, for the first time 
in two decades, the Republican platform next year would reflect a 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; position on abortion.
<p>
The media response to this prospect, as well as to Powell, was
wild excitement.  From a strict news sense, it's not hard to understand why. 
A Powell candidacy presented historic opportunities: the nomination and 
possible election of the first black American President. Second, a GOP 
abandonment of its pro-life plank would have caused an earthquake
on the American political landscape.  Earthquakes are hard news.
<p>
The Republican Platform calls for a constitutional amendment to provide legal 
protection for the unborn.  It also calls for the appointment of judges who 
respect traditional values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  Has it 
made much difference?  One conservative leader has said that a pro-choice 
president like Powell &quot;could do more to lower the number of abortions 
than a presidential candidate who claims to be pro-life, who supports a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, but who does nothing more than pay 
lip-service to the pro-life constituency.&quot;
<p>
Of course, pro-life Americans want no part of this leader's dilemma.
 They prefer a third way: someone, Republican or Democratic, who not only claims 
to be, but is, pro-life, who supports full legal protection for the unborn, 
and who will pay service to that goal in both speech and action.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>PERSISTENCE ISN'T<br>
ALWAYS APPRECIATED.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
So why are pro-life Americans so often made to feel like skunks at the wedding 
party?  Partly, I'm sure, it's because nothing is more alien to the modern 
American mind than a moral absolute, even when that absolute is the 
overwhelming duty to refrain from taking innocent human life.  Second,
there is the matter of persistence.  It isn't always appreciated.
<p>
In his <i>Lincoln: The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg retells the story
of a White House reception after Lincoln's Second Inaugural. Frederick 
Douglass, the black anti-slavery leader, tried to enter the White House 
to greet the President.  Guards barred his way.  Douglass eluded them 
and rushed through the door.  He was seized and escorted to a plank that
led outside through a window. Once again on the street, he asked a 
passerby entering the White House to tell Lincoln that &quot;Frederick 
Douglass is detained by officers at the door.&quot;
<p>
Hearing the news, Lincoln invited Douglass into the East Room, and the 
journalist finally greeted the reelected president.  Lincoln told Douglass 
that he had seen him in the crowd listening to his address. &quot;There 
is no man's opinion that I value more than yours,&quot; Lincoln told him, 
&quot;what do you think of it?&quot;  Douglass replied, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, 
it was a sacred effort.&quot;
<p>
In this world of slippery slope relativism, where rights to do
wrong are enshrined among our political commandments, the pro-life cause 
is often treated like an unwelcome guest.  As 1996 approaches, some of 
the political &quot;palace guards&quot; are already trying to show us to the 
window again.  As they do so, we could use a little of the spirit of
Frederick Douglass.  After all, this cause is a sacred effort, too.

	I am not the kind of guy who normally takes part in feminist "consciousness-raising" efforts.  But I am participating in Take Your Daughter to Work Day today because I have an eight-year-old daughter whose self-esteem matters a great deal to me.
<P>
	For the uninitiated, Take Your Daughter To Work Day is an annual event dreamed up by the Ms. Foundation in response to research showing that girls' self-esteem often plummets during the fragile pre-teen and early adolescent years.  By exposing young girls to successful women in the workplace, organizers hope that girls will learn to think more highly of females in general and of themselves in particular.
<P>
	I have a great day planned for my daughter, Allison.  This morning, I plan to take her by the offices of two women whose job it is to meet regularly with members of Congress and other public officials.  Then, I plan to have her talk with a young woman who just finished graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and is now serving as a health policy analyst.  At lunch, she'll chat with a woman who does some public speaking, and another who crunches numbers in our accounting department.  Finally, in the late afternoon, Allison is scheduled to meet with a woman who used to practice law and now manages a bevy of staff writers.
<P>
	I am sure all of this will be interesting to Allison.  But the time I am most looking forward to is the ride home.  For it is then that I plan to point out to my daughter that some of the exciting tasks carried out by my female colleagues in the workplace are tasks my wife performed in jobs she held prior to motherhood.  She used to meet regularly with congressmen and senators.  She used to do some writing and public speaking.  And she has a Phi Beta Kappa key from hr college days.
<P>
	After I remind my daughter of these things, I plan to turn to her and look her in the eye and say, "Allison, you must be a very special young girl.  Your mother could be using her talents and skills in all sorts of jobs in the workplace, but she has chosen instead to use them at home teaching you.  She must love you very, very much and think you are very, very important."
<P>
	Somehow, I think that at that moment my daughter' self-esteem will rise to a level heretofore unimagined by the organizers of Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  And for that I owe debt of gratitude to my wife, whose esteem-building job as a mother at home rarely receives the public esteem it deserves.
<P>

</font></center>
<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="compact"><center><h1>An American Compact</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>O</font>ne year after the Republican Contract with America, 
FRC President Gary Bauer has written a book in which he announces &quot;A 
Compact with Our Fellow Americans.&quot; Like the GOP Contract,
this Compact is an effort to put down on paper the goals of a movement. 
It follows in the long tradition of &quot;getting it in writing&quot; which 
has characterized our people's history, from Magna Carta to the U.S. 
Constitution.  Like the Contract, too, it contains 10 key items and invites 
supporters to sign on.
<p>
But the Compact differs in that it seeks to go beyond reforms to be enacted 
by Congress. Rather, it emphasizes actions which Americans can take in their 
homes, churches and communities, even if reform is thwarted in Congress. 
The Compact also differs in that any American, regardless of party ties, 
can freely subscribe to it.  The &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; 
touches on what Alexis de Tocqueville called the &quot;habits of the heart&quot;
which define and preserve us as a free people.
<p>
<center><h3>What We Want</h3></center>
<p>
The Compact is part of Gary Bauer's new book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams:
A Vision for America</i>. The book is being published this month by Focus 
on the Family. <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is an effort to go directly to 
Americans, to appeal to their hearts, <i>without the reinterpretation and
distortion of the major media</i>. It seeks to answer the question so often 
asked by brusque reporters, but which is also asked with sincerity by many 
of our fellow citizens:  &quot;What do you people want?&quot;
<p>
Bauer states the case for a pro-family America.  He tackles head-on
not only the issues which shape our political choices, but, more importantly, 
those cultural questions, beliefs and actions which determine whether our 
American experiment in ordered liberty will survive at all.  Despite
the facts that we are not at war and that Wall Street's Dow Jones
Index has been daily reaching new highs, most people think our country is 
on the wrong track.
<p>
Bauer recently spoke to this anxiety when he told Dan Rather: &quot;I 
want to see an America where I don't have to worry about date rape when my 
daughter goes out for the first time at college. I want an America where, 
when a young man pledges to love and honor her for the rest of their lives, 
there is a good chance he means it.  I want a country where children come 
first again and where virtue is honored, a place where values matter and 
the American Dream is still real.&quot;
<p>
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is not just a policy manual.  It goes behind
today's headlines and tomorrow's talk shows to explore the reasons why 
conservatives defend the family as the fundamental unit of society. It 
describes in detail what this nation would look like if the pro-family
cause were to triumph.  It seeks to summarize the aspirations of families 
and to quell the fears of citizens who have been urged by the polarizing 
media to view &quot;family values&quot; with grave suspicion.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>&quot;MOVE BEYOND<br>
BREAD-ALONE POLITICS...&quot;</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
Even though the book includes over 100 public policy recommendations,
it ultimately resists the temptation to put &quot;our trust in princes,&quot; 
as if the cure for America's ills could be found in Washington. It challenges 
our national leadership to move beyond &quot;bread-alone&quot; politics.  It
includes some thoughtful questions for citizens to ask all candidates
who seek power over us, giving pro-family Americans the chance to shape 
public debate.
<p>
<center><h3>Getting the Word Out</h3></center>
<p>
Look for <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America</i> at your local
Christian bookstore, or use the enclosed card to order from us.  Urge your 
neighborhood group, your church, your public library to obtain copies. 
Share them with family and friends who may be sympathetic but skeptical. 
This is a year of decision.  The decisions that are made will shape the world 
our children inherit.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Kinsey's Pedo-File.</b>  U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) has introduced
a bill, with over 40 cosponsors, calling for federal investigation into the 
infamous Kinsey sex studies.  The &quot;Child Protection and Ethics in 
Education Act&quot; also calls for a cut-off of federal funds to programs 
that use the Kinsey research uncritically.  Media attention continues
to build regarding Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft's admission that 
a key table on child sexuality was based on the records of a single pedophile. 
FRC has publicly called on the Institute to identify all of its pedophile 
sources.
<p>
<b>In the Dark.</b> What had originally been slated as a House hearing
to expose &quot;the homosexual agenda in schools&quot; turned into a 
mostly watered-down exercise on &quot;parents, schools and values.&quot; 
The Dec. 5 and 6 hearing drew little media coverage.  Virtually
ignored was shocking testimony by avowed lesbian Claire Connelly of 
Ventura County, California, who gave evidence that millions of taxpayer 
dollars' worth of AIDS programming is being hijacked by homosexual activist
groups. The hearing was held by the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations.
<p>
<b>Not with My Kid.</b>  A hearing was held in November on the Family
Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 1271), which requires researchers to get 
written parental permission before administering surveys to children. 
FRC's Robert Knight supported the bill in testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs.  Knight said the law is needed because 
some researchers are prying into family matters and/or asking children 
graphic questions about sex. The FRC video about Alfred Kinsey, <i>The 
Children of Table 34</i>, was submitted to the committee to illustrate 
research run amok.
<p><a name="abortion">
<b>Life Gains.</b> On Dec. 7, the Senate passed the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, 54-44.  Since the Senate-passed version has been amended slightly, 
a final version still must be approved by the House, possibly by the end of 
January.  After final congressional approval, the bill will go to
President Clinton, who threatens to veto it.  While thousands of Americans 
are calling the White House about this legislation, it is also important to 
educate your neighbors by writing letters to the editor and calling talk 
radio programs.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Slippery Summit.</b> Ever since the 1989 governors' education summit
in Charlottesville, Va., produced the National Education Goals and 
prompted Goals 2000, Americans are rightly suspicious of such gatherings. 
When word got out last summer about a follow-up meeting to recommit to 
the national goals, the ensuing uproar scuttled the meeting. Now a summit 
is scheduled for March 26-27 in Palisades, New York.  Business leaders
have been invited to join governors to discuss opportunities for participation 
in the Goals 2000 school restructuring. Unfortunately, a new partner in a bad 
venture won't improve it.
<p>
<b>Holiday Spirit.</b> On Dec. 19, Andrei Codrescu, a commentator on
National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered</i>, said this about 
the Christian concept of Rapture: &quot;The evaporation of four
million who believe in this crap would leave the world a better
place.&quot;  The taxpayer-funded NPR issued an apology. The week 
before Christmas, NPR also devoted considerable air time to commentators 
who tried to debunk Christianity.  And it was business as usual over 
at PBS, which re-aired the sexually explicit homosexual series <i>Tales 
of the City</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="npr">
<b>New Allies?</b> While the fate of the GOP's $500 per child tax credit
remains tied up in the budget deadlock, the National Parenting Association 
(NPA), a liberal academic group, has begun to lobby for pro-family tax cuts. 
On Dec. 15, an NPA youth violence task force hosted testimony
from representatives of Promise Keepers, the Christian pro-fatherhood
group that reached 826,000 men in 1995.  Meanwhile, a new Heritage Foundation 
study shows that the Clinton family tax cut covers 23 million fewer children 
than the GOP proposal.
<p>
<b>Maine Rebounds.</b> Pro-family forces have won a big victory in the
Pine Tree State.  For the first time in 20 years, Maine legislators won't 
face homosexual rights legislation in 1996.  An openly lesbian state 
senator withdrew the bill, citing the need for &quot;healing&quot;
on the issue.  But the real reason was the bill's certain defeat.  In 
November, voters narrowly rejected a statewide referendum that would 
have struck down local gay rights laws.  Outspent 10 to one, pro-family 
forces still snagged 47 percent of the vote, sending lawmakers a message.
<p>
<b>Saving Marriages.</b> Divorce reform is gaining momentum in the new
year.  Michigan and Iowa are among states likely to consider bills that 
reintroduce the fault concept in contested cases where children are present. 
Randy Hekman, head of the Michigan Family Forum, a member of the Association 
of State Policy Councils, points out that under current law, &quot;I can 
divorce my wife of 26 years with less difficulty than I can fire a 
secretary I hired last week.&quot;

<p><a name="porn">
<h3>Cyberprogress</h3>
<p>
At the end of 1995, staff members for the House and Senate
conferees on the large telecommunications deregulation bill came to 
agreement on strong pornography restrictions, but only after a series 
of tough negotiations.  Leaving pornography unrestricted in cyberspace 
would be like leaving a loaded gun on a playground.  If the &quot;telecom
bill&quot; is passed, the anti-cyberporn language will help parents protect 
their children by making pornography inaccessible by children.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions as negotiated include:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of a court-approved indecency standard, defined in
the bill as an <b>&quot;image or other communication that, in context, 
depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs&quot;</b>;
<p>
<li>Indecent communications are available to adults but <b>barred
to children</b>;
<p>
<li>People are liable only for <b>knowing violations</b> of the law;
<p>
<li>Online service providers are not liable for violations beyond areas 
they own or control;
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws are left unchanged;
<p>
<li>Those making good faith efforts to keep pornography away
from children have a defense against prosecution.
</ul><p>
Contrary to much of the current rhetoric from civil libertarians,
the anti-cyberporn provisions could not be used to find Shakespeare or 
any other serious work of literature or art to be indecent. Adults with 
common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently offensive
materials which degrade women, harm children, and corrupt men.
Under the indecency standard, the courts will be obliged to evaluate 
material in its proper context.
<p>
A few other provisions of the bill remained unresolved as <i>Watch</i> 
went to press. Congressional leaders should make every effort to conclude 
these matters as soon as possible, so that we do not risk losing the 
opportunity to protect our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn.
<p>
FRC's legal policy director took part in the negotiations leading to 
these provisions.  In the past, telecommunications reform has happened once 
a generation. FRC will continue to monitor this legislation in the days 
to come.

<h3>FRC: Ready and Abel</h3>
<p>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) is challenging the Clinton
administration's military personnel policies in the courts.  On Dec. 5, the 
MRP had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. 
Thomasson is an avowed homosexual who wants the military's ban declared 
unconstitutional.  The MRP defended the law's intended meaning, while
the U.S. Justice Department hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty 
regulations.  A decision is expected in April.
<p>
Last summer, the MRP filed a brief in <i>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</i>, which
involves six avowedly homosexual service members.  This case was scheduled 
for oral argument in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Dec. 
19.  That hearing was delayed after a Clinton-appointed judge was reminded 
that he had made a biased comment about the issue.  The hearing was re-set 
for mid-January with a decision expected this spring.  This case will
compete with <i>Thomasson</i> for a high court hearing next year.
<p>
On other fronts, the MRP worked with key members of Congress
to close a loophole in President Clinton's regulations on homosexuals. 
In response to Hill queries, the Pentagon's general counsel wrote a 
memo to the services clarifying Clinton's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations which say that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is not a bar to 
military service. The memo was necessary because last summer a Navy 
administrative board used the faulty regulations to retain an avowed lesbian 
who promised to avoid homosexual acts.
<p>
Meanwhile, on Dec. 15, the MRP filed a Supreme Court brief in
<i>U.S.A. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</i> (the Virginia Military Institute 
case).  The Clinton administration wants the high court to impose a 
&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard which would make all classifications 
by gender very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would 
amount to back-door adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, reviving old 
debates about everything from the Boy Scouts to unisex bathrooms. It would 
also remove most gender-based exemptions in the military, like women serving
in infantry units.  The FRC brief argues that gender classifications
should be subject to a less exacting standard.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Hope Is a Hand-up</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>J</font>ust before Christmas, Family Research Council hosted 
an important event in Washington.  It was a one-day conference, with 
distinguished speakers like authors Michael Novak and Dr. Marvin
Olasky.  The conference was devoted to the tragedy of poverty, with a 
close look at the tricky question of welfare reform.
<p>
I'm more convinced than ever that we must look with new eyes at
the scale of this tragedy.  It's really not enough to say that certain 
kinds of welfare reform will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms 
with the degree of suffering that is happening right now -- and not just 
suffering from material want, but from the sense of purposelessness that
saps the human spirit.
<p>
Those of us who believe most fiercely in the durability of traditional
values are precisely the ones to stand up now and say that every individual 
has qualities that no welfare system should be allowed to destroy. FRC 
recognizes that the best and most compassionate help comes from
private individuals who build personal relationships and offer
material support simultaneously. A hand-up not a handout. The premise is 
that needy individuals are not &quot;clients,&quot; but fellow human
beings.
<p>
America cannot implement neat, clean, top-down policies that will
jumpstart a network of caring in every community.  Instead, each of us must 
take direct action to heal the hurt -- not at the ballot box, but in our 
neighborhoods and communities as we minister daily to needy individuals.
<p>
One happy byproduct is that our own children, by watching our
example, will grow to appreciate what is great and good.  Even strong 
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help pattern 
right habits of the heart.
<p>
FRC is taking the initiative to encourage a new ethic of caring
because, I believe, social conservatives are the very people who have the 
idealism and initiative to build up a new network of helping institutions. 
As we have begun to speak out, we have discovered that the scale of the
crisis is an unprecedented opportunity for us to demonstrate, in full 
technicolor action, a fundamental truth:  Traditional values are traditional 
because they are functional.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>TRADITIONAL VALUES<br>
ARE<br>
FUNCTIONAL VALUES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
When nothing else moves the needle, God's ways work.  His love
binds up wounds.  Our service to those who are hurting is one of the most 
obvious means we have at our disposal to let earth know what heaven looks like. 
God's love looks most beautiful, in fact, against a backdrop of despair.
<p>
Dr. Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids Hope USA, tells a story about
one small step in a child's journey to God.  Kids Hope USA aims to link adult 
volunteers in one-to-one relationships with at-risk children. This Christmas 
season, one volunteer took &quot;her child&quot; to see a Christmas pageant
at her church that included a living nativity.  As Mary, Joseph,
and the baby Jesus took their places, the child Amanda turned to her new 
friend and asked with wide eyes, &quot;Is this real?&quot;  The volunteer 
replied, &quot;Oh yes, Amanda, it's very real.&quot;
<p>
That moment almost undoubtedly left a mark on Amanda's soul. In time, 
I suspect, she will be much more likely to regard that scene as real 
because one of God's loving servants was sitting by her side.
<p>

Freshmen members of the House of Representatives are in the media
glare as the budget dispute continues between Congress and the White House. 
The first-termers have been called both &quot;principled citizen 
legislators&quot; and &quot;inflexible extremists.&quot; What's the 
reality?
<p>
Nearly all of the freshmen have strongly endorsed term limits
and committed to do what they think is right, regardless of short-term 
political consequences. They want a balanced budget and tax relief for 
America's families.  Their insistence on these policies led to stronger 
agreements with the Senate than first seemed possible.  They have been 
just as tough in negotiations with the White House.
<p>
Moreover, despite President Clinton's opposition, the freshmen
have helped to restore two abortion limitations that were overturned 
during the last Congress: limits on abortion funding through federal 
health insurance programs and a ban on elective abortions in overseas 
military hospitals.
<p>
Freshmen House members also helped sidetrack a bill to fully fund
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).  Their efforts forced the House 
leadership to zero out NEA funding within two years.
<p>
The principles of this freshman class will be further demonstrated
in 1996 as they strive to move parental rights and religious liberties 
legislation through Congress. They are truly making a difference on issues 
vital to pro-family Americans.

<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n a sweeping victory for families, Congress recently 
passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including provisions protecting
children from computer pornography.  The Telecom Act extends current
child protection laws to cyberspace, using the court-approved
&quot;indecency&quot; standard to keep patently offensive material
away from minors.  The cyberporn provisions punish only knowing
violations, while preserving existing electronic mail privacy
laws.
<p>
The significance of the new law's computer porn section cannot
be overstated.  It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity
to set ground rules for the next great communications medium.
Pornographers have been flooding this promising technology, and
the new Telecom Act comes not a moment too soon.
<p>
<center><h3>ACLU Logs In</h3></center>
<p>
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to strike
down the computer pornography section as unconstitutional.  Clearly,
the ACLU is fighting a losing battle.  Time and again, the courts
have upheld the constitutionality of &quot;indecency&quot; restrictions
in other contexts, most recently regarding dial-a-porn services.
FRC will file its own brief in response to the ACLU challenge.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>ACLU FIGHTS A<br>
LOSING BATTLE</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
The battle now shifts to the Clinton administration, whose
resolve in defending the law is questionable.  Last April, President
Clinton voiced concern that children &quot;may be exposed to things
on computer, which in some ways are more powerful, more raw and
more inappropriate than those things from which we protect them
when they walk in a 7-Eleven.&quot;  Clinton declared, &quot;I
do not believe in any way, shape or form that we should be able
to do on e-mail, or through the electronic superhighway anything
beyond what we could elsewhere.  I think the First Amendment has
to be uniform in its application.&quot;
<p>
However, in recent days the Clinton administration has appeared
to retreat from this resolve.  The floundering is reminiscent
of the notorious <I>Knox</I> case, where the administration tried
to weaken the federal child pornography law it was bound to defend.
Although Congress rebuffed that attempt, fear remains that the
administration might try a similar tactic again.
<p>
Objections to the new cyberporn law have less to do with
free speech than with arrogance and greed.  The &quot;online elite&quot;
know that if this new medium is to be truly open to a diverse
community, all members of that community will deserve respect,
including children.  Even with the new law, parents must be ever
vigilant in ensuring that cyberporn remains off-limits to their
children.
<p>
<center><h3>Nixing PX Porn</h3></center>
<p>
FRC continues to fight pornography on other fronts.  Last
month at the Supreme Court, FRC filed a legal brief in <I>Alliance
for Community Media v. F.C.C.</I>, a case challenging the regulation
of pornographic programs on cable television access channels.
The challenged law would simply give private cable operators
the ability to limit indecent programs.  It would relieve operators
of the current law requiring them to show everything, no matter
how offensive. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs charge that restoring
a cable operator's right to decide against airing indecent programs
amounts to indirect government censorship.  FRC supports the right
of private cable operators to reject &quot;nude talk shows&quot;
and &quot;amateur porn hours&quot; on access channels.  Oral argument
at the Supreme Court was set for Feb. 21.
<p>
Pornography in the military has been another flashpoint.
For years, the U.S. military has been the nation's largest porn
purveyor, stocking military exchanges with tax-free smut worth
millions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, in recent years the military
has been plagued by sexual misconduct and assault.  New Jersey
Rep. Christopher Smith is drafting a bill to prohibit the sale
of pornography at military facilities worldwide.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Over the last few months, tremendous progress has occurred
in the fight against pornography, thanks largely to grassroots
support.  Your continued involvement will help keep these gains
intact.  Insist that child protection laws apply consistently
to all areas of society, including the Internet.  Urge your members
of Congress to support the pending Smith bill on military porn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="believers">
<B>Forsaken Brethren.</B>  FRC President Gary Bauer testified
on Feb. 15 before the House Subcommittee on International Operations
and Human Rights regarding anti-Christian persecution overseas.
Bauer testified that this persecution takes many forms, from
harassment of worshippers to, in Ethiopia, actual crucifixion.
Abuses seem to be especially prevalent in certain Moslem countries.
Bauer called for a more coherent response from the U.S. Government
and from U.S. religious leaders:  &quot;How much longer,&quot;
he said, &quot;can we allow persecuted Christians overseas to
call out, 'Why have you forsaken us?'&quot;
<p>
<B>CAREERS Update.</B>  The National Governors Association recently
released a statement urging final passage of the CAREERS bill
(H.R. 1617) within 30 days.  Progress in a House-Senate conference
committee to combine CAREERS with the Senate's Workforce Development
Act (S. 143) has been slow due to major differences between the
bills, which would consolidate job training programs.  The bills'
extensive Labor Market Information System and implementation of
a skill certificate system could threaten workers' economic freedom.
Governors favor consolidation, which gives them more authority
over state job training and economic development.
<p>
<B>Pro-Life Progress.</B> A short-term spending bill signed by
President Clinton on Jan. 26 included three pro-life measures.
They are:  a ban on federal funds for the experimental creation
of human embryos; a ban on federal funding of abortions for prison
inmates, except in the case of rape or life of the mother; and
a compromise restriction on international population funds.  The
compromise will bar funding until July 1 for organizations that
perform or promote abortions overseas, but allow funding thereafter
at reduced levels from 1995 spending.  Pro-life members of Congress
continue to seek permanent restrictions.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<B>Innocent as Charged.</B> After a more than year-long federal
grand jury investigation, the Clinton Justice Department has found
no evidence of a national conspiracy to attack abortion clinics.
However, Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed to continue the
probe, and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) has called for congressional
hearings on the issue.  Meanwhile, federal and state prosecutors
have used the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) act
to charge two peaceful pro-lifers, sidewalk counselors Carmen
Vazquez and Bobby Riley, with &quot;obstructing&quot; and 
&quot;interfering&quot; with women seeking abortions.
<p>
<B>Drug Fighter.</B> President Clinton has selected a get-tough
soldier to lead our nation's battle against drugs.  During his
State of the Union address, Clinton announced his decision to
tap Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey to replace drug czar Lee Brown,
who is now teaching in Texas.  Gen. McCaffrey is an expert on
narcotics trafficking who returns to Washington from a command
in Panama, where he has overseen U.S. cooperation with Latin American
and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction since
February 1994. Drug abuse among American youth con-tinues to
rise.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="baer">
<B>Baer Backs &quot;Mule.&quot;</B> Federal Judge Harold Baer,
Jr. provoked a firestorm Jan. 24 when he threw out the drug trafficking
conviction of Carol Bayless.  Bayless was driving a car with 80
pounds of cocaine and heroin in the trunk. Two accomplices ran
when police observed them.  Judge Baer,  a Clinton appointee,
said: &quot;Residents in this neighborhood tend to regard police
officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.  Had the men not run
when the cops began to stare at them, it would have been unusual.&quot;
Bayless had confessed to being a regular drug courier (&quot;mule&quot;).
<p>
<B>PC &quot;Volunteers.&quot;</B>  Mandatory voluntarism takes
the spirit out of serving, argue many parents and secondary school
students.  Graduation requirements for &quot;volunteering&quot;
are prompted by Goals 2000, which encourages community service.
But what some programs call service is actually political activism.
Others exclude religious service activities.  The conflict over
mandatory service may soon reach the U.S. Supreme Court if a New
York decision upholding a service requirement is appealed.  Federal
parental rights legislation (S. 984, H.R. 1946) could provide
a remedy by defining parental authority in school matters.
<p>
<B>Army Salvation.</B> An Army wife, Tambra Hartmann, lost her
license to run a home-based day-care service on a military post
because she said grace with the children over meals and played
Christian music.  The children's parents selected the service
in part because it was faith-based.   Last November, the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Army overstepped
its authority and violated the families' First Amendment freedoms.
The Army has changed the regulation to permit faith elements
as long as child-care providers inform parents of that fact before
enrollment.

<h3>Wedding Bans</h3>
<p>
Acting before Hawaiian courts mandate homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;
which may occur in July, pro-family activists nationwide are working
to protect the definition of marriage.
<p>
In California, the state assembly voted 41 to 31 on Jan.
31 to prohibit the recognition of same-sex relationships as marriage.
A tougher vote is expected in the liberal Senate.  Utah enacted
a law in 1995 that defines marriage as the union of &quot;one
man and one woman&quot; and bars recognition of same-sex nuptials.
Other states considering such measures: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.  In Maine,
a marriage protection bill was introduced but withdrawn after
a lesbian legislator withdrew her own homosexual rights bill.
In Nebraska, a bill legalizing same-sex marriages has been introduced.
<p>
At the national level, a federal bill is being written to
reinforce the &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition in all
policies, including Social Security and the military.  The tentative
title is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and a sponsor was
being sought at press time.
<p>
The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated.  If homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; becomes law in Hawaii and is imposed on all
other states through the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution,
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexuality, schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital sex,
and churches will be pushed into a religious &quot;ghetto,&quot;
where pressure will mount for conformity to civil law.  Redefining
marriage would redefine the family, giving homosexuals an uncontested
&quot;right&quot; to adopt children.
<p>
Citizens can do two things to preserve marriage:  1) contact
your state legislators and urge them to support current legislation
or to introduce a bill protecting marriage; 2) ask your congressman
and U.S. Senators to cosponsor the eventual federal bill.  The
Capitol Hill switchboard number is (202) 225-3121 or (202) 224-3121.

Marriage (513) 733-8908.

<h3>Wobbling on Welfare</h3>
<p>
The promise to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; remains
a popular talking point, but on Jan. 9 President Clinton vetoed
the welfare bill passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
The nation's Governors have now advanced their own welfare
reform package, and regrettably they have chosen to abandon serious
attempts to reduce illegitimacy.  The House and Senate agreed
last year to prohibit states from using federal funds to increase
welfare payments to women who bear additional children while on
welfare, but would have allowed states to opt out of the prohibition.
<p>
While erasing the focus on illegitimacy, the Governors proposed
<I>adding</I> an extra $4 billion in child care funding.  Their
recommendation would increase spending on day care 49% more than
current law, without spending a penny on abstinence programs to
help reduce out-of-wedlock births.  The emphasis on child care
is ironic, since the Governors also moved to weaken the work requirements
passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
In a letter to House colleagues, Congressman Jim Talent (R-Mo.)
argued that the last time Congress adopted a welfare plan proposed
by the Governors, a Democrat from Arkansas rode to the White House
partly on the strength of his pledge to fix the mess.  If the
Congress listens to the Governors' advice this year, it will have
committed itself to spending over half a trillion dollars to subsidize
fatherlessness through cash benefits, day care, job training,
and other services.
<p>
A recent FRC poll shows that three out of four Americans
believe that welfare encourages illegitimacy and, by a ratio of
two to one, that reducing illegitimacy is more important than
merely encouraging single mothers to support themselves.  A hefty
84% of Americans support a family cap, and an overwhelming majority
believe that work requirements should focus last on mothers with
preschool-aged children.  Both provisions would help reduce the
Governors' incentive to capture new federal dollars for child
care -- and would allay our concerns about leaving children, yet
again, at the mercy of public institutions.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Foster Has a Future</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
In his State of the Union Address on Jan. 23, President Clinton
made an appeal to pro-family Americans.  He talked about balancing
the budget, reforming welfare, attacking drug abuse, and reducing
the rate of teen pregnancy, among other things.  For Drug Czar,
the President made a choice American families warmly applauded,
Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey.  Now comes Clinton's Teenage Pregnancy
Czar, and the ovation is over:  Dr. Henry Foster, Planned Parenthood
advocate extraordinaire and failed nominee for Surgeon General,
is back in the saddle.
<p>
Almost a year ago, President Clinton tapped Dr. Foster to
replace Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General, saying that he wanted
Foster's Nashville-based teen pregnancy program, &quot;I Have
A Future,&quot; replicated throughout the nation.  But part of
the reason Foster was rejected as Surgeon General was that his
program, like all contraceptive-based programs, proved a dismal
failure.  According to an evaluation by the Carnegie Corporation,
a program underwriter, participants in &quot;I Have a Future&quot;
actually had <I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those
outside the program.
<p>
This is not the kind of leadership that America wants or
needs to help combat teen pregnancy.  This is not the kind of
program that will help reach the President's stated goal of reducing
the teen pregnancy rate by one-third over the next 10 years. 
And this is surely not the kind of approach that will help our
children grow up to be responsible and mature adults.
<p>
The research is crystal clear.  Teenagers' best safeguard
against having or causing an out-of-wedlock pregnancy is to have
two loving parents involved in their lives.  But it's also important
to create a culture where the values that parents teach their
children are reinforced outside the home.  Several abstinence
programs have done just that, with excellent results.
<p>
For example, only 1.1 percent of participants in the Washington,
D.C.-based <I>Best Friends</I> program became pregnant, as opposed
to 25 percent of other girls in the city.  The abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> helped to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in Jacksonville,
Florida, by 35 percent just three years after it was implemented.
Examples of other successful abstinence programs abound.
<p>
Tragically, the President has chosen to support ideology
over progress.  The Foster task force has been christened the
&quot;National Campaign to Reduce Teen Pregnancy.&quot;  Reducing
pregnancy among unmarried teens is a laudable goal.  But to reach
it we must have a sustained reversal of the sexual activity that
haunts the young with unprecedented rates of pregnancy, abortion,
disease and emotional heartbreak.  Unfortunately, the Foster
group has already admitted that it intends to promote contraception
rather than abstinence.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>CLINTON CHOOSES IDEOLOGY<br>
OVER PROGRESS</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
While raising children well is a tough job, it's not impossible.
In truth, the teen pregnancy rate has been declining for the
last two years because more teens are choosing abstinence despite
all of the federal projects and cultural pressures promoting the
contrary.  Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the drop in teen pregnancy rates reflects
a rising number of teens choosing to abstain from sex.
<p>
The familiar Scripture says, &quot;Train up a child in the
way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;
(Proverbs 22:6).  Last June the U.S. Senate reviewed Dr. Foster's
credentials and told the President this <I>isn't</I> the way
we should go.  But the President has refused to turn from his
old friend.  So now it appears that Henry Foster has a future
in government.  It's our nation's young people for whom the future
now looks a little bleaker.

<p>

&quot;<font size=+3>T</font>he Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful 
antidote to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the 
hands of some injudicious judges.&quot; -- Gary Bauer, FRC president, 
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 1996.

<p>

On July 12, the House of Representatives approved the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) by an overwhelming vote of 342 to 67.
The bill defines marriage for federal purposes as &quot;the union
of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot;  It also asserts
the power of Congress to interpret the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the Constitution to protect the other 49 states if Hawaii legalizes
homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; as expected later this year.

<p>

<center><h3>Senate Action Soon</h3></center>

<p>

As of press time, DOMA was slated for Senate action before the
August 3 recess.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has threatened
to attach an amendment to the bill that would grant homosexuals
special workplace protection.  This could kill DOMA, since the
Kennedy amendment is an unacceptable, back-door way of enacting
federal gay rights legislation.  Calls are needed to Capitol Hill
to urge legislators to &quot;pass DOMA pure.&quot;

<p>

The swift consideration of DOMA is testament to the hard work
of thousands of pro-family activists who have pressed Congress
to act.  FRC's government relations staff report that Capitol
Hill has been inundated with calls and letters supporting DOMA.

<p>

On June 24, leaders of 11 state family policy councils allied
with FRC and Focus on the Family spoke in support of DOMA at a
Washington press conference that drew national and regional press
coverage.

<center><i><font size=+2>
"URGE LEGISLATORS TO<br>
PASS DOMA PURE"
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

On July 3, FRC hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on DOMA with eight
experts who analyzed the faulty research on homosexuality and
addressed the importance of traditional marriage in law, culture,
education and adoption.  Speakers included author Dr. Jeffrey
Satinover,  Transformation Ex-Gay Ministry leader Anthony Falzarano,
Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley Arkes, FRC cultural
studies director Robert Knight, social work specialist Brenda
Destro, adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former school principal
and author Linda Page, journalist Peter LaBarbera, and Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Briefing Highlights</h3></center>

<p>

The two-hour briefing ran live on C-SPAN, which repeated it three
times during the next two days.  Millions of Americans learned
facts about homosexuality and the homosexual political agenda
that are routinely omitted from media coverage.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>

<b>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.</b>, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale:  &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea
is true, and in fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence
to the contrary.&quot;

<p>

<b>Hadley Arkes</b>: &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'  We can count on the fact
that there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue
by raising a challenge in the court....&quot;

<p>

Anthony Falzarano: &quot;I speak to you today not just as an
observer of this movement, but as one of them.  I am a former
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 until
I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle thinking that there really
wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't realize is that although
I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay.  I
had a choice.... Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle
that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all
kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us....&quot;

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Bill Emerson, RIP.</b>  A strong champion of the sanctity of
life and the family, Rep. Bill Emerson (Mo.) died of cancer June
22.  Emerson was universally admired by his colleagues and popular
with his constituents.  His public career was sparked by service
as a Congressional page at age 16.  The flag-waving families who
lined his funeral route and the members of Congress who paid him
tearful tribute during a July 12 memorial service offered praise
to his memory.  Emerson's quiet service was marked with integrity
and devotion.

<p>

<b>Istook Tries.</b> On July 11, the House passed the 1997 funding
bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education. Defeated: a pro-family amendment offered by Rep.
Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) that would have required written parental
consent before a teenager receives any services, including abortion
referrals, under the Title X federal family planning program.
The House also defeated an attempt by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.)
that would have allowed federally-funded human embryo experiments.
Current law prohibits such research on live human embryos.

<p>

<b>Unaccountable.</b> The House and Senate passed separate health
reform bills last spring with bipartisan support, yet no compromise
has been reached.  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been holding
the bill hostage by refusing to let the Senate leadership appoint
conferees.  Kennedy opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
were contained in the House bill but narrowly defeated by the
Senate.  He has vowed to continue stalling until the leadership
appoints a majority of conferees opposed to MSAs. If Kennedy
succeeds, much-needed reforms (in access and ability to keep insurance
when changing jobs) will go by the boards.

<p>

<b>Jubilee Pits.</b> &quot;Come, Holy Spirit&quot; -- with those
words, Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) took the floor of Congress on
June 27 and defended his Christian faith, biblical sexual morality,
and FRC's role in exposing the homosexual &quot;circuit&quot;
party in a federal building in April. Dornan made the remarks
in response to a personal attack by fellow Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R-Wis.).  For a full transcript of Rep. Dornan's remarks as they
were printed in the <I>Congressional Record</I>, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fdabortion">

<b>FDA Variety Store.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Reproductive Drug Advisory Committee
initiated hearings on two new abortion drugs -- hearings not solicited
by a drug manufacturer.  On June 28, the FDA committee decided
that increased dosages of oral contraceptives were &quot;safe&quot;
and &quot;effective&quot; for use as an abortifacient &quot;morning-after
pill.&quot;  Pro-abortion groups urged the FDA to force reluctant
manufacturers to relabel oral contraceptives for post-coital use.
On July 19, the same FDA committee considered approving RU-486
for use in the US.  FRC attended both hearings and  publicly opposed
both FDA actions.

<p>

<b>China MFN.</b> The Clinton administration prevailed in renewing
China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade status for
the coming year.  On June 27, an effort to revoke China's MFN
status failed in the House of Representatives by vote of 141 to
286.  However, the House did pass a second, non-binding resolution
(H. Res. 461 by vote of 411 to 7) which called for hearings and
possible legislation to punish China for its military intimidation
of Taiwan, weapons sales, and human rights abuses.  FRC supports
hearings and opposes MFN for China because of its myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Five-ring Political Circus.</b> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
were, sadly, misused to advance the homosexual agenda.  The Olympic
torch run bypassed Cobb County, Georgia, and Greenville County,
South Carolina, because officials there passed resolutions opposing
homosexuality.  The torch was actually hidden in a van and driven
through Greenville County during the night.  Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration lifted the ban on HIV-infected immigrants for the
Olympics, just as was done earlier for the Gay Games in New York.
It's not known whether other infectious diseases got equal opportunity.

<p>

<b>First Advocate.</b> In a first-ever presidential interview
with a homosexual magazine, President Clinton told <I>The Advocate</I>
(June 25) that his administration &quot;has taken more steps than
any previous in bringing the gay and lesbian communities to the
table.&quot;  Los Angeles-based Liberation Publications, which
publishes <I>The Advocate</I>, also owns Alyson Publications,
a Boston-based publisher of <I>Heather Has Two Mommies, Daddy's
Roommate, Daddy's Wedding</I> and books about sado-masochistic
sex with children.  One book gives advice for homosexual pedophiles
on how to avoid prosecution.

<p><a name="marijuana">

<b>MUM's Not the Word.</b> California's &quot;Medical Use of
Marijuana&quot; initiative will appear on the November ballot.
International &quot;decriminalization&quot; promoters who have
bankrolled this initiative claim it will provide &quot;compassionate
use&quot; of marijuana without prescription for people with cancer,
AIDS and glaucoma, but the initiative allows use for &quot;any
other illness&quot; and would virtually legalize possession and
cultivation for anyone, including children.  The federal government
rejects smoking marijuana as a medicine because it has serious
physical and psychological consequences.  Physicians wishing to
prescribe THC, marijuana's active ingredient, have the FDA-approved
drug Marinol.

<h3>FRC: Ready and <i>Abel</i></h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court will decide this September whether to hear the
first challenge to the Pentagon's new ban on homosexuals in the
military.  This appeal was prompted by the high court's recent
ruling that Colorado cannot constitutionally bar &quot;special
rights&quot; laws for homosexuals.

<p>

On July 1, 1996, former Navy Lieutenant Paul Thomasson, who was
discharged for proclaiming, &quot;I am gay,&quot; asked the high
court to hear his case.  He challenged both the law passed by
Congress and the Clinton administration's regulations on homosexuality
in the armed forces.

<p>

Thomasson lost his challenge in both the federal district and
appeals courts.  The appeals court hearing was noteworthy because
it included oral argument presented on behalf of the Family Research
Council.  FRC had filed two briefs in this case, both of which
thoroughly exposed the administration's illegal plans to use the
military to legitimize homosexuality.

<p>

Thomasson's attorney said his appeal decision was influenced by
the high court's <I>Romer v. Evans</I> ruling, which struck
down Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; amendment.  He claims
that the judicial landscape has improved greatly with <I>Romer</I>.
Writing for the Supreme Court's minority in the <I>Romer</I>
decision, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is &quot;no foundation
in American constitutional law&quot; for the court's ruling.

<p>

It's expected the Clinton Justice Department will favor the appeal
request.  If the court accepts <I>Thomasson</I>, oral arguments
will likely be held this fall with a decision next spring.  The
military's ban should be upheld -- if the Supreme Court relies
on the constitution.

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) has participated in 12
homosexual court cases so far.  Should the <I>Thomasson</I> case
be heard, the MRP will file an amicus brief and ask the high court
for time to make oral argument.

<p>

Meanwhile, also on July 1, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit returned the <I>Abel et al. v. Perry</I> case
to federal district court directing that judge to determine whether
the military can constitutionally exclude soldiers who engage
in homosexual conduct.  The lower court previously ruled that
the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the six service members
in <I>Abel</I> were violated when the military sought to discharge
them based solely on their <I>admission</I> of homosexuality,
without regard to actual conduct.

<h3>Ban the Postcards!</h3>

<p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate and was vetoed by President Clinton on April 10,
1996.  The House will first attempt to override the President's
veto shortly after Labor Day. A two-thirds majority of those
present and voting is required to override.  If the House vote
is successful, the Senate is expected to make an override attempt
shortly thereafter. These are crucial pro-life votes.

<p>

On June 29-30, the nation's Catholic bishops sponsored a massive
pro-life postcard campaign (in local churches) to members of Congress
to urge support for the override.  It is expected that millions
of postcards will flood Capitol Hill in the next month or two.
The House Post Office has reportedly hired extra workers to deal
with the heavy influx of cards.

<p>

The Clinton White House is not waiting for the cards to react,
however. Administration officials at the Pentagon attempted to 
silence Catholic chaplains on military bases by issuing a directive 
forbidding them to mention the postcard campaign in church. They 
claimed it involved &quot;partisan political activity,&quot; a 
claim belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was 
passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
Congress.  Many Catholic service members and their families believe 
that they were illegally denied the guidance of their priests and 
bishops on this vital issue. A legal defense fund which specializes 
in religious liberty cases is reportedly planning to file suit on 
behalf of military chaplains who believe that their First Amendment 
rights were violated.

<p>

FRC urges concerned citizens to call on their legislators to override
the veto by talking with them personally, especially at local
&quot;town meetings&quot; during the August congressional recess.
Calls and/or letters to the members' district offices are also
encouraged.  Please continue to educate your friends and neighbors
about partial-birth abortions by writing &quot;letters to the
editor&quot; to local newspapers, participating in radio talk
shows, etc.

<center>
<font size=+2><b><i>The Court's Conscientious Dissenter</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>J</font>ustice Antonin Scalia is making a name for himself 
as a conscientious objector to a Supreme Court run amok.  He is heard 
most often from the dissenting side these days, frequently accompanied 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
His dissents are noteworthy -- some would say notorious.  Justice
Scalia has an uncanny knack for cutting through the majority's
sophistry and sloppy self-justification to make a stunning legal
defense of American tradition, true democracy, plain old common
sense and decency.

<p>

Scalia shines the light of truth on &quot;this most illiberal
Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after
another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's
law trained elite) into our Basic Law.&quot;  He believes that
it is &quot;no business of the courts (as opposed to the political
branches) to take sides in the cultural war.&quot;  We at FRC
believe the same, and Scalia's measured umbrage is our vicarious
voice.

<p>

In response to special rights gained by the well-funded gay lobby
in several Colorado cities, voters across the state approved a
constitutional amendment that would prevent any person from getting
such legal privileges solely on the basis of their homosexuality.
The Court majority said that the amendment was unconstitutional
because it was obviously born of hatred against gays, despite
what the Coloradans say.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
THE COURT UNASHAMEDLY<br>
OVERSTEPS ITS AUTHORITY.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Scalia retorted that &quot;[t]he Court's portrayal of Coloradans
as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled 'gay-bashing'
is so false as to be comical.&quot;  He also deplored the sinister
effect of the Court's &quot;verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence
to traditional attitudes.&quot;  Scalia charged the majority with
&quot;tak[ing] sides in the culture wars,&quot; specifically,
choosing &quot;the views and values of the lawyer class from which
the Court's Members are drawn&quot; and supporting this choice
&quot;by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine.&quot;

<p>

The Court unashamedly overstepped its authority, he wrote: &quot;Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia took up his pen again in the case challenging the male-only
admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute:  &quot;Since
it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States
-- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I
dissent....Today the Court shuts down an institution that has
served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and
distinction for over a century and a half.&quot;  To do that,
it &quot;sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people.&quot;

<p>

In one of the last cases of the term, Justice Scalia rhetorically
shook his head: &quot;The court must be living in another world.
Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution
for a country I do not recognize.&quot;

<p>

Those are stark words from the bench, words befitting the steady
dismantling of legislative prerogatives today's &quot;conservative&quot;
Supreme Court is engaged in.  But Scalia is no doomsayer.  A recent
report of a celebration of his first 10 years on the bench with
his present and former law clerks noted that, despite his angry
dissents, Justice Scalia is a happy man with a sense of hope.
Apparently he knows, as we know, that ours is not in the winning,
but in the trying.

<title>Gary Bauer's June, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

June 7, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

June is fittingly called &quot;the month of weddings.&quot; 
As the first real warm days of summer finally arrive, skies are
blue, flowers are blooming, and brides and grooms are seemingly
everywhere.  Marriage is never out of season, but I can think
of no better time than the month of June for our nation to reaffirm
the value and meaning of marriage.

<p>

As this letter is written, a reaffirmation of marriage is taking
place all across our land.  You can hear it in the peal of church
bells and read about it in wedding announcements and church bulletins.
You can even see it in brightly decorated cars parading by on
dazzling June days.  But this reaffirmation is taking place in
another way, too.

<p>

In Washington, DC, and in over 30 states, legislators are stepping
forward to make sure that marriage is protected in American law.
My letter is brief this month because the Family Research Council
is in the thick of this essential effort.  The reaffirmation of
traditional marriage is coming <b>just in time</b>.  Even as I
write this, an organized assault is in progress to redefine marriage
to allow men to marry men and women to marry women.

<p>

Let me recap quickly what has happened.  In 1993, the highest
court in Hawaii handed down a shocking decision.  Liberal judges
there said that Hawaii's law limiting marriage to one man and
one woman (similar to laws in every other state) was a form of
sex discrimination -- unless the state could somehow show that it
had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in reserving marriage to
couples of the opposite sex!  Hawaii is a very liberal state politically,
but this ruling sparked immediate outrage even there.

<p>

Nearly three quarters of Hawaii's citizens told pollsters they
<I>reject</I> making Hawaii a haven for homosexual couples to
&quot;marry.&quot;  In 1994 the Hawaii legislature responded and
passed a law reaffirming that marriage is intended for &quot;man-woman
units&quot; -- not two men or two women.

<p>

Despite the findings of this poll, and subsequent efforts to
convince the courts that Hawaii does have a &quot;compelling interest&quot;
here, most experts believe that traditional marriage in Hawaii
will be struck down -- perhaps as soon as this August.  If that happens,
homosexual couples from every state in the Union are ready to
fly to Hawaii and find &quot;chapels&quot;or Justices of the Peace
to marry them.  They will then return to their home states and
demand recognition of these marriages from their state and local
governments, from their employers, from the courts, from their
churches (and from you)!

<p>

The worst news is that these demands have a good chance of succeeding.
Under what is known as the &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;
clause of the U.S. Constitution, each state is required to recognize
the &quot;Public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings&quot;
of every other state (Article IV, Section 1).   States that refuse
to recognize these Hawaiian &quot;marriage&quot; licenses as valid
are likely to find themselves being sued in court, with the outcome
uncertain.  Unbelievably, the action of a single court -- or even
a single judge -- in Hawaii could lead to a revolution that undoes
the sanctity of the marriage bond in every corner of the United
States.

<p>

<b>We must not -- and cannot -- allow this to happen!</b> When Hawaii's
Supreme Court ruled in 1993, FRC responded with alerts and issue
papers pointing out the devastating impact that would follow.
We and other groups encouraged states to respond by reaffirming
the traditional definition of marriage to insulate it from attack.
The word has spread rapidly, and a wide coalition of religious
and family groups and legislators of all political persuasions
is currently pushing for marriage protection laws.

<p>

Such laws have now been enacted in at least eleven states, and
more may be signed into law by the time you read this.  In addition,
the Congress of the United States is set to respond to this challenge.
With FRC's help and through the dedicated efforts of legal experts
on Capitol Hill, legislation has been introduced to protect marriage
in federal law.  This legislation is called the Defense of Marriage
Act, or DOMA.  It was introduced in the House of Representatives
on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob  Barr (R-Ga.).
Senate introduction of the legislation followed on May 8 with
Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Bob Dole (R-Kans.) as co-sponsors.
The respective bill numbers are H.R.3396 and S.1740.

<p>

Make no mistake, this bill is vitally needed.  Sen. Dan Coats
(R-Ind.) issued a powerful statement endorsing the bill and explaining
the importance of marriage.  His quote is worth sharing at length:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by 
humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual 
relationship that prepares the next generation for its duties and 
opportunities.  An 1884 decision of the Supreme Court called it 
&quot;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization.&quot;

<p>

The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, 
and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in our history,
in our laws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our 
nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and one woman. 
This fact can be respected or resented, but it can't be altered.

<p>

The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural inheritance. 
It is our duty -- perhaps our first duty -- to pass it intact to the 
future . . . It is amazing and disturbing that the debate should even 
be necessary.  It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep 
moral confusion.  But events have made the definition of traditional 
marriage essential.  The preservation of marriage has become an issue 
of self-preservation for our society.</i>

</blockquote><p>

With Senator Coats' words, the case for marriage rests.
Be assured that the Family Research Council will continue to
work with him and other like-minded legislators in both parties
to secure passage of this bill as soon as possible -- before a final
decision is reached by the Supreme Court in Hawaii.  Americans
need to be heard before our courts intervene and disturb yet another
legal ideal.  Our goal is that DOMA will swiftly reach President
Clinton's desk and that he will have no choice but to sign it
into law.

<p>

<b>The need for passage of this bill could not be more urgent.
On May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state of Colorado's
Amendment 2, which would have blocked special rights for homosexuals.
One leader of the homosexual movement bragged, &quot;This is
a joyous day for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.&quot;</b>

<p>

Please join with us in this effort.  Use the enclosed card, or
call us at 1-800-225-4008, to obtain a free copy of our information
packet on saving the institution of marriage.  Take note of the
enclosed copy of the full-page advertisement we placed in the
May 19 <i>Washington Post</i>.  Feel free to make copies or contact
us to arrange to run this ad in your local newspaper.

<p>

Be assured that your prayers and financial support of the work
of the Family Research Council are what sustain us.  Your involvment
and commitment to FRC will enable us to continue in our efforts
to defend the divine institution of marriage.  As always, thank
you for your friendship, and may God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

<title>Gary Bauer's July, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

July 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

The Bauer family had a close call last month.  An unusually strong
summer thunderstorm ripped through the Washington area, bringing
with it 150-mile-per-hour winds.  To make matters worse, a tornado
touched down on our street, knocking down trees and sending limbs
flying through walls and onto rooftops.  Fortunately, our house
was largely spared, but a neighbor's home was badly damaged.

<p>

My daughter, Elyse, and I were driving home through the storm
when the tornado hit.  I'll never forget the sight as we turned
down our street and saw how the severe weather had rearranged
the familiar objects of our daily lives.  The storm was gone in
a little more than an hour, but it was incredible how quickly
so much raw destruction was wreaked on our community.  Human beings
are no match for the forces of God's Creation.  We were struck
with a sense of awe -- and our hearts were filled with thanks that
the destruction was not worse and that no one was injured or killed.

<p>

That twister wasn't the only storm I encountered last month.
Throughout the month of June, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind
over the Republican Party Platform and the sanctity of human life.
Debate over the GOP's pro-life plank has been going on for years,
but this new storm kicked up suddenly and unexpectedly.  It came
about when Sen. Robert Dole, the certain GOP presidential nominee,
called for the addition of  a &quot;declaration of tolerance&quot;
to the platform, and suggested that it be applied <I>only</I>
to the abortion language.  That current language in the existing
platform says that the unborn child has a fundamental right to
life that cannot be infringed, and calls for a human life amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>

Let me say right up front that Sen. Bob Dole and I have known
each other for years.  I consulted with him last fall, at his
request, before he delivered his speech in Hollywood calling on
the entertainment industry to reverse its tide of sex-and-violence
for profit.  We have collaborated over the years on many other
issues.  A few weeks ago, Jim Dobson and I prayed together with
Bob in his Capitol Hill office.  I consider him a friend, and
I believe he would say the same about me.

<p>

But, in my humble opinion, Bob Dole is wrong about the pro-life
plank. It cannot and should not be changed.  Talk about revising
the plank has been swirling, of course, for months in GOP circles.
Some prominent pro-abortion Republicans, like Govs. Christine
Todd Whitman and Pete Wilson, have insisted on removing it altogether.
To do so would repeat the discussion that took place in the Democratic
party some years ago. The 1992 Democratic Platform endorsed an
abortion on demand philosophy.  A previous statement tolerating
the presence of pro-life Democrats in the party was stripped from
the platform.  As a result, President Clinton has vetoed every
attempt to restrict abortion, including those in the 7th, 8th
and 9th months of pregnancy.

<p>

All during the early summer, I was among a number of pro-life
leaders who were kept abreast of negotiations taking place among
leading Republicans.  After weeks of discussion, an agreement
was reached to include &quot;open door&quot; language in the preamble
to the platform.  That language would only state the obvious:
that the GOP platform stands for a set of principles, and that
not every member of the party agrees with every one of those principles.
The sanctity of human life would not be singled out or in any
other way watered down.  The current pro-life plank, powerful
and unequivocal, would remain as written. No deletions.  No dilutions.

<p>

This solution was acceptable, but within 24 hours Bob Dole himself
overturned it. He used a television interview to declare his
intention to put the tolerance language right in the pro-life
plank. Talk about a twister out of the blue!  This so-called
solution was totally unacceptable, and I said so publicly.  The
sanctity-of-life plank is among a handful of essential statements
in the GOP platform.  To attach &quot;tolerance&quot; language
directly to that plank would signal to the world (and the media
immediately interpreted it this way) that the Republican Party
regards it as one of the least important issues facing the nation,
when in fact the issue goes to the heart of the fundamental purpose
of liberty.

<p>

Just consider the impact of including tolerance language on another
subject, say, taxes:  &quot;We favor tax relief for overworked
Americans, but we recognize that many people disagree with us.&quot;
You would instantly recognize that the party which said this
wasn't serious about cutting taxes.  The same holds true for the
profound question of whether unborn children and their mothers
should be protected from the exploitation of abortions.

<p>

What followed my public criticism of Sen. Dole's proposal was
uncomfortable for both of us.  The senator took me on by name,
and major newspapers were happy to splash the dispute across page
one.  I kept my comments focused on the issues at stake, but it
was an awkward moment for me anyway.  Disputes among friends will
always draw a crowd of spectators.  But this fight, gut-wrenching
as it was, has an upside.  First, I have high hopes that, by the
time you read this, the dispute over the pro-life plank will be
resolved with an agreement that makes it clear that our children
deserve the full protection of the laws of the United States.
Second, this public argument gave me a rare chance to address
the nation on why the sanctity of human life matters so much.

<p>

National Public Radio, as liberal a media outlet as there is,
interviewed me in drive-time, and my comments were carried fairly
and without censorship.  <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington
Post</I> and other major papers accurately reported my defense
of our children.  The following weekend, I was invited to appear
on the prestigious CNN public policy show, <I>The Capital Gang.</I>
I was able to tell large segments of the American people what
our nation's abandonment of the sanctity of human life is doing
to the fabric of our society.  All of this came on the heels of
unprecedented media opportunities for the Family Research Council
(FRC), including appearances on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I> 
and <I>Face the Nation</I> and a write-up in <I>Time</I> magazine
featuring our principled stands.

<p>

Since all of this happened, I have heard from many people who
say they don't necessarily agree with FRC on every issue, but
that we give them something to think about.  This is vital to
remember.  Where &quot;tolerance&quot; language goes in the Republican
platform -- whether it's there at all -- isn't just a matter of dotting
&quot;i's&quot; and crossing &quot;t's.&quot;  If an issue isn't
important enough to appear in any party's platform, then it's
not worth a national conversation.  How we address the sanctity
of human life will determine whether this nation endures, or whether
it is torn away forever from the ideals that motivated our Founders.

<p>

Let me take a moment here to thank you.  In the middle of this
hot debate, hundreds of you called, wrote and faxed me your support.
Countless friends prayed for my family and for FRC.  Believe
me, we felt that encouragement.

<p>

My relationship with Washington leaders in both parties, including
Bob Dole, matters very much to me.  But the Family Research Council
is committed to speaking the truth:  on the needs of families,
on neglected children, on coarseness in the culture, on the virtue
deficit, and on the violence corroding our common sense of neighborliness.
We will speak the truth in election years and non-election years.
We will speak up when it pleases our friends, and when it doesn't.
To do otherwise would be to convert this organization into just
one more nest of political hired guns in the nation's capital.
I won't have that.  The issues facing America are bigger and
more enduring than one presidential race.

<p>

You will be happy to know, for example, that we are working with
a courageous band of Democrats in Congress who are struggling
to add &quot;tolerance&quot; language to the 1996 Democratic Platform.
This is &quot;tolerance&quot; language we <b><i>can</i></b> support
because it moves in the opposite direction:  it would say that
there is room in the Democratic party for people who champion
the &quot;little guy&quot; in the womb.  Unfortunately, I am not
optimistic about a change in their platform even though 40 percent
of registered Democrats hold pro-life beliefs.  For nearly a decade
now, the party has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.  Instead,
they have allowed radical feminists, the ACLU and gay rights groups
to turn the party into a vehicle for radical social change.

<p>

As I've emphasized many times before, FRC does not endorse candidates,
but we do work diligently to keep the issues affecting America's
families at center stage.  Toward that end, we will work with
anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely willing to espouse family-friendly
public policy.

<p>

While I'm writing to you, let me give you an update on another
&quot;contest&quot; in which I've been involved.  This is the
competition I proposed last January between two visions:  the
big-government philosophy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, <I>It
Takes a Village</I>, and the family-centered ideals of my book,
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This spring, Family Research Council
placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines challenging
the American people to compare the visions in these two books
and to choose the one that best represents their hopes for the
next generation of American children.

<p>

So here are the results to date.  The first lady's publisher
reports that 360,000 copies of <I>It Takes a Village</I> are in
print.  Those figures do not necessarily reflect actual sales.
A similar number of copies of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> have
now been sold, enough to put this little paperback on the Top
Five list of Christian best-sellers for the past three months.
In short, my competition with Mrs. Clinton is neck-and-neck.

<p>

I realize that this has happened only because thousands of faithful
supporters like you have bought multiple copies of <I>Our Hopes,
Our Dreams</I> and shared them with neighbors, friends, and fellow
believers.  I can hardly ask you to do more.  But consider this:
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> was written as a straightforward,
easily understood summary of what has drawn pro-family Americans
into the public policy arena in record numbers.  Can you think
of anyone -- an acquaintance or business associate -- who would benefit
from the couple of hours it takes to read this statement of pro-family
principle?

<p>

If you can, it's easy to use our &quot;800&quot; number to order
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> directly from us.  Better still,
however, you can take a step that will aid a vital voice in your
community and help boost the ranking of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
on the best-seller lists.  Visit your local Christian bookstore
and obtain or order a copy there.  Christian booksellers play
an irreplaceable role in spreading the Word, attracting new Christians
and encouraging &quot;old&quot; ones.  Many of these establishments
exist on a shoestring, and they struggle at this time of year.
Please take a moment to drop by and let them know you appreciate
their presence in your community.

<p>

Have a blessed and enjoyable summer (may it be as storm-free
as possible, too!).  From all of us at Family Research Council,
thank you for your support, and God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. Summers are a great time for families, a time for vacations
and building memories for a lifetime.  The only problem is that
cagey Washington insiders know that grassroots Americans are distracted
from their handling of critical issues. <b><i>This summer, FRC especially
needs your help</i></b>. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) <I>must</I>
be passed before a Hawaiian court acts in August.  The
Partial-Birth Abortion bill <I>must</I> get a powerful vote in
the House this month to override Bill Clinton's veto.  And we
<i>must</i> push for desperately-needed tax relief for families with
children before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
I hope you will prayerfully consider giving us your financial
support this month.  With your help, I am convinced that we can
stay in the fight and win. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's March, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

March 8, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Washington is even more hectic than usual these days and the
Family Research Council (FRC) seems to be working 24 hours a day.
While Alaska, Louisiana and Iowa held caucuses in February,
March is the big month for primaries in this presidential year as 
voters in state after state determine whom they will vote for. 
South Carolina led off on March 2.  Twelve more states vote between 
March 5 and 7.  &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; -- which isn't that 
super anymore because so many states have moved up
the date their primary -- follows on March 12.  California votes
at the end of the month.

<p>

By the end of this month, if not sooner, we may know
the name of the Republican presidential nominee.  On the Democratic
side, President Bill Clinton is unopposed and his renomination is 
virtually assured.  Third party candidates like Ross Perot and Jesse 
Jackson may still emerge.

<p>

In all of my contacts with friends of the Family Research Council,
no question is asked me more often than this one:  &quot;Gary,
which candidate for the White House will keep his word and do
the most for families?&quot;  I wish I could answer that question.
But, as I've often mentioned in my letters to you, endorsements
aren't -- and cannot be -- the business of FRC. 
The authors of our tax laws have prohibited nonprofit groups
like FRC from participating in or attempting to influence the
outcome of any election.

<p>

Even more importantly though, our mission is education, and our
goal is the promotion and protection of the traditional family.
Our message is profoundly conservative, but we believe that this
message is both the heritage and the hope of all Americans.  FRC
is in a unique position to bridge the purely partisan conflicts
of our time and to offer a vision of enduring values that any
person of goodwill can embrace.

<p>

But even though I can't tell you whom to vote for, I can talk
to you candidly about issues that I know concern you deeply.
(Our role is to keep pro-family issues at center stage.)  What
has this still-young election year already told us about what's
on the hearts of the American people?

<p>

The answer, I believe, is both worrisome and uplifting.  The
worrisome side is simple.  Voter turnout has been mixed -- lower 
than expected in Iowa, near-record levels in New Hampshire.
Last November, Family Research Council conducted a nationwide
poll which confirmed the fact that a large majority of Americans
believe this nation is on the wrong track, and that the primary
reason for the decline is moral decay.  If Americans are dispirited
about the future and stay away from the polls, the problems we
face will be even more difficult to solve.

<p>

The uplifting part of the answer is that many Americans aren't
dispirited, and they are exercising their rights of citizenship in search 
of change. To better understand what those voters are saying, first we 
must understand what the politicians are saying.  Let's start with
President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address on January 23.

<p>

Remember what was going on back in 1992?  For much of that year,
&quot;family values&quot; took it on the chin from the major media.
Vice President Dan Quayle took aim at Murphy Brown, the fictional
TV heroine, over her deliberate decision to conceive a child out
of wedlock.   Quayle endured a hail of scorn, from Hollywood to
the halls of Congress.  The Vice President was charged with everything
from making too much of a TV show to trying to &quot;divide the
nation.&quot;  All of this happened merely because he suggested
that America's culture shouldn't encourage family break-up and
promiscuity.

<p>

But the attack on family values didn't stop there.  After the
1992 presidential election, pundits both inside and outside the
GOP made &quot;family values&quot; the scapegoat for the defeat
of President George Bush.  The GOP platform, with its clear statements
on abortion and homosexuality, was the cause, these writers said,
of the first Democratic presidential victory in 16 years.  This
analysis was ludicrous, but it became the accepted wisdom.  George
Bush lost for a number of reasons, including running a poorly
strategized campaign and breaking his promise of &quot;no new taxes.&quot;

<p>

Now lets flash forward.  Before a crowded House chamber and a
national television office just five weeks ago, Bill Clinton made
a speech that had cultural values as its primary theme.  He talked
with feeling about welfare reform, getting tough on drugs, reducing
teen pregnancy, and jawboning Hollywood directors into taming
violence on television.  This time, the pundits were silent. 
The next day, The <i>New York Times</i> merely noted that 
Clinton's &quot;values talk&quot; had wide public support.

<p>

In this atmosphere, the Republican presidential race has likewise
gone forward with a sharpened focus on family issues -- and those
issues seem to be boosting the candidates who express them most clearly. 
The sanctity of human life is a major example. Much of official 
Washington believes that abortion and euthanasia are just the kind of 
&quot;divisive&quot; issues that doom politicians to the margins
of public life.  But advocates of the right to life have played a 
major role in the primaries to date. Liberal pundits overlook the 
fact that the two most ardent champions of legal abortion in the 
race -- Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Gov. Pete Wilson of 
California -- dropped out months ago for lack of public support.

<p>

Defending the right to life is one way to stand up for &quot;the
little guy.&quot;  A similar sentiment may be driving the voter
response to candidates who speak to the average family's economic 
insecurity.   The families who read my letters regularly understand 
this insecurity very well.  Their tax burden has soared in the past
generation.  In many cases, economic pressures have forced both
Mom and Dad to work.  Too many families are living from paycheck
to paycheck.  If the economy turns down or wages continue to stagnate,
what will these families do?

<p>

On top of this is the indifference of so many in government -- and
others on Wall Street who seem to think globally while ignoring
things that matter here at home.  Americans sense that the strong
ties of loyalty and community which have always bound us together
are fraying.  Major companies close factories here and open new
ones overseas, where labor costs are drastically lower.  American
workers who have lost their jobs are told by some conservative
leaders that what's happened to them is just a &quot;structural
adjustment.&quot;  &quot;Don't worry,&quot; they're advised, the
U.S. economy will be the healthier for it 10 years down the road.
I can still vividly remember my own father, sitting at our kitchen
table in despair after he lost his job.  Every family worries
whether such a scene will be played out in their own kitchen.
Some leading liberals counter that the answer to the problem
is retraining, or &quot;lifelong learning,&quot; a response that
seems a little glib to working men and women worried about mouths
to feed today and tomorrow.

<p>

Underlying all of this is a sense that something has changed
in America.  America's families have shouldered the burdens of
World War II, Vietnam and the Cold War.  They have borne each
cross bravely, run the race, and won the crown -- but still their
government will not let up and allow them to keep a little more
of what they earn.  America's families built the world's greatest
peacetime economy, shared their resources to rebuild post war
Europe, even assisted Japan in making the transition to a modern
industrial democracy.  They have founded global institutions to
keep the peace, and risked nuclear holocaust to resist the nightmare
of communism.  For all their pains, they have been rewarded with
political leaders in both parties who tell them they are selfish
because they want to keep American jobs on American soil.

<p>

&quot;You must be patient,&quot; these leaders say -- all the while
committing vast amounts of our hard-earned tax money to programs
that do not work, to bureaucrats who delight in interfering with the 
religious rights of the people, to artworks that scorn the values of
the people who foot the bills, and to lavish retirement programs
for a class of permanent legislators who have abandoned the ideals
of Madison and Jefferson.

<p>

Today, barely 10 weeks into this election year, the voices of
the forgotten Americans are being heard.  On issue after issue -- tax
reform, parental choice in education, control of illegal immigration,
campaign finance reform, term limits, support for the institution
of marriage, sanctity of life -- voters are gravitating toward candidates
who are saying that <b>values do matter</b> and that power and resources
must begin flowing away from Washington and back toward families
and local communities.

<p>

That same message was at the core of the 1994 congressional elections.
It may be one reason why a record number of longtime incumbents
are retiring from the House and Senate this year.  It's rare that
anyone in Washington voluntarily gives up the reins of power.
But in one sense, that is what is being asked of every politician
in the nation's capital.

<p>

Our welfare system is destroying families? Then return power
to the states to innovate and enlist more aid from private charities
to combat poverty.  Academic achievement continues to decline?
Then return authority and resources to local school districts.
Economic growth is faltering?  Then lift the burden of tax and
regulation that is stifling entrepreneurs.

<p>

It's no accident that these are the concerns defining political
trends in this election year. They are the same concerns that fill the 
letters I receive every day from friends of FRC. 
What ties so many of these issues together is concern for our children's 
future.  We inherited a nation that was free. We were a nation where a 
man's word was his bond.  We were a nation where a person trying to start 
a business was hailed as a pioneer, not hauled before a dozen permit boards 
like a suspected criminal.  We were a nation where parents could let their 
children spend an afternoon watching a double feature at the local theater
without fearing they would be saturated with sex and violence
on the screen.  We were a nation where the &quot;village&quot;
did, to borrow Hillary Clinton's word, help raise children, but
always with respect for parental authority.

<p>

That nation had its deep flaws -- racial prejudice, for one.  But
to that problem we have now added others.  We have kept the bathwater 
and (all too literally!) thrown out the baby.

<p>

FRC believes that the national public policy debate is too important
for families to sit on the sidelines.  We will continue to put
ideas and research on the table that will chase the ghosts of
relativism from our public life.  We will continue to insist that
some values are good for families, while others are bad. We will continue 
to fight for the causes that endure:  respect for every human life, the
honorable bonds of husband and wife, the virtue of sexual restraint,
the daily love that only a parent can lavish on a child.

<p>

These are the themes that guide FRC.  I wish I had enough space here 
to tell you of all the activities in which our government relations and 
policy staff are now engaged.  Be sure to read the latest <i>Washington 
Watch</i> for all the details -- weekly updates are available
from our legislative hotline at 202-783-HOME.  And don't forget
to consult the enclosed reply card for information on the latest FRC 
resources.

<p>

Thank you for your prayers, your encouragement and your financial
support.  Your partnership with us is essential to our success.
Slowly but surely, this great nation is awakening to the dream
of restoring its families and communities.  God bless you for
all you're doing to help turn this dream into a reality.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  Our hope that millions of Americans will learn more about
the pro-family agenda is coming true.  The response to my book,
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, has been excellent, but the best
news is that we are reaching a wide secular audience as well.
Two major book chains, Walden Books and B. Dalton, are now carrying
it!  I've just received word that <i>Publisher's Weekly</i>, one
of the major resources that booksellers and librarians use to
determine what books they will acquire, will carry a review of
the book.  Thank you for your prayers and for all you're doing
to help get this resource in the hands of people who are considering
and embracing our issues! Let's keep the momentum going!

<title>Gary Bauer's August, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

August 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
he giveth strength. Even the youths shall faint, and be weary; and 
the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord 
shall renew their strength; they shall mount with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not 
faint.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

<i>- Isaiah 40:29-31</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

While watching the Olympic games last month, I couldn't help
but recall these poignant words from the prophet Isaiah.  These
verses play a pivotal role in the classic film <I>Chariots of
Fire,</I> the true story of Scottsman, Eric Liddell, an Olympic
runner.  Liddell recites this passage from Scripture at a church
service held on a day he was supposed to run a race in the Paris
Games. <I>Chariots of Fire</I> tells how Liddell, a dedicated
Christian, refused to run on the Sabbath, standing by his personal
conviction in the face of intense pressure from the future King
of England and others.

<p>

Even though my athletic ability won't get me into the Olympics,
I must tell you that these hectic summer months have all of us
at Family Research Council (FRC) running hard.  Time and again,
we are led back to God's promise that He will renew our strength,
that he will enable us to effectively run the race and that His
strength will never fail.  FRC's staff has truly been pressed
to the limit in recent days, and just like Olympic athletes, we
have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Let me share with you, some of the many hills and hurdles FRC
has encountered.

<p>

This month, the major events requiring our attention are the
conventions of national political parties.  The Republicans met
first in San Diego, followed by the National Taxpayer's Party,
Ross Perot's Reform Party, and finally the Democrats.  The Libertarian
Party has already nominated its presidential candidate.  As a
non-partisan organization, FRC continues to focus its energies
on providing each of these parties with a detailed agenda for
families. As I reported to you last month, FRC has advocated
the pro-family agenda in a wide variety of public forums and we
will continue to do so regardless of  the response we receive
from party leaders and the media elite.

<p>

As you read this, chances are I'll be returning to Washington
after having taken the pro-family message to the GOP Convention
in San Diego.  We have urged each of the nation's political parties
to make America's families a priority.  We want Democrats, Republicans,
and the smaller &quot;third parties&quot; alike, to see &quot;family&quot;
<b><i>not</i></b> in terms of election cycles, but in terms of daily
responsibilities and everyday needs.  We have urged them all to
adopt platforms that strengthen marriage, recognize the sanctity
of human life, cut taxes for families, and to pay increased attention
to the cultural decay undermining our society.

<p>

In San Diego, I addressed a rally at Sea World designed to urge
the GOP to uphold its commitment to the sanctity of life, to lower
taxes on families and to work for economic opportunitiy and growth.
I made our case to convention delegates and to the national media,
who always crowd these events.  In the weeks before the conventions,
my schedule was crammed with appearances on network and cable
talk shows to discuss the issues at stake during this election
year.  Incredibly, FRC was cited more than 1,500 times in the
print media nationwide in June.  Needless to say,  FRC Press Secretary,
Kristi Hamrick and her quality staff are incredibly busy.

<p>

For my part, there was CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; to discuss
the GOP platform plank on abortion, an appearance on &quot;Crossfire&quot;
with former Gov. Carroll Campbell to discuss the presidential
campaign, another visit to the weekly commentary show, &quot;The
Capital Gang,&quot; an interview with Ollie North on his daily
radio show and numerous other media opportunities.

<p>

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, FRC has provided in-depth research
and related resource materials to lawmakers who are concerned
about the attack on traditional marriage. Our recent full page ad in
<I>USA Today</I>, which I described in my June letter, was just 
the opening move in our effort to inform citizens
about the potential impact of an expected court decision in Hawaii.
This decision would recognize same-sex marriages and potentially
impose similar recognition on other states.

<p>

To most Americans, I suspect, the reason that one man/one woman
marriage is so vital to the survival of our society almost goes
without saying.  But in these times, people need regular, convincing
reminders about the fundamentals.  That's why FRC recently hosted
a briefing on Capitol Hill, which gathered together a group of
distinguished scholars, physicians, and public policy experts
to discuss the far reaching implications of  &quot;same sex&quot;
marriage.  The briefing was carried live on C-Span, and was re-aired
several times during the next 24 hours.  As a result, millions
of Americans had the opportunity to join with legislators and
congressional aides to see and hear the powerful testimony that
was presented.

<p>

The arguments against homosexual marriage are convincing and
familiar -- so familiar, in fact, that many of us have forgotten
how to effectively articulate them.  FRC's briefing brought together
people like adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former homosexual
Anthony Falzarano (who now leads Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries
in Washington, D.C.), Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley
Arkes, psychiatrist and former Yale University Fellow, Jeffrey
Satinover, and FRC's own Bob Knight, each of whom drove home the
essential values that are at stake in this debate. <i>(To help
you understand and articulate the arguments, FRC has condensed
this briefing into an hour-long video -- see the enclosed
reply card for information on how to obtain a copy for your church
or action group.)</i>

<p>

One week after the briefing, I found myself in the thick
of things again as I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  Disappointingly,
most of the senators who attended are very liberal and they are
also in favor of allowing same-sex marriages.  Before I testified,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), a primary opponent of DOMA, used the
hearing to attack the bill.  His central point was that marriage
laws traditionally have been made by the states, and that DOMA
would violate the principle of &quot;federalism,&quot; which says
that Congress will not interfere with the powers of state government.
Unbelievable! Ted Kennedy, quoting &quot;states rights,&quot;
while he has been the major proponent of bigger and bigger government
here in Washington. Maybe cows really can fly!

<p>

Kennedy left before I testified, but as I was finishing my remarks
he returned to the hearing room, so I couldn't resist a jab.
&quot;Senator Kennedy,&quot; I said, &quot;this is the first
time in your career you've made such an outstanding defense of
federalism.&quot;  The usually somber hearing room broke into
raucous laughter, and the liberal senator from Massachusetts sank
back into his chair speechless.  The irony is, DOMA makes a powerful
statement in support of the right of each state to ignore the
radical judicial inventions of other states.  It's true federalism
all the way.

<p>

On the day after my testimony, the full House of Representatives
voted for DOMA 342-67.  This 5-1 margin of victory makes it clear
that DOMA <b><i>is</i></b> mainstream and that the aggressive ambitions
of the homosexual lobby <b><i>are not</i></b>.  In the coming days, FRC
will continue scrambling to help ensure that DOMA passes the Congress
without amendments and goes to the president for signature.  We
intend to do everything we can to send the Hawaii courts -- and liberal
judges everywhere -- a powerful message.

<p>

Here are several other fronts on which FRC has been fighting
for America's families:

<p><ul>

<li>FRC Director of Legal Policy, Cathleen Cleaver, has been in
the thick of the raging debates over computer pornography, cable
porn, and social issues from assisted suicide to religious liberty.
Cathleen played a key role in the recent adoption of the Communications
Decency Act, a bill passed by Congress earlier this year that
will help keep distributors of computer porn away from our children.
A federal court in Philadelphia struck down this law, but Cathleen
has begun work on FRC's legal brief to the Supreme Court, which
is likely to hear the case this fall.

<p>

FRC is also fighting for the right of citizens to offer sidewalk
counseling to women seeking abortions.  Cathleen prepared a brief
to the Supreme Court in the <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I>
case and she is working with other lawyers to prepare oral arguments
to be made before the Court. Two major assisted suicide cases
are also getting our attention.  Either one could lead to a landmark
Supreme Court ruling which would protect human life, or put millions
of elderly and handicapped Americans at risk.

<p>

Finally, Cathleen is taking her effective debating skills before
some very tough audiences, and more than holding her own.  This
summer she has debated cable porn with Elliott Mincberg of People
for the American Way. She also locked horns over computer porn
with the government relations director of America On-line (a
longtime lawyer for the porn industry.) The computer porn debate
was shown on C-Span to a national audience.

<p>

<li>Robert Maginnis, FRC Policy Analyst has continued to spearhead
our Military Readiness Project. Bob came to FRC from the U.S. Army,
following his retirement, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Together with Melissa Wells-Petry, the Armed Forces' acknowledged
expert on the policy banning service in the military by homosexuals,
Bob has guided FRC's work this summer on three major court cases
regarding the ban. One of these cases, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
may soon be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>

Bob has been working diligently on the drug issue as well, and
one glance at the trends will tell you how urgent this is.  In
the past three years, drug abuse has spiraled, especially -- and
most disturbingly -- among elementary school-age children using
gateway drugs like marijuana.  Bob recently attended a major
international drug conference in Sweden, and in early August he
met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar,
to lay out FRC's specific concerns.

<p>

<li>Then there's Marty Dannenfelser, FRC Director of Government
Relations, and his excellent staff who have worked long and hard
on the effort to override the Clinton veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban. A vote in Congress, on this issue, is expected
soon after Labor Day. Marty's experienced team also played a
major role in the passage of a new bill which creates a national
commission on gambling, working in conjunction with our friend,
Congressman Frank Wolf (R- Va.).

<p>

<li>FRC has also been blessed to have the talents of Bob Morrison
and Jennifer <i>A</i>. Marshall on education issues, Jennifer
<i>E</i>. Marshall (that middle initial is not a misprint -- the
mail-sorting staff at FRC has its hands full!) on welfare reform
and voluntarism, Ryan Dobson (Jim Dobson's son) on youth issues,
and Steve Knudsen, our new director of state and local affairs,
who helped put together our recent press conference with state
family policy councils to endorse laws barring same-sex marriage.

</ul><p>

These are just a few of the activities that have kept FRC moving
at a sprinter's pace this summer. I wish I could tell you more
about the work of each and every member of our dedicated staff
members in Washington, D.C. and in Holland, Michigan, where our
constituent services and information systems teams are located.
FRC's team is top-notch, and it includes you, our beloved supporters.
Working together, we can make a significant difference in the
future of our country... in the way our families, our children,
and our grandchildren will spend their lives.

<p>

Thank you for all you do to help keep FRC moving forward. Your
involvement in our work is essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. While we've been busy running the race, financial support
for our work has fallen into the typical summer doldrums.  Your
help would give FRC a special boost right now, so please consider
making a contribution if you possibly can. Again, thank you -- and
God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's October, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

October 16, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

<i>Last month, just before the Congress adjourned, the Senate held its 
historic debate on partial-birth abortion.  At the end of an incredible 
day on Capitol Hill, I sat down at 1:00 o'clock in the morning to write 
you this "eyewitness account"</i>:

<p>

It's nearly 1:00 o'clock in the morning as I write this month's letter to 
you. I have just finished an unbelievable 20-hour day in which my emotions 
have run the gamut from exhilaration to deep despair.  The focus of 
today's events was the vote in the United States Senate to overturn 
President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. We lost that 
vote, but in the process we may have taken a giant step toward stopping the 
ongoing tragedy of abortion on demand.  Let me share with you a few excerpts 
from the roller coaster ride I was on today as we spoke the truth about the 
sanctity of human life to the powerful elites here in Washington, D.C.

<p>

My day began on the <i>CBS Morning News</i>, where I debated Kate Michelman 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  As is 
usually the case, the morning talk shows only give us four or five minutes 
to present our views on an issue -- this morning was no exception.  I knew 
I had to have my arguments down pat, for there is little time to hesitate 
or reflect when you're sitting in a TV studio under a bank of hot 
lights.  I also knew a sharp debater like Michelman would be sure to 
quickly fill any time I didn't use.

<p>

I often feel frustrated after such a debate because I don't usually get 
enough time to fully express my views or because I don't think of the 
best way to articulate some arguments until the debate is over.  But 
this morning was a "home run."  The CBS anchorwoman was fair, and she 
gave me equal time.  I was able to establish for the millions of people 
watching that partial-birth abortions <i>do</i> occur thousands of times a 
year -- most of them for purely elective reasons rather than because of 
health problems of the mother or her baby.  Kate Michelman presented few 
relevant arguments and seemed unusually low-key.  It had to be tough for 
her to defend the position that it could ever be okay to abort a baby in the 
eighth or ninth month of pregnancy by stabbing it in the back of the head.

<p>

But there was no time to relish the debate victory. I was immediately 
rushed from the CBS studio to attend an extraordinary prayer breakfast 
on Capitol Hill.  Pro-life senators led by Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania 
hosted the gathering to pray that senators' hearts would be touched 
before they voted.  The solemn gathering in that small room included 
some of the real "stars" of the pro-family/pro-life movement -- proven 
crusaders like Chuck Colson and my good friend and colleague Jim Dobson 
of Focus on the Family. We took turns asking God for His wisdom and 
strength for the tough hours of lobbying ahead.  More importantly, we 
prayed that God would have mercy on our country as it slips further 
and further into the culture of death.

<p>

A few minutes after breakfast, the ecumenical group gathered again -- 
this time in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  There 
we participated in a press conference on the upcoming vote.  Fourteen 
pro-life leaders made individual statements before a bank of TV cameras 
and a forest of microphones.  The room was jammed from one wall to the 
other, and the hot TV lights glared down on us all.  We were expecting 
the usual hostility of the liberal Washington media.  But again, 
strangely, there were no real arguments -- no hardball questions. Only 
one reporter even asked a question, and I was given the opportunity to 
answer.  He asked whether I was satisfied with the attention Bob Dole 
had paid to the issue. My response was clear: I told the reporter 
that Bob Dole was not responsible for partial-birth abortions.  I said 
we were here because Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill passed overwhelmingly 
by the Congress to stop these horrible procedures.  I then urged Senator 
Dole in the remaining days of the campaign to emphasize the issue and to 
draw the stark comparison between himself and his opponent so the 
American people could clearly understand their choice.

<p>

After the press conference, we all fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole 
lawmakers.  We met Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania as he got off the 
Capitol subway, and, even though he is usually pro-abortion, we ultimately 
won his vote. A few minutes later, we encountered Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware, and he ended up voting with us too.  Unfortunately, other senators 
were harder to convince.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas refused to hear 
us out when we appealed to her in the Senate dining room.  She said she 
didn't even think the Senate should be discussing the issue.  My good 
friend Kay James, who is a black American, told Mrs. Kassebaum that she was 
glad that her attitude didn't prevail in our country when slavery was 
being debated over 100 years ago!

<p>

As we walked the halls of the Capitol, the abortion debate was raging on 
the floor of the Senate.  Good friends, senators like Dan Coats of Indiana, 
John Ashcroft of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, led the floor debate 
while a hushed gallery of visitors looked on.  The pro-abortion side was 
led by Barbara Boxer of California.

<p>

We sat in the Senate gallery together to watch the proceedings -- myself, 
Dr. Dobson, Kay, Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America, Anthony 
Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and a dozen other 
allies.  As I looked around, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on 
in the minds of tourists from all over America who had brought their 
children there with them.  They seemed subdued, almost shocked, as they 
heard senators describe this terrible procedure.  At one emotional moment, 
one pro-life senator pointed to a picture of a baby and shouted in 
exasperation, "This is not an appendix; this is not a lump of tissue; this 
is a baby!"  Here's what happened next as reported by <i>The Washington 
Post</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of 
those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its 
rich wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a 
baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.

<p>

No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one spoke at all.</i>

</blockquote><p>

No one knows whose baby it was that brought the Senate to silence that day, 
but I can't help but believe that God chose that moment for this child to 
cry and, by so doing, to remind the Senate that "choice" in this case means 
the death of <b>real</b> human beings.

<p>

Soon the voting began.  As I am sure you know by now, our efforts helped 
win a clear majority, but we still fell short of the 66 votes needed to 
overturn Clinton's veto.  It was a tragic day, but even in the midst of 
our disappointment and heartbreak, there were some encouraging developments. 
I am convinced that something is stirring among God's people.  The 
cooperation of a large number of religious leaders from different 
denominations and from all parts of the country was unprecedented.  I'm 
convinced, too, that a new level of coalition building has been achieved 
and that the groundwork has been laid for better communication and 
cooperation in the future.

<p>

As the day wore on, my message was the same in every press interview. I 
told reporter after reporter that America is better than the vote that just 
took place.  I also told them that our nation was founded as a "shining 
city on a hill", that we are a unique experiment in liberty under God 
with rights and responsibilities that come only from Him. And this vote 
to allow the outright killing of nearly-born children through the promotion 
of abortion-on-demand sticks in our throats.  It will never go down easy 
with Americans because it violates every tenet of our founding.  Our 
conscience will not rest easy as long as we continue to allow the sacrifice 
of these children.

<p>

More than ever, I believe our beloved nation is at a crossroads, with the 
question Lincoln posed at Gettysburg still before us. As he stood on 
hallowed ground, he said we were conceived in liberty and asked whether 
"this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure?"

<p>

This is the great question facing our nation as we go into the next century. 
How we resolve the issues of life, family and marriage will determine whether 
America during the next century can still be that "shining city on a hill".

<p>

Even though the hour is late for our country, we must never cease our efforts 
to protect our spiritual heritage.  As God told Solomon, "if my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive 
their sin and will heal their land." (II Chronicles 7:14 NIV) We must 
redouble our prayers seeking God's mercy as the elites of our nation look 
farther away from Him. I want you to know that my staff and I are committed 
to do everything in our power to defend the values that have made our 
country great.

<p>

The Family Research Council is here to represent and serve you.  But I have 
to be honest. In recent weeks we haven't been hearing from enough of you. 
We need your encouragement, and your prayers, and we need to know if you 
stand with us in the battle for family, faith and freedom.  We also pray 
that, if you are able, you will choose to help FRC financially, <b>after</b> 
you have met the needs of your family and your church.

<p>

In closing, it's my prayer that God will richly bless you and your family. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. FRC is preparing a special analysis of the upcoming elections 
focusing on how the results will impact you and your family.  To receive

you and may God bless America.

<title>Gary Bauer's November, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

November 6, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

I know that your first reaction to yesterday's election returns 
is to be disheartened. I found myself recalling the words of Thomas 
Jefferson, who suggested that we should tremble for our country as 
we consider that God is just.

<p>

But, my friends, as people of faith devoted to the family, there must 
be no room in our hearts for demoralization.  It is not just that 
there were many bright spots on Election Day, including the 
strengthening of pro-family forces in Congress.  No, it's the fact 
that we are obliged in conscience to carry on our fight for the family, 
no matter what one day's election returns suggest. The worst thing we 
could do now is to retreat from the public square.  Instead we must 
advance the pro-family banner boldly and without shame.  I have hope 
for the future -- because the truth is on our side, 
the lessons of history are on our side, and, I believe, the will of 
the people is on our side.

<p>

I am not naive.  In the coming year, the principles that unite us -- 
traditional values, the sanctity of human life, smaller government, 
and lower taxes -- will be under political and cultural attack as 
never before. Regarding these threats, I can speak only for me and my 
"house" at the Family Research Council: "We will redouble our efforts to 
speak for your values and to bring the truth to the American people."

<p>

With that in mind, as election day approached, my staff and I put 
together a six-point plan of action.  Today, as the final vote is 
still being tallied we begin to implement this plan, with you at our side.

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family Americans have been too passive -- not <i>too active</i>! -- 
in their approach to public life.  Too often we've waited for our party system 
to produce for us candidates who will subscribe to some portion of our 
world view, candidates who, by design and default, always seem to fail 
us at the finish line.  The truth is, our movement should be producing 
and promoting leaders of its own.  I want you to know that achieving 
this goal is at the top of my personal priorities for the coming year. 
In my capacity as a private citizen, I will be organizing a political 
action committee, which I believe you'll be hearing a lot about in 
the near future.

<p>

<li>Each month 250,000 American homes receive our monthly publication, 
<i>Washington Watch</i>.  With your help, <b>FRC will double the 
circulation of this publication within the next 12 months</b>. Early 
next year <b>FRC will unveil a new and expanded version of <i>Watch</i></b>. 
We must make it our goal <b>to reach every American home in which 
there still burns a spark of love for this land Lincoln called 
"the last, best hope of Earth."</b>

<p>

<li>FRC will launch a youth leadership program here in Washington, 
D.C.  If the family is to survive (my friends, it <i>will</i> survive), 
if religious values are not to be completely routed from the public 
square (my friends, they <i>will</i> not), <b>we must act now to foster a 
new generation of leaders with a profoundly Christian world view.</b> The 
darker this night of cultural amorality becomes, the more youthful 
flames we must light that will kindle hope for our country.

<p>

<li>Our very self-government is at stake when the acts of duly elected 
legislatures, or of the people themselves, to restrict abortion, protect 
parental rights, and safeguard the institution of marriage are trampled 
by our runaway judges.  Judicial tyranny must end.  I pledge to you 
today <b>a sweeping campaign to check and balance our out-of-control 
courts.</b> We must become again a people who insist that <b>no one govern 
us without our consent.</b>

<p>

<li>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  How many of our 
government's destructive schemes would be possible if it did not 
seize nearly 45 cents of every dollar that hardworking families 
earn? There will be no freedom without tax freedom. <b>Today I am 
launching, in partnership with key economic conservative organizations, 
a massive push for across-the-board tax relief.</b> We will begin with 
tax credits for families with children and end the double taxation 
that occurs when government taxes the estates our families have 
shored up over a lifetime of sweat and sacrifice. <b>Our families 
built this capital; the meddling Washington establishment must be 
stopped from hauling it away.</b>

<p>

<li>Early in the new year, FRC will convene a summit of leaders of 
major pro-family groups and religious leaders who share our profound 
concern for the cultural decay now gripping the Western world. We will 
pool ideas and, where possible, resources to provide an effective 
counter to the forces of cultural disintegration.  Our response will be 
as global as the threat we face.  In the coming months and years, it is 
imperative that pro-family groups work together. <b>I pledge my total 
effort to help achieve this goal.</b>

</ul><p>

One final word. I do not view these steps as an ambitious plan. This 
is the <b>minimum</b> we must do to give this generation, and the next 
generation, of American families a fighting chance.  I cannot promise 
you we will succeed at everything we do, but I can promise you that we 
will try as never before. FRC has been positioned -- I pray by 
God's grace -- in the nation's capital to be here for the family at 
such a time as this.

<p>

In the coming days, please consider this plan and let me know if I have 
your support.  Your prayers and encouragement mean so much, and your 
financial support is FRC's very lifeblood.  I know that you are counting 
on the Family Research Council.  We will do everything we can to be worthy 
of the trust you place in us. God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<title>Gary Bauer's May, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

May 15, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

You probably read about the incredible speech Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia delivered at a prayer breakfast in early April at 
the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. Scalia delivered 
a stirring defense of the role of Christians in public life. The 
reaction was a prolonged standing ovation. But there was no ovation 
for the speech inside the Washington Beltway, where FRC fights 
every day on behalf of your family, or among America's cultural 
elite.

<p>

&quot;Justice Scalia: Defender of the Faith,&quot; sneered the
headline in the <I>International Herald Tribune.</I>[1]

<p>

The speech &quot;clearly undermines public confidence in [Scalia's]
objectivity regarding religious controversies,&quot;[2] said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

<p>

&quot;This is a disturbing view for a Justice to have,&quot;[3] said
Elliott Mincberg, legal director of Norman Lear's group, People for
the American Way.

<p>

The speech should have set off &quot;alarm bells,&quot;[4] charged
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover.

<p>

In a few pockets of liberalism outside the beltway the reaction
was even harsher:

<p>

Humor columnist Art Buchwald fired away: &quot;When a Justice
is hearing a case, no secular person can feel comfortable with
a member of the court who is thinking, 'If this lawyer doesn't
believe in the &quot;burning bush,&quot; he has a serious constitutional
problem.'&quot;[5]

<p>

<I>Des Moines Register</I> writer Donald Kaul, suggested that
Scalia &quot;occupies the outermost reaches of the right of the
court (some days you can only reach him by dogsled).&quot;[6]

<p>

What words could have possibly sparked such -- there's no other word
but <I>scornful</I> -- reactions from so many elements of the working
press? Scalia spoke to the crowd of 650 fellow Americans about the 
difficulty of upholding Christian beliefs, especially a belief in miracles,
in our increasingly secular society. He pointed out that the word
&quot;cretin,&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; is derived from the French
word for &quot;Christian,&quot; and added:

<p><blockquote>

<i>To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians taken
by modern society. Surely those who adhere to all or most of these 
traditional Christian beliefs are to be regarded as simple-minded.</i>[7]

<p>

The &quot;worldly wise,&quot; he went on:

<p>

<i>just will not have anything to do with miracles . . . [they
assume] that everything from Easter morning to the Ascension had to 
be made up by the groveling enthusiasts</i> (the disciples - ed.) 
<i>as part of their plan to get themselves martyred.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

In the midst of this cynicism, he concluded, &quot;We must pray
to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.&quot;[9] Justice 
Scalia's prayers came not a moment too soon. Those
who immediately attacked the speech, calling it contrary
to American tradition and inconsistent with his role as a judge,
seemed blissfully unaware that they were only confirming the truth
of what he said.

<p>

One professor of constitutional law at American University in
Washington, D.C., blasted the speech and remarked, &quot;We expect
our Supreme Court justices to be the most secular of our public
servants.&quot;[10] <b><i>We</i></b>? Where in our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution is it written that
judges must be less endowed with a sense of religious conviction
than other officials? The professor could only have been speaking
for that group of Americans who agree with <I>his</I> own expectation.
Most Americans <i>still</i> believe that every citizen, regardless
of their religious belief, is equal before the law. It is that
very equality -- the right of Christians to bring their full convictions
into the public square -- that Justice Scalia, and we at FRC, believe is 
under attack.

<p>

Don't let me leave the impression here that Scalia was without
defenders. Among them was syndicated newspaper columnist Cal Thomas,
who eloquently reminded readers that it was a rather
well-known &quot;public servant,&quot; Abraham Lincoln, who said,
&quot;But for this Book [the Bible], we would not know right from
wrong.&quot;[11]

<p>

Is there a difference between Presidents and Supreme Court Justices
in this regard? Our history and tradition say otherwise. The
Supreme Court begins each day of oral argument with the bailiff
stating, &quot;God save this honorable court.&quot; As you enter
the Supreme Court building, there is, on the right side of
the portico, a statue of Moses holding aloft the tablet of the
Ten Commandments.

<p>

The critics say, &quot;Those are mere symbols, devoid of meaning.&quot;
They believe that Scalia crossed a line that Justices must never 
cross -- expressing his religious faith. But once again, they 
don't know our history! Justices of our Supreme Court have time 
and again pronounced themselves about religious faith in general 
and Christianity in particular.

<p>

John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said in 1777:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers,
and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and the interest, of a 
Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

Imagine any public official saying something similar today! No
Christian leader or politician would echo Jay's observation today,
but the point is, such beliefs were not extraordinary among the
men and women who founded this nation. Daniel Webster is esteemed
as one of the five greatest senators in U.S. history, by resolution
of the Senate.[13] At the bicentennial of the Pilgrims' landing at
Plymouth Rock in 1620, Webster's keynote address included these
words:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Our ancestors established their system of government on morality
and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be 
trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any 
government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Whatever 
makes men Christians, makes them good citizens.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

In July 1835, when Chief Justice John Marshall died, the Liberty
Bell was rung, sustaining the crack that is one of the keys to
its fame.[15] Are American traditions affronted by the fact that the
Liberty Bell, one of a handful of supposedly secular American
&quot;shrines,&quot; bears the words of Leviticus 25:10: &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof&quot;?
In 1852, Justice John McLean wrote a letter asserting that &quot;Aside
from Revelation, darkness rests upon the world and upon the future.
The Bible has shed a glorious light upon the world.&quot;[16]

<p>

To all of these examples, dozens more could be added, from
Lincoln to McKinley to Coolidge, to TR and FDR, to John F. Kennedy,
to Jimmy Carter, to Ronald Reagan. Candid assertions of the importance
of religious beliefs to democratic institutions transcend partisan
divisions. It was Justice William O. Douglas, perhaps the Supreme
Court's leading liberal for nearly four decades, who wrote
that, &quot;We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;[17]

<p>

In short, what Justice Scalia said is in keeping with
a long line of statements by American jurists and statesmen. But
what about the substance of what he said? Do Christians face any
special level of scorn in modern society? Sadly, I believe they
do. Among the Beltway publications, the liberal <I>Washington Post</I>
published the most hostile appraisal of Scalia's speech. Of course, 
just a few years ago, they printed a front-page story suggesting 
that Christian voters are &quot;poor, uneducated and easily led.&quot;

<p>

Just a few weeks ago, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> printed a cartoon
showing a crucified Bob Dole. A crown of thorns was depicted lacing
his head, with the crown composed of letters spelling out, &quot;Christian
Coalition.&quot;[18] That same paper, on Easter Sunday, refused to
print the regular Johnny Hart comic strip called &quot;B.C.&quot;
because it referred positively to the Resurrection of Christ.
&quot;B.C.&quot; was out, and PC, political correctness, was in!

<p>

Perhaps the real scourges in our society today are reserved for
sincere religious believers <I>of any kind</I>. Consider what
happened to Marian P. MacDonald and Teen Challenge. Marian spent
32 years building an outstanding record as a public school teacher
in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was forced to resign her post
last month under pressure from the school system. The reason?
She invited members of Teen Challenge to one of her health and
physical education classes. Teen Challenge is an extremely effective
drug rehabilitation organization that incorporates religious principles
in its program.

<p>

The visiting teens told MacDonald's class they believed God had
helped them overcome drug abuse, but added, &quot;We are not here
to push our religion off on anybody.&quot; Apparently, that disclaimer
was not enough. The school principal sent a note home to parents
apologizing for the teens' &quot;insensitive comments.&quot; An
investigation followed, and MacDonald was essentially fired.[19] 
Stories like this are all too common.

<p>

I believe that Justice Scalia, whose sense of fairness and level
of scholarship are without match in the federal judiciary, has paid
religion the high compliment of taking it seriously. As I reported
to you last month, Christian convictions <I>are</I> cause for
persecution in many lands around the globe. Bigotry against
Christians in American, by comparison, seems mild; but that bigotry
is real nonetheless. Moreover, the aggressive, secularizing forces
in our nation today are committed to keeping you and me out of 
government, law, and the public debate on all the great issues.

<p>

True religious tolerance <i>is</i> the American way. But Justice
Scalia's critics would have you believe that the sanctity of human
life, traditional marriage, equal access of religious speakers
to the public square, and dozens of other ideas are merely a religious
creed and not the common code of civilization. In a healthy society,
Scalia's articulation of his private thoughts in the setting of
a private prayer breakfast would not have been news. That
they are news at all tells us a great deal about the crisis facing
America today.

<p>

I can assure you that, with your help, the Family Research Council
will continue to speak calmly, but passionately, in behalf of
moral values and true religious liberty. We hold with Daniel Webster
that good Christianity and good citizenship go hand in hand. And
we invite all Americans of goodwill to join with us in honoring
and preserving the values of family, faith and freedom.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. We'd love to hear from you this month. Many of you are already
aware of the &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; included
in my book <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> The Compact is designed
to renew the spirit of cooperation among our citizens. Its final
provision states, &quot;In our personal lives, we promise to honor
the Creator, who made us and endowed us with such unalienable
rights as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will
practice our faith on a daily basis and will gather with others
to worship regularly. Without resorting to coercion or vilification,
we will encourage faith, and the fruits of faith, in others.&quot;

<p>

Just check the enclosed reply card if you would like a free copy
of the Compact, suitable for framing. Thank you for your support
of our efforts on behalf of America's families and for reading
my letter this month. God bless you.

<TITLE> Charles A. Donovan Article</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3> Written Testimony of Charles A. Donovan,<BR>
Senior Policy Adviser<BR>
Submitted on May 2, 1995 to the<BR>
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,<BR>
Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Chairman</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
MADAM CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer the testimony of the Family Research Council on the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.  The Family Research Council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to analysis of the impact of public policy on the traditional family.  We place particular emphasis on the ways in which society can preserve and strengthen the two-parent family, and maximize the benefits that stable, intact family structure can confer on this nation's economic vitality, social well-being and spiritual strength.
<P>
     We believe that the position of Surgeon General of the United States now, more than ever, requires an individual who understands these dimensions of public policy.  Evolu- tion of the office of Surgeon General in the past two decades has diminished its direct policy-making and admini- strative role.  Evolution of the nature of many of the public health threats facing this nation today has magnified the importance of the Surgeon General's office in articulat-ing the essentials of healthy behavior.  The intersection of individual health and moral responsibility has never been more obvious.
<P>
     For this reason, it is critical that the office of Surgeon General be occupied by a person who has worked comfortably within that intersection.  That person must possess a clear, and consistently expressed, vision of public health.  He or she must be alive to the profound ethical dimensions of health issues in the late 20th century, and have a proven track record of responding cor-rectly to issues as they arise, not merely riding with the tide of public or professional opinion.  In short, he or she must be a leader, not a follower, intellectually and instinctively true to the highest standards of ethical behavior in medicine.  
<P>
     As a threshold matter, a Surgeon General must know and be able to articulate who he is and what he believes.  From the very beginning, when President Clinton announced his choice of Herny Foster on February 2, this nominee has been unable to articulate from one day to the next a consistent account even of his own career.  At every turn, members of this committee, of our own organization, and of the press have elicited from Dr. Foster and the administration new and revised accounts of various dimensions of his creed and his practice.  To this day, not one of these accounts fully squares with the other.  To this day, not one of these accounts amounts to a full disclosure by the nominee regard-ing his personal involvement in the most wrenching health policy questions of our time.
<P>
     The course of this nomination resembles a tent in spring rain.  Touch its soggy canvas anywhere and more revelations seep through.  It is hard to imagine an individual who has been implicared in more major public health controversies than Dr. Foster.  From the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to involuntary sterilization of men-tally handicapped women, to the performance of abortions and advocacy of abortion on demand, to distribution of condoms and other birth control devices to children, to the school-based clinic debate, to involvement with radical sex education programs, Dr. Foster has been on the cutting edge -- and nearly always on its wrong side.
<P>
     As this testimony is written, it is impossible to say with assurance that he hasn't <B> always </B>been on the wrong side, because nothing of what is known about Dr. Foster's role in each of these controversies is the result of the nominee's frank and full disclosure.  Everything that is known about them is the result of examination of the nominee's record and repeated questioning of that record by others, our-selves included.  The Administration has been reluctant to take the first step to volunteer accurate information about any of the issues that have placed this nomination in jeopardy.
<P>
     Before discussing those issues in detail, I want to make one final point.  This nomination has not been, and is not being, "Borked."  No one has led an advertising campaign distorting the nominee's record, impugning his character, or implying dreaded, unnamed consequences for the nation if he takes office.  No one has scrolled through a list of his tastes in videos. The debate over this nomination is first and foremost about profoudnly important questions of public policy, and this nomination is in difficulty first and fore-most because the nominee himself has been unable to provide a consistent and accurate account of where he has stood and what he has done regarding these questions.  Even Robert Bork's most vociferous opponents will agree, I think, that he did not leave anyone in doubt about the authenticity of his beliefs.
<P>
     Doubt, on the other hand, is the essence of Dr. Foster's nomination.
<P>
<B> Biographical Omission</B>
<P>
     The difficulty with Dr. Foster's nomination began with the refusal of the White House to share with the public, and with this committee, his basic philosophy.  The biography of Dr. Foster released by the White House mentioned his chron-ological affiliations, but totally ignored his lifelong ties to Planned Parenthood.  That this would be the occasion for controversy can hardly be something the Administration would not recognize.  The <I> Chronicle of Philanthropy </I>has noted on several occasions that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is among the top 10 most frequently objected to "charities" in the United States.  The <I> Chronicle </I>has reported that no nonprofit in the United States is more commonly eschewed through "restricted" gifts to the nation's United Way agencies.
<P>
     The reasons are simple, and to express them is to belie the White House's claim that Dr. Foster is a "mainstream" nominee.  The nominee claims that he is committed to absti- nence as the primary approach to sex education.  Planned Parenthood has led the ideological and legal assault on abstinence education programs in the United States.  The nominee claims that he desires to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."  But he has served as a "Public Policy Advocate" for the Planned Parenthood Federation during a time when its national leadership had dedicated itself to opening 75 abortion clinics across the United States<I> merely to meet a numerical goal consonant with the 75th anniversary of its founding</I>.
<P>
     Dr. Foster has sought to portray himself as an advocate for the family, and for parent-child communication.  But during his time as an official of Planned Parenthood of Nashville, that organization filed suit against a Tennessee law requiring parental consent for abortion.  Far from being a strict statute, that law provided for a judicial bypass procedure by which teenagers could seek abortions under court auspices without parental involvement.  Such an arrangement was not liberal enough for Planned Parenthood, which has led the national legal fight to exclude parents from involvement with their minor children's abortion decisions.  Again, this is not a mainstream position -- Americans support parental consent for abortion by margins of 2-1 or 3-1.  Parents themselves show an even higher rate of support for such laws.
<P>
     It is possible that Dr. Foster was and is ignorant of these positions taken by organizations with whom he has been associated for nearly two decades.  But it is not likely. Ignorance is a valid defense in some circumstances, but it is not a valid credential for someone who seeks to become the "nation's doctor," and the leader of a national crusade against teenage pregnancy.
<P>
     The American people had a right to know of Dr. Foster's association with this organization and its ideas.  The White House had no right to omit it from the biographical informa-tion it provided the Congress and the nation.
<P>
<B> Tuskegee Institute</B>
<P>
     "Ignorance" is also the nominee's defense against the circumstantial evidence, and the direct testimony of one individual, Dr. Luther McRae, that, as Vice President of the Macon County Medical Society in 1969, Dr. Foster partic-ipated in a Public Health Service briefing on the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.  It is not in dispute that Dr, Foster spoke out against the experiments in 1972, when they were publicly revealed in media accounts.  It is pre-cisely that public expression of outrage that provoked the reaction of Dr. McRae, who has stated that he is willing to testify to this committee under oath that Dr. Foster was indeed present at the meeting on May 12, 1969 where PHS officials sought the "surrogate informed consent" of the MCMS for continuation of the Tuskegee Study.<P>
     McRae is categorical, and here is what he told Carl Ramsey of Family News in Focus:
<P>
<UL> The most striking thing about it, when
         the news broke . . . I saw on television
         and read in the papers that Dr. Foster 
         was involved in the public outrage about
         the study having been conducted.  And I
         was struck by that, in that I knew he was
         at the meeting . . . I asked myself why
         Henry didn't go ahead and say something at
         the meeting that night in 1969. Because he
         had every opportunity, nobody had a muzzle
         on him.i</UL><P>     McRae is also specific, recalling where Dr. Foster sat.  Moreover, he holds no animus against his colleague and believes -- in contrast to my view -- that he would make an excellent Surgeon General.  This fact lends added weight to his assertion regarding Dr. Foster's knowledge of the Tus-kegee experiment in 1969.
<P>
     Dr. McRae insists that Henry Foster did know about the existence of the experiment.  But it is equally important to recognize that he should have known, and that the May 12 meeting at a restaurant outside Tuskegee was not his only opportunity to inform himself about a PHS study that had been under way for nealry four decades.  First, the study had been described in the medical journals; as an obstetric-ical chief working in a county with one of the nation's highest rates of syphilis (indeed, this was one reason PHS originally chose Macon County as the site of the nontreat-ment study), at perhaps that county's most prominent ob-gy
center, Dr. Foster would have reason to be well read in the literature of venereal disease.
<P>
     Dr. McRae has noted, as does James Jones' account of the Tuskegee experiment, Bad Blood, that PHS officials supplied the Macon County Medical Society with a list of the individuals "participating" in the study, to assure that they would not obtain treatment, particularly antibiotics, by other means from local physicians.ii  Given the "zeal," as Jones puts it, with which PHS officials pursued the cooper- ation of Macon County physicians, it seems unlikely that distribution of this list to the Vice President of the Society's Vice President would be overlooked.<P>    Jones also points out that in 1970the PHS "also reestablished something of its former working relationship with medical personnel at John A. Andrew Hospital."  A representative of PHS, Dr. Joseph G. Caldwell, met with the hospital's administrator and medical director and contracted to have the surviving men's X-rays taken there in the hospital's new facility.  Again, it is possible that the presence of PHS officials, and the conduct of examinations of the syphilitic men, in the facility where he was chief of obstetrics would have entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Foster.  
<P>
     Assuming as much, however, it is hardly a flattering protrayal of Dr. Foster's engagement with public health issues when the most significant events of his time took place in his immediate vicinity, with the cooperation of the Medical Society of which he was Vice President, without his taking cognizance of them.  Such a lapse may not amount to much for a physician who simply desires to continue his work serving the general population; it is a fatal failure of responsibility in an individual who claims to have the ability to serve as the nation's top spokesman on public health.  Dr. Foster says that he did not know of the exper- iments.  The key is that nearly all his colleagues did, that at least one says that he himself did, and that, in any case, he should have known.
<P>
<B> Dr. Foster and Abortion</B>
<P>
     On the issue of abortion, Dr. Foster has taken the fifth.  That is to say, he has taken at least five posi- tions on the number of abortions he has performed or guided to completion.  He has misstated not merely his own involvement in abortion, but inaccurately described the guidelines on medical education under which, he claims, a study of prostaglandin suppositories was conducted during his tenure at Meharry Medical School.  Worse, he has used language in documents officially released by the Department of Health and Human Services that finesses the question of his involvement in abortion.  These finesses put his vera-city not merely in question, but in grave doubt.  
<P>
    Let me summmarize:<P>
<UL> <B> Late January.  </B>A White House official informs<BR>
      Chairman Kassebaum that Dr. Foster had per-<BR>
      formed one abortion during his medical career.<BR>
      ("Foster Says He Performed Abortions,"<I> The Wash-<BR>
      ington Post</I>, Feb. 4, 1995).
<P>
 <B> February 3, 1995.  </B>The Department of Health<BR>
       and Human Services releases a statement by<BR>
       Dr. Foster which states, " I believe that I<BR>
       performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy term-<BR>
       inations." (Statement by Dr. Henry Foster,<BR>
       Nominee for U.S. Surgeon General.)
<P>
 <B> February 6, 1995.  </B>The International Foundation<BR>
       for Genetic Research/Michael Fund releases a<BR>
       transcript, first disputed by the White House<BR>
       but then acknowledged to be genuine, in which<BR>
       Foster states, "I have done a lot of amniocen-<BR>
       tesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near<BR>
       700." (Department of Health, Education and Wel-<BR>
       fare, Office of the Secretary, Ethics Advisory<BR>
       Board, Meeting V, Friday, November 10, 1978<BR>
       Seattle, Washington, p. 180, 197).
<P>
       The Foundation also releases a story from the<BR>
       November 1980 <I> ObGyn News </I>describing an abortion-<BR>
       pill study conducted by Dr. Foster at Meharry on<BR>
       behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals that resulted in<BR>
        59 completed abortions on patients in the trial.     <BR>
<P>
 <B> February 8, 1995.  </B>Appearing on ABC's<I> Nightline</I>,<BR>
        Dr. Foster acknowledges performing 39 abortions, but<BR>
       notes that this does not include any abortions he<BR>
       may have performed before 1973.  Foster tells Kop-<BR>
       pel that this total also does not include the 59<BR>
       abortions carried out under the trial he super-<BR>
       vised, because he did not personally perform them.</UL>
 <P>
     Thus, in little more than a week, Dr. Foster deployed five different versions of his record regarding abortions.<P>
Volatility like this makes the Mexican peso look stable by comparison.  It prompted even the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Avis LaVelle, to remark, "The next time we utter a number [of Foster's abortions], it won't be based on Dr. Foster's recollec-tions."iii  But if you take a closer look at the February 3 statement released over his name, it appears amply crafted to disguise the information that was released on February 6 by the International Foundation for Genetic Research.<P>     As <I> The Washington Times </I>pointed out on February 7, Dr. Foster's artful February 3 statement offered circumlocu- tions regarding his term as chief of service at Tuskegee and Meharry.  Of the "wide variety of medical procedures and research" performed at both, "all," he wrote, "were in accordance with the law and educational requirements."iv  As the <I> Times </I>observed, "Abortion . . . has been legal for many years, and thus had Dr. Foster performed hundreds of abortions as chief of service - as opposed to acting in his capacity as a private physician - that fact would not have been actually lied about, given the statement's careful wording."
<P>
     The same can be said about the prostaglandin supposi- tory trial, which Dr. Foster was compelled to elaborate upon the following night in his exchange with Ted Koppel.  There he launched the "educational requirements" explanation, citing alleged accreditation requirements as the justifi- cation for seeking grant money to test the abortion suppos- itory for Upjohn.  There are two issues here.  One is the intended evasion by Dr. Foster of a full accounting of his abortion activity in his February 3 statement.  The second is his misunderstanding -- or possible evasion -- regarding the rationale for the prostaglandin trial.
<P>
     As chief of obstetrics at two major medical instituti- tions, Dr. Foster surely should have known that nothing in the then-extant accreditation guidelines from the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Education required any medical school to offer training in performing abortions, much less to conduct trials of experimental abortion drugs.  In relevant part, the guidelines state that:
<P>
<UL> Resident education [in obstetrics and<BR>
         gynecology] must include, but not neces-<BR>
         sarily be limited to the following:<BR>
<P>
         1. Obstetrics<BR>
         a. The full range of obstetrics, includ-<BR>
            ing high-risk obstetrics and medical<BR>
            and surgical complications of pregnancy.</UL>
<P>
     Arguably this standard could be interpreted as requiring training in the management of complications resulting from botched abortions, although the term "abor-tion" (or any euphemism for it) is nowhere mentioned in the standards.  Even under this reading of the standard, however, it would clearly be unethical for a program to arrange for a botched abortion to give the residents a training opportunity.  Conducting a trial of a new drug (one that never did reach the market) would just as clearly be an unethical way to fulfill such an obligation.
<P>
     But the bottom line is that no such obligation existed in the late 1970s when the trial was conducted, nor does one exist now, when Dr. Foster cites it as justification for Meharry's participation in the Phase 2 trial and uses it as a mask for a major abortion activity he obviously did not want disclosed.  It is only an added insult to common knowl- edge when Foster continues to cite this erroneous account of accreditation requirements to justify a project that was clearly taken on because of Dr. Foster's lifelong commitment to abortion.
<P>
     Finally, it should be pointed out that as of the date of this testimony, March 24, 1995, a complete accounting of Dr. Foster's activity on behalf of abortion is still not in the public record.  He has specifically excluded revelations regarding any abortions he may have performed prior to 1973, when he began his association with Meharry.  His basis for the exclusion is the unavailability of records prior to that date.  Given how well Dr. Foster's "recollections" have served him and the administration on other issues, it's just as well.
<P>
<B> Involuntary Sterilization</B>
<P>
     Dr. Foster's involvement in the possily involuntary sterilization of four mentally handicapped women is the only controversial issue in his background that was placed before the public by action of the White House.  Its discovery, however, was inevitable, as Dr. Foster himself described the prcedures in an article entitled "Removal of the Normal Uterus" in the <I> Southern Medical Journal </I>in 1976.v  Dr. Foster states in the article only that he had "begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.  Hysterectomy," he noted, "can be done <I>eithe</I>r [emphasis added] for sterilization or to eliminate the menses[.]"vi<P>     Whatever the presumed indication for the procedure, obviously hysterectomy eliminates both fertility and the menses.  This is important because hysterectomy carries significantly higher risks to the mother than the conven-tional means of sterilization (salpingectomy, i.e., removal of the Fallopian tubes).  As Stephen Trombley's valuable history of coercive sterilization makes clear, the United States in the early 1970s experienced a "sterilization explosion."vii  At least part of the impetus for the proce- dure (besides the desire of Planned Parenthood and other population control groups to promote permanent methods of sterilization, particularly on eugenic grounds) was the desire to provide medical students with the opportunity to perform hysterectomies.viii<P>
     This "sterilization explosion" did not go unnoticed or unopposed.  In fact, by 1973 the Health Research Group, affiliated with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, Inc. had pub-lished a major report on sterilization abuse.  The report documented the sudden rise in sterilization, particularly targeting the indigent, the uneducated and the young, and called for federal regulation, especially to ensure informed consent.
<P>
     This report provided the statistical and anecdotal basis for federal interest in sterilization reform, but as Trombley writes, the report attained its full effect "only after the problem of sterilization abuse was heightened by the personal tragedy of the Relf family."ix<P>     Interestingly, the Relf case took place in Alabama in 1973.  Once again a major public health controversy brewed virtually under Dr. Henry Foster's nose, without his being aware of it, and at a time when had begun to perform hyster- ectomies.  The Relf case deserves a brief synopsis.  A poor balck family living in Montgomery, the Relfs had three daughters, ages 12 to 16.  At the behest of the local family planning service, the three girls were injected with the contraceptive drug Depo-Provera.  In March 1973, the oldest girl, Katie was taken, without her parents' consent, to a family planning clinic, where an IUD was inserted over her objections.
<P>
     A series of events then brought the remaining two girls, along with their mother, to a local hospital, where the mother, unable to read or write, was induced to place an "X" on a document authorizing them, without hr knowledge, to be sterilized.  A subsequent effort by the family planning service to sterilize Katie failed.  
<P>
     That summer, the Relf case came to the attention of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who on July 10, 1973 invited the Relfs to his office.  By happenstance, Sen. Kennedy's committee was at that same time engaged in the hearings on health care and human experimentation spawned by the Tuskegee incident.  The Relfs proceeded to file suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, resulting in a judgment requiring the federal government to issue guidelines providing for the protection of minors from sterilization and for informed consent.
<P>
     Contemporaneous with <I> Relf </I>was the <I> Wyatt </I>case, in which a federal court declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that permitted the sterilization of mentally retarded inmates of state institutions.  Although compulsory steril-ization remained legal in many states during the 1970s, the issues raised by the Health Research Group and debated in the federal courts in Alabama had risen to national prominence two to three years before Dr. Foster's article appeared in<I> the Southern Medical Journal</I>.  Despite this fact, Foster's article makes no mention of these develop- ments, and betrays no awareness of any kind that, even in his own state, he was part of a rapidly dying consensus that such sterilizations as he had "begun" to perform were med- ically and morally unacceptable.
<P>
     As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote on February 17, the circumstances surrounding these surgical sterilizations (why higher-risk hysterectomies were performed, whether informed consent was obtained, and from whom) involve serious questions.  The apologia that Foster performed only four such sterilizations does not answer these questions; in fact, as Krauthammer notes, "It breyas an obvious discomfort with what Foster did.  It reinforces the sense that the moral climate of the 1970s was not nearly as alien as some pretend and that even in that ancient time surgically sterilizing the retarded was a morally troubling act."x<P>    I only note in passing that Dr. Foster's first account of abortions he performed was one.  Once again, Foster failed to notice a major public health controversy that sprang up largely as a result of incidents just down the road from the institutions he helped to lead.<P><B> I Have a Future</B><P>     The plausibility of Dr. Foster's commitment to abstinence as his first priority in educating young people about sexuality was discussed above.  One example should suffice.
<P>
     In 1987 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America distributed a report written for it by Marie Haviland-James, apparently affiliated with Michigan Planned parenthood.  The report was an ideological assault on "Sex Respect," one of the most venerable abstinence education programs in the United States.  The following account of the Haviland-James report appears in an analysis of sex education programs written and published in 1991:
<P>
<UL> The Haviland-James report provided guidance<BR>
       to Planned parenthood sex educators opposing<BR>
 <I> Sex Respect </I>and seeking its removal from the<BR>
       schools.  The memo urged opponents of <I> Sex <BR>
       Respect </I>to argue that it "violates the separa-<BR>
       tion of church and state" and risks litigation<BR>
       from the American Civil Liberties Union {whose<BR>
       late counsel, Harriet Pilpel, once represented<BR>
       both organizations].  It charged that the pro-<BR>
       gram is faulty because it contained "many refer-<BR>
       ences . . . to a 'spiritual' dimension of sex-<BR>
       uality; contained use of the word 'baby' for<BR>
       fetus"; expressed "bias . . . against people<BR>
       who are sexually active and unmarried"; "com-<BR>
       pared stealing of money continually with con-<BR>
       tinued sexual activity'; contained " a descrip-<BR>
       tion of a woman haunted by guilt"; omitted <BR>
       "pro-choice material"; and, of greatest inter-<BR>
       est, included "unsubstantiated claims" such as<BR>
       "abstinence has future benefits for teens" and<BR>
       "because of the special nature of human sexual-<BR>
       ity, there's no way to have premarital sex <BR>
       without hurting someone."  The memo concluded<BR>
       that <I> Sex Respect </I>"appeals . . . to the lowest <BR>
       common denominator of mentality."xi</UL><P>     Once again, the most chartible interpretation that can be put on Dr. Foster's involvement with an organization that takes this aggressive a stance against abstinence education is that he is wholly unaware of it.  Fortunately, there is more direct evidence of Dr. Foster's approach, which is at best "abstinence-plus," with the abstinence part thrust with embarrassment up his sleeve.
<P>
     The Family Research Council has obtained a copy of the eight-page brochure produced by Foster's "I Have a Future" program to introduce the program.  Over a couple of thousand of words of text, the word "abstinence", or its equivalents is not mentioned once.  The phrase, "delaying the initiation of sexual activity," common in all true abstinence materials, is not mentioned once.  On the other hand, the brochure repeatedly stresses the objective of the program to enhance "contraceptive availability," to address the problem of "poor" "contraceptive practices," and to promote "distribution of contraceptives."xii<P>     Efforts by the Council and the media to obtain a full copy of the "I Have a Future" curriculum have been rebuffed.xiii  If the currciulum is as its sponsors say it is, this reaction to public curioisity is itself curious.  In fact, one would expect that, upon his elevation to Surgeon General, Dr. Foster would proudly promote the "I Have a Future" curriculum as a model abstinence program.  His pride should be just as great before this committee votes.<P><B> Conclusion</B><P>    These are but a few of the issues that attend the nomination of Dr. Herny Foster.  Ther common link is that in 1995, the United States deserves to have in this position of authority an individual with a clear vision of the public health consequences of personal behavior, an abiding commit- ment to marriage and the family, an alertness to the ethical dimensions of today's contemporary controversies in medicine and public policy, an unblemished record of candor and truth-telling to the American people, and a concern for every mother and child.  
<P>
     Henry Foster has shown that he is not that person.

<title>Gary Bauer's September, 1996 Letter</title>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

September 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>Restoring parental rights to their original firm foundation
in U.S. constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to
reinvigorate the democratic ideal of citizenship.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

-- from <i><b>FRC's Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</b></i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

A few weeks ago Carol and I drove our oldest daughter, Elyse,
back to college for her second year of studies.  It was wonderful
to have her home for the summer, and saying good-bye was really
hard.  The summer months flew by, reminding us once more how precious
is the time that we have together as a family.  Even though Elyse
attends college only a few hours' drive from our home outside
Washington, D.C. -- close enough for us to see her on some weekends -- 
she's still much farther away than we would prefer.

<p>

Millions of families go through this emotional ritual each September,
and it doesn't really matter that much whether your child is heading
off to college, high school, or to a nearby elementary school
classroom.  Each fall mothers and fathers face the same anxieties
and pressures:  how will my children fare in school?  Will their
teachers recognize their special qualities?  Will teachers honor
and respect their talents and beliefs or will they try to convince
them to &quot;question authority&quot; and reject the values they
have been taught?  What about their classmates?  Will they make
friends?  Will those friends help uphold their faith?  Or will
their faith be weakened?  Or worse, will our children be lead
into trouble?  Is there anyone out there besides us who really
understands the worth of our beloved children?

<p>

Today, questions like these are being asked by every parent and
they unfortunately have a special sharpness to them.  Many of
our nation's schools are no longer the &quot;common ground&quot;
of shared values and aspirations that generations of families
counted on them to be in the past. All too often, today's classrooms
are laboratories for radical ideological experimentation. The
teaching profession has been politicized as never before. Textbooks
and lesson plans routinely foster a liberal world view. Attempts
to isolate, intimidate and confuse religiously inclined students
continue. Violence and illegal drugs are found even in elementary
schools. The &quot;safe sex&quot; philosophy still dominates
sex education.

<p>

I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics on educational decline,
so I won't repeat them here.  The public education establishment
routinely goes out of its way to question the depth of the problem,
but, in the same breath, rushes to endorse the latest reform plan,
a tacit admission that our schools are falling short.  Let me
be especially clear here:  many, if not most, of our teachers
are dedicated educators who are motivated by a love of learning
and of children.  Many, if not most, are disturbed by the same
education fads that distress parents.  Like parents, these teachers
are ill-served by education leaders who are constantly reinventing
the wheel and interfering with what works in real classrooms.

<p>

In fact, the education policy debate of the last few years has
been dominated by the <I>illusion</I> of reform. With every fiber
of their being, the leadership of the nation's massive teachers'
unions, the National Education Association (2.2 million members)
and the American Federation of Teachers (900,000), have opposed
nearly every change in the way our schools are financed and operated.

<p>

Bogus education reform schemes come and go.  Many of them have
impressive-sounding names and a stellar line-up of sponsors.
Desperate for signs of improvement that will give their children
hope, parents are sold various reform packages under such brand
names as Outcome-Based Education, Goals 2000, character education,
mandatory voluntarism, New American Schools and restructuring.
These schemes have different details, but they have at least
two omissions in common:  they leave the basic method of funding
public education untouched, and they leave parents at the margin
of education decision-making.

<p>

The Family Research Council (FRC) is keenly aware of the concerns
expressed by America's families about education, and we are dedicated
to reversing these omissions.  We want parents to control their
education dollars.  We believe that the same hands that rock the
cradle, smooth the fevered brow, set the table, and clothe the
child should direct the funds that educate the child.  The centerpiece
of our campaign for education reform is massive tax relief for
families with children, coupled with genuine parental choice policies
that enable parents to select the school their children will attend.

<p>

Today, more than ever before, I am optimistic about our chances
for success.  School choice plans are gaining momentum and making
headway.  A new study by Harvard's Paul Peterson and Jay P. Greene
at the University of Houston shows that the City of Milwaukee's
parental choice plan has resulted in real academic gains for the
children enrolled in the program.  In August, state courts in
Ohio upheld the constitutionality of a school choice program that
includes religious schools.  Tax credits for families with children
will now be a centerpiece of this year's election debate.

<p>

Most importantly, I'm encouraged that, in the true spirit of
America, parents are not waiting for politicians to respond to
their needs.  They are moving in pioneering numbers to options
like homeschooling, classical education and parent-based education,
which are not so much novelties as rediscoveries of the art of
family-centered teaching and learning.  At the center of all of
this is spiritual renewal, the faith that moves mountains.

<p>

With all of the forces at work in today's education debate, FRC
has developed the <I>Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</I>.
This 64-page booklet is packed with resources to help you through
the coming school year.  Between its covers you'll find:

<p><ul>

<li>A glossary of education jargon -- what do the fancy terms 
<I>really</I> mean?

<p>

<li>Feature articles on major topics like Outcome-Based Education,
the religious rights of students, and parental rights in today's
schools.

<p>

<li>Addresses and phone numbers of key resources for homeschooling
and classical education.

<p>

<li>A reference section containing everything from newsletter sources
to web sites dealing with education issues.

</ul><p>

Our <I>Survival Guide</I> is designed to put a wealth of helpful
information at your fingertips.  It's yours for a donation of
any amount -- please use the enclosed reply card to order your copy
today.

<p>

I had intended this letter to deal solely with education issues,
but drug abuse and educational failure feed off one another.
There is no way to dismiss the disturbing statistics: in the
war against teenage drug abuse, America is in full retreat. A
new federal survey shows that teen drug use has risen 105 percent
since 1992.  The sharp increases span every form of illegal drug.
Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent; cocaine
use, 166 percent (from 1994 to 1995 alone); marijuana, 105 percent.
One of every 10 teenagers has used an illegal drug in the past
month.

<p>

The tragedy here is that these numbers come after a decade of
progress.  By 1992, teen drug use had been driven to its lowest
point in decades.  The reason for that progress was and is easy
to understand. Our nation's policy was direct -- and repeated over
and over again in every forum where young people gather.  It said:
&quot;Drug abuse is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.&quot;  But
then, following a change in the Oval Office, we changed course.

<p>

The flow of anti-drug messages from our nation's capital dried
up.  The Clinton administration cut the office of National Drug
Control Policy some 83 percent.  MTV, and even the networks, began
to produce material that winked at the drug threat, or openly
declared the war on drugs a failure. Leaders in Congress turned
their attention to other issues. Treatment funds were reduced,
and &quot;civil libertarians&quot; ratcheted up their pressure
on highly effective social agencies like Teen Challenge that use
faith-based messages to help teenagers and young adults kick the
habit.

<p>

Let me say something here about the liberal versus conservative
debate about the treatment versus law enforcement approaches to
drug abuse.  In fact, let me say one word about it -- it is a 
<I>fallacy.</I> Both approaches are needed.  Drug abusers need treatment
if they are to re-enter society as productive citizens.  But the
truth is that even the best treatment programs are only partially
successful. Preventing the abuser from taking that first hit,
snort, or injection is crucial.

<p>

Who would propose that we eliminate hospital emergency rooms
to treat automobile accident victims?  No one, of course.  Then
again, who would argue that we eliminate speed limits, safety
belts, guard rails, and the like because, after all, we have emergency
rooms? But that's precisely what advocates of drug legalization
argue! Remember when then-Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested
that problems like crime would be reduced if America legalized
drug use, saying it was time to study this option and rely on
treatment rather than law enforcement?

<p>

Elders, thankfully, is gone, but the legacy of permissiveness
she represented is reflected in what is happening now to our youth.
Last month, my senior adviser for drug issues, retired Army Lieutenant
Colonel Bob Maginnis, met with General Barry McCaffrey, President
Clinton's drug czar.  Gen. McCaffrey is a dedicated man, but he
has his work cut out for him.  FRC offered the general our heartfelt
support and suggested various ways to recapture the initiative.
New efforts to control the flow of drugs through Mexico and out
of Colombia are especially needed.

<p>

Again, we must not settle for illusion.  Attempting to treat
an ever-rising wave of drug-abusing youth will destroy our economy
and bankrupt this nation -- and, worst of all, waste the potential
of thousands of our children. Attempting to reform education
without putting parents back at the center of school decision-making
is doomed to fail as well. As always, on both of these issues,
FRC will continue to fight for the home truths that really matter:
we will work with legislators, government officials -- anyone of
goodwill, regardless of party -- who recognizes the need to strengthen
our education system and to gird our children against the sex-and-drug
culture.

<p>

We would really like to hear from you this month.  Your financial
gifts to FRC provide the lifeblood that enables us to advance
the pro-family cause.  Your prayers and involvement are essential,
too.  The cards and letters we receive provide a tremendous lift
to me and the entire FRC staff.  Because the work we do is both
draining and difficult, being able to associate names and faces
with the cause we are advancing makes our efforts all the more
meaningful.

<p>

Once again, thank you for your faithfulness.  As we continue
to work together, we can move closer to our hope and dream of
family renewal in our beloved nation.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. As our <I>Survival Guide</I> illustrates, FRC is constantly
developing new materials that make the case for family values.
Let me close by mentioning another resource that you've helped
to make a household word: <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This
companion book to the family values debate of 1996 has now reached
a total distribution of nearly 400,000 copies.

<p>

I conceived <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> as a vision for a pro-family
future -- a book that would make the case for our cause to a cross-section
of the American public. Earlier this year, FRC took out paid
advertising posing a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
had just released her book, <I>It Takes a Village.</I> We asked
the American people to choose between the alternative visions
represented by these books.  I'm pleased to report that, thanks
to support like yours, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> has held its
own in this contest of visions.

<p>

Our original goal was to distribute 1,000,000 copies of <I>Our
Hopes, Our Dreams,</I> and to get them into the hands of people
who may not know just how much today's cultural clash over the
family means to them. If you can help us make one last push to
reach this goal and to spread the pro-family message, please take
this opportunity to do so. The enclosed card has all the information
you need.

Early in 1995, Miss Marshall joined the Family Research Council's 
public policy team to contribute her research skills and experience 
in the field of welfare. Her responsibilities as policy analyst 
include tracking, analyzing, and writing about proposed legislation 
on welfare reform. In addition, her analysis and research benefit 
FRC in educating key decision makers in the U.S. Congress and at the 
grass roots nation-wide.

<p>

Through her studies at Rice University, in various internships 
throughout her undergraduate experience, and most recently, at the 
American Enterprise Institute with Charles Murray, Marshall has 
developed a keen understanding of compassionate welfare reform and 
school choice as well as a familiarity with the U.S. Congress and 
the formulation of public policy. 

<p>

Miss Marshall began her career in Washington as an intern in the 
Office of Congressman Tom DeLay in the summer months of 1990 and 
1991. In 1992, she served an extended internship in the White 
House Office of Political Affairs during the critical months of 
the campaign. She moved on to work in the Office of the Deputy 
Convention Manager at the 1992 Republican National Convention, with 
particular responsibility for caucus teams. Since then, she has worked 
in the Houston office of George Bush and, in 1993, in the office of 
the Deputy Executive Director at the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee.

<p>

Through the years, she has volunteered time for local Republican 
party activities and campaigns, both local and Presidential. Her 
campaign experience includes a stint as opposition research 
coordinator for a Congressional candidate in Houston. 

<p>

Native of Texas, Marshall graduated <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> from Rice 
University in 1994 with majors in Policy Studies and English. She is 
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Rice Fellow.

<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95c2dr.html">Legalization of Drugs: 
The Myths and The Facts</a>: an article by Robert L. Maginnis

<p>

After a distinguished career in the U.S. military, Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert (Bob) L. Maginnis, USA Ret., joined the Family 
Research Council in 1994 to handle one of the most difficult 
social problems facing American society and American families 
today -- the crisis of crime.  In addition, Colonel Maginnis' 
skills as an analyst, writer, speaker and team leader will be 
applied to family issues impacted by military/foreign affairs 
policy and cultural issues. Already nationally known as an expert 
on the Pentagon and a spokesman on military issues, Colonel 
Maginnis brings to FRC a broad perspective on today's toughest 
issues.

<p>

In his many roles, Colonel Maginnis has appeared on ABC, NBC and 
CBS evening news shows, CBS "This Morning," "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
Newshour," CNBC "Cal Thomas," CNN's "Crossfire" and "Larry King 
Live" as well as other programs, such as "Donohue," and on numerous 
networks.  He has been quoted many times in newspapers across the 
country from the <I>New York Times</I> to the <I>LA Times</I>.  
His editorial pieces have been published in the <I>Washington 
Times, Orange County Register, Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald</I> 
and elsewhere. And the colonel has been featured on most major radio 
shows nationwide.

<p>

In July 1993, Colonel Maginnis retired from an assignment in 
the Pentagon where he served as an Inspector General.  He is 
an airborne-ranger infantry officer with an assignment history 
that includes Korea, Germany, Alaska, and several posts in the 
continental United States.  He served in command and staff 
positions in four infantry divisions from platoon to division 
level.  The colonel was the chief for the U.S. Army Infantry 
School's leadership training branch.  He developed curricula, 
taught, participated in leader development research and consulted 
with leaders and soldiers throughout the Army. He is the author of 
more than fifty articles published in professional military 
journals concerning ethics, leadership, and personnel matters 
impacting the military.

<p>

In the last eight months of his military service, Colonel Maginnis 
was a member of the Army's study group examining the homosexual 
ban.  He also was advisor to the Defense Department Military 
Working Group on homosexuals in the military.  In that role, he 
debated the issue in the media as well as speaking in various forums 
-- including testifying before a House subcommittee. Because of his 
expertise, Colonel Maginnis is also, on occasion, a spokesman for 
the Defense Readiness Council, a non-profit organization that led 
the fight to keep the homosexual ban.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis' service in the armed forces was commended with 
the Legion of Merit, the highest peacetime decoration, as well as 
with five meritorious medals and four commendations. Among his over 
fifty letters of commendation is one from former President Jimmy 
Carter who honored the colonel for inventing a laser training 
device, at great savings to the armed forces.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis received his B.S. from the United States Military 
Academy, West Point, New York in 1973 and a M.S. from the Naval 
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in 1983.  He is also 
a graduate of many military schools, including the Command and 
General Staff College.

<p>

Long active in his community and in many organizations, the colonel 
now coordinates his church's participation in homeless shelters. 
He, his wife and two children live in Northern Virginia.

<hr>
<h2>The September Budget Battle: Truth and Consequence </h2><p>
<h3>Pete du Pont</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
When the Congress returns from its recess after Labor Day, the battle 
of the budget will begin in earnest.   <p>
 
While the Congress has adopted a budget resolution providing for a 
balanced budget by 2002, now it must pass legislation implementing 
that budget.  Assuming the appropriations bills follow the resolution, 
and thus reduce spending, what will President Clinton do with them?  
The budget resolution Congress adopted was not subject to a 
Presidential veto, but the appropriations bills are another matter.  
President Clinton could shred the Republican budget by vetoing 
appropriations bills that include more spending cuts than he wants.   <p>
 
But the President is in a box.  The truth is his initial economic 
policy, enacted in 1993 by a single vote in each House, has failed 
badly.  One of the consequences was the election of a Republican 
Congress.  And the consequence of that is very little room for the 
President to maneuver.  <p>
 
In the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to balance the 
federal budget in 5 years.  His first budget proposed to reduce the 
deficit primarily through one of the largest tax increases in U.S. 
history.  Spending cuts in his budget were largely offset by spending 
increases elsewhere. <p>
 
So how has this liberal fiscal policy fared? <p>
 
In 1993, before the Clinton plan was enacted, the budget deficit was 
around $250 billion.  Under the latest budget projections, excluding 
proposed Republican changes, the deficit is projected to rise to $300 
billion per year by 2000. <p>
 
The economic rationale for the Clinton budget plan was that cutting 
the deficit would reduce borrowing pressures, and consequently reduce 
interest rates.  Lower rates would in turn stimulate investment and 
economic growth.  But by the end of April of this year, the prime rate 
charged by banks was 50% higher than in 1993 when the Clinton plan was 
adopted.  Other interest rates from new home mortgages to AAA 
corporate bonds and Treasury bills and bonds were all substantially 
higher as well. <p>
 
Meanwhile, the dollar has collapsed against foreign currencies.  From 
January, 1993 to June of this year, the dollar is down one-third 
against the Japanese yen, almost one-fourth against the Swiss franc, 
and one-eighth against the German mark.  As a result, all Americans 
are poorer because their dollar incomes now buy less of the world's 
goods and services.  This is in sharp contrast to the strong dollar 
policy of the Reagan administration, which led the dollar to soar to 
record levels, making all Americans richer. <p>
 
Real incomes and wages have continued to fall under Clinton's economic 
policies, a trend which started with the tax and regulation increases 
of the Bush Administration. <p>
 
Finally, economic growth has been sluggish.  With the Clinton tax 
increases, the recovery from the recession of 1990-1991 has been the 
weakest post-recession period on record.  Job growth has been half and 
real GDP growth  only about two-thirds the rate of prior recoveries.  
Indeed, in the last full quarter, the economy barely grew at all. <p>
 
Surely the President does not want to return to this sort of fiscal 
policy.  In any event, he cannot, for the Republican Congress will not 
raise taxes.  So the best the administration can do is veto a few 
appropriations bills and hope to keep government as large as he can 
for as long as he can. <p>
 
But remember that the Constitution dealt all the budget cards to the 
Congress.  If the Congress reduces funding for a department, the 
President cannot restore the spending simply by vetoing the 
legislation.  A veto ends all funding for all of the activities of  
the department, until the President signs a Congressionally approved 
bill. <p>
 
Remember, too, that at the end of the current fiscal year on September 
30, the government cannot operate if Congress has not authorized 
spending for the new fiscal year.  Congress can consequently turn off 
the government -- or parts of it -- if the President does not accept 
the Congressional budget.  In the fall, Congress will also have to 
approve an increase in the debt ceiling for deficit borrowing to 
continue, so it holds all the cards here as well. <p>
 
So the Congress leads from strength.  The only real risk is that the 
Republicans will compromise with themselves and hand the President a 
victory he otherwise could not have won. <p>
 
If the Republicans continue to reduce regulation and taxes, 
encouraging both job and real wage growth, and stay on the glide path 
to a balanced budget in seven years, the President will have little 
choice but to sign the appropriations bills and say it was all his 
idea in the first place.<p>

<title>Phil Gramm Speech</title>

<center>
<h2>Speech by Phil Gramm</h2><p>
<h3><i>January 1st, 2001</i></h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Any candidate running for President ought to be able to tell you what 
they want America to look like after their programs are in effect.  It is 
particularly fitting that one of the final days of the first term of the 
next president will be January the 1st, 2001 -- the beginning of the new 
millennium.  If you choose me to be your next President, here's the 
America I will work with you to create on that day.<p>
<center><h3>BALANCED BUDGET</center></h3><p>
On January the 1st, 2001, your life will be better and your future will be 
brighter because the federal budget will be balanced.  For the first time in 
over thirty years, the government in Washington will be forced to operate 
in the black and pay its bills.  The  50 cents out of every dollar we save 
that today is siphoned off to pay for government deficit spending will be 
available to build new homes, new farms and new factories; to create new 
jobs, new growth and new opportunity.<p>
Americans will be surprised at the benefits they get when government is 
again forced to live within its means.  In the five years since 1950 when 
the federal government actually balanced the budget, prime interest rates 
averaged 3.5% and mortgage rates averaged 4%.<p>
Owning your own home will again be part of the American dream, and 
today's workers will become tomorrow's small business owners, as 
Americans will again quit their jobs and strike out on their own to start 
their own businesses.<p>
<center><h3>TAXES</center></h3><p>
On January 1, 2001, the federal government will be spending just 18 
cents out of every dollar earned in America, down from 22 cents today.  
What does that mean to you and your family?  It means $3,900 per family 
that will be spent by you rather than by Washington.  Our flat tax will be 
fully in place by January 1, 2001, and you will be able to fill out your tax 
return on a post card.  <p>
By January 1st, 2001, excessive regulations that now add as much as 33% 
to the cost of building jet engines and nearly double the price of new 
vaccines will have been lifted.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, no family farm or small business in America will 
have to be sold to pay inheritance taxes.  When you build up your 
business or farm your family will have it for keeps. <p>
<center><h3>ECONOMY</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, private investment will be at an all-time high.  
More jobs will be created and your family will earn more and keep more 
of what you earn.  With the creative genius of America once more 
unleashed, no spot on the planet will be safe from our commercial 
onslaught. <p>
By January 1st, 2001, French farmers, Japanese semi-conductor 
manufacturers, and German auto makers will be lobbying their 
governments to erect protectionist walls against American goods. And as 
President I will knock down those barriers.  <p>
<center><h3>GOVERNMENT</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, I see an America where our government will be 
doing less, but what it does it will be doing better.  Medicare will be an 
efficient health care delivery system and our seniors will know that the 
government has honored its contract with them.  Medical costs will be 
under control because we will have the right to choose the health care 
plan that best fits our needs, a plan that is competitive and efficient.  
Social Security benefits will be guaranteed and young people will be able 
to invest more in their own private retirement plans and medical savings
accounts.<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE</center></h3><p>
By January the 1st, 2001, able-bodied men and women now riding in the 
welfare wagon will have had to get out of the wagon and help the rest of 
us pull.  We will have stopped giving more and more money to 
encourage people to have more and more children on welfare.  And the 
illegitimacy rate will be falling as fast in the year 2001 as it is rising 
today.  Those who can and should help themselves will be doing it again.  
And they will be learning to love it.  And those who truly need help will 
get it in programs tailored by their own states and run in their own 
communities in partnership with their churches and charitable 
organizations.<p>
<center><h3>CRIME</center></h3><p>
It always makes me mad when I go to my mother's house and see the bars 
she has on her windows.  On January 1st, 2001, those bars will be down.  
My mother will be able to walk around her neighborhood on the darkest 
night and not be afraid, and the people she's afraid of today will have bars 
on their windows.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, your family will be safer because we will be 
grabbing violent criminals by the throat, and the 7% of criminals who 
today commit 70% of the violent crimes will be in jail where they belong.  
We won't be building federal prisons like Holiday Inns anymore.  The 
weight rooms will be gone, so will the color televisions and the air 
conditioning.  Our federal prisons will be mini-industrial parks, where 
prisoners work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Prisoners will be working 
during the day to pay for the cost of their incarceration and going to 
school at night. When criminals have served their full sentences they will 
leave prison with the skills they learned working, they will be able to read 
and write and they will be drug-free.  And they won't be eager to go back 
to prison.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, the sound of children playing and people chatting, 
neighbors talking to neighbors, will replace the sound of gunfire and 
sirens in America's cities.  The law will require ten years in prison 
without parole for possessing a firearm during the commission of a 
violent crime or a drug felony, twenty years for discharging it, and when 
a brutal, predatory criminal kills one of our neighbors, he will be put to 
death.  <p>
By January of 2001, we will have begun taking down the metal detectors 
in our schools, and drug dealers will know that if they sell drugs to our 
children, they are going to go to jail for ten years without parole, no 
matter who their daddy is or how society has done them wrong.
<center><h3>EDUCATION</center></h3><p>
America will not have an education President on January 1st, 2001; we 
will have something a lot better.  You will be an education parent again.  
By January 1st, 2001, there will be no federal Department of Education.  
Half of the $32 billion it now spends every year will be back in the hands 
of families in the form of an education tax credit, so that you can invest 
your own money in your own children's education. The other half will go 
back to local school districts so local parents, local teachers, and locally 
elected school board members can again set education policy. There will 
be no federal Goals 2000 -- I will repeal Goals 2000.  Education policy 
will be set by you in your home and in your schools.  <p>
With you in charge of your child's schools, the schools of America will 
for the first time in 50 years be on their way to leading the world in math 
and science, in reading and reasoning.  They will once more teach our 
heritage and our history.  Our children will graduate ready to lead 
America and the world in the high-tech, global economy.  <p>
<center><h3>VALUES</center></h3><p>
By January, 2001, America's forty year experiment with Washington 
imposing values on our people will be a bad but fading memory.  Having 
opposed Bill Clinton's efforts to impose his values on America, I will 
never try to impose my values on you.  There's only one person 
who'sever lived who I would trust to impose values on America.  And 
when He comes back, He won't need government to impose His values.  
In the meantime, we will entrust the formation of values to the American 
family.  The values of our families, refined through each family's own 
faith, will permeate up from our homes, through our neighborhoods and 
our communities to form our nation's values. <p>
And America will be a more virtuous America. When we put families 
first in America again we will love ourselves, our neighbors and our 
country better for it.  Our children will have voluntary prayer in the 
schools again, and every American will have the guaranteed right of 
religious expression.  And putting families first means respecting the 
sanctity of human life.  By January 1st, 2001 the federal government will 
have stopped funding abortion and groups that advocate it.  Federal 
judges will be appointed who will faithfully interpret the Constitution, not 
make it up as they go along.<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS</center></h3><p>
In taking the oath of office, I will place my hand on the Bible and swear 
allegiance to a Constitution that enshrines equal justice under law.  When 
my hand comes off that Bible, I will pick up a pen and by Executive 
Order end quotas and set-asides in the Executive branch of American 
government.  I will veto any bill that requires quotas or set-asides.  I will 
fight for equal and unlimited opportunity for all but there will be special 
privilege for none. <p>
With our best effort, by January, 2001, Martin Luther King's dream that 
men and women in America will be judged not by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character will have come true.  And with a 
strong economy, strong families and pervasive opportunity, we will 
rediscover in America what ordinary people with more opportunity and 
more freedom than any people who have ever lived can accomplish in 
this extraordinary land of ours.<p>
<center><h3>DEFENSE</center></h3><p>
By January of 2001, we will have rebuilt our national defenses and will 
recruit and retain the finest young men and women who have ever worn 
the uniform of this country.  We will provide them with the best training 
and the finest weapons that Americans can build.  We will guarantee that
even in a world where the lion and the lamb are lying down together, 
America will always be the lion.  On January 1st, 2001 nowhere in the 
world will Americans be in combat under U.N. command.  <p>
<center><h3>ELECTION</center></h3><p>
The election for President in 1996 is not just a contest between candidates 
and political parties, it is a choice between two very different visions for 
America's future.  Bill Clinton believes that a brighter future will be won 
with more government.  I believe it will be won with more freedom.<p>
In Bill Clinton's America on January 1, 2001, our federal government 
looks pretty much the way it's looked for the last 40 years-- except it is 
bigger, more expensive, and more powerful.  But we reject that America.  
The test results are in:  big government had 40 years to do the job and it 
failed.<p>
If we are bold enough in defining our vision of an American future 
dominated by freedom and family, Bill Clinton will be remembered as 
the last President of a liberal era when big government arrogantly thought 
it knew best.  Bill Clinton is yesterday's president wedded to yesterday's 
government.  I will be tomorrow's President.  I will lead America back to 
the future to reaffirm, as our founders did, the revolutionary idea that 
ordinary people with freedom and opportunity can decide their own 
destiny and the destiny of the world.<p>
<center><h3>NORMAN ROCKWELL</center></h3><p>
As we ask our people to look up from the crisis of the present and to 
share our vision of what America can be, some will say that our vision 
looks a lot like a Norman Rockwell painting.  And I won't deny it.  But 
should we accept anything less?  After all, Norman Rockwell's paintings 
presented America as we wanted it to be and as we knew it could be.  
And I see Norman Rockwell paintings in the making everywhere in the 
history of our families and in the history of our country.<p>
I can see a Norman Rockwell painting of my wife's family.  Her 
grandfather came to America as an indentured laborer to work in the 
sugar cane fields in Hawaii.  He had no money.  He spoke not one word 
of English.  He didn't know anybody in America.  He came with a dream, 
with a devout faith, and with willing hands.  Twenty-five years later, his 
son, my wife's father, got on a freighter leaving Hawaii to come to the 
mainland with $25 he'd won in an essay contest and the dream of going 
to college.  He came home to Hawaii as an engineer and became the first 
Asian American ever to be an officer of a sugar company in the history of 
Hawaii.  And under President Reagan and President Bush, his daughter, 
my wife, served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, where she oversaw the trading of all commodities and 
commodity futures, including the same cane sugar that her grandfather 
came to America to harvest.  I'm not sure that even Norman Rockwell 
could have captured that story in a painting.  But the only thing 
extraordinary about that story is that there is nothing extraordinary about 
that story.  It's a story of an ordinary family in an extraordinary country. <p>
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but my mother had a 
dream before I was born that I was going to college.  I resisted.  I failed 
the third, seventh, and ninth grades, but it didn't make any difference to 
my mother. My mother prodded me every step of the way through 
collegeto a Ph.D. in economics because in the America we grew up in, 
mother's dreams did not die easily.  Too many mothers' dreams are dying 
too easily in America today.  And I want our America back.<p>
We have a right to dream great dreams because we're Americans.  If 
American history proves anything, it proves that with leadership and 
courage what we can dream we can do.  <p>
Our founders dreamed they could start the world over again and they did 
it in America.  With God's help we can make our dream, The American 
Dream, a reality.  Now and forever.<p>

"Conservatives often get too caught up in the many proble
ith the was affirmative action is currently implemented, and forget the reason it's there at all.
It is not enough to just get rid of race-based preferences, we must create opportunities for minorities and all of society through pro-growth tax policies.
<br>A negative message of "anti-affirmative" action will get the Republican party
nowhere unless it is backed up with a positive message of hope and opportunities
created."<br><b>Charles, Washington DC</b><P>

"Racial tensions are very real and
the rights of minorities do need to be protected.  Perhaps the affirmative action programs of the past three decades have been helpful in at least weakening
 barriers that existed, especially in the better-paying professions.  We now
e a generation of senior managers, many of whom really believe that they have an
 obligation to ensure that women and minorities are given opportunities for advancement.  <br>Though these programs may have been necessary to help overcome the
barriers of tradition and expectation, they have had incidious effects as we have seen  minorities of mediocre talent promoted to levels of high responsibility.  These unmerited promotions are damaging to the esteem of our institutions
and are as debilitating to those of little merit who are promoted as they are those of great merit who are passed over.  We need to move as quickly as possile
to a color- and sex-blind system of merit.
<br><b>Judy, Vienna, VA</b>

<P>
I believe neither the Republicans nor the Democrats
are serious about ensuring fairness in hiring practices (note the Democrat-controlled Congress's long-standing
policy of exempting themselves from all the affirmative
action laws they have passed over the last 25 years as
well as the Republicans missing the opportunities they
have had over the years to demonstrate any understanding
of racial inequity).<br>
I will hold both parties responsible for the lack of pro-
gress this year and with any increase in racial tensions
or inequity in treatment of all people of any race. <br><b>John, South Charleston</b><P>
 
"I coach the Debate Team at Transylvania University, a member
 of the National Educational Debate Association, and our resolution this semester deals with Affirmative Action. From the massive amount of research my team
has done it is very clear
that Affirmative Action is a joke.  It promotes a very small group of minorities,
 while failing to address the real needs of the very people it is suppossed
help.<br>
It is typical of governmental attempts at solving problems.  It simply does not
work."<br><b>James, Lexington, KY</b><P>


"I hope the March accomplishes its stated goal of helping men
return to their families as better individuals and citizens. <br>I hope that all men who heard about the march take this as a wake up call to them. Too many people in this country are waiting for someone else to fix their problems. I wish that politicians from both parties would realize that they are simply tearing this country further apart by their constant pettiness. Instead of trying to shift the blame from one party to another, they should understand that they are a group.
That is why congress was composed. <BR>
Whether they are Republican or Democrat or Independent, they should be responsible. In a crime, there is an idea of accomplice. In politics, there is no such idea, only men trying to appear to be perfect.
Sorryy to be so winded, I am really getting sick of hearing both sides blame each
er. It makes it difficult to believe anybody.<br><b>Mark, Scottsdale, AZ</b><P> 


Affirmative Action has never affirmed anyone's worth in
 society.  The proof is that achievement of any sort by any of the eligible classes holds no validity, even in their own eyes.  The presence of the possibility that decisions are made based on such superficial standards promotes envy, malice and distrust.<Br>
The MMM, and their threat of lawsuit about the count released by the park service only illustrates the difference between races.  A difference that all the social programs in the world cannot hide.  Although blacks and hispanics now openly
exercise their right to speak about segregation (and territorial control),
only a limited license is granted to whites, and those who try to practice segregation have the fate of Randy Weaver to consider.<br><b>Patty, Chantilly, VA</b><p>

Affirmative action programs were good when they started.
<BR>
Martin Luther King woke americans up to prejudice and the
need for real equality in america. The congress then passed
laws and they were almost immediately grafted and corrupted
The Bumper sticker which says " Crime wouldn't pay if the
Government ran it" is true. We need government to set 
guidelines and make laws, but it is people who must learn
to do right and be just.<BR>
 For Black people to support Farakan
is to turn their backs on the principles that Martin Luther
King fought for. We white Americans need to do the right
thing because it is right not because some muslim demands it.
Islam is in direct opposition to what this country stands for.
Liberals scream separation of church and state and then
rush to support a cult that will divide us and tear down the
advancements we have made. I say we should look to the
real Black leaders, such as Dexter Scott King, and seek to
encourage them and stand firm with Martin Luther Kings'
principle of a truely integrated america.<br><b>Michael, West Palm Beach, FL</b><P>

<h2>RNC TALKING POINTS:<br>
TOP TEN REASONS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As conferees from both Houses of Congress meet to reconcile 
differences between the recently passed House and Senate budget 
resolutions, it is important to remember why we must balance the budget 
and what a balanced budget will mean to all of us. We've heard the 
arguments from Bill Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress 
about why we can't balance the budget by 2002 and why we can't reduce 
spending. Given the doom and gloom rhetoric coming from their corner, 
many Americans may be wondering why we would want to balance 
the budget at all. Here are ten good reasons: <p>
A balanced budget will reduce the burden of debt on our children. The 
national debt is now $4.8 trillion. A child born today will pay $187,000 
in taxes over his or her lifetime -- just to pay the interest on that debt. 
That's more than $3,500 in taxes every year of their working lives to 
pay for our debt. And if we do nothing, that debt will balloon to nearly $8 
trillion in 15 years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will enable us to return to the American people more 
of their hard-earned tax dollars. Federal taxes as a share of median family 
income have steadily increased from 5% in 1950 to almost 25% today. In 
fact, if the average family today paid the same percentage of their income 
in taxes as their parents did, they would have roughly $10,000 more to 
spend at the end of the year. As we balance the budget, we can reduce the 
tax burden on families (sources: Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute). <p> 
A balanced budget will bring down interest rates. Deficit spending raises 
interest rates as government borrows more. A balanced federal budget 
will result in a drop in interest rates of approximately two percentage 
points or more. This will mean a savings of $37,440 on a $75,000, 30-
year home mortgage. It will mean a savings of $900 on a $15,000 car 
loan. Everything you borrow money for will cost less (source: Joint 
Economic Committee of Congress). <p> 
A balanced budget will increase economic growth. Time magazine 
reports (see attached article) that Roger Brinner, chief economist with the 
forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill, estimates balancing the budget 
would raise America's yearly output an extra 2.5% over the next 10 years. 
That would mean an average of an extra $1,000 a year for each American 
family. <p>
A balanced budget will create more jobs. Economic growth means more 
jobs, and a balanced budget is estimated to result in 6.1 million more jobs 
over the next ten years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will increase our standard of living. The nonpartisan 
Concord Coalition concludes that without deficit spending and debt, the 
average family income today would be $50,000 instead of $35,000.  
When asked what a balanced budget will mean for most Americans, Alan 
Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress: "I think 
their real incomes and purchasing power of their real incomes would 
significantly improve ... they would look forward to their children doing 
better than they." <p>
A balanced budget will strengthen the American dollar. Clinton's deficits 
have been driving the U.S. dollar to record lows, and the most dramatic 
drop was right after he and the Democrats in Congress defeated the 
balanced budget amendment. The devaluation of our currency ultimately 
leads to a lower standard of living. But the passage of Republican 
bills in Congress to balance the budget has caused the dollar to bounce 
back. As The Washington Post reported 5/19/95, "The U.S. dollar has 
rebounded in foreign exchange markets during the past several weeks, in 
part because of a growing belief among foreign investors that the United 
States is moving to put its economic house in order." <p> 
A balanced budget will ensure that our retirement programs are safe. 
Medicare and Social Security are programs that seniors have paid into all 
their lives, and we must be able to meet our commitments to them. 
Younger people paying into these programs now must also be assured 
that the funds will be there for them when they retire. The only way to 
preserve and protect these programs is to balance the federal budget 
once and for all, so we will always have the necessary resources 
available. As Bob Myers, long-time Chief Actuary of the Social Security 
Administration has said: "If we continue to run federal deficits year after 
year, and if interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we 
will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid the trust funds to 
pay for our current profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly 
inflating our way out of indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the 
real value of the social security trust funds." <p> 
A balanced budget will allow us to spend money on programs we need, 
rather than interest on the debt. If we do nothing, entitlements and interest 
on the debt will consume all tax revenues in just 17 years. Balancing the 
budget will ensure the federal government has the money it needs to 
defend our country, fund education, build roads and perform other 
necessary and important functions of government (source: Entitlement 
Commission). <p> 
A balanced budget will restore the American Dream. Rising interest rates, 
higher taxes, and stagnant wages are robbing us of the American Dream. 
Since the early 1970s when government spending began to balloon, 
Americans' incomes have stayed flat. In 1993, the first year of 
Clintonomics, median family income declined by $709 (source: U.S. 
Census Bureau). If we balance the federal budget, interest rates 
will drop, taxes can be lowered, and wages will increase. In short, we will 
restore the American Dream for millions of hard-working American 
families.  <p>

<title>Budget Reform</title>

Washington Watch<br>
Volume 6, Number 10<br>
September 23, 1995<br>

<h2><center>KEEPING BUDGET REFORM ON TRACK</h2></center><br>

	White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his "no new taxes" pledge. Today, they decry "a train wreck" they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. <p>
	First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996 Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.<p>
	House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period, but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. <p>
	
<h3><center>Media's False Picture</h3></center><br>
	Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal also produces $2 trillion in new federal debt.  <p>
	Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They claim the tax cuts will "explode the deficit,."  But more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief  is dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes. Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition of the tax package will be very "family friendly."<p>
	Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending is projected to increase at twice the rate of inflation even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.  The argument that tax cuts "explode the deficit" is answered by pointing out that tax revenues actually increased by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a budget surplus today. <p>
	Not a penny can be spent unless both houses of Congress approve. This gives the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers' money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal activism. Congress has an obligation to use its "power of the purse" to protect the legitimate interests of the American family.<p>
	
<h3><center>A Contest of Wills <br></h3></center>
	Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may try to get through October by passing "continuing resolutions. But, by early November, the Treasury's authority to borrow will expire.  Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling.  If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash is possible. But essential services like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social Security will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will be a great hue and cry from the liberal interest groups who see their funds disappearing.<p>       
	A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest groups.  What happens if a few weeks or months go by and the public doesn't miss the "services?"  That would provide a very powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a  liberal "train wreck" to get our country back on track, that may be a small price to pay. <p>

<title>Phil Gramm Floor Speech to the Senate</title>

<hr>
<h2>Phil Gramm Speech to the Senate</h2><p>			
<h3>104th Congress 1st Session</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this week and next week, we are going to come
down to the moment of truth on two issues. One issue has to do with putting
the Federal Government on a budget like everybody else. The other issue has
to do with fulfilling the Contract With America to let working people keep
more of what they earn. I would like to briefly address both of these subjects.<p>
In the 1994 election, in one of the most remarkable political occurrences
in the postwar period, House Republicans did something that is very unusual
in the political process and that is they set out in plain English what they
promised America they would do if the American people gave them a majority
in the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years.<p>
I would add that while many people have forgotten it, Republican
candidates for the Senate put out a joint statement where virtually every
Republican challenger for the U.S. Senate in the country came to Washington
and released a ''Seven More In '94'' document, where we outlined seven
things we would do if the American people gave us a majority.<p>
   Two of those promised items had to do with balancing the budget and with
letting working people keep more of what they earned. The House of
Representatives has done something even more remarkable than making all these
promises-they have actually done it. The House of Representatives has adopted
the Contract With America. They have adopted 90 percent of the things they
promised to simply vote on. And at the best universities in the land, you
would grade that as an ''A.''<p>
   We are now down to the moment of truth in the U.S. Senate and that moment
of truth basically has to do with whether or not we are going to pass the
Contract With America and whether we can make the tough decisions necessary
in order to do that. To balance the Federal budget over a 7-year period and
at the same time to accommodate the tax cut contained in the Contract With
America will require us, over a 7-year period, to limit the growth in
Federal spending to approximately 3 percent a year.<p>
   Over the last 40 years, Federal spending has grown at 2-1/2 times the
growth of family budgets in America. Over the last 40 years, the Federal
Government has increased its spending 2-1/2 times as fast as the average
family in America has been able to increase its spending. Now what would
America look like if those trends had been reversed? Well, if the average
family in America had seen its budget grow as fast as the Government has
grown for the last 40 years, and the Government's budget had grown only as
fast as the family budget has grown over the last 40 years, the average
family in America today would be earning $ 128,000 a year and the Government
would be approximately one-third its current size.<p>
   I ask my colleagues, if you could choose between the America where the
governments budget grew faster or an America where the family's budget grew
faster-put me down as one who would favor having the average family in
America make $ 128,000 a year and have the Federal Government one-third its
size.<p>
   Here is our dilemma. We have some of our colleagues who say, ''I did not
sign any Contract With America. That was the House of Representatives.'' As
I am fond of saying in our private meetings, that is a subtlety that is lost
on the American people. They do not see this contract as having been a
contract between just the House and the American people. They see it as a
Republican contract. And, quite frankly, it is a Republican contract. It
embodies everything that our party claims to stand for.<p>
   But what I think is important for the Senate is not just that Republican
candidates signed the contract, not just that every House Republican
incumbent who signed the contract was reelected but I think what is
significant to us is that the American people signed that contract when they
gave us a majority in both Houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.<p>
   The question that we are going to have to answer in the next 3 weeks is,
are we willing to limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2 percent a
year so that we can, over a 7-year period, balance the Federal budget and so
that we can let working families keep more of what they earn? I believe that
we can and I believe that we should. I think there are many Republicans in
the Senate who sort of have a problem, in that they have one foot firmly
implanted in the dramatic changes in Government policy that we promised the
American people in 1994, and they have the other foot firmly implanted in the
status quo. And, as those two things have moved further apart, we have had
the predictable result.<p>
   I think it is time for us to choose. I believe in the next 3 weeks we are
going to basically decide whether or not we meant it in November of 1994
when we told the American people that we were going to dramatically change
the way Government does its business. I think the American people are
convinced that we can limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2
percent a year so that we can let families and businesses spend more of what
they earn.<p>
   I know if the President were here, he would say this is a debate about
how much money we are spending on our children; or how much money we are
spending on education; or how much money we are spending on housing or
nutrition.<p>
   But that is not what the debate is about. Everybody in America wants to
spend money on children, housing, education, and nutrition. The debate we
are about to have is not how much money is going to be spent on those
things, but who is going to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats
want Government to go on doing the spending. They want Government spending
to continue to grow 2-1/2 times as fast as the family budget grows.<p>
   I want to put the Federal Government on a diet. I want to slow down the
rate of growth in Government spending so that we can let working families
keep more of their own money to invest in their own children, in their own
businesses, and in their own future.<p>
   This is not a debate about how much money we spend on the things that all
Americans believe we should spend money on. It is a debate about who ought
to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats want the Government to do
the spending. We want the family to do the spending. We know the Government,
and we know the family. And we know the difference.<p>
   Since we are investing in the future of America, I want to invest the
future of America in our families and not in our Government.<p>
   I know that there is a lot of anguish in the Senate, even on our side of
the aisle. But I think it is time to choose. I wanted my colleagues to know
that I am for a budget that does two things: No. 1, over a 7-year period,
limit the growth of Federal spending to about 3 percent a year so we can
balance the budget in 7 years and let our colleagues do something that no
current Member of the Senate, save two, has ever done before; that is, vote
for a real honest-to-God balanced budget. We literally have the power, by
having a 7-year binding budget, to let Members of the Senate vote to stop
talking about balancing the budget and to start doing it.<p>
   Second, in addition to the controls on spending necessary to balance the
budget, I want to limit the growth of spending not to 3 percent a year, but
to 2-1/2 percent a year so that we can let families keep more of what they
earn, so that we can cut the capital gains tax rate, so that we can
eliminate the marriage penalty, so that we can let families have a $ 500 tax
credit per child, so that, rather than having our Government spend our money
for us, we can let working people spend their own money on their own
children and on their own future.<p>
   As we look at this in perspective, let me give you three numbers. In
1950, the average family in America with two little children sent $ 1 out of
every $ 50 it earned to Washington, DC, and thought it was too much. And it
probably was. Today, that family is sending $ 1 out of every $ 4 it earns to
Washington, DC, and if the Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
some people would applaud that prospect, but only because they do not
understand our problems. If Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
and we did not start a single new program nor repeal any existing program, to
pay for the Government that we have already committed to is going to require
that in 20 years $ 1 out of every $ 3 earned by the average family in America
with two children come to Washington, DC, to pay for the Government.<p>
   We are going to have to institute dramatic changes in spending simply to
keep things the way they are. If we are to let working families keep more of
what they earn, we are going to have to institute a dramatic change in
Government policy. Mr. President, I am in favor of a dramatic change in
Government policy. If our Budget Committee does not offer and adopt a budget
that balances the budget and that provides for tax cuts for families and for
job creation, I intend to offer a substitute for that budget. I think we
have to stop cutting deals with America's future. I think we have to stand
up and tell the American people we meant it in November 1994 when we said
you give us a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress and we will
change the policy of American Government.<p>
I think we are now down to a moment of truth. Are we going to fulfill the
commitment we made in that election, or are we basically going to defend the
status quo? The status quo means less opportunity, future jobs, and an
America that is not the America that I want my children and my grandchildren
to have. I am ready to change the status quo. I am ready to cut the growth
in Government spending, not just to balance the budget, but to cut taxes.
And what I want my colleagues to know today is I want to work with the
Budget Committee, I want to work with our leadership. I am hopeful that we
can put together as a party position a budget that balances the budget over
a 7-year period and that mandates tax cuts contained in the contract. But,
if our leadership is not ready to bring that budget forward, if they cannot
muster the courage to control Government spending to make it possible, I
will muster that courage, and will offer a substitute and give my colleagues
the opportunity to join me, and to join America in that process.<p>
   Finally, let me say, Mr. President, I simply want to remind my colleagues
that the Contract With America was in fact signed by House Members, but
there are two additional points. First, it was not distinctly different from
the ''Seven More in '94'' contract that our candidates agreed to here on the
north front of the Capitol. Second, the important part of that contract is
not the fact that the House signed it. The important part of that contract
is that America signed it. The important part of that contract is it was the
document that defined what the 1994 election was all about.<p>
   The question now, the question that will be before us for the next 3
weeks is, Did we simply want to be for dramatic changes in Government at
election time, or are we willing to put our votes where our mouth is? Are we
really more wedded to funding for programs such as public television, or are
we more wedded to letting working people keep more of what they earn? Do we
really believe that Government knows best and that we need not only a $ 1.6
trillion Federal budget but that we need it to grow by 7.5 percent a year
while the family budget is growing at less than half that rate?<p>
   I think that is the decision. I think the answer of every Republican in
the Senate ought to be clear. And that answer ought to be we can change the
status quo, we can limit the growth of Government spending, we can terminate
programs, and we can and will not only balance the budget but let working
families keep more of what they earn to invest in their own children, in
their own businesses and their own future, and that we ought to cut taxes on
American business to provide incentives for people to work, save, and
invest. That is what I am for. I believe that is what America is for.<p>
   I thank the Chair.<p>
I yield the floor.<p>

<H2>President Reagan's Second Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Monday, January 21st, 1985 <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker
O'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and
friends, and my fellow citizens:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one
who, for a time, has been absent--Senator John Stennis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and welcome back.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative
Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. I wonder if we could
all join in a moment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.)
Amen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great
honor that you have bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be
deserving of your trust.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the
people have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first
President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible,
he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw,
untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union
of 13 States. Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States.
We have lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid
of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed
to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed. And yet
we stand together as we did two centuries ago.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic
stress. Voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for
the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are
not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is
always a better tomorrow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Four years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have
accomplished that. But in another sense, our new beginning is
a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when,
for the first time in history, government, the people said, was
not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we
the people allow it to have.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
That system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the
system. We asked things of government that government was not
equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government
that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to
the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us
of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine
that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down
and the number of unemployed increase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with
all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent
with an orderly society.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human
progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced,
inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than
ever before in our history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive.
But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until
every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity
as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great
Republic, and we'll meet this challenge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These will be years when Americans have restored their confidence
and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work,
and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy
was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere
efforts at meaningful arms reduction, rebuilding our defenses,
our economy, and developing new technologies, and helped preserve
peace in a troubled world; when Americans courageously supported
the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise
throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from
totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for greatness. We must
do what we know is right and do it with all our might. Let history
say of us, &quot;These were golden years--when the American Revolution
was reborn, when freedom gained new life, when America reached
for her best.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our two-party system has served us well over the years, but never
better than in those times of great challenge when we came together
not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a
common cause.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a
Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group
who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start
the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become
political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then years
later, when both were retired, and age had softened their anger,
they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond
was reestablished between those two who had helped create this
government of ours.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence,
they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours
of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives,
Jefferson wrote: &quot;It carries me back to the times when, beset
with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the
same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right
to self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some
wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless
... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today: One people
under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past.
As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our
past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women,
by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling
demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in
1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe
you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight
months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the
drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress.
We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment;
reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its
interference in people's lives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring
the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and
move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can
find work; so the least among us shall have an equal chance to
achieve the greatest things--to be heroes who heal our sick, feed
the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world
a better place.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The time has come for a new American emancipation--a great national
drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of
enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends,
together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more
productive, fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America--an
America that will lead the technological revolution, and also
open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature,
music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes,
will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But
an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought
us to a time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a
moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff
a question, and now I put the same question to all of you: If
not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us
going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget.
We can then begin reducing the national debt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing
government program spending for the next year. Beyond that, we
must take further steps to permanently control Government's power
to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations
from Government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax
them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional
for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government
takes in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have already started returning to the people and to State and
local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now,
there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social
compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency
and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged.
And here a growing economy and support from family and community
offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way
of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and,
yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and
made self-sufficient.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And there is another area where the Federal Government can play
a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of
different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred
and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There
is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that
we have made toward the &quot;brotherhood of man&quot; that God
intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back
or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant
with opportunity for all our citizens.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity
society in which all of us--white and black, rich and poor, young
and old--will go forward together arm in arm. Again, let us remember
that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner
of the Earth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last,
best hope of man on Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which
we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a
task which is the primary responsibility of National Government--the
safety and security of our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer
for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not
come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There
are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and
freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest
military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome
offensive weapons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But
much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor
any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities
to remain free, secure, and at peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost
of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And
this we are trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union.
We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear
weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the
total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of
the Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat
of mutual assured destruction; if either resorted to the use of
nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one
who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing
that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people,
our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security
shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their
target. It wouldn't kill people, it would destroy weapons. It
wouldn't militarize space, it would help demilitarize the arsenals
of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet
with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the
world of the threat of nuclear destruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all
around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies
in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march,
and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of
the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People,
worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those
inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is
our best ally.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And it is the world's only hope, to conquer poverty and preserve
peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against
its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human
freedom will be a victory for world peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and
powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with
our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion,
we look forward to a world rich in possibilities. And all this
because we have worked and acted together, not as members of political
parties, but as Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much
is changing and will change, but so much endures, and transcends
time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
History is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And
as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before
us. We stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our
democracy--or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't
gotten so cold. Now we are standing inside this symbol of our
democracy. Now we hear again the echoes of our past: a general
falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely
President paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle to
preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement
to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the
song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic,
daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; that is our song.
We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are
together as of old, as we raise our voices to the God who is the
Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold
us close as we fill the world with our sound--sound in unity,
affection, and love--one people under God, dedicated to the dream
of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon
now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and may God bless America.

<H2>President Reagan's First Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Tuesday, January 20th, 1981. <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President
Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill,
Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today,
this is a solemn and most momentous occasion; and yet, in the
history of our Nation, it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly
transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely
takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop
to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the
world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing
less than a miracle.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you
did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in
the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we
are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system
which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any
other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining
the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are
confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We
suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations
in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes
thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income
elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of
our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human
misery and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a
fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful
achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public
spending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging
our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience
of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous
social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our
means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should
we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that
same limitation?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there
be no misunderstanding--we are going to begin to act, beginning
today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will
go away. They will go away because we, as Americans, have the
capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs
to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our
problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society
has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government
by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the
people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself,
then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All
of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.
The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled
out to pay a higher price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for
a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It
knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions,
and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and
women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and
our factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us
when we are sick--professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers,
clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, &quot;We
the people,&quot; this breed called Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous,
growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans,
with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America
back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending
inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway
living costs. All must share in the productive work of this &quot;new
beginning&quot; and all must share in the bounty of a revived
economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of
our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous
America at peace with itself and the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has
a government--not the other way around. And this makes us special
among the nations of the Earth. Our Government has no power except
that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse
the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond
the consent of the governed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal
establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between
the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved
to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded
that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States
created the Federal Government.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention
to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work--work
with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.
Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster
productivity, not stifle it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved
so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because
here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius
of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom
and the dignity of the individual have been more available and
assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this
freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling
to pay that price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are
proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that
result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It
is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit
ourselves to small dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe,
doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that
will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that
will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy
at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us
renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let
us renew our faith and our hope.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that
we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where
to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory
gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed
all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a
counter--and they are on both sides of that counter. There are
entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who
create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They are individuals
and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary
gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their
patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our national
life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have used the words &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; in
speaking of these heroes. I could say &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot;
because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak--you, the citizens
of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are
going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration,
so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your
makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen,
and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when
they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them self-sufficient
so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is
an unequivocal and emphatic &quot;yes.&quot; To paraphrase Winston
Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the
intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest
economy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that
have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be
taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels
of government. Progress may be slow--measured in inches and feet,
not miles--but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial
giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten
our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities,
and on these principles, there will be no compromise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have
been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph
Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow
Americans, &quot;Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired
of.... On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide
the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the
liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy
of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness
and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's children.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen
as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again
be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who
do not now have freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen
our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.
We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually
beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose
on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries,
they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of
the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it;
we will not surrender for it--now or ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance
for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When
action is required to preserve our national security, we will
act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be,
knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having
to use that strength.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the
arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral
courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries
in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans
do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism
and prey upon their neighbors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being
held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a
nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.
It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration
Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been
held, as you have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.
Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this
city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall
are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George
Washington, Father of our country. A man of humility who came
to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary
victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial
to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with
his eloquence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the
Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning
of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on
the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery
with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or
Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price
that has been paid for our freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I
spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood,
The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world
on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir,
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under one such marker lies a young man--Martin Treptow--who left
his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with
the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was
killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy
artillery fire.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf
under the heading, &quot;My Pledge,&quot; he had written these
words: &quot;America must win this war. Therefore, I will work,
I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully
and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended
on me alone.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind
of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others
were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort,
and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in
our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together,
with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which now
confront us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.
God bless you, and thank you.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/townhall/background.jpg">

<H2>Address at the U.S.-French Ceremony at Omaha Beach on the
40th Anniversary of D-Day.</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, June 6, 1984. Normandy, France. <HR>

<P>
We stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw
and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet
of - or inches of sand, as bullets and shellfire cut through their
ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, &quot;Every
man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero.&quot;
<P>
Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today.
Others who hoped to return never did.
<P>
&quot;Someday, Lis, I'll go back,&quot; said Private First Class
Peter Robert Zannata, of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, and
first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. &quot;I'll go back, and
I'll see it all again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and
the graves.&quot;
<P>
Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa
Zanatta Henn, in a heart-rending story about the event her father
spoke of so often. &quot;In his words, the Normandy invasion would
change his life forever,&quot; she said. She tells some of his
stories of World War II but says of her father, &quot;the story
to end all stories was D-Day.&quot;
<P>
&quot;He made me feel the fear of being on the boat waiting to
land. I can smell the ocean and feel the sea sickness. I can see
the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces-the fear, the anguish,
the uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can
feel the strength and courage of the men who took those first
steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant
death.&quot;
<P>
Private Zannata's daughter wrote to me, &quot;I don't know how
or why I can feel this emptiness, this fear, or this determination,
but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know
is that it brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as
a 20-year old boy having to face that beach.&quot;
<P>
The anniversary of D-Day was always special to her family. And
like all the families of those who went to war, she describes
how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle:
&quot;So many men died. I know that my father watched many of
his friends be killed. I know that he must have died inside a
little each time. But his explanation to me was, `You did what
you had to do, and you kept on going.&quot;
<P>
When men like Private Zannata and all our Allied forces stormed
the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors,
but as liberators. When these troops swept across the French countryside
and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to
take, but to return what had been wrongfully seized. When our
forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and
defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those
who yearned to bee free again.
<P>
We salute them today. But, Mr. President [Francois Mitterand of
France], we also salute those who, like yourself, were already
engaging the enemy inside your beloved country-the French Resistance.
Your valiant struggle for France did so much to cripple the enemy
and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The French Forces
of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit.
They will be a timeless inspiration to all who are free and to
all who would be free.
<P>
Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate
the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic
people who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in
a firm resolve to keep the peace.
<P>
From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible;
now, in peace, that same unity makes us secure. We sought to bring
all freedom-loving nations together in a community dedicated to
the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance,
forged in the crucible of war, tempered and shaped by the realities
of the post-war world, has succeeded. In Europe, the threat has
been contained, the peace has been kept.
<P>
Today, the living here assembled-officials, veterans, citizens-are
a tribute to what was achieved here 40 years ago. This land is
secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and dying
for.
<P>
Lisa Zannata Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised
that he would return to Normandy. She ended with a promise to
her father, who died 8 years ago of cancer: &quot;I'm going there,
Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments.
I'll see the graves, and I'll put flowers there just like you
wanted to do. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor
will I let any one else forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud.&quot;
<P>
Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us
today, a D-Day veteran has shown us the meaning of this day far
better than any President can. It is enough to say about Private
Zannata and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside
him four decades ago: We will always remember. We will always
be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.
<P>
Thank you.

<H2>The Evil Empire</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Reagan's Speech to the House of Commons, June 8, 1982.
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible
political invention -- totalitarianism. Optimism comes less easily
today, not because democracy is less vigorous, but because democracy's
enemies have refined their instruments of repression. Yet optimism
is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to
be a not at all fragile flower. From Stettin on the Baltic to
Varna on the Black Sea, the regimes planted by totalitarianism
have had more than thirty years to establish their legitimacy.
But none -- not one regime -- has yet been able to risk free elections.
Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The strength of the Solidarity movement in Poland demonstrates
the truth told in an underground joke in the Soviet Union. It
is that the Soviet Union would remain a one-party nation even
if an opposition party were permitted because everyone would join
the opposition party....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint
and peaceful intentions of the West. They will note that it was
the democracies who refused to use the threat of their nuclear
monopoly in the forties and early fifties for territorial or imperial
gain. Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the Communist
world, the map of Europe--indeed, the world--would look very different
today. And certainly they will note it was not the democracies
that invaded Afghanistan or suppressed Polish Solidarity or used
chemical and toxin warfare in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If history teaches anything, it teaches self-delusion in the face
of unpleasant facts is folly. We see around us today the marks
of our terrible dilemma--predictions of doomsday, antinuclear
demonstrations, an arms race in which the West must, for its own
protection, be an unwilling participant. At the same time we see
totalitarian forces in the world who seek subversion and conflict
around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human
spirit. What, then, is our course? Must civilization perish in
a hail of fiery atoms? Must freedom wither in a quiet, deadening
accommodation with totalitarian evil?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sir Winston Churchill refused to accept the inevitability of war
or even that it was imminent. He said, &quot;I do not believe
that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits
of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.
But what we have to consider here today while time remains is
the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions
of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this is precisely our mission today: to preserve freedom
as well as peace. It may not be easy to see; but I believe we
live now at a turning point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right. We are witnessing today
a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where the demands of the
economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political
order. But the crisis is happening not in the free, non-Marxist
West but in the home of Marxism- Leninism, the Soviet Union. It
is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying
human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in
deep economic difficulty. The rate of growth in the national product
has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than
half of what it was then.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The dimensions of this failure are astounding: a country which
employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to
feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny
private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might
be on the brink of famine. These private plots occupy a bare 3
percent of the arable land but account for nearly one-quarter
of Soviet farm output and nearly one-third of meat products and
vegetables. Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year
after year the Soviet system pours its best resources into the
making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of
economic growth combined with the growth of military production
is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here
is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic
base, a society where productive forced are hampered by political
ones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The decay of the Soviet experiment should come as no surprise
to us. Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and
closed societies -- West Germany and East Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam -- it is the democratic countries
that are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people.
And one of the simple but overwhelming facts of our time is this:
of all the millions of refugees we've seen in the modern world,
their flight is always away from, not toward the Communist world.
Today on the NATO line, our military forces face east to prevent
a possible invasion. On the other side of the line, the Soviet
forces also face east to prevent their people from leaving.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The hard evidence of totalitarian rule has caused in mankind an
uprising of the intellect and will. Whether it is the growth of
the new schools of economics in America or England or the appearance
of the so-called new philosophers in France, there is one unifying
thread running through the intellectual work of these groups --
rejection of the arbitrary power of the state, the refusal to
subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate, the
realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chairman Brezhnev repeatedly has stressed that the competition
of ideas and systems must continue and that this is entirely consistent
with relaxation of tensions and peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, we ask only that these systems begin by living up to their
own constitutions, abiding by their own laws, and complying with
the international obligations they have undertaken. We ask only
for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an
instant transformation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement
there has been and will continue to be repeated explosion against
repression and dictatorships. The Soviet Union itself is not immune
to this reality. Any system is inherently unstable that has no
peaceful means to legitimize its leaders. In such cases, the very
repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist
it, if necessary, by force.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, we
must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and to take
concrete actions to move toward them. We must be staunch in our
conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky
few but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.
So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which, among other things, guarantees free elections.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The objective I propose is quite simple to state: to foster the
infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions,
political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose
their own way to develop their own culture, to reconcile their
own differences through peaceful means.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not cultural imperialism; it is providing the means for
genuine self-determination and protection for diversity. Democracy
already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and
historical experiences. It would be cultural condescension, or
worse, to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy.
Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote, decide
to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent
newspapers, prefer government to worker-controlled unions, opt
for land to be owned by the state instead of those who till it,
want government repression of religious liberty, a single political
party instead of a free choice, a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead
of democratic tolerance and diversity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since 1917 the Soviet Union has given covert political training
and assistance to Marxist-Leninists in many countries. Of course,
it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these
same forces. Over the past several decades, West European and
other social democrats, Christian democrats, and leaders have
offered open assistance to fraternal, political, and social institutions
to bring about peaceful and democratic progress. Appropriately,
for a vigorous new democracy, the Federal Republic of Germany's
political foundations have become a major force in this effort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We in America now intend to take additional steps, as many of
our allies have already done, toward realizing this same goal.
The chairmen and other leaders of the national Republican and
Democratic party organizations are initiating a study with the
bipartisan American Political Foundation to determine how the
United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign
for democracy now gathering force. They will have the cooperation
of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives
of business, labor, and other major institutions in our society.
I look forward to receiving their recommendations and to working
with these institutions and the Congress in the common task of
strengthening democracy throughout the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation -- in both
the public and private sectors -- to assisting democratic development....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term
-- the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism
on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which
stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.
And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO
even as we move forward with our zero-option initiative in the
negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for
a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let it be
clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used,
for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that's now going
on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills
and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the
beliefs we cherish, the ideals to which we are dedicated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The British people know that, given strong leadership, time, and
a little bit of hope, the forces of good ultimately rally and
triumph over evil. Here among you is the cradle of self-government,
the Mother of Parliaments. Here is the enduring greatness of the
British contribution to mankind, the great civilized ideas: individual
liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under
God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the West
about standing for these ideals that have done so much to ease
the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect world. This
reluctance to use those vast resources at our command reminds
me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz. As
the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd
stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.
And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled
the cork to give her a taste of it. She came around immediately
and said, &quot;Here now -- there now, put it back. That's for
emergencies.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the emergency is upon us. Let us be shy no longer. Let us
go to our strength. Let us offer hope. Let us tell the world that
a new age is not only possible but probable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the dark days of the Second World War, when this island
was incandescent with courage, Winston Churchill exclaimed about
Britain's adversaries, &quot;What kind of people do they think
we are?&quot; Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary
people the British are. But all the democracies paid a terrible
price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us. We dare
not make that mistake again. So, let us ask ourselves, &quot;What
kind of people do we think we are?&quot; And let us answer, &quot;Free
people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so
but to help others gain their freedom as well.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sir Winston led his people to great victory in war and then lost
an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed.
But he left office honorably and, as it turned out, temporarily,
knowing that the liberty of his people was more important than
the fate of any single leader. History recalls his greatness in
ways no dictator will ever know. And he left us a message of hope
for the future, as timely now as when he first uttered it, as
opposition leader in the Commons nearly twenty-seven years ago,
when he said, &quot;When we look back on all the perils through
which we have passed and at the mighty foes that we have laid
low and all the dark and deadly designs that we have frustrated,
why should we fear for our future? We have,&quot; he said, &quot;come
safely through the worst.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
But together, we too have come through the worst. Let us now begin
a major effort to secure the best -- a crusade for freedom that
will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation. For
the sake of peace and justice, let us move toward a world in which
all people are at last free to determine their own destiny.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/townhall/background.jpg">
<H2>Statement on the Occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the
Announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, March 23rd, 1993. Washington, D.C. <HR>

<P>
Good morning. It's a pleasure to be able to speak to you today
on this tenth anniversary of my announcement of the Strategic
Defense Initiative. Above all I want to thank all of you for the
hard work and perseverance you have shown through the years in
supporting and shaping this very important program. It is as true
today as it was ten years ago that this effort holds the promise
of changing the course of human history, by freeing the world
from the ominous threat of ballistic missile attack. Given the
choice, shouldn't we seek to save lives rather than avenge them?
I think we should. And indeed, now we can.
<P>
Ten years ago when I asked the scientific community to give us
the means of defending against the threat of ballistic missiles,
I said there would be risks, and that results would take time.
Well, I'm proud to say that these scientists and engineers boldly
embraced this challenge, and in only a few short years broke new
technological ground in developing innovative systems capable
of providing effective and affordable defenses against missile
attacks anywhere in the world. It is a tremendous achievement,
worthy of the great scientific accomplishments of this century.
<P>
As you know, however, critics of SDI from the very beginning have
been all too eager to denounce the program (and if it weren't
for George Lucas, maybe we would have been off to a better start).
But over the years, these critics have been disproved time and
time again. Today we know that we can defend ourselves, that the
threats have not disappeared -- many new threats, in fact, are
rapidly emerging -- and that Russia and our European allies have
expressed their desire to cooperate with us in developing a global
system of missile defenses.
<P>
This should be good news. Unfortunately, there is a stubborn contingent
of policy-makers who insist on abiding by the obsolete ABM Treaty
and support only extremely limited missile defenses, or even none
at all. Yet I believe their efforts will not stop the progress
we have made and the progress we have yet to make. The wisdom
of the program we launched a decade ago will prevail, and America
will not remain forever defenseless against ballistic missile
attack.
<P>
Now more than ever it is vital that the United States not back
down from its efforts to develop and deploy strategic defenses.
It is technologically feasible, strategically necessary and morally
imperative. For if our nation and our precious freedoms are worth
defending with the threat of annihilation, we are surely worth
defending by defensive means that ensure our survival.
<P>
Thank you again. God bless you, and may God bless America.

<H2>A Time for Choosing, aka The Speech</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am going to talk of controversial things. I make no apology
for this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's time we asked ourselves if we still know the freedoms intended
for us by the Founding Fathers. James Madison said, &quot;We base
all our experiments on the capacity of mankind for self government.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This idea? that government was beholden to the people, that it
had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique
idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This is
the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity
for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution
and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant
capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them
ourselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but
I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is
only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream-the maximum of individual
freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.
Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those
who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this
downward path. Plutarch warned, &quot;The real destroyer of the
liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties,
donations and benefits.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy
without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets
out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its
purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Public servants say, always with the best of intentions, &quot;What
greater service we could render if only we had a little more money
and a little more power.&quot; But the truth is that outside of
its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as
economically as the private sector.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet any time you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders,
we're denounced as being opposed to their humanitarian goals.
It seems impossible to legitimately debate their solutions with
the assumption that all of us share the desire to help the less
fortunate. They tell us we're always &quot;against,&quot; never
&quot;for&quot; anything.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment
by reason of old age, and to that end we have accepted Social
Security as a step toward meeting the problem. However, we are
against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception
regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism
of the program means that we want to end payments....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for aiding our allies by sharing our material blessings
with nations which share our fundamental beliefs, but we are against
doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy,
if not socialism, all over the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We need true tax reform that will at least make a start toward
I restoring for our children the American Dream that wealth is
denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as
high as his strength and ability will take him.... But we can
not have such reform while our tax policy is engineered by people
who view the tax as a means of achieving changes in our social
structure....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Have we the courage and the will to face up to the immorality
and discrimination of the progressive tax, and demand a return
to traditional proportionate taxation? . . . Today in our country
the tax collector's share is 37 cents of -very dollar earned.
Freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our
grasp.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Are you willing to spend time studying the issues, making yourself
aware, and then conveying that information to family and friends?
Will you resist the temptation to get a government handout for
your community? Realize that the doctor's fight against socialized
medicine is your fight. We can't socialize the doctors without
socializing the patients. Recognize that government invasion of
public power is eventually an assault upon your own business.
If some among you fear taking a stand because you are afraid of
reprisals from customers, clients, or even government, recognize
that you are just feeding the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all of this seems like a great deal of trouble, think what's
at stake. We are faced with the most evil enemy mankind has known
in his long climb from the swamp to the stars. There can be no
security anywhere in the free world if there is no fiscal and
economic stability within the United States. Those who ask us
to trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state
are architects of a policy of accommodation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They say the world has become too complex for simple answers.
They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple
answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally
right. Winston Churchill said that &quot;the destiny of man is
not measured by material computation. When great forces are on
the move in the world, we learn we are spirits-not animals.&quot;
And he said, &quot;There is something going on in time and space,
and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells
duty.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for
our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will
sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of
darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's
children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did
all that could be done.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech at Pointe de Hoc</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Pointe de Hoc, Normandy, June 6, 1984 (The 40th
anniversary of D-Day) <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples
joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four
long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free
nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried
out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed
for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies
stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled
in human history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of
France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the
air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was
filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At
dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped
off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs.
Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the
invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out
the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest
of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches
to stop the Allied advance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- at the edge
of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing
grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope
ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves
up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one
rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb
again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon,
one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in
seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to
seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five
came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still
bear arms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that
were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the
men who put them there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took
the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent.
These are the heroes who helped end a war.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's
poem. You are men who in your 'lives fought for life...and left
the vivid air signed with your honor'...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here.
You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were
hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you.
Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled
you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your
lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies
that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer.
It was faith, and belief; it was loyalty and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right,
faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God
would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was
the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that
there is a profound moral difference between the use of force
for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here
to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not
doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country
is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because
it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised
by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight
tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind
you.

<H2>Reagan's Speech at the 1994 Gala</H2>

<H3>On the Occasion of His 83rd Birthday</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I can't tell you how thrilled Nancy and I are to be here with
you tonight to celebrate the &quot;forty-fourth anniversary of
my thirty-ninth birthday.&quot; Haley told me he was going to
gather a few friends for dinner tonight, but I had no idea!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before I get started here, I want to thank my dear friend, Margaret
Thatcher, for being part of yet another important milestone in
my life and for those very kind words.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As most of you know, Margaret and I go back quite a ways. We met
at a time before she became Prime Minister and I became President.
From the moment we met, we discovered that we shared quite similar
views of government and freedom. Margaret ended our first meeting
by telling me, &quot;we must stand together,&quot; and that's
exactly wat we've done in the years since--as friends and as political
allies. Margaret Thatcher is one of the giants of our century.
Her many achievements will be appreciated more and more as time
goes on and history is written. For me, she has been a staunch
ally, my political soulmate, a great visionary and a dear, dear
friend. Thank you, Margaret, for being with us here tonight. I
would also like to convey my personal appreciation to Haley Barbour.
Haley, you and the entire Republican National Committee are doing
and excellent job keeping the heat on the Democrats at both ends
of Pennsylvania Avenue. Haley, back when I hired you to work on
my White House staff, I suspected you might amount to something
someday!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I must say that returning to Washington today really brought back
memories. As our plane headed toward the airport, I looked down
on the White House, and it was just like the good old days...the
South Lawn, the Rose Garden...David Gergen. I looked over a couple
of blocks, and there was the Internal Revenue Service--bigger
than I ever remembered it. When I looked down at the enormous
United States Post Office building I could just see the excitement
on the faces of the bureaucrats--knowing they would soon be managing
our national health care system! Up on Capital Hill, I saw that
big, white dome, bulging with new tax revenues. I instinctively
reached for my veto pen and thought to myself, &quot;Go ahead,
make my day.&quot; You may have seen President Clinton draw his
own veto pen on television just last week. The difference is that
his pen doesn't have any ink in it! Unless, of course, you're
talking about red ink. And we all know the Democrats have plenty
of that!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of you have made our day, just by being here. It's a pleasure
to see so many familiar faces and those who work so hard for the
Grand Old Party. Birthdays often serve as the rare moments when
we can pause from the bustle of our daily lives to reflect on
the years that have passed, the accomplishments and people that
have made them special. As I look around this gathering, I am
filled with countless warm and fond memories. Many of you go back
with us as far as my two terms as California Governor. Others
of you are more recent additions to the family.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regardless of when you came, you have been a big part of our lives.
For that, we are so grateful and feel so blessed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, as most of you know, I'm not one for looking back, I figure
there will be plenty of time for that when I get old. But rather
what I take from the past, is inspiration for the future. And
what we accomplished during our years in the White House must
never be lost amid the rhetoric of political revisionists.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When we came to Washington on that bright sunny day in January
of 1981, we shared a dream for America. Back then, the reach of
government had become intolerable. It was a time of rampant inflation
and crushing interest rates--when hope was scarce. It was a time
when coldy, ugly walls divided nations and human rights were trampled
in the name of evil and corrupt ideologies. It was a time when
the nuclear arms race was spiraling out of control and a blinding
mistrust stood between East and West. We believed that for the
future of America and the free world, this could not stand. And
together, we insisted that this great nation must once again behave
as such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In our America, most people still believed in the power of a better
tomorrow. So together we got the government off the backs of the
American people. We created millions of new jobs for Americans
at all income levels. We cut taxes and freed the people from the
shackles of too much government. And, the economy burst loose
in the longest peacetime expansion ever. We brought America back--bigger
and better than ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was a time when America was a bright beacon of hope and freedom
to oppressed people everywhere. The world looked to us--not just
because of our military might--but because of our ideas of liberty
and freedom. And, they knew we were willing to defend and promote
those ideas in every corner of the earth. We rebuilt a demoralized,
underfunded and unappreciated military. And we made it the most
modern and respected force in the world. And who can forget those
so-called &quot;experts&quot; who said our military build-up threatened
a dangerous escalation of tensions? What kind of fool, they asked,
would call the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. But as
events have shown, there was nothing foolish in my prediction
that communism wa destined for the ash-heap of history. After
decades of struggle, and with the help of the bold leadership
of Margaret Thatcher, democracy won the Cold War and the Berlin
Wall came tumbling down.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The world watched with amazement as we put our house in order
and took our rightful place as the most dynamic country in the
world. And I firmly believe that history will record our era as
on of peace and global prosperity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, our task is far from over. Our friends in the other party
will never forgive us for our success and are doing everything
i their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd
think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression--filled
with greed and despair. Well you and I know better than that.
Although the political landscape has changed, the bold ideas of
the 1980s are alive and well. Republican candidates swept every
major election across the country last year. From New York to
Texas--from New Jersey to my home state of California. And as
a result, it seems that our opponents have finally realized how
unpopular liberalism really is. So now, they're trying to dress
their liberal agenda in a conservative overcoat. After watching
the State of the Union address the other night, I'm reminded of
the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny--the intellectual
theft of ideas that you and I recognize as our own. Speech delivery
counts for little on the world stage unless you have convictions
and, yes, the vision to see beyond the front row seats. The Democrats
may remember their lines, but how quickly they forget the lessons
of the past. I have witnessed five major wars in my lifetime,
and I know how swiftly storm clouds can gather on a peaceful horizon.
The next time a Saddam Hussein takes over a Kuwait, or North Korea
brandishes a nuclear weapon, will we be ready to respond?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what this
country is looking for now. It was leadership here at home that
gave us strong American influence abroad and the collapse of imperial
communism. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we
should always be cautious of those who would lower our profile
because they might just wind up lowering our flag.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, on a serious note, I would like to end by telling
you something Nancy and I have wanted to say to you for a long
time. During our years together here, as you know, things were
always on the move. As soon as we accomplished one objective,
we were quickly on to the next. There was rarely time to celebrate
victory or recall all the people who made it possible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, one of the benefits of retirement is you get a chance to
reflect back over the years. Since Nancy and I have returned to
California, we've spent many oaccasions looking back at what we
did here and remembering the extraordinary people who worked so
hard to make those great days possible. Ad we've wondered if we
would ever get the chance to thank them. You are those people--those
great individuals who gave so much of yourselves--who sacrificed
and supported us and helped us achieve everything we did. So,
I will conclude tonight by saying that the greatest gift I could
receive on my birthday is to be able to stand before each and
every one of you and convey in the only words I can how grateful
Nancy and I are: thank you for being there--and for being here.
And thank you for making this evening a memory I will cherish
forever. Until we meet again, God bless you, my friends.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech on The Challenger Disaster</H2>

Ronald Reagan -- Oval Office of the White House, January 28, 1986

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts
in a terrible accident on the ground. But, we've never lost an
astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And
perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the
shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers,
but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven
heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair,
Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn
their loss as a nation together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the
full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking
about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave,
and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says,
'Give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.' They had a hunger
to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to
serve, and they did. They served all of us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle
us. But for twenty-five years the United States space program
has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space,
and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still
pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who
were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know
it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this
happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the
brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and
we'll continue to follow them...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great
explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.
In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian
later said, 'He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in
it.' Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication
was, like Drake's, complete.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner
in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor
the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for
the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of
earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Accounting has been called the &quot;language of business.&quot; The concepts and terms of accounting are used to describe and measure the events of daily business activity. The accountant measures, aggregates, and reports financial information necessary for decision-making by organizational managers, owners, investors, government agencies, and other users. Timely and accurate information on operations is crucial to success in today&#39;s rapidly changing business environment and the accountant is the one responsible for this critical business function.&nbsp; The importance of accounting information to business opens many career opportunities for accountants. The opportunities generally are in-- </font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Public Accounting - Public accountants provide consulting services to organizations and individuals. A critical function they perform is the preparation and certification for accuracy of financial reports used by individuals outside of the firm such as investors or government agencies., Those following a career in this area will generally seek to become certified public accountants (CPA&#39;s). </font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Private Accounting - Private accountants are employed by businesses of all types and sizes. They develop accounting reports used by the firm&#39;s management for internal decision making as well as prepare reports for external users. Because of the importance of accurate information to decision makers, a firms&#39; internal accountants are often important members of its management team. Many following this career will seek to become certified managerial accountants (CMA). </font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Government Accounting - Accounting for government agencies and other not-for-profit organizations requires special methods and reporting procedures not used in profit-oriented firms. Governmental Accountants perform similar functions as do private accountants for local, state, and federal agencies and charitable organizations. </font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>ACCOUNTING PROGRAM<br>
All business students at Idaho State receive a solid foundation in general education and understanding of general business practices.

Accounting majors may then choose from two program tracks-one designed specifically for those seeking a career in public accounting and a second track for those planning careers in private or governmental accounting. Students may shape their programs to meet their individual interests and career plans by choosing electives from the following areas: <br>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>The goal of the Department of Marketing at ISU&#39;s College of Business is to meet the needs of students interested in marketing as a career and the needs of local, national, and international organizations which hire our graduates. Marketing managers are concerned with finding out what consumers want and providing products that meet consumer&#39;s needs, wants, and desires. The backbone of business&#39; marketing effort is sales, and that is where the largest need for our graduates is, and where our educational emphasis lies.&nbsp; Careers include:<br><br>
<B>Personal Selling </B>&nbsp;
Personal Selling is the key component of our marketing program. We are proud to be one of the leading universities specializing in this field.

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Timely, accurate and pertinent information is critical to managers as they meet decision making needs of the competitive business environment. Rapidly changing computer technology, both in hardware and software design, is providing the capability for businesses and other organizations to develop complex information systems to meet growing business information needs. <br>
<br>
The computer information systems program is designed specifically to prepare students to design and manage computer based information systems. Combining concepts of computer science, computer hardware design, software engineering, and management, the program provides an in-depth understanding of the analysis and design of computer based management systems and the management of the information resource. The program intends to acquaint the students with the design and management of information systems ranging from those using small desk-top or personal computers to large mainframe systems. <br>

COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS PROGRAM<br>
All business students at Idaho State University receive a solid foundation in general education needed to be successful in any field. Half of the courses taken for a bachelor of business administration degree are from the liberal arts and sciences. A broad base understanding of business is gained from the business core requirements. Computer Information Systems majors will then take a common set of CIS courses designed to give them a thorough understanding of computer programming, management information systems, and systems analysis. Students may shape their programs to meet their individual interests and career objectives by taking elective courses in the areas of: <br>
<br>
Quantitative Methods <br>
Computer Languages <br>
Decision Support Systems <br>
Expert Systems in Business <br>
Network and Communication Systems <br>
Business Systems Simulation <br>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>The Master of Business Administration degree at Idaho State University (ISU) is designed to prepare students for leadership roles in all areas of business requiring skilled, ethical decision-making and analytical abilities. The program emphasizes the development of critical thinking skills in a supportive professional environment. Individuals interested in expanding their career potential and improving their business acumen will find much to recommend ISU&#39;s MBA program. <br>
<br>
The ISU College of Business provides the advantages of a small, quality program accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The typical MBA class is a diverse group of 30 or fewer students representing all regions of the U.S. and many foreign countries. The informal, friendly atmosphere encourages interaction between students and faculty, providing an ideal educational environment. <br>
<br>
Idaho State University is located in Pocatello, a community of 50,000. Pocatello is the transportation, industrial, and trade center of southeastern Idaho. It is also convenient to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, a nationally recognized energy management research center. The surrounding area provides ideal opportunities for all forms of outdoor recreation including access to some of the finest skiing in the country and to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. <br>
<br>
The MBA Program<br>
<br>
The program is designed to develop leadership and interpersonal skills. It also enhances abilities to carry out effective financial analyses, thoroughly understand the process of creating and delivering quality goods and services, and attain a global view of decision-making. <br>
<br>
The MBA program consists of seven first-year graduate core courses (MBA I) and ten second-year courses (MBA II). Students may select either a General Management or an Accounting option for their program. <br>
<br>
The first-year core courses develop a broad competence in the functional fields of business. This core provides a foundation for the integrative focus of the program&#39;s second year. The majority of first year courses are waived for recent graduates of AACSB accredited institutions. <br>
<br>
The second year consists of six required and four elective courses. The courses are designed to provide the student with the ability to make sound business decisions with an appreciation for the complexity of modern global competition. Traditional issues of business are considered along with concrete examples of global competition and ethical behavior. Team problem-solving and leadership skills are particularly emphasized in the second year program.</p></font>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Financial Managers specialize in the analysis of risk and potential returns from alternative uses of a business firm&#39;s or individual&#39;s resources. The finance major should have a broad understanding of business management concepts accompanied by a sound background in economic theory, management information systems, and quantitative techniques. The nature of the work also requires that financial managers possess effective communication skills, a basic understanding of accounting and financial procedures, and the ability to work well with people in all other parts of the organization. <br>

All business students receive the sound foundation of general education courses needed for success in any field. These are followed by a broad understanding of business principles gained from the business core curriculum. Finance majors then take common finance requirements in corporate financial management and investments. Students may shape their programs to meet their individual interests and career goals by taking electives in these areas: <br>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Students choosing the Accounting option will join one of the country&#39;s most outstanding programs. ISU&#39;s accounting students have an excellent track record. They have consistently placed among the top ten schools in the nation in their pass rate on the CPA examination. <br>
<br>
The opportunity for students to combine an accounting emphasis with their MBA comes in direct response to the needs expressed by the CPA profession for a broader education beyond the in-depth expertise in accounting. ISU is in the vanguard of institutions providing programs to meet the new 150 credit hour requirement for the CPA certificate. <br>
<br>
The accounting emphasis combines the MBA II core with four graduate accounting courses. This combination of courses prepares students for both the CPA and CMA examinations. <br>
<br>
Students with a recent undergraduate degree in accounting can complete the program in twelve months, including the CPA examination in May and the CMA examination in June or December. Students with other degrees have a longer program including five undergraduate accounting courses taken along with the MBA I courses.</p></font>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Management is the science and art of accomplishing organizational objectives through planning, organizing, directing and controlling human, fiscal, and physical resources. A degree in management prepares a student for a variety of challenging careers. Graduates in management are employed in all sectors of business, government, and not-for-profit organizations. Job titles held by management graduates include: <br>
</p><p align=center><center></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1>Personnel Director/Officer<br>
OSHA Managers<br>
Bank Officer<br>
Pension and Benefits Administrator<br>
Inventory Manager<br>
Maintenance Manager<br>
Production Cost Analyst<br>
Production Planner<br>
Management Trainee<br>

The different kinds of jobs managers must do and the kinds of knowledge they must have fall into several broad categories. <br>
<br>
Problem Solving-the recognition of problems, developing and analyzing possible solutions, and implementing selected solutions. Human Relations-motivation, communications, and development of effective relations with people both in and outside the organization. <br>
<br>
Organizational Skill-planning and implementing actions to achieve various goals of the organization. This includes knowledge of labor relations and personnel processes, production management, and operations procedures. <br>
<br>
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM<br>
All business students at Idaho State University receive a solid foundation in general education requirements. Half of all courses taken for a bachelor of business administration degree in management are from the liberal arts and sciences. A broad-based understanding of business operations is gained through the business core requirements. Management majors follow the general business core with advanced courses in organizational behavior and human resources management. A student may then select: <br>
<br>
<B>An Emphasis in Human Resources/Industrial Relations</B> which prepares a student to work with the personnel or labor relations functions within a business:<br>
<br>
<B>An Emphasis in Productions/Operations Management</B> which prepares a student to manage the manufacturing or processing of raw materials into finished goods or services; OR <br>
<br>
<B>No Emphasis</B> Students would choose electives from the areas of business law, personnel management, labor law and relations, production management, international business or organizational theory to meet their individual interests and career goals.</p></font>

<p align=center><center><B><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>New Accounting Course Benefits Both Students and Business<br>
</center></p><p align=left><br>
</B>A new community-based learning course provides free consulting to area businesses and a taste of the real world to accounting students. Accounting 470, Contemporary Issues in Management Accounting, is a senior elective in which student teams tackle management accounting projects aimed at addressing problems of concern to local business owners and managers.<br>
<br>
The class was first offered on an experimental basis last spring to four brave students who created an activity-based costing system for a business process within a local medical practice. Based on the results, they recommended a re-engineering of the business process. The sponsor was so pleased with the results he is hosting another team this fall.<br>
<br>
This semester twenty students are immersed in seven projects involved in a variety of activities. Three teams are focusing on developing cost accounting and/or cost management systems, one for a specialty manufacturer in Blackfoot, another for a farming operation in Rupert, and the third for a combined retail/service business in Idaho Falls. Potential start-up companies are the charge of several other teams, with two groups working through the Pocatello Small Business Development Center (SBDC), and another studying the economic feasibility of a spin-off from an existing business. Finally, one team is working on developing a customer-driven performance measurement system for a Pocatello-based industrial service organization.<br>
<br>
Early in the semester, students are introduced to basic consulting conduct.Each student signs a commitment of confidentiality to all sponsor organizations serviced in the course. Teams are coached and guided throughout the term via weekly faculty/team conferences in order to help ensure high quality and timely service.<br>
<br>
Any person or organization interested in sponsoring a student team in the future should contact Professor Priscilla Reis of the accounting department at (208) 236-3638 or reispris@ISU,EDU.</p></font>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>The rapidly changing technology available to businesses challenges business education to remain current so that graduates are ready to move into the new business environment. Most business schools lack the resources to meet this challenge. Nationally, budgets for education are not sufficient to keep pace with the business world. The ISU College of Business is fortunate to have generous business partners and alumni who have permitted us to respond to the challenge. <br>
<br>
Thanks to the generosity of The J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation and Microsoft, Inc., the College of Business is poised to leap into the twenty-first century. These grants have driven the upgrading of technological capabilities of our faculty and classrooms. The Albertson Foundation contributed $100,000 to upgrade classroom hardware. Microsoft donated over $1,000,000 in the latest software allowing the faculty to use that hardware effectively.<br>
<br>
When these projects are completed, the College will have 13 classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art computers and digital projectors. Instructors and students will have direct access to the Internet and multimedia education tools to enhance their in-class learning experiences.<br>
<br>
One classroom has been designed for electronic teamwork. Eight cubicles with multimedia computers allow faculty to design classes in which students are assigned to different &quot;offices&quot; to work as teams researching problems, accessing data bases, or simulating business activities. An additional computer and digital projection system at the front of the room allows the instructor and student teams to present to the entire class.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>College of Business faculty are excited with the potential for new approaches to teaching made possible by these resources. We can now schedule all business classes in rooms with cutting edge technology. The success in using this technology will depend on the faculty&#39;s developing new competencies, new teaching approaches, and new software tools.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>The College has always striven to provide an excellent education for its graduates. We have been able to attract superior faculty who work together extremely well to remain on the cutting edge of technology and to keep the curriculum current and relevant to the business environment. We have been fortunate.&nbsp; In addition to staying abreast of technological developments and hiring of strong faculty, we maintain undergraduate and MBA programs at a favorable faculty/student ratio to ensure personal interaction with students.&nbsp; This provides exceptional learning experiences both in the classroom and through direct student-teacher contacts.<br>
<br>
We are proud of the education that we have been able to provide over several decades and believe most alumni have found their ISU education has provided a competitive advantage leading to success. Our faculty has also been very active in providing service to businesses and professional organizations. <br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=1><br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Striving for excellence is a continuous activity requiring synergistic interaction among many partners, including the faculty, students, businesses and alumni. Much more can be accomplished when multiple skills and resources are combined. No piece of the partnership can accomplish excellence alone.<br>
<br>
We need to ensure the interaction we have enjoyed intensifies to meet the new demands.&nbsp; For example, the new technology available in classrooms will be underutilized unless we expend time and resources to develop effective specialized software that simulates actual business problems and processes. Faculty must continuously develop competencies in the new technologies. Businesses can help by providing relevant problems and information to be used in the classrooms. Everyone can help by providing the financial resources necessary to take advantage of the technology.</p></font>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>In April of this year, Governor Phil Batt appointed Management Professor John Kilpatrick to a task force on Medicaid reform.&nbsp; Because of expected cuts&nbsp; in Medicaid funds at both the federal and state levels, the task force&#39;s goal is to find ways to make the Medicaid program more cost effective while serving the needs of Idaho&#39;s medically indigent.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>
Since May, the Council has been involved in the lengthy and complex process of&nbsp; developing a set of recommendations to be delivered to Governor Batt by early December.&nbsp; After going through a crash course on the Medicaid program, council members held&nbsp; 21 public meetings in 7 Idaho cities: Couer d&#39;Alene, Lewiston, Nampa, Boise, Twin Falls, Pocatello and Idaho Falls.&nbsp; These hearings resulted in over 700 specific recommendations from the public, providers, and recipients.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>
Next the council met in Boise to develop a formal mission statement and begin organizing the&nbsp; public comments into a coherent set of principles and recommendations.&nbsp; Working in sub-committees, the council came up with a preliminary list of just over 100.&nbsp; In August a draft of these proposals was circulated and another round of public hearings held.&nbsp; When public comment has been summarized and reviewed, the council will meet to revise the proposals further. <br>
<br>
 Because of the complexity of the issues involved, a subcommittee may continue working on the reform until well into the new year.&nbsp; Once the recommendations are submitted to the governor, he and his staff will make decisions as to which ones will be presented to the legislature or passed on to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare for study and implementation.<br>
<br>
While the process has been arduous and time-consuming, Professor Kilpatrick feels that getting to know the council members from across the state and&nbsp; working with them has been a valuable experience.</p></font>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=1>+The Simplot Decision Support Center (SDSC) is an example of how your College of Business uses donated funds.&nbsp; In November 1995, we described what the center had been doing in its research role. We have provided over 100 sessions for local, national, and international organizations and conducted research for the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. We have even been recognized as a National Information Systems Security Resource Center<br>
<br>
The SDSC also is integral to the general operation of the College of Business. The college is a responsible steward of resources. We have taken the original gift from the Simplot Corporation and multiplied it 25 fold. This has allowed the SDSC to be not only independent of state funding but to support students, faculty, the college, university, and state in the following ways. <br>

<p align=center><center><B><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>ISU Students Succeed on the CPA Examination</B><br>
</center></p><p align=left><br>
Once again ISU accounting students have excelled on the CPA examination. Out of 17 students taking the May, 1996 examination, 7 passed the entire examination (41&#37;) and 10 either passed or conditioned it (65&#37;). Nationally, the pass rate is about 16&#37; and the pass or condition rate 25&#37;.<br>
<br>
These statistics are more impressive when put into the context of expectations based on college entrance scores. The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) divides CPA examination candidates into three categories based on the ACT college admission scores.&nbsp; ISU students are in the lowest category.&nbsp; According to NASBA, that category has a success rate that is 50&#37; of the national average.&nbsp; Thus, if the national average pass rate for May is the typical 20&#37;, students with similar ACT scores as ISU would have a pass rate of only 10&#37;.<br>
<br>
According to Dr. Ken Smith, the reasons for ISU students&#39; success continue to be their dedicated work ethic and rigorous, innovative course work that encourages them to analyze situations rather than memorize rules and facts.</p></font>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Sabbaticals at ISU are competitively awarded on the basis of past record, current performance, years at ISU, and the merits of the sabbatical proposal. Johnson adds that sabbaticals by definition are meant to be a period of rejuvenation. But hard work and rejuvenation can go hand in hand. &quot;I hope critics of academic sabbaticals come to recognize the merits and importance of sabbaticals. Perhaps one day we will see an increase of sabbaticals in the private sector--this is common practice in some European countries. My sabbatical was a wonderful change--I continued to work hard but came back refreshed, spending my entire summer working hard to progress my sabbatical works to fruition.&quot;<br>
<br>
Currently Johnson is &quot;recovering&quot; from his recent sabbatical; at least he likes to tease that that is what he is doing. He spent most of his spring 1996 sabbatical in the Los Angeles area researching and writing. With his trusty laptop computer in tow, he made frequent trips to UCLA, USC, and CSULA libraries. Although his sabbatical was awarded for the spring semester, he viewed the spring/summer period as his &quot;informal&quot; sabbatical period. (Most professors are not on contract during the summer months although most are professionally active during this period.)<br>
<br>
Johnson worked on a number of research projects during his sabbatical, some of which have already been accepted. He will present three papers at conferences this fall that will be published in the conferences&#39; Proceedings. They are 1) <I>Organizational and Behavioral Constraints to Employment Testing</I> (Institute for Behavioral and Applied Management, Portland, Maine), 2) <I>The EEOC&#39;s Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures: Outdated, Misleading, and Counterproductive</I> <I>(</I>American Association of Employment Principles and Practices<I>, </I>San Diego<I>), and 3) Employment Test Validation: Conducting and Documenting The</I> <I>Process (</I>Association Employment Principles and Practices<I>)</I>.<br>
<br>
He has also submitted a manuscript, <I>The Sub-dimension Versus Overall Criterion Debate: Interpreting Test Validation Data,</I> to the Western Decision Science Institute and another paper, <I>The Ethics of Downsizing: The View From Non-managers</I> to <U>The Workplace</U> <U>Journal</U>.<br>
<br>
Johnson is working with fellow faculty members Professors Gamewell Gantt and James Jolly in researching <I>The Legal Status of Validity Generalization for Validating Employment Tests</I>. He has also made significant progress researching a handful of other topics including: <I>The Affirmative Action Versus Employment Testing Tug-A-War: Can Their Differences Be Reconciled?, Misrepresentations and Abuses of Personnel Selection Testing, Behavioral Realities of Conducting Job Analysis and Conducting Test Validation, </I>and <I>Employment Testing, the ADA, and Job Analysis</I>. <br>
<br>
Johnson is in his tenth year as a faculty member and is working as hard as ever. &quot;When I started in this career I knew I was going to have to work hard and long hours to earn tenure and promotions, and I did. I also thought that after reaching the rank of full professor my 60-hour weeks might lessen and I could get away with 40- to 50-hour weeks, at least some of the time. It just hasn&#39;t worked that way. We are working as hard as ever,and I don&#39;t expect that to change. Besides, work is more fun when I am really cranking it out. When I tell my students this, some of them just look at me in amazement.&quot;<br>
<br>
Johnson is enjoying himself while he is teaching his classes and conducting research. His first love is teaching, which is the reason he earned his doctorate degree in the first place. &quot;I had a chance to teach management courses while I was an MBA student at California State University, Los Angeles. I loved it and knew that was what I wanted to do long term.&quot;<br>
<br>
He also keeps busy with his involvement in community and university service. He is the President of the Eastern Idaho Society for Human Resources Managers, which is a professional association for practicing personnel/human resources managers. During past five years, he served this group as a Vice President, Membership Director, and Board member. He was also elected by his fellow College faculty members to serve as one of its two representatives on the Faculty Senate for the next three years. He enjoys signing memos as &quot;Senator Johnson.&quot; John Kilpatrick (Senator Kilpatrick!!) of the Department of Management also serves the College in this capacity.</p></font>

<p align=left><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The College of Business (COB) at Idaho State University (ISU) offers a program leading to the degree of Master of Business Administration (MBA) to holders of business and non-business bachelor&#39;s degrees. The MBA program is accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). ISU&#39;s MBA program was the first to be accredited by the AACSB in the State of Idaho and we remain committed to the delivery of a high quality, rigorous program. <br>
<br>
The MBA program serves Southeast Idaho&#39;s need for part-time education and as such is primarily an evening program. The MBA program, accounting option, meets the needs of students who wish to satisfy requirements for certification as public accountants (CPA) or certification as management accountants (CMA). In the interest of a more diverse student body, the college encourages and attracts a small number of full-time students from other parts of the United States and foreign countries. <B><br>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I have been at ISU since Fall, 1993. In that time, I have taught numerous courses, including </p>
<ul>
<li>CIS 220 - Foundations of Computer Programming </li>
<li><a href="http://cob.isu.edu/classes/cis/cis382/">CIS 382 - Systems Analysis and Design </a></li>
<li>CIS 480 - Database Management Systems </li>
<li><a href="http://cob.isu.edu/classes/cis/cis490/">CIS 490 - Management of Information Systems</a> </li>
<li>MBA 614 - Graduate-level MIS course </li>
<li><a href="http://cwis.isu.edu/~aytekreg/660/660syl.htm">MBA 660 - Technology to Support Teams</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>My <a href="http://cwis.isu.edu/~aytekreg/cob.htm">Business student Websites</a> page includes pointers to several categories of websites, including those that may be of interest to CIS, accounting, finance, 
marketing, and management students. Take a look - there are some good resources in there! </p>
<p><img src="images/rainban.gif" align=bottom width=600 height=5> </p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Much of my research revolves around investigations into the effective use of collaborative technologies. Fortunately, there is a wealth of information out there on the 
web about such things. To see some of what is available, go to the <a href="group.htm">Groupware page</a>. </p>
<p><img src="images/rainban.gif" align=bottom width=600 height=5> </p>
<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>When I'm not working, I like to spend my time with my wife, Tracy, and our two kids, Erica (age 11), and Logan (age 9). I enjoy running, x-country skiing, 
mountain biking, and an occasional tennis match. I'm also learning to downhill and telemark ski, although currently I'm pretty lousy. </p>

Research  partners come in many forms. Compaq has participated in a unique
relationship by providing resources that normally would be unavailable to
our college of business.
<P>
Compaq has been an important contributor to both the Idaho State University
and the <A HREF="../cds/cds.html">Simplot Decision Support Center</A>.
<P>
For the last two years they have loaned us hardware for use with our
portable decision support center, our information security initiative and
our software engineering program.
<P>
It has afforded our students a unique opportunity to work with equipment
from a state of the art hardware manufacturer.
<P>
Their partnership has allowed us to provide 13 students with scholarships
and research assistantships.
<P>
Computer Science and Computer Information Systems students have linked
portions of the Compaq home pages that they have found interesting to our
system:

<P>
Welcome to the third annual ISOC Symposium on Network and Distributed
System Security! Each year we seek to bring together researchers,
implementors, and users of network and distributed system security
facilities. This year our Program Committee has again done an
outstanding job of selecting a mix of technical presentations
and panel sessions to discuss and debate the issues we face today.
<P>
As we are all aware, the need for usable distributed system security
mechanisms is growing rapidly, tracking the growth and utilization
of the world-wide Internet. For a welcome change, the general
awareness of and interest in security is growing significantly
as well _ by commercial organizations, the media, and private
citizens. More than ever before, organizations will be looking
to you, the participants of this symposium, for both technical
solutions to specific problems and advice for the emerging public
policy debates.
<P>
I encourage you to take advantage of this Symposium to not only
listen to the presentations but also share your own experiences
and ideas with other attendees during the breaks and evening activities.
<P>
Many thanks are in order for the behind-the-scenes effort that
has culminated in this symposium: Tom Hutton &quot;secured&quot;
our new location at the Princess Resort; Donna Leggett has done
a superb job in handling the increased registration activities;
and Stephen Welke has brought our Proceedings into the electronic
age! I also want to commend the Program Co-Chairs, David Balenson
and Clifford Neuman, for their excellent work with the Program
Committee for pulling together the excellent program in which
you are about to participate. Without the hard work by all these
folks, this symposium would not have been possible.
<P>
As always, I want to thank all the authors who submitted papers
and the panelists who are participating by sharing their knowledge
and experiences with us.
<P>
Enjoy!

<H2>Program Chairs' Message</CENTER></H2>

<P>
In the past year, the public has increasingly been urged to enter
cyberspace and to use the Internet to obtain information from
vendors, order products, and even bank from home. At the same
time, businesses are being compelled to have a presence on the
Internet, making information available to customers and other
businesses. As a result, the need for network and distributed
system security has grown dramatically.
<P>
Today we find that the individuals trying to breach the security
of computer systems are using more sophisticated attacks, and
because such attacks now can yield business data or result in
financial transactions, these attacks have become more lucrative.
While the computer security discipline once addressed mostly hypothetical
threats, the press has recently taken notice when attacks known
by practitioners for years were suddenly perpetrated against widely-used
and heavily marketed products including web servers and browsers
and network file systems.
<P>
There is good news and bad news regarding the state of Internet
security. The good news is that most of the threats we are seeing
have been known for some time, and we know how to protect against
them. The bad news is that the solutions must still be integrated
with applications, many of the solutions require a computer security
infrastructure that is not widely available, and we have yet to
see widespread deployment of computer security technologies.
<P>
The organizers of this symposium hope that the symposium will
encourage the Internet community to deploy the available security
technology and develop new technology in areas where it is lacking.
In selecting papers and panels for the symposium, the program
committee sought to bring together the papers that will have the
greatest impact on the field by introducing new computer security
technologies whether research prototypes or actual products, demonstrating
the application of computer security technologies to Internet
applications, and describing components of the computer security
infrastructure.
<P>
By bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field
we are confident that the symposium will have a positive impact
on the state of Internet security. We encourage you, as a participant
in this symposium, to use this opportunity to actively participate
in the dialog. Ask questions of the speakers, raise your important
issues during relevant panel sessions, and let others know of
your requirements, observations, and experience in this important
area.

The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by Congress in 1972 
to provide congressional committees with analyses of emerging, difficult, and 
often highly technical issues.  Services include major assessment reports, 
background papers, briefings, and testimony.  OTA explores complex issues 
involving science and technology, helps Congress identify policy options, 
and provides foresight about new developments that could have important 
implications for future federal policy.  OTA does not advocate particular 
policies or actions, but points out their pros and cons, sorts out the facts, 
and provides options.<p>

The College of Business at Idaho State University is the repository for a classic scheduling program 
developed by the Department of Education. Not only do we 
support the original Fortran progam and documentation, but we 
also have students developing new interfaces and human factors 
models for working with scheduling systems.
<P>
This model has provided unequaled opportunities for our 
students to work with "real world" problems.
<P>
We must also thank Murray Spitzer and John Tressler from the

<p><a name="STUDENTHANDBOOK"><b>USING THE STUDENT HANDBOOK</b></a> </p>
<p>The purpose of this handbook is to provide a compact, comprehensive source of information 
on the Idaho State University accounting program. It is intended to help prospective students 
familiarize themselves with the Program and to aid the progress of students currently in 
accounting degree program. The handbook is not the sole source of information on the Idaho 
State University accounting program. In particular, we remind you that students are 
responsible for understanding and complying with the policies described in the Idaho State 
University catalogs. The University and College of Business policies described within the 
catalogs and this handbook are strictly adhered to by the accounting program. </p>
<p>This handbook is intended to aid, but not replace, the advising provided within the accounting 
program. It is not designed to cover unusual circumstances. In planning your specific program 
of studies and for answers to questions not covered in the handbook, we encourage you to 
seek help of your undergraduate or graduate advisor. </p>
<p>We hope that this handbook will be a useful supplement to our counseling in guiding you 
through your degree program. The faculty and staff sincerely wish that the time you spend as 
part of the Idaho State University accounting program will be both enriching and enjoyable. 
This handbook can help in achieving those goals; please read it carefully. </p>
<p><a name="ROLE"><b>ROLE AND MISSION OF THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT</b> </a></p>
<p>The Accounting Department, an integral part of the College of Business, shares the role and 
mission of its College and the University as established by the State Board of Education. Thus, 
the Department responds to current and emerging demands within the state and region and 
primarily serves local and statewide constituencies of students, accountants, and other 
interested parties. </p>
<p>The Department's primary mission is to offer a quality professional education in accounting. As 
such, the Department imparts business and accounting knowledge, develops competencies in 
emerging technologies, fosters learning skills, and promotes the pursuit of life-long learning. 
The Department also strives to enhance communication skills, interpersonal and leadership 
skills, and critical thinking abilities. Ethical awareness, with attendant standards and 
perspectives, is also encouraged. </p>
<p>The research mission of the Department complements and enhances the instructional mission. 
Research activities are conducted to improve the understanding of accounting theory and 
practice among the Department's main constituents. Thus, research and related activities are 
oriented primarily towards the needs of practitioners and students. Consequently, 
departmental research typically focuses upon behavioral aspects of accounting, teaching 
methodologies, emerging accounting issues, and tax legislation. </p>
<p>The service mission also addresses the needs of the Department's constituents. The 
Department seeks to use its expertise to enhance economic development in the region and to 
meet the continuing educational needs of business professionals and accountants. The 
Department encourages participation in and service to professional and community 
organizations. The Department also provides applied research and other assistance when 
needed by various organizations. </p>

<p><a name="EXPECTATIONS"><b>EXPECTATIONS</b> </a></p>
<p><a name="COMMENTS"><b>COMMENTS FROM TWO FORMER ISU STUDENTS</b> </a></p>
<p><b>(Rob Griggs and Brad Borden)</b> </p>
<p>Idaho State University offers a very intense program of study in accounting. Students who are 
not prepared for the rigorous demands encountered at ISU have great difficulty completing the 
program. Professors and the accounting material require a level of concentration and effort to 
which most students at the sophomore level have never been exposed. In order to meet the 
demands, students have to develop skills beyond memorization and regurgitation. In fact, 
students will find the program so challenging, that if they do not learn how to discipline 
themselves and prioritize activities, they will not be prepared for the challenge. </p>
<p>In addition to focusing on the skills mentioned above, students should also be prepared to 
participate in every accounting class when discussions arise. The number of students at ISU is 
relatively small. As a consequence, students have the chance to become familiar with the 
professors' teaching styles and the personalities of fellow students. This serves to the student's 
advantage if the student makes an effort to participate in class and group learning activities. 
However, this also requires that students be prepared for every class. Doing so will enhance 
the educational experience of every student in the program. </p>
<p>Outside of class, students should not only prepare for class, but also concentrate on 
developing professional skills and capabilities. As former students, we found that active 
participation in Beta Alpha Psi helped us develop many of the skills and capabilities listed in 
this section. We also found that the accounting faculty were always very helpful in helping us 
identify areas that needed improvement and ways to improve. Therefore, we strongly 
recommend that students seek the advice of their advisor and speak with other accounting 
professors when contemplating career choices and the need to participate in on-campus 
activities. </p>
<p>The accounting department at ISU appreciates being challenged by students. They realize that 
the field of accounting is very complex. Although each one of them is qualified for the position 
they fill, they understand that student participation is vital to a successful educational 
experience. Therefore, students should be attentive in class and question what is being said to 
learn more about the subject. Students should also feel free to discuss concerns that arise in 
any class concerning the instructor's style and effectiveness. Students should be sure to 
exercise intellectual integrity when doing so to ensure that their positions are well-founded and 
supported by facts or studies pertinent to the topic of discussion. </p>
<p><a name="THEROLE"><b>THE ROLE OF THE ACCOUNTING FACULTY</b> </a></p>
<p>Faculty members serve as guides to help students pursue successful accounting careers. The 
faculty challenges students to strive to the best of their abilities to master factual information 
and to apply that information. Consequently, classes are designed and presented by faculty in 
a manner that goes well beyond mere presentation of data. A successful class enhances each 
student's analytical abilities and strengthens his or her interpersonal leadership and 
communication skills. </p>
<p>Faculty also have a responsibility to certify to third parties that students have mastered the 
content of each course. While a faculty member tries to guide each student through the 
process, a level of independence must be maintained so that grading is proper and meaningful 
to others. Faculty have an obligation to the profession to maintain the highest standards in 
evaluating student success. </p>
<p>One advantage of ISU is its small size which allows personal attention to each student. While 
accounting topics may be presented in separate courses, the entire program is an integrated 
unit. The accounting faculty meets at least once each semester to discuss the progress of 
students in the program. If a student approaches the program properly, faculty will be readily 
available on a personal basis to enhance the student experience. <b>However, the ultimate 
responsibility for academic success lies with each student.</b> </p>
<p><a name="CHALLENGE"><b>CHALLENGE TO IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS</b> </a></p>
<p>Student must become familiar with the concepts and principles described in this section. 
Students need to become familiar with the principles that are contained in the &#147;Ethics 
Statement.&#148; Idaho State University strives to uphold the strictest level of ethics and encourages 
students to do the same. The world is in need of ethical professions, and Idaho State 
University is proud of its commitment to contributing to this need. </p>
<p>Each student should independently strive to understand and implement the learning to learn 
concepts mentioned in the &#147;Intentional Learning&#148; section. Students should regularly and 
systematically reflect upon their personal learning styles and behaviors. Students should be 
aware of their strengths and weaknesses, and should focus on developing skills that will 
compensate for weaknesses in their personal learning styles. </p>
<p>The list of capabilities is vital to accounting students who desire to be successful in the 
increasingly competitive profession. Students should refer to this list of capabilities frequently 
and regularly to identify areas where weaknesses exist, and to monitor progress in the 
developmental process. Students must be careful not to believe that some of these capabilities 
have been fully developed through prior experiences. Doing so will interfere, preventing the 
maximum benefit that an educational experience can provide. </p>
<p>Most of the concepts in this section are revisited at the beginning of the junior year. Through 
attending and participating fully in Acct 350, students will be able to work together to prepare 
the professional skills required for the profession. However, students will gain a competitive 
advantage if they consider applying and learning more about these principles prior to 
participating in Acct 350. </p>
<p><a name="GRADING"><b>GRADING</b> </a></p>
<p>Because of the many objectives of accounting courses, grading is much more than a 
quantitative analysis. Numbers may be used in the process, but they are minor portion of the 
overall evaluation. The instructor uses professional opinion to evaluate student success in 
meeting course objectives. In other words, grading is a qualitative assessment of a student's 
overall performance. </p>
<p>The instructor evaluates each student's professional attitude, including analytical skills, ability to 
communicate clearly in writing and verbally, and ability to work with others in small groups. In 
many ways, grading is similar to periodic subjective evaluation of a staff accountant by his or 
her supervisor. It is important that you treat your instructor as you would treat your supervisor. </p>
<p>Even though accounting topics are taught in separate courses, they all tie together into an 
integrated program. You should strive for understanding, not memorization. Memorized data 
will be lost in a very short time and is frequently not useful in a varied situations. You should 
utilize your classes as developmental opportunities directed toward a lifetime career. </p>
<p><a name="ETHICSSTATEMENT"><b>ETHICS STATEMENT</b></a><b> </b><a href="#FOOTNOTE_1"><b>[1]</b></a> </p>
<p>The following list of ethical principles incorporates the characteristics and values that most 
people associate with ethical behavior. The accounting program incorporates this code of 
ethics and expects all students and faculty to meet these standards. </p>
<p><b>Honesty </b>Be truthful, sincere, forthright, straightforward, frank, candid; do not cheat, steal, lie, 
deceive, or act deviously. </p>
<p><b>Integrity </b>Be principled, honorable, upright, courageous, and act on convictions; do not be 
two faced, or unscrupulous, or adopt an <i>end justifies the means</i> philosophy that ignores 
principles. </p>
<p><b>Promise Keeping</b> Be worthy of trust, keep promises, fulfill commitments, abide by the spirit 
as well as the letter of an agreement; do not interpret agreements in an unreasonably technical 
or legalistic manner in order to rationalize noncompliance or create excuses and justifications 
for breaking commitments. </p>
<p><b>Loyalty (Fidelity) </b>Be faithful and loyal to family, friends, employers, clients, and country; do 
not use or disclose information learned in confidence; in a professional context, safeguard the 
ability to make independent professional judgments by scrupulously avoiding undue influences 
and conflicts of interest. </p>
<p><b>Fairness</b> Be fair and open minded, be willing to admit error and, where appropriate, change 
positions and beliefs, demonstrate a commitment to justice, the equal treatment of individuals, 
tolerance for and acceptance of diversity, do not overreach or take undue advantage of 
another's mistakes or adversities. </p>
<p><b>Caring for Others</b> Be caring, kind, and compassionate; share, be giving, be of service to 
others; help those in need and avoid harming others. </p>
<p><b>Respect of Others</b> Demonstrate respect for human dignity, privacy, and the right to 
self-determination of all people; be courteous, prompt, and decent; provide others with the 
information they need to make informed decisions about their own lives; do not patronize, 
embarrass, or demean. </p>
<p><b>Responsible Citizenship </b>Obey just laws; if a law is unjust; openly protest it; exercise all 
democratic rights and privileges responsibly by participation (voting and expressing informed 
views), social consciousness and public service; when in a position of leadership or authority, 
openly respect and honor democratic processes of decision making, avoid unnecessary 
secrecy or concealment of information, and assure that others have all the information they 
need to make intelligent choices and exercise their rights. </p>
<p><b>Pursuit of Excellence </b>Pursue excellence in all matters; in meeting your personal and 
professional responsibilities, be diligent, reliable, industrious, and committed; perform all tasks 
to the best of your ability, develop and maintain a high degree of competence, be well 
informed and well prepared; do not be content with mediocrity; do not &#147;win at any cost.&#148; </p>
<p><b>Accountability </b>Be accountable, accept responsibility for decisions, for the foreseeable 
consequences of actions and inactions, and for setting an example for others. Parents, 
teachers, employers, many professionals, and public officials have a special obligation to lead 
by example, to safeguard and advance the integrity and reputation of their families, companies, 
professions and government itself; an ethically sensitive individual avoids even the appearance 
of impropriety, and take whatever actions are necessary to correct or prevent inappropriate 
conduct of others. </p>
<p><a name="INTENTIONALLEARNING"><b>INTENTIONAL LEARNING</b></a><b> </b><a href="#FOOTNOTE_2"><b>[2]</b></a> </p>
<p>Success in a career requires development of certain skills and capabilities. Among these skills 
are personal learning skills, which includes intentional learning. Students are also expected to 
develop other capabilities beyond accounting knowledge. </p>
<p>A component of intentional learning is learning to learn. Learning to learn is defined <b>&#147;as a 
process of acquiring, understanding, and using a variety of strategies to improve 
one's ability to attain and apply knowledge, a process which results from, leads to, 
and enhances a questioning spirit and a life long desire to learn.&#148;</b> </p>
<p>Academic programs focused on teaching students how to learn must address three issues: 1) 
content, 2) process, and 3) attitudes. </p>
<p>The <b><i>content</i></b> of the program must create a base upon which continued learning can be built. 
Developing both an understanding of underlying concepts and principles and the ability to 
apply and adapt those concepts and principles in variety of contexts and circumstances are 
essential to life-long learning. A focus on memorization of rules and regulations is contrary to 
the goal of learning to learn. </p>
<p>The <b><i>process</i></b> of learning should focus on developing the ability to identify problems and 
opportunities, search out the desired information, analyze and interpret the information, and 
reach a well-reasoned conclusion. Understanding the process of inquiry in an unstructured 
environment is an important part of learning to learn. </p>
<p>Above all, an <b><i>attitude</i></b> of continual inquiry and life-long learning is essential for learning to 
learn. An attitude of accepting, even thriving on, uncertainty and unstructured situations should

<p><a name="BBA"><b>THE BACHELOR OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION</b> </a></p>
<p>The undergraduate accounting degree program at ISU prepares accountants with broad 
knowledge in business and accounting suitable for entry level positions in the several career 
paths available to accountants. The program strives to produce graduates with the knowledge 
and skills necessary for successful professional accounting careers. The undergraduate degree 
emphasizes characteristics that promote success among graduates, including:<b> </b></p>
<ul>
<li>business and accounting knowledge; </li>
<li>capability and motivation for continued learning; </li>
<li>abilities to analyze, critique, and communicate; </li>
<li>interpersonal and leadership skills, and </li>
<li>rigorous ethical standards. </li>
</ul>
<p>Students are cautioned that completion of the B.B.A. degree alone will not satisfy the eligibility 
requirements to sit for the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination after the year 1999. 
Students intending to progress in a professional career in public accounting should plan to 
pursue a college degree with 150 credit hours. Graduates intending to progress in a 
professional career in either managerial or public accounting will benefit greatly from the 
additional breadth and depth offered by a graduate degree. The ISU Accounting program 
meets Idaho's legal requirements and provides the additional knowledge and skills demanded 
by a rapidly changing business environment with both a BBA in Accounting and an MBA with 
Emphasis in Accounting. </p>

<p>Beginning in the 1997-1998 academic year, the requirements for an accounting degree will 
change. Where CIS 381 is now required, it will no longer be required. However, students will 
be required to take CIS 220 and CIS 480. Students who start at ISU after spring 1997 will 
be required to comply with these new requirements. Students who have already begun the 
program are encouraged to take these courses, but may graduate under the catalog in effect 
when they started the program. </p>
<p><a name="PROBATIONANDDISMISAL1"><b>PROBATION AND DISMISAL</b> </a></p>
<p>At the end of any semester or summer session, undergraduate students will be placed on 
probation if their cumulative ISU grade point average is below 1.75 for 25 credits or less or 
2.0 for over 25 credits. </p>
<p>Students on scholastic probation who attain a GPA of 2.0 or higher during the next or 
subsequent semester after being placed on probation, but whose cumulative GPA is still below 
the minimum required for their rank, remain on scholastic probation. </p>
<p>Students on scholastic probation who attain a cumulative GPA higher than the minimum 
required on the scholastic probation scale are automatically removed from probation. </p>
<p>A student on probation will be dismissed at the end of any probationary semester or summer 
session in which the student obtains a GPA of less than 2.0 unless the grades earned in that 
semester or summer session are sufficient to take the student off probation. </p>
<p><a name="PETITION1"><b>PETITION</b></a> </p>
<p>A student may petition to the dean or the appropriate committee for consideration of problems 
of curricula or admission which are not covered by stated procedures. Curricular petitions 
must: 1) include a recommendation from the student's advisor, 2) a recommendation by the 
chair of the department offering courses in the subject field or by a special committee 
overseeing the requirements, and 3) catalog copy of descriptions of courses transferred from 
other institution if the course is to be considered in a test of course equivalency. All copies of 
the petition are to be advanced to the Registrar's Office for action after all signatures are 
affixed. Decisions may require several weeks, and notice of the result will be mailed to the 
student. A student may petition: </p>
<ol>
<li>Deletion of Idaho State University grades from computation in the grade point average 
(GPA) under the conditions which follow: <ol>
<li>When a student changes to a radically different curriculum, lower division 
courses which are not required in or appropriate to the new curriculum may be 
eliminated from computation or grade point averages for the purpose of 
determining probation or graduation at the discretion of the dean who has 
responsibility for the new curriculum. </li>
<li>Elimination of computation of courses from grade point average by petition also 
results in the elimination of corresponding course credits. </li>
<li>This adjustment will not be made until the conclusion of one semester in the new 
curriculum. </li>
<li>Courses that satisfy any general education requirements in the university cannot 
be removed from GPA computation, even if alternate courses meeting the 
requirement have been taken. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Academic dismissal and reinstatement. Students will be notified at mid-semester as to 
whether they are doing D or F work in any class. The students' advisors will also 
receive this information so they may work with the students to try to prevent 
probationary status. </li>
<li>Following dismissal, under the scholastic probation ruling, a student on first dismissal 
may be reinstated after a one-semester layout by petitioning the dean. A student on 
second dismissal may be reinstated after a one-year layout by petitioning the college 
dean. No more than two reinstatements will be permitted. A third dismissal is final. 
Students seeking reinstatement prior to expiration of the mandatory layout period may 
petition their dean. The summer session does not qualify for a semester layout. </li>
<li>Substitution of departmental requirements. A student may petition to substitute courses 
in lieu of departmental requirements. The course or courses the student wishes to 
substitutes must be approved by the department chairperson. </li>
<li>Substitution of the general education requirements. A student who transfers from 
another institution may petition to have courses with similar content but different titles 
than those offered at ISU substituted for courses listed in the general education 
requirements. Petitions must be approved by the department chairperson of the

<p><a name="MBA"><b>MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION WITH EMPHASIS IN ACCOUNTING </b></a><b></b></p>
<p>Following a national trend, Idaho law requires that a candidate sitting for the CPA examination 
after the year 1999 must have a college degree with 150 credit hours. While many accounting 
positions can be filled by individuals with a bachelor degree without a CPA certificate, 
graduates intending to progress in a professional career in either managerial or public 
accounting will benefit greatly from the additional breadth and depth offered by a graduate 
degree. </p>
<p>The program strives to produce graduates with the knowledge and skills necessary for 
successful professional accounting careers. Both the undergraduate and graduate degrees 
emphasize characteristics that promote success among graduates, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>business and accounting knowledge, </li>
<li>capability and motivation for continued learning, </li>
<li>competence in learning skills (including research of data bases), </li>
<li>abilities to analyze, critique, and communicate, </li>
<li>abilities to work effectively with others, </li>
<li>interpersonal and leadership skills, and </li>
<li>rigorous ethical standards. </li>
</ul>
<p>The undergraduate degree program prepares accounts with broad knowledge in business and 
accounting suitable for entry level positions in the several career paths available to 
accountants. The MBA Accounting Emphasis program enhances the knowledge and skills for 
rapid advancement in either managerial or public accounting. Students planning to pass the 
Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and Certified Management Accountant (CMA) 
examinations should continue beyond the BBA degree into the MBA. </p>
<p>Students who have gone through the graduate program at Idaho State University consistently 
pass the CPA exam. In 1993, Idaho State University was first in the nation, shattering the 
CPA pass record with a 70% pass rate. This phenomenon exemplifies the quality program 
offered at ISU. Why is ISU's rate consistently in the top 10 in the nation in passing the CPA 
exam? The reason is the quality of professors who foster a learning environment and the 
dedication of students who are willing to work very hard. </p>
<p>The program is designed to last one complete year (30 credits). The four courses constituting 
the accounting emphasis are offered in the spring of each year. Students taking these courses 
will also have to complete the six MBA II courses to earn an MBA. The required courses, 
although anchored in traditional functional fields are designed to provide a strong integrative 
focus building upon the competencies developed during a student's undergraduate years or 
developed in the first year of Graduate School (MBA I). In order to complete the program in 
one year, students will have to plan on taking at least two courses (6 credits) during one 
summer. </p>
<p><a name="ADMISSIONREQUIREMENTS2"><b>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</b> </a></p>
<p>To enroll in the Graduate Program at Idaho State University, all students must complete their 
undergraduate studies and take the GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test). The 
MBA program admits only those students that have met the minimum requirements of the 
program outlined in the Graduate Catalog. Applications must be completed and sent in by 
May 1st for summer admission, July 1st for fall semester admission, and December 1st for 
spring admission. </p>
<p>The GMAT is a standardized test administered four times a year at various locations across 
the country. The test consists of quantitative, writing, and analytical components. Students 
registering for the GMAT can pick up registration pamphlets at the MBA office located on the 
5th of the College of Business, the Office of Graduate Studies and Research located on the 
2nd floor of Fine Arts Building, or the Testing Center located on the 3rd floor in Gravely Hall. 
GMAT testing is offered at ISU twice a year-- in June and October. For exact dates, 
locations, and other information pertaining to the GMAT, please refer to the registration 
pamphlet and/or consult your advisor. </p>
<p>There are numerous companies offering home-study materials, software, or classes to help 
you prepare for the GMAT. For example, PrepMaster (1-800-325-5728), Kaplan 
(1-800-KAP-TEST), and The Princeton Review (1-800-955-3700) offer home-study 
materials, software, and classes. Idaho State University (College of Business), Utah State 
University (College of Business), and University of Utah (Adult Continuing Education) all offer 
classes with accompanying home-study materials. Barron's and GMAC offer study guides. 
Barron's study guide can often be purchased in book stores while GMAC's study guide must 
be ordered through the GMAT test registration booklet. These are only a small sample of the 
numerous study and preparation aids available. Students are strongly encouraged to study for 
the GMAT. </p>

There is nominal fee for graduation that must be paid before a student graduates. </p>
<p>Along with successfully completing the course requirements, students must pass an oral 
examination in order to graduate. The oral examination consists of an executive summary and 
presentation of a case. The case is given to the student two weeks prior to the presentation. 
The case will be presented to a panel of three professors, two from the College of Business 
and one from outside the College of Business. After the presentation the student who is 
presenting will be asked to leave the room while the three professors evaluate the student's 
performance. After evaluating the student's performance, the professors will notify the student 
whether he/she passed or not. In addition to the presentation, the student must turn in an 
executive summary three working days prior to the case presentation. This summary will also 
be a factor in determining whether or not the student passed. </p>

<p><a name="CAREERDEVELOPMENT"><b>CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND JOB PLACEMENT</b></a> </p>
<p><a name="Advising"><b>Advising</b> </a></p>
<p>Career advising is available through a variety of sources. Your academic advisor is a valuable 
source of information about careers in accounting. The Counseling and Testing Center on the 
third floor of Gravely Hall can also help you determine a career path if you are undecided. </p>
<p>Students pursuing an undergraduate degree program are assigned academic advisors to assist 
them with educational planning. Those fully accepted for admission who have indicated an 
intent to major in a specific program of study will be assigned an advisor by an academic 
advising coordinator in their respective college or department. </p>
<p>Students who are undecided about their program of study and others who have been identified 
as needing academic assistance are provided academic advising through the Supplemental 
Advising Center. Non-degree seeking students are not assigned advisors unless requested. </p>
<p>Students should always consult their advisor prior to registration to develop an appropriate 
plan of study. To receive this type of help, it is necessary to call your advisor well in advance 
to schedule an appointment. </p>
<p>Since deciding on a career and a course of study is so important, students are encouraged to 
strike out on their own and inquire of individuals who are already in the profession and to look 
for information about the accounting profession in other areas as well (i.e. the internet and 
fellow students). </p>
<p><a name="CareerPlanningandPlacement2"><b>Career Planning and Placement</b> </a></p>
<p>The Career Planning and Placement Center provides career guidance to students and alumni in 
both individual and group settings. This centralized student service program seeks to enhance 
the student's educational experience by promoting the development and implementation of 
career plans. </p>
<p>In assisting students with preparation for potential employment, the Career Planning and 
Placement Center provides the opportunity to open and maintain a credential file; helps 
construct an effective resume, and cover and follow-up letters; assists with preparation for the 
professional interview experience; and offers a wide range of weekly career-related 
workshops. The Center maintains a comprehensive Career Resource/Video library, fosters 
employer contacts, and keeps students informed of current job opportunities through a weekly 
vacancy bulletin and individual announcements.  The Center coordinates on-campus interviews, 
develops off-campus interview opportunities, provides a resume referral system, and 
promotes and maintains a positive working relationship between students and prospective 
employers. The Staff seeks to meet recruiter needs by helping students acquire knowledge of 
what various careers require and after, gain insight into employer expectations, and develop 
realistic views of the world of work in today's employment arena. </p>
<p>Students enrolled in their senior academic year (within one year of expected graduation) may 
register with the Center to gain several additional benefits. These include: entitling them to 
participate in on-campus interviews; receiving the weekly vacancy bulletin; having their 
resumes referred to employers for specific positions; receiving individualized notices of 
off-campus employment opportunities; and having five free sets of credentials mailed. 
Commencing with the sixth set of credentials requested, a fee of $2 is charged for each 
subsequent mailing. </p>
<p>Alumni wishing to reactivate their credential files will be charged a fee of $30. This fee will 
entitle them to receive the weekly vacancy bulletin and individualized notices of employment 
openings in their fields, participate in on-campus interviews, and request the mailing of five free 
sets of their credentials for a period of five free sets of their credentials for a period of one 
academic year. If the reactivating alumnus requests more than five sets of credentials be mailed 
during a given academic year, an additional $2 fee will be charged for each subsequent 
mailing. </p>
<p>An ISU alumnus who will graduate with a post-graduate degree from ISU will not be required 
to pay a fee to reactivate the credential file for a period of one year. However, if a 
post-graduate degree is earned from another institution a reactivation fee of $30 will be 
charged. </p>
<p><a name="Internships"><b>Internships</b> </a></p>
<p>Internships are career-related work experiences incorporating learning goals or an &#147;intentional

dynamic and worthwhile experience allowing students to test or experience accounting issues 
in a nonacademic environment. Interested students can find out more about available 
internships through the Career Planning and Placement service and through announcements 
made at Beta Alpha Psi meetings. Occasionally announcements of available internships are 
made in some accounting classes. </p>
<p><a name="STUDENTORGANIZATIONS"><b>STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS</b> </a></p>
<p>With the demands of accounting professionals continuously changing and becoming more 
competitive, it is necessary for students to supplement their technical training with activities that 
will develop equally important leadership and personal skills. The best place to develop the 
additional skills is in ISU's student organizations. Students who actively participate and make 
meaningful contributions to ISU's student organizations will enhance their educational 
experience and gain a competitive advantage in the workforce. ISU currently has two student 
organizations for accounting students &#150; Beta Alpha Psi and the ISU Accounting Association. </p>
<p><b>Beta Alpha Psi</b> </a></p>
<p>Beta Alpha Psi is an honorary fraternity with 115 chapters throughout the nation. The ISU 
chapter is called Eta Lambda. It is governed and run by accounting students at ISU each year. 
There are annual elections held each year to select students to serve as officers in the local 
chapter. Officers perform various functions and oversee the work of committees established 
within the organization. Officers also have the unique opportunity of going to national meetings 
to learn about the functions of Beta Alpha Psi and to receive training and instruction. These 
national meetings provide a unique opportunity for the officers as they are held in America's 
major cities and involves student chapters from all over the country. </p>
<p>All students have opportunities to develop leadership skills. Those students who do not serve 
as officers within the chapter have a number of opportunities to serve as a chairperson of one 
of the various committees. These positions provide invaluable experience as students plan, 
prepare, and delegate; interact with both students, professionals, and professors; and work to 
reach goals and complete tasks. </p>
<p>Students who do not serve as officers of as a chairperson of one the committees still have 
opportunities to serve and develop professional skills. Through serving on one of the various 
committees, students can interact with other accounting students and learn more about the 
organization and functions. In so doing, students will be prepared to chair committees in future 
years. Students will also have a chance to come in contact with professors and professionals 
through fulfilling and carrying out assignments within the committees. This exposure will 
provide students with insights into the profession and help them develop relationships and 
contacts that will prove invaluable in future employment endeavors. </p>
<p>Because Beta Alpha Psi is an honor society, members are required to meet certain 
requirements. Requirements include high ethical standards and a minimum grade point average. 
Scholastic requirements for Beta Alpha Psi include: </p>
<ol>
<li>Completion of at least one upper-division accounting courses at ISU with a minimum 
average GPA of 3.0 on all accounting courses taken. </li>
<li>Have a 3.0 cumulative GPA for all work completed in all courses. </li>
</ol>
<p>An active professional program is conducted by Beta Alpha Psi each year including guest 
speakers from the accounting profession, panel discussions, field trips, and other activities 
designed to promote professional awareness. Members of Beta Alpha Psi provide services to 
the School through the tutoring program. Services to the external community are provided in 
the form of VITA (voluntary income tax assistant) program and the Adopt-a-Highway 
program. </p>
<p>Students can join Beta Alpha Psi if they meet the requirements above and attend and actively 
participate in Beta Alpha Psi. There is a one-time fee paid to National Beta Alpha Psi to join 
and annual local dues for members. New members are honored each semester at an initiation 
banquet. </p>
<p><a name="ISUACCOUNTINGSOCIETY"><b>ISU ACCOUNTING SOCIETY</b> </a></p>
<p>The ISU Accounting Society participates in activities with Beta Alpha Psi. The requirements 
for membership are not as stringent as those for membership in Beta Alpha Psi, but students 
still have the opportunity to serve on Beta Alpha Psi committees and participate in Beta Alpha 
Psi activities. Such participation provides unique and valuable opportunities. </p>
<p>Active participation in Accounting Club/Beta Alpha Psi is very important for developing your 
professional skills. Accounting majors should join and become involved as soon as possible. 
The club provides many benefits to its members, including but not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>exposure to professional speakers </li>
<li>enhancement of leadership skills </li>
<li>exercise of entrepreneurial skills </li>
<li>getting to know the faculty and other students </li>

<p><a name="CPAREVIEWANDPREPCOURSE"><b>ISU/BETA ALPHA PSI CPA REVIEW AND PREP COURSE</b> </a></p>
<p>For many years, ISU has been able to boast a nationally recognized pass rate on the Uniform 
CPA exam. One of the reasons is that Beta Alpha Psi offers a unique review and prep course. 
The course is taught by expert accounting professionals teaching at ISU and utilizes materials 
developed by ISU professors and used in a nationally prominent review course produced by 
Accounting Institute Seminars, Inc. (AIS). </p>
<p>Students and professionals enrolled in the course have the unique opportunity to gain in-depth 
knowledge of the exam and to receiving instruction from some of the best instructors in the 
nation in their respective fields. In the past, students who have successfully passed the CPA 
exam contribute success to the principles taught in the course. Specifically, students attribute 
the scheduling, prioritizing, and analytical skills developed in the course to their success. 
Students have also found greater success when taking the course concomitantly with the 
Graduate level accounting courses. Together, the course and graduate courses, provide an 
intense program which develops the mind and prepares students for the CPA exam and 
beyond. </p>
<p>Students who are serious about pursuing a career in professional accounting should contact a

Financial Aid Office, a good starting point, is located on the third floor of the Museum Building 
(Room 337, phone 236-2756). Next door to the Financial Aid Office is the Scholarship 
Office, located on the third floor of the Museum Building (Room 327, phone 236-3315). The 
Idaho State University Undergraduate Catalog lists all resources to contact for information on 
financial aid and scholarships. </p>
<p>Scholarships are also available through the Undergraduate Studies Office in the College of 
Business, room 510. Scholarships are primarily based on academic performance at ISU but 
consideration is also given to those students with financial need. Applications are usually due 
March 1st for the following fall semester and November 15th for the following spring 
semester. </p>
<p>Students preparing to enter the MBA program at ISU can apply for graduate assistantships 
through the MBA office (BA 510). Appointments are for the nine-month academic year and 
require twenty hours of work per week. Students may be assigned to assist faculty, teach labs, 
develop software, or other duties needed by the department. Graduate assistantships offer a 
tuition waiver and a stipend of approximately $6000. Award decisions are based upon 
GMAT scores, undergraduate GPA, and the match between the department's needs and the 
skills and experience of the individual. Students must first be admitted to the MBA program to 
be considered for an assistantship. Applications are generally due two months before the first 
semester of study, however, interested students should confirm deadlines well in advance. </p>
<p><a name="SCHOLARSHIPSAVAILABLE"><b>SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE</b> </a></p>

<H2>Program Prerequisites</H2>
<HR>

<P>
<I>Mathematics Skills</I>: The minimum level of mathematics proficiency
required for the MBA program is a basic course in statistics and
one other advanced mathematics course (one with college algebra
as a prerequisite). If students have not completed this work,
they may do so in their first term in the program.
<P>
<I>Computer Skills</I>: Computer literacy is an essential skill
for business students both for success in the MBA program and
success in a professional business career. The minimum skills
required are the ability to use a word processor, a spreadsheet,
DOS, and Windows. Students are required to attend a non-credit
seminar during the first term in their programs to acquaint them
with the software and computing environment at Idaho State University.
<P>
<I>Communications skills</I>: Good communication skills are fundamental
for students and managers. Students are expected to have a high
degree of proficiency in both oral and written communication skills.
<P>
<I>Case Research and Analysis Skills</I>: The ISU MBA program
uses the case method extensively. Students are required to attend
a non-credit seminar on case research and analysis during the
first term in their programs. This seminar provides students with
faculty expectations for case analysis and class discussion. It
is also designed to expose students to the various skills and
library resources useful in doing case analyses.
<P>
<I>Team-building Skills</I>: ISU MBA classes use a considerable
amount of group effort for undertaking class assignments. Learning
to work effectively in groups is considered an important skill
in today's business organization. A non-credit seminar during
the first term of a student's program is required in the area
of team-building skills. This course provides an initial foundation
for group efforts in later classes.<HR>

<H3>Admission</H3>
<HR>

<P>
Admission to the MBA program is open to anyone holding a baccalaureate
degree from an accredited institution. Applicants are required
to submit official copies of all undergraduate transcripts, a
resume, and a Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score.
Foreign students are also required to submit a Test of English
as a Foreign Language Score (TOEFL).
<P>
Admission to the MBA program is granted only to students showing
high promise of success. The College of Business uses various
measures of high promise, including the candidate's performance
on the GMAT, upper-division grade-point average, and work experience.
Ordinarily such measures, along with other reasonable indications
of promise, will be used in combination to arrive at a final judgment.

<b>Welcome to the Fall 1997 Instructional Grant Program </b></font>
<br> 
<font size=2>
Microsoft sponsors the Instructional Grant Program to reward colleges and universities for their innovation and effectiveness at integrating new technologies into their courses.  Grants provide languages, tools, application and system software licenses to support computer science, engineering, information systems, math, science and business courses.  In exchange for the software licenses, faculty agree to provide curriculum resources and materials for sharing with other faculty at our Academic Cooperative Web site.

Please read all Grant Program documents before downloading the online grant application. 
If you still have questions after reviewing these pages, please send e-mail to <a href="mailto:GrantQuestion@msdeved.isu.edu">GrantQuestion@msdeved.isu.edu</a>.  The Instructional Grant Program is currently limited to higher education institutions in the United States & Canada.  High schools will be considered on a case by case basis.

<b>Grant Description and Requirements</b></a></font>
<font size=2>
<P> 
The Instructional Grant Program includes three levels of grant awards.  Microsoft will provide licenses for applications, developer language products, and operating systems.  The number and type of licenses awarded is dependent upon the level of the grant.  For 1997, the levels are:
<P> 
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Level 1</font></td>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Course Development Grant</font></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Level 2</font></td>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Team Builder/Infrastructure Development Grant</font></td></tr>	
<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Level 3</font></td>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Professional Development Grant</font></td></tr></table>
<P>		

Each department within a school is eligible to apply for the grant level of their choice.  The grant application and supporting materials must meet the requirements detailed below to be eligible for the level requested.  If an application does not meet the higher-level criteria, Microsoft may fund you at one of the lower levels if your application meets the requirements of that level.
<P>

Software available varies by level of award and is listed below. Schools will be required to purchase an initial copy of each of their selected software applications from their local reseller. Microsoft provides the additional licenses under this grant program. 
<P>

All levels of grants require course materials to be classified by Knowledge Groups. Knowledge Groups are  categories for classifying curricula traditionally covered in the technical areas -- Computer Science, Information Systems, and Software Engineering.  Each course taught may be categorized by one of the Knowledge Groups.  Courses can then be further categorized by the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) subsections for each Knowledge Group.  KSAs match the objectives of a course and are the fundamental building blocks of any curriculum.  We have defined Knowledge Groups and KSAs using the ACM draft standards for Computer Science and Information Systems curricula.  For more information about Knowledge Groups, see the Grant Application and related Help file.

<font size=3><a name="04">
<B>Upgrading Software</b></a></font>
<font size=2>
<P>

The Instructional Grant Program permits you to upgrade your software with new versions during the award period by acquiring one copy of the upgraded product and copying the upgraded software to all computers affected by the awarded licenses.  Rules for maintenance are different for the first and second years. 
<P>
<B>First Year Maintenance Upgrades</B> 
<P>
The software license agreement provided to grant recipients allows schools to update their labs with the latest version of application, language, database, and system software for which they receive a license under the grant program for a one-year period from the date of award. To upgrade the computers with software licensed through the grant program, the recipient needs to purchase from a reseller one copy of each product licensed under the grant program. 
<P>
<B>Second Year Maintenance Upgrades </B>
<P>
During the spring of 1998, all posted syllabi and course materials will be checked against the original applications. Those schools having met their commitments will receive an additional license that permits them to upgrade the software to the next version, as described in the paragraph above. 
<P>
<B>Upgrades Beyond the Second Year</B> 
<P>
There will be no further maintenance upgrades beyond the second year under this program. All licenses will continue to be current under grant for installed software. You will be able to continue using the software as is.

<b>Welcome to the Fall 1997 Instructional Grant Program </b></font>
<br> 
<font size=2>
Microsoft sponsors the Instructional Grant Program to reward colleges and universities for their innovation and effectiveness at integrating new technologies into their courses.  Grants provide languages, tools, application and system software licenses to support computer science, engineering, information systems, math, science and business courses.  In exchange for the software licenses, faculty agree to provide curriculum resources and materials for sharing with other faculty at our Academic Cooperative Web site.

Please read all Grant Program documents before downloading the online grant application. 
If you still have questions after reviewing these pages, please send e-mail to <a href="mailto:GrantQuestion@msdeved.isu.edu">GrantQuestion@msdeved.isu.edu</a>.  The Instructional Grant Program is currently limited to higher education institutions in the United States & Canada.  High schools will be considered on a case by case basis.

<b>Grant Description and Requirements</b></a></font>
<font size=2>
<P> 
The Instructional Grant Program includes three levels of grant awards.  Microsoft will provide licenses for applications, developer language products, and operating systems.  The number and type of licenses awarded is dependent upon the level of the grant.  For 1997, the levels are:
<P> 
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Level 1</font></td>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Course Development Grant</font></td></tr>
<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Level 2</font></td>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Team Builder/Infrastructure Development Grant</font></td></tr>	
<tr><td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Level 3</font></td>
<td align=left valign=top><font size="2">Professional Development Grant</font></td></tr></table>
<P>		

Each department within a school is eligible to apply for the grant level of their choice.  The grant application and supporting materials must meet the requirements detailed below to be eligible for the level requested.  If an application does not meet the higher-level criteria, Microsoft may fund you at one of the lower levels if your application meets the requirements of that level.
<P>

Software available varies by level of award and is listed below. Schools will be required to purchase an initial copy of each of their selected software applications from their local reseller. Microsoft provides the additional licenses under this grant program. 
<P>

All levels of grants require course materials to be classified by Knowledge Groups. Knowledge Groups are  categories for classifying curricula traditionally covered in the technical areas -- Computer Science, Information Systems, and Software Engineering.  Each course taught may be categorized by one of the Knowledge Groups.  Courses can then be further categorized by the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) subsections for each Knowledge Group.  KSAs match the objectives of a course and are the fundamental building blocks of any curriculum.  We have defined Knowledge Groups and KSAs using the ACM draft standards for Computer Science and Information Systems curricula.  For more information about Knowledge Groups, see the Grant Application and related Help file.

<P></font>
<font size=3><a name="04">
<B>Upgrading Software</b></a></font>
<font size=2>
<P>

The Instructional Grant Program permits you to upgrade your software with new versions during the award period by acquiring one copy of the upgraded product and copying the upgraded software to all computers affected by the awarded licenses.  Rules for maintenance are different for the first and second years. 
<P>
<B>First Year Maintenance Upgrades</B> 
<P>
The software license agreement provided to grant recipients allows schools to update their labs with the latest version of application, language, database, and system software for which they receive a license under the grant program for a one-year period from the date of award. To upgrade the computers with software licensed through the grant program, the recipient needs to purchase from a reseller one copy of each product licensed under the grant program. 
<P>
<B>Second Year Maintenance Upgrades </B>
<P>
During the spring of 1998, all posted syllabi and course materials will be checked against the original applications. Those schools having met their commitments will receive an additional license that permits them to upgrade the software to the next version, as described in the paragraph above. 
<P>
<B>Upgrades Beyond the Second Year</B> 
<P>
There will be no further maintenance upgrades beyond the second year under this program. All licenses will continue to be current under grant for installed software. You will be able to continue using the software as is.

<H2>What is the Simplot Decision Center?</H2>

<P>
The Simplot Decision Support Center (SDSC) is a facility designed
to increase group decision making effectiveness and efficiency.
The physical facility is valued in excess of $750,000. It is a
research and development effort of Idaho State University resulting
from the generosity of the Simplot Corporation. The Simplot Decision
Support Center if one of only a few dedicated facilities in the
nation and is available as a resource to both local and national
organizations.
<P>
Committees are the most common form of group decision making we
encounter. As we all know, most people love committee meetings. They
rank just above a root canal without anesthesia as their favorite
activity. The bad reputation of committees stems from a fundamental
flaw -- the way participants interact before, during and after
the meeting. Despite their reputations, the literature shows that
well run groups generally make better decisions by increasing
the interaction among individuals.
<H2>What Types of Problems Does the SDSC Address?</H2>

<P>
Some items that lead to non productive meetings are:
<UL>
<LI>An abandoned agenda.
<LI>Decisions were not reached.
<LI>Plans for follow-up were not made.
<LI>The meeting notes and recommendations are not documented.
<LI>One person tried to dominate the discussion.
<LI>Individuals with valid contributions did not make them.
<LI>Creative ideas were limited by negative comments
</UL>
<p>
The SDSC is designed to support the Group Decision Support systems
(GDSS) process. This process improves the quality of group decisions
by removing the most frequent impediments to good decision making.
<P>
<H2>Simplot Decision Support Center Users</H2>

<P>
The Simplot Decision Support Center attracts users from around
the world to Pocatello, Idaho:

<TITLE>Welcome to the Office of Technology Assessment</TITLE>

<H1>Welcome to the Office of Technology Assessment</H1>
<HR>

The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by Congress in 1972 
to provide congressional committees with analyses of emerging, difficult, and 
often highly technical issues.  Services include major assessment reports, 
background papers, briefings, and testimony.  OTA explores complex issues 
involving science and technology, helps Congress identify policy options, 
and provides foresight about new developments that could have important 
implications for future federal policy.  OTA does not advocate particular 
policies or actions, but points out their pros and cons, sorts out the facts, 
and provides options.

<TITLE>About OTA</TITLE>
<H1>About OTA</H1>
<hr>
<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="process.html">Assessment Process</A></B>:
OTA undertakes assessments at the request of the Chairman of any 
congressional committee.  The Chairman may request the work personally, 
on behalf of a ranking minority member, or on behalf of a majority 
of committee members.  The OTA Board may also request work, as can 
the Director.  In practice, most studies are requested by the Chairman 
and the Ranking Member of a Committee, and many are supported by 
more than one committee.<P>
OTA staff reviews requests to determine whether resources are 
available, whether OTA can effectively provide the information, and 
whether interest is broad and bipartisan.  The OTA Director submits 
proposals to the Technology Assessment Board, which makes the final 
decision on whether to proceed.  The OTA Board reviews all major 
studies prior to release.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="tab.html">Technology Assessment Board</A></B>:
A 12-member bipartisan congressional board of six Senators and six 
Representatives governs OTA.  The chairmanship and vice chairmanship
alternatve between the Senate and House in succeeding Congresses.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF ="taac.html">Technology Assessment Advisory Council</A></B>:
An advisory council of 10 eminent citizens from industry, academia, and elsewhere outside the federal government are appointed by the Board to advise the Agency.  The Comptroller General of the United States
and the Director of the Congressional Research Service serve as
statutory members.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="herd.html">Director</A></B>:
The Technology Assessment Board appoints OTA's Director for a 
six-year term.  Roger Herdman, the current director, was appointed 
to his first term in 1993.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="orgcht.html">Organization</A></B>: OTA is organized into six programs and has a staff of about 200, of which two-thirds are the professional research staff.  Among the research staff, 88% have advanced degrees, 58% with PhD's, that span the disciplines.  About 40% of the research staff are temporary appointments of professionals recruited specifically to staff ongoing assessments.

<LI><B>Advisory Panels</B>:
OTA assembles an advisory panel of stakeholders and experts for 
each major study to ensure that reports are objective, fair, and 
authoritative.  These panels meet two or three times during a study. 
They help to shape studies by suggesting alternative approaches, 
reviewing documents, and critiquing reports at the final stages. 
No attempt is made to develop consensus among panel members; in 
fact, a wide diversity of views is sought.  OTA retains full responsibility 
for the content and conclusions of each report.  In all, nearly 5000 outside panelists and workshop participants come to OTA annually to help OTA in its work.<P>
<LI><B>Contractors</B>:
For specific information or analysis, OTA contracts with key individuals 
or organizations.  Contractors may analyze data, conduct case studies, 
or otherwise provide expertise to complement staff capability.<P>
<LI><B>Reviewers</B>:
Many people assist with the studies by participating in technical 
workshops, providing information, reviewing documents, or just talking 
with OTA staff.  The involvement of people with differing backgrounds 
and interests greatly strengthens OTA work.  Extensive formal review 
of studies is conducted by OTA staff and outside experts.<P>

<P> Listed below, by program name, is descriptive information about assessments currently in progress 
at OTA.  Information for each assessment includes title, abstract, 
project director and phone number, estimated publication date, and 
requesting committees.  The project publication dates for ongoing 
work are the best current estimates but they are subject to change 
both to allow for uncertainties inherent in research, and because 
OTA must frequently shift its priorities to match evolving congressional 
needs.

<p>My <a href="http://cwis.isu.edu/~aytekreg/cob.htm">Business student Websites</a> page includes pointers to several categories of websites, including those that may be of interest to CIS, accounting, finance, 
marketing, and management students. Take a look - there are some good resources in there! </p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Much of my research revolves around investigations into the effective use of collaborative technologies. Fortunately, there is a wealth of information out there on the 
web about such things. To see some of what is available, go to the <a href="group.htm">Groupware page</a>. </p>
<p><img src="images/rainban.gif" align=bottom width=600 height=5> </p>
<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
<p>When I'm not working, I like to spend my time with my wife, Tracy, and our two kids, Erica (age 11), and Logan (age 9). I enjoy running, x-country skiing, 
mountain biking, and an occasional tennis match. I'm also learning to downhill and telemark ski, although currently I'm pretty lousy. </p>

<P>
 This class is designed to provide the student with the basic computer
competency/literacy to proceed with a college education and career.
 It will involve a basic knowledge of both hardware and software
as well the technology of the computer revolution/ evolution.
 We will work with IBM compatible computers and emphasize the
personal computer.<BR>

<P>
 The attached syllabus identifies the chapter for each week's
lecture, although we may vary depending on class interest and
motivation during the lecture series.  It is to your advantage
to study the reading material prior to each lecture and lab. 
You will retain more from each lecture and lab if you study and
read the material assigned from your text and lab manual.<BR>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=Right ALT="Figure 1 - ENIAC COMPUTER" SRC="eniac.GIF">
<P>

 We meet for two 50 minute lectures each week and once a week for
lab (two hours - hands-on experience) time.  Additional material
(out-of-book) is discussed during lecture and there will be at
least three pop-quizzes during the semester.  You are tested on
material from lecture, text book, and lab.  Your grade is determined
along the following weighted scale:<BR>

<P>
Lecture exams (3) 40%
<P>
Final exam <I>(<B>Comprehensive</B></I><B>)</B> 25%
<P>
Questions  and pop-quizzes 10%
<P>
Lab work 25%<BR>
<BR>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<B>QUESTION SETS</B>
<P>
 The question sets are stored weekly on the ISU network for your
completion with a word processor for submission the following
week. These weekly question sets are due during class on the established
date and there is a penalty for late turn-ins:
<UL>
<LI>Turn-in after class and up to one day (24 hours) late reduces
the total grade by 10 points;
<LI>If the assignment is turned-in after that, the grade is reduced
by one-half (a 90% becomes 45%).
<LI>Assignments are not accepted after one week (with exception
of documented illness).
</UL>

<P>
Completing the questions will increase your competency of the
Greek-like terms and concepts associated with the silicon idol.
 DO YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT WORK!!  Submitting someone else's questions
will result in a <U>zero</U> for 10% of your CIS 120 grade.  This
will also involve the use of CD-ROM technology.<BR>

<P>
<B>LAB WORK</B>
<P>
The lab meets a each week and attributes 25% of your CIS 120 grade.
 The assignment is available at lab time and due at the end of
each lab period (barring equipment failure).  We often will discuss
the lab assignment during lecture.  Also, a lecture on the topic
of the week is provided at the first of the lab session.    You
must complete your work in lab during the time allotted (2 hours).
There is a final in the lab which constitutes 50% of your lab
grade.<BR>

<P>
<B>EXAMS</B>
<P>
Contact your instructor prior to an exam if you are unable (deathly
ill) to attend an exam, otherwise, no credit is given and a zero
is assigned for that opportunity.  Anyone found cheating (see
student handbook) will receive a minimum of a zero for that exam
(or a 'F' for the class).  The comprehensive finals will require
a picture ID for admission.  <BR>

<P>
Final grades are assigned along the following distributions:<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At the completion of this course, you should have
a strong foundation in the principles of structured programming
and increased exposure to critical thinking and technology.  Specifically,
this course introduces the techniques for good programming practice,
and provides the basis for learning more about the processing
of data and file structures in CIS 221.<BR>
</FONT>
<H1><FONT SIZE=2>The above objectives can only be obtained through
experience with a programming language.  Therefore, you will spend
<I>considerable </I>effort in this course designing, coding, and
debugging Visual Basic 4.0 programs.  While the concepts taught
in this course are relatively simple, when used together in a
large program the cognitive complexity of their interrelations
can be challenging and time consuming.</FONT></H1>

<H2>Student Responsibilities</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Students are responsible for preparing for class
by reading pre-assigned readings and other completing assignments.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Students may collaborate on design and programming
issues.  This does NOT include duplication of programs or form
designs.  Collaboration should be use to find bugs in programs
or to solve program syntax and general structure problems. Copying
of code, regardless of the number of editor changes, renaming,
and/or retyping is considered cheating, and a student's inability
to describe the function of a handed-in assignment will be considered
defacto evidence of cheating. Cheating will be dealt with in the
strongest possible terms including expulsion from the University
is possible.</FONT>
<H2>Virus Infected Disks</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Assignments handed in on disk will be virus scanned.
 Any assignments turned in on a virus infected disk will be returned
without being graded.  The assignment may be turned in again with
the usual <B>Late Assignment Policy</B> acting from the original
assignment due date.</FONT>
<H2>Late Assignment Policy</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day including
weekends from the time the assignment is due.  Assignments turned
less than 24 hours after the due date will be penalized for one
day (10%).  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NOTE: Late assignments may be mailed to: <B>beard@isu.edu</B>
to avoid missing points for weekends, and such. Any address other
that this is unacceptable.  Any mailed assignment will be graded
based on the delivery time listed on the CIS server system.</FONT>
<H2>Program Requirements</H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All programming assignments must conform to the variable
and object naming standards listed in <B>Appendix II </B>of this
syllabus except when specifically mentioned when the assignment
is assigned.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In general programs will be graded based on meeting
assignment specifications, use of standard interface design, modular
code, code readability, and internal documentation.  Code readability
includes indenting and formatting code so that it may be easily
read.  A concise block comment should be placed at the top of
each procedure and function including your name, date, and a single
sentence without &quot;ands&quot; or &quot;ors&quot; that exactly
describes what the function or procedure does.  Additional documentation
should be included in critical places through the code to explain
specific situations and decisions.  See <B>Appendix III</B> for
examples of code documentation and code format.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A well-styled minimal working program is necessary
for a &quot;B&quot; grade on a programming assignment; an &quot;A&quot;
grade will be given for well-styled working solutions that incorporate
additional visual basic controls and features. Only solutions
that are substantially working are acceptable; non-working solutions
will receive a grade of &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F&quot;.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NOTICE:  As of assignment 3, all modules and forms
MUST have in their &quot;Declaration&quot; section must have the
key word &quot;Option Explicit&quot; defined and each variable
must be defined using a &quot;DIM&quot; statement.</FONT>

Collaboration should be use to find bugs in programs or to solve program syntax and general structure problems.  Individual procedures may be duplicated between students; however, these procedures / function may not account for more than 10% of the total line count of the program.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Any procedure / function that is to be copied from one student to another or from another source must have the name of the original programmer / source at the top of the procedure - this includes procedures duplicated and then modified to meet slightly different needs.  See <B>Appendix III</B> for examples of code documentation.  Failure to document the source of any code is considered cheating / plagiarism and appropriate measures will be taken.</P>

<P>In general programs will be graded based on meeting assignment specifications, use of standard interface design, modular code, code readability, and internal documentation.  Code readability includes indenting and formatting code so that it may be easily read.  Internal documentation should be placed at the top of each procedure and function to describe its what the procedure should do.  Additional documentation should be included in critical places through the code to explain specific situations and decisions.  See <B>Appendix III</B> for examples of code documentation and code format.</P>

<p>The primary objective of this course is to give Accounting,
Computer Information Systems, Computer Science and business
students an opportunity to practice the skills acquired in the
other courses. Elements will be drawn from CIS 382, 381, 220,
221, 480, Acct. 201, 202, 241, FIN 315, MKT 325 and M&amp;O 216,
217, 329. Understanding of basic accounting, finance and marketing
principles is also useful. The course is experiential in nature
i.e., the student will be required to produce results for use by
real individuals and will be evaluated both on process and product.
The course is based on the Intentional learning processes. </p>

<h2>Philosophy: </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>&quot;Men are men before they are lawyers, or
    physicians, or merchants, or manufacturers; and if you make
    them capable and sensible men, they will make themselves
    capable and sensible lawyers or physicians. What professional
    men should carry away with them from an University, is not professional
    knowledge, but that which should direct the use of their professional
    knowledge, and bring the light of general culture to
    illuminate the technicalities of a special pursuit. Men may
    be competent lawyers without general education, but it
    depends on general education to make them philosophic
    lawyers--who demand, and are capable of apprehending, principles,
    instead of merely cramming their memory with details. And so
    of all other useful pursuits, mechanical included. Education makes
    a man a more intelligent shoemaker, if that be his
    occupation, but not by teaching him how to make shoes; it
    does so by the mental exercise it gives, and the habits it impresses.&quot;</i>
    -- J. S. Mill, Inaugural Address at St. Andrews </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Schedule: </h2>

<p>The class will meet at 08:00 Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
About 75% of class time will be devoted to group activities. The
remainder will be involved in student faculty interactions. In
order to complete the projects, you will be expected to
participate in group/class activities outside the scheduled
period. Early in the course, I may lecture on basic subjects
needed to get the team moving. In addition, I will prepare
special lectures on issues the group considers important. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Project: </h2>

<p>During the term, a series of projects will be assigned to the
class. The number, frequency and complexity will be determined by
the professor during the term. I will be assuming many roles during
the class. If there is a question about the role, ask me. I may
be a venture capitalist, a customer, a competitor, a facilitator,
etc.. It is the responsibility of the class to establish organizational
structures to carry out these projects using professional
standards. For each project, the class will be responsible for
the following minima: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Business Plan</li>
    <li>Feasibility analysis and proposal </li>
    <li>Cost estimates </li>
    <li>Project schedules </li>
    <li>Hardware and software recommendations (if appropriate) </li>
    <li>Progress reports </li>
    <li>Final reports including <i>inter alia</i> <ol type="a"
        start="1">
            <li>Documentation </li>
            <li>Operating instructions </li>
            <li>Software </li>
            <li>Training materials </li>
            <li>Software repair procedures </li>
            <li>Procedure documents </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Grading: </h2>

<p>You are required to maintain a hardbound contemporaneous
journal of your activities associated with the course </p>

<ol>
    <li>Group Projects Outcome 60% </li>
    <li>Individual Evaluation 30% </li>
    <li>Journal/Log book 5% </li>
    <li>Initiative 5% </li>
</ol>

<p>Since this course is participatory in nature, no provision is
made for missed work. All work is due not later than one week
prior to the scheduled final examination </p>

<p>Think About The Following: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Are there ethical considerations you have missed while
        doing the project? </li>
    <li>How would one calculate the payback on a project? </li>
    <li>Explain how to calculate the break-even point of a
        project. </li>
    <li>Explain the relationship between top down design and
        bottom up testing. </li>
    <li>Could your project be marketed overseas? </li>
    <li>Explain structured walk-through in detail including
        participants and outcomes. </li>
    <li>What is the time relationship between programming,
        documentation, design, and testing? </li>
    <li>What are the components of a system proposal? </li>
    <li>What is work breakdown structure? </li>
    <li>Explain dataflow diagrams and their relationship to
        organization charts, program flowcharts, and system
        flowcharts. </li>
    <li>What is the difference between a requirement and a
        specification? </li>
    <li>What is the relationship between the systems analyst and
        the system tester? </li>
    <li>Could your organization be viable in the 'real world'</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Final Comments: </h2>

<p>Please remember, this course is not a textbook or case course
(CIS 382). The clients will be real people with real problems.
You are an essential element in a group of professionals who must manage
the projects to solve your clients' problems. I suggest that you
select a leader and get started. You are empowered to fire your
team members. This action should not be taken lightly. It does
not fail the student in the class...It returns the student to the
environment. If you exercise this option, you should follow your
published organizational procedures. If the student protests the firing,
I will convene a review board consisting of two faculty and one
alumnus of the 482 class. The decision of the review board will
be final.</p>

<p>The professor reserves the right to include a final
examination in the course (replacing Project Outcome) if it is
believed that the class has not grasped the important elements of
the course. The final examination in the course will be a
comprehensive essay and case. The student should be able to
integrate the contents of the experiential activity, readings and
lecture. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Text Book: </h2>

<p>In addition to <i>TQM In Software Development</i>, AND The <i>Mythical
Man Month</i> you are expected to purchase any materials you need
to run your company and use the library and other sources for
reference. If it appears that a substantial outlay of funds will
be necessary, notify me.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Software: </h2>

<p>As part of our curriculum development and upgrade process, all
software developed for this course will be for a Windows NT/95
environment. The following Microsoft development packages are available
for your use:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Visual Basic</li>
    <li>Visual C++</li>
    <li>Visual J++</li>
    <li>FrontPage 97</li>
    <li>Publisher 97</li>
    <li>Fortran PowerStation</li>
    <li>Office 95 Pro</li>
    <li>SQL Server</li>
    <li>BackOffice</li>
    <li>Visual Test</li>
    <li>Visual Source Safe</li>
</ol>

<p>You will be expected to manage the projects using Microsoft
Project 95. Your presentations will be made to the clients using
PowerPoint.</p>

<p>This software was made available through a Microsoft Academic
Cooperative Grant.. </p>

<p>Quizzes may occur at any time. There will be no make-up for
these. I expect all written work to be Emailed to me and posted
on the class web page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>Research Paper:</b> </p>

<p>The research paper topic will be established by agreement with
the professor. The paper will should contain original research
components. I expect you to submit it for presentation or
publication in some regional or national forum. It is anticipated
that CS majors will focus on more technical issues while CIS
majors will focus on the more managerial topics. All papers will
reflect a knowledge of the McCumber model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>Lectures</b></p>

<p>In general the U.S. Government will be used as the information
security model. This is generalizable to the needs of the private
sector. Early lectures in the course will emphasize the
philosophy, legal and policy issues associated with security and
privacy. This will be followed by sections on Security History,
Access controls, Viruses, Planning, Administration,
Communication, Encryption, Networks, and Physical security.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>Text Book:</b> </p>

<p>There are three texts for the course.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Information Security Modules (Green Book) Free</li>
    <li>Computer Security Basics, Russel and Gangemi ~$30.00</li>
    <li>CDROM Encyclopedia of Information and Security Terms.
        When available ~ $5.00</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Additional Readings</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Machivelli, <i>The Prince</i> </li>
    <li>Dickens, <i>Hard Times</i> </li>
    <li>Snow, <i>The Two Cultures</i></li>

Computerworld's 1996 Skills Survey will be published November 18. This 
is the first in a series of exclusive online previews. 
<hr>

<p>
From Atlanta to Dallas to Phoenix, the high demand for Visual Basic 
skills shows no signs of slowing. 
Salary premiums for permanent Visual Basic workers range from 3% to 16%, 
depending on the region and the nature of the work. 
"A lot of the skills are transferable. If you know Visual Basic, [it 
will be easier] to use PowerBuilder or some other visual programming 
language. It's a good item to have on a resume." <br>
-- John Kile,
<p>
Eli Lilly & Co. <br>
There seem to be only two constants in the information systems job 
market: The demand for skilled workers far outstrips the supply, and 
what is hot today may be frozen next week. 
<p>
The trick for IS professionals is to stay on top of the career 
opportunities for various technology skills, and to invest in the ones 
that are right for their portfolios. One skill that has been in much 
demand is Visual Basic and, according to a forthcoming Computerworld 
survey of IS hiring managers, it will remain so for the immediate 
future. In fact, those managers say it will be the most sought-after 
development skill of all. What follows is some information on how to 
build your VB skills, what they're worth and where they might be going 
in the future. 
<h3>By popular demand </h3>
<p>
Demand for every IS skill is increasing at an exponential rate, and 
Visual Basic is right on the leading edge. 
<p>
From Atlanta to Dallas to Phoenix, the high demand for Visual Basic 
skills shows no signs of slowing. So says Shannon Brandon, director of 
professional services division at Matrix Resources, Inc, a recruiter and 
consultancy with offices in the South and Southwest. Indeed, 
Computerworld's upcoming annual skills survey (to be published Nov. 18) 
finds it will be the most hired-for development tool next year. 
<p>
"We're seeing it all across the board -- everything from manufacturing 
to banking to service organizations," says Brandon. "It's probably the 
most prevalent requirement we get from a development tool standpoint." 
<p>
Visual Basic skills top the most wanted list on the East Coast and 
throughout the industrial Midwest, says Jack DeTurk, president of DP Job 
Works, an Indianapolis-based recruiter. 
<p>
As DeTurk sees it, IS professionals with Visual Basic skills can land 
jobs in everything from manufacturing applications to account and 
financial applications.

It pays (well!) to know Visual Basic

</TABLE>
<p>
Shows what you know! 
<p>
Demand is increasing because applications are easier to put together in 
Visual Basic. Mastering this skill shows that you've got a solid 
background in visual programming. 
<p>
Part of the reason for the sustained high demand for Visual Basic, says 
John Kile, a systems analyst involved in hiring for Eli Lilly & Co., is 
its ease of use and versatility. 
<p>
"A lot of the skills are transferable. If you know Visual Basic, [it 
will be easier] to use PowerBuilder or some other visual programming 
language. It's a good item to have on a resume." 
<p>
Peggy Martinus, Chicago branch manger for consultants Greenbrier & 
Russel, believes that acquiring Visual Basic skills is definitely a good 
career move. "Some companies only use Microsoft skills," he says. "In 
general, knowing any GUI tool is an advantage."

<h3>Playing this game </h3>

Of the development tool skill sets, probably the highest-paying are 
Visual C++, Visual Basic and Powerbuilder. 
<p>
Investing in Visual Basic can certainly show dividends in your weekly 
paycheck, says Brandon. "Visual Basic may not be the highest paid of the 
three, but it's right up there close to it." 
<p>
Computerworld's forthcoming annual skills survey (to be published Nov. 
18) reveals that salary premiums for permanent Visual Basic workers 
range from 3% to 16%, depending on the region and the nature of the 
work. 
<p>
That premium may not come directly from an employer, however. There 
appears to be an increasing trend for companies to go outside their own 
ranks to fill their needs for VB skills. Contract consultants, according 
to the Computerworld survey, can command salary premiums of 5% to 18%. 
<p>
"As outsourcing continues to develop, the compensation level for what we 
like to call permanent employees probably gets pretty close to a 
standstill," says DeTurk. "Contracting inevitably drives internal 
salaries and wage increases down."

<h3>Tops in it's field</h3>

IS managers say Visual Basic will be their most sought-after development 
tool in 1997. The percentage that will hire for the skill are:REGION 
PLAN TO HIRE New England 38% Middle Atlantic 20% East North Atlantic 27% 
West North Atlantic 32% South Atlantic 20% East South Central 22% West 
South Central 20% Mountain 18% Pacific 26% Total 24%  
<p>
There seems to be almost as many ways to come by Visual Basic skills as 
there are applications for them, from home study to on-the-job 
experience to formal classroom endeavors. 
Easy to come by 
<p>
Visual Basic is a tool that a lot people can pick up on their own. 
Individual programmers can buy the tool and it's not expensive. 
<p>
There seems to be almost as many ways to come by Visual Basic skills as 
there are applications for them, from home study to on-the-job 
experience to formal classroom endeavors. 
<p>
Martinus points out that while employers will often foot the bill for 
training, even when they don't "it certainly isn't a hard class to come 
by." 
<p>
Whether VB is learned on the job, by the book or in an academic setting, 
it is clear that any investment of time or money will pay for itself in 
short order, a fact that recent IS grads seem to have realized. 
<p>
Brandon says most of his Visual Basic people are younger. "We don't see 
that many mainframers moving over. In general, our primary candidate 
base is [people who] just came out of school." 
Seeing the future 
<p>
Right now, the short-term demand is pretty hot. It is definitely still a 
tool of choice. But in three years, even two years, who knows? 
<p>
Bearing in mind the aforementioned constants of the IS world, it is 
difficult to tell what the long-term appetite for Visual Basic will be. 
The near future is easier since many VB projects are already under way, 
and companies with large investments in a particular tool are likely to 
stick with it, if for no other reason than to save face. 
<p>
Brandon is confident. "We don't see demand slowing down anytime soon," 
he says. And marketing is sure to play a role in Visual Basic's future. 
"After all," says Brandon, "having the Microsoft name tagged onto it 
doesn't hurt."

<h2>Microsoft Unveils 'Internet Studio' at Site Builder Conference</h2>
<p>
Newest Microsoft Visual Tool for Active Server-Based Web Application 
Development Takes Full Advantage of Active Platform Initiatives and Products
<p>
   SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)
today delivered an alpha version of its highly anticipated Web application
development tool, code-named "Internet Studio," to more than 2,000 attendees
at the Microsoft(R) Site Builder Conference.  A public beta version of Internet
Studio will be available for downloading from the Microsoft Web site later
this year.
<p>
   Internet Studio is the complete, integrated development tool for building
Active Server Web applications based on open Internet standards.  Internet
Studio enables developers to take full advantage of server-side processing
using Active Server Pages and Active Data Objects -- new features of Microsoft
Internet Information Server (IIS) version 3.0.  In addition, Internet Studio
enables developers to incorporate Active Desktop features such as advanced
HTML, ActiveX(TM), Java(TM) and scripting in the Visual Basic(R) programming
system, Scripting Edition or JScript.
<p>
  "The vision for Internet Studio is to make it easier to build dynamic Web
applications that use server-side processing and corporate databases," said
Bob Muglia, vice president, developer tools at Microsoft.  "In the past,
developers have had to jump through hoops to build such applications. Internet Studio
integrates the Active Server and Active Desktop tools in an easy-to-use,
visual development environment."
<p>
<h3>Internet Studio Makes Web Development Easier, Drives Web Benefits for
Businesses</h3>

   Businesses have rapidly adopted Web technologies for building intranet and
Internet Web applications because of the seamless deployment, cross-platform
accessibility, and low-bandwidth capabilities they provide.  At the same
time, the demand for richer, more user-driven and interactive experiences within
these applications has increased the complexity of both Web server and client
development. For example, connecting Web applications with corporate
databases while preserving the security and data integrity required for a
mission-critical application has been very difficult.
<p>
   "Our customers want solutions based on industry standards to address the
70 percent to 80 percent of their internal development that requires database
access," said Ken Miller, chief technology officer of 32X Inc., a leading
solution provider.  "Internet Studio provides the solution they're looking
for by delivering platform-independent HTML to the front-end browser and easy,
reliable access to virtually any database on the back end."
<p>
<h3>Internet Studio Builds Upon Active Server Platform</h3>

   Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 provides server-side scripting
(with both VBScript and JScript), state management and access to Active
Server Components.  Internet Studio provides a work space for building the Active
Server Pages that provide these features to Web applications.  In many cases,
Internet Studio automatically creates the logic and Active Server Pages for
the developer.
<p>
   Active Server Components are any COM-based component that runs on IIS. For
example, a financial analysis component (developed as a dynamic-link library
[.DLL] or executable [.EXE] component) could be integrated into the Web
application using Internet Studio to provide investment results that are
returned to the client as standard HTML. Active Server Components can be
developed in any COM-enabled tool, including future versions of Microsoft
Visual Basic, the Visual C++(R) development system, the Visual J++(TM) development
tool and third-party tools.
<p>
<h3>Integrated Data Connectivity Tools</h3>

   Internet Studio enables developers to add data connectivity to their Web
applications, making their sites smarter and more interactive.  Internet
Studio provides this functionality through the use of the following features:
<p>
  -- Design-time controls, a new class of ActiveX Controls that automatically
generate the HTML and server scripting logic necessary to add database
functionality
<p>
  -- Microsoft Active Data Objects, a new feature of IIS 3.0 that provides
server-side database access to any ODBC database, including Oracle, Sybase,
Microsoft SQL Server(TM), Microsoft Access, the Microsoft FoxPro(R) database
system and IBM DB/2
<p>
  -- Data View and Query Designer tools, which work with any ODBC database
<p>
  -- Database Designer tool, which brings the ease of Microsoft Access
table-definition tools to the creation and modification of Microsoft SQL
Server databases

<h3>Team-Based Development With Internet Studio and Microsoft FrontPage 97</h3>

  Internet Studio is specifically designed for developers, and looks and
works like other products in Microsoft's line of visual development tools. Internet
Studio uses the same project model as the Microsoft FrontPage(TM) 97 Web
authoring and management tool so Web developers and Web authors can
collaborate on the same projects and Web sites. They also share the same WYSIWYG HTML and
Microsoft Image Composer editing tools.
<p>
   "We have been working with an early, prerelease version of Internet Studio
and are very excited by its development capabilities," said Jonathan
Kutchins, president of Exeter Group Inc.  "The combination of Internet Studio and
Microsoft FrontPage 97 offers a true team-oriented development platform. Our
nonprogrammers and programmers can work simultaneously on the same Web site,
using tools tailored for their specific needs."
<p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>

  Microsoft is scheduled to release a beta version of Internet Studio in the
fourth quarter of 1996 and is targeting the commercial release for 1997.
Pricing has not yet been announced.  For more information, visit the Internet Studio
Web site at http://www.microsoft.com/istudio/.

SAN FRANCISCO - Dec. 4, 1996<B> </B>- Information technology professionals,
technical support personnel, and higher education faculty members
who use technology in the classroom often have minimal technical
or training assistance when making new product purchasing decisions.
 Microsoft Corporation is making difficult product evaluation,
support and training decisions easier for college and university
technology professionals through its new Academic Technology Advantage
(ATA) program.  The ATA offer, designed to encourage decision
makers to test drive Microsoft&reg; software solutions in their

<TITLE>About OTA</TITLE>
<H1>About OTA</H1>

<UL>
OTA undertakes assessments at the request of the Chairman of any 
congressional committee.  The Chairman may request the work personally, 
on behalf of a ranking minority member, or on behalf of a majority 
of committee members.  The OTA Board may also request work, as can 
the Director.  In practice, most studies are requested by the Chairman 
and the Ranking Member of a Committee, and many are supported by 
more than one committee.<P>
OTA staff reviews requests to determine whether resources are 
available, whether OTA can effectively provide the information, and 
whether interest is broad and bipartisan.  The OTA Director submits 
proposals to the Technology Assessment Board, which makes the final 
decision on whether to proceed.  The OTA Board reviews all major 
studies prior to release.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="tab2.html">Technology Assessment Board</A></B>:
A 12-member bipartisan congressional board of six Senators and six 
Representatives governs OTA.  The chairmanship and vice chairmanship
alternatve between the Senate and House in succeeding Congresses.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF ="taac.html">Technology Assessment Advisory Council</A></B>:
An advisory council of 10 eminent citizens from industry, academia, and elsewhere outside the federal government are appointed by the Board to advise the Agency.  The Comptroller General of the United States
and the Director of the Congressional Research Service serve as
statutory members.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="herd2.html">Director</A></B>:
The Technology Assessment Board appoints OTA's Director for a 
six-year term.  Roger Herdman, the current director, was appointed 
to his first term in 1993.<P>
OTA is organized into six programs and has a staff of about 200, of which two-thirds are the professional research staff.  Among the research staff, 88% have advanced degrees, 58% with PhD's, that span the disciplines.  About 40% of the research staff are temporary appointments of professionals recruited specifically to staff ongoing assessments.

</UL><P>
<LI><B>Advisory Panels</B>:
OTA assembles an advisory panel of stakeholders and experts for 
each major study to ensure that reports are objective, fair, and 
authoritative.  These panels meet two or three times during a study. 
They help to shape studies by suggesting alternative approaches, 
reviewing documents, and critiquing reports at the final stages. 
No attempt is made to develop consensus among panel members; in 
fact, a wide diversity of views is sought.  OTA retains full responsibility 
for the content and conclusions of each report.  In all, nearly 5000 outside panelists and workshop participants come to OTA annually to help OTA in its work.<P>
<LI><B>Contractors</B>:
For specific information or analysis, OTA contracts with key individuals 
or organizations.  Contractors may analyze data, conduct case studies, 
or otherwise provide expertise to complement staff capability.<P>
<LI><B>Reviewers</B>:
Many people assist with the studies by participating in technical 
workshops, providing information, reviewing documents, or just talking 
with OTA staff.  The involvement of people with differing backgrounds 
and interests greatly strengthens OTA work.  Extensive formal review 
of studies is conducted by OTA staff and outside experts.<P>

<TiTle>Industry, Commerce, and International Security Division</TiTle>
<H1>Industry, Commerce, and International Security Division</H1>
<HR>
<P>The Industry, Commerce, and International Security Division 
comprises 3 research Programs:  Energy, Transportation, and Infrastructure; 
Industry, Telecommunications, and Commerce; and International Security 
and Space.
<P>The <A HREF="eti.html"><B>Energy, Transportation, and Infrastructure (ETI) Program</B></A> is 
responsible for examining the role of technology in extracting, producing 
and using energy resources; designing, operating, and improving transportation 
systems; and planning, constructing, and maintaining infrastructure. 
 The Program addresses the impacts of these technologies and the 
factors that affect their ability to support commerce and other societal 
goals.  Applications of materials to energy, transportation, and 
infrastructure systems, including the development of natural and 
manufactured material resources through extraction, processing, use, 
and recycling or waste management, are included in ETI's work.  The 
Program's work also covers the export and import of energy, transportation, 
and infrastructure technologies, goods, and services, including energy 
fuels and efficiency, and the implications of these activities for 
economic growth, global competitiveness, and international stability.
<P>The <A HREF="itc.html"><B>Industry, Telecommunications, and Commerce (ITC) Program</B></A> is 
responsible for assessments on technology and international industrial 
competitiveness, telecommunications and computing technologies, international 
trade, industry productivity, and related topics.  ITC examines how 
technology affects the ability of U.S. industry to contribute to 
a healthy national economy.  This includes consideration of the competitiveness 
of U.S. industries in international markets; trade and economic development 
issues; the changing role of telecommunications and computing technologies 
in the nation's industry, commerce, and government; the number and 
nature of employment opportunities in the U.S. economy; and the effects 
of technological change on jobs and training.  The Program also studies 
telecommunications regulation, information policy, and applications 
of information technology in the public sector.
<P>OTA's work concerning technological aspects of national security, 
international security (as it concerns the U.S.), and space is pursued 
in the <A HREF="iss.html"><B>International Security and Space (ISS) Program</B></A>.  The program's 
security work focuses on implications of technology and technological 
change on national defense as well as international stability, arms 
control, arms proliferation, terrorism, and alliance relations.  
Assessments of issues related to the nation's defense industrial 
and technology base is an increasing part of ISS's work. The program's 
space work involves a broad range of issues, such as space transportation, 
earth observation, international cooperation and competition, exploration, 
use, and commercialization of space.  The program's work has also 
ranged into areas such as law enforcement.<P>

<TITLE>OTA's ETI Program</TITLE>
<H2>Energy, Transportation, and Infrastructure</H2>
<hr>
Energy, transportation, and infrastructure are essential systems
underpinning the nation's prosperity, security, and well-being. The
ETI Program examines the role of technology in producing and using
energy resources; designing, operating, and improving transportation
systems; and constructing and maintaining infrastructure.
Applications of materials to these issues, including the development
of natural and manufactured material resources through extraction,
processing, use, and recycling or waste management are also included
in ETI's work. The Program covers the export and import of energy,
transportation, and infrastructure technologies, goods, and services,
including energy fuels and efficiency. The Program's work helps
Congress develop policies for these systems that will sustain
economic growth, global competitiveness, and international stability
while minimizing adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts.

OTA's work concerning technological aspects of national security, 
international security (as it concerns the U.S.), and space is pursued 
in the International Security and Space  (ISS) Program.  The program's 
security work focuses on implications of technology and technological 
change for national defense as well as international stability, arms 
control, arms proliferation, terrorism, and alliance relations.  
Assessments of issues related to the nation's defense industrial 
and technology base is an increasing part of ISS's work. The program's 
space work involves a broad range of issues, such as space transportation, 
earth observation, international cooperation and competition, exploration, 
use, and commercialization of space.  The program's work has also 
ranged into areas such as law enforcement.

<TITLE>About OTA</TITLE>
<H1>About OTA</H1>

<UL>
OTA undertakes assessments at the request of the Chairman of any 
congressional committee.  The Chairman may request the work personally, 
on behalf of a ranking minority member, or on behalf of a majority 
of committee members.  The OTA Board may also request work, as can 
the Director.  In practice, most studies are requested by the Chairman 
and the Ranking Member of a Committee, and many are supported by 
more than one committee.<P>
OTA staff reviews requests to determine whether resources are 
available, whether OTA can effectively provide the information, and 
whether interest is broad and bipartisan.  The OTA Director submits 
proposals to the Technology Assessment Board, which makes the final 
decision on whether to proceed.  The OTA Board reviews all major 
studies prior to release.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="tab2.html">Technology Assessment Board</A></B>:
A 12-member bipartisan congressional board of six Senators and six 
Representatives governs OTA.  The chairmanship and vice chairmanship
alternatve between the Senate and House in succeeding Congresses.<P>
<LI><B><A HREF ="taac.html">Technology Assessment Advisory Council</A></B>:
An advisory council of 10 eminent citizens from industry, academia, and elsewhere outside the federal government are appointed by the Board to advise the Agency.  The Comptroller General of the United States
and the Director of the Congressional Research Service serve as
statutory members.<P>

in 1993.<P>
OTA is organized into six programs and has a staff of about 200, of which two-thirds are the professional research staff.  Among the research staff, 88% have advanced degrees, 58% with PhD's, that span the disciplines.  About 40% of the research staff are temporary appointments of professionals recruited specifically to staff ongoing assessments.

<LI><B>Advisory Panels</B>:
OTA assembles an advisory panel of stakeholders and experts for 
each major study to ensure that reports are objective, fair, and 
authoritative.  These panels meet two or three times during a study. 
They help to shape studies by suggesting alternative approaches, 
reviewing documents, and critiquing reports at the final stages. 
No attempt is made to develop consensus among panel members; in 
fact, a wide diversity of views is sought.  OTA retains full responsibility 
for the content and conclusions of each report.  In all, nearly 5000 outside panelists and workshop participants come to OTA annually to help OTA in its work.<P>
<LI><B>Contractors</B>:
For specific information or analysis, OTA contracts with key individuals 
or organizations.  Contractors may analyze data, conduct case studies, 
or otherwise provide expertise to complement staff capability.<P>
<LI><B>Reviewers</B>:
Many people assist with the studies by participating in technical 
workshops, providing information, reviewing documents, or just talking 
with OTA staff.  The involvement of people with differing backgrounds 
and interests greatly strengthens OTA work.  Extensive formal review 
of studies is conducted by OTA staff and outside experts.<P>

<H1>Health, Education, and Environment Division</H1>
<HR>
<P>The Health, Education, and Environment Division comprises three 
programs: the Education and Human Resources Program, the Environment 
Program, and the Health Program.
<P>The <A HREF="ehr.html"><B>Education and Human Resources (EHR) Program</B></A> is responsible 
for studies of technologies for learning, and of science-grounded 
human resource topics.  Education studies critically examine technologies 
of all kinds, for learners of all ages and abilities, and in all 
settings.  Human resources studies deal with the costs, availability, 
effectiveness, and impacts of technologies in areas such long term 
care and disability services, housing for people with disabilities, 
prevention of drug abuse, and issues of crime and violence. 
<P>The <A HREF="env.html"><B>Environment (ENV) Program</B></A> assesses scientific, technical, 
and policy issues related to the environment.  Program areas include 
the use and conservation of renewable resources; pollution prevention, 
control, and remediation; and environmental health and risk management. 
 Assessments have focused on such topics as agriculture; management 
of public lands; biological diversity; risk assessment methods and 
policy; air and water pollution; management of solid, hazardous, 
and nuclear wastes; and the effects of weather and climate change.
<P>The <A HREF="hlth.html"><B>Health (HLTH) Program's</B></A> charter is reflected in three primary 
types of efforts: 1) assessments of specific clinical and general 
health care technologies, 2) studies of broader issues of health 
policy related to or with implications for technology, and 3) studies 
of applications, particularly to human health, of the biological 
and behavioral sciences (including biotechnology, human molecular 
genetics, neurological sciences, and health-related behaviors).  
The Program also is responsible for OTA's statutory, methodology 
oversight responsibilities regarding Vietnam veterans health studies
<P>In addition, the Division provides the staff work for the OTA 
Director's mandated responsibility to select and appoint members 
of the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, the Physician Payment 
Review Commission, and the Advisory Panel on Alzheimer's Disease.

<TITLE>Document Types</TITLE>
<H2>Document Types</H2>
<hr>
<b><I>Reports</I></b> are the principal documentation of formal assessment projects.  
OTA Reports are analyses with major policy content.  They are submitted 
to the Technology Assessment Board for review prior to release.  Major 
policy content includes not only policy options, but also conclusions 
that are virtually indistinguishable from policy options, and significant 
analysis directly relevant to policy alternatives.  The Technology 
Assessment Board has the opportunity to review Reports before release 
but this does not necessarily imply endorsement of the results by the 
Board or its individual members.<p>

<b><I>Background Papers</I></b> are analyses without major policy content.  A Background 
Paper presents information that generally stems from, or supplements, OTA 
assessments, covers a specific topic not immediately related to an assessment, 
or is an outcome of internal exploratory planning and evaluation.

GPO operates U.S. Government Bookstores all around the country 
where you can browse through shelves and take your books home with 
you. Naturally, these stores can't stock all of the more than 12,000 
titles in GPO's inventory, but they do carry the ones you're most 
likely to be looking for. And they'll be happy to special order any 
Government book currently offered for sale and have it directly sent 
to you. All of GPO's bookstores accept VISA, MasterCard, and Superintendent 
of Documents deposit account orders. For more information, please 
write or call your nearest U.S. Government Bookstore.<P>

<HR><H3><A NAME="counter">Countering Proliferated Weapons of Mass Destruction (R)</A></H3>
<P>Top officials in both Congress and the Executive Branch have identified 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as one of the most, 
if not the most, important security threat facing the United States 
and the rest of the international community in the post-Cold War 
era. An urgent priority of U.S. foreign policy is to prevent the 
further spread of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and, in 
some cases, to cause those possessing such weapons to give them up. 
Nevertheless, prudent military planners must prepare for the contingency 
that U.S. military forces may confront adversaries armed with these 
weapons. OTA proposes to assess the technological components of three 
stages of response to proliferation: counterforce, active defense, 
and passive defense. To evaluate the prospects for success in each 
stage, three questions must be addressed:
<UL>
<P><LI>Requirements--what conditions must be met to accomplish the task?
<P><LI>Potential--how might the technology options under consideration 
meet the requirements?
<P><LI>Limitations--what inherent problems and uncertainties are likely 
to constrain success?
</UL>
<P>The OTA assessment has the goal of helping Congress to understand 
the potential, the limitations, and the implications of the countering 
technologies that it is being asked to fund. With such understanding, 
it can make more informed decisions about how to allocate national 
resources toward ameliorating the proliferation threat.

<HR><H3><A NAME="support">International Peace Support Operations (R</A>)</H3>
<P>International peace support operations and U.S. involvement in 
them have increased greatly since the end of the Cold War. New areas 
of operation (added to old ones, such as Cyprus, the Sinai, the Golan 
Heights) have included Bosnia, Somalia, Angola, and a police action 
(rather than peacekeeping operation) to reverse the results of aggression 
in Kuwaitthe first such case since Korea in 1950.
<P>Operations include peacekeepingundertaken with a cease-fire in 
place and aimed at permitting negotiations (e.g., Cyprus)peace enforcementdone 
without a workable cease-fire or without the agreement of all parties 
involved (e.g., Somalia, Liberia)and police actions, in which an 
intervention force deals with an aggressor. Each type of activity 
will have its own technical requirements: technological, operational, 
and doctrinal. In addition to their other military requirements, 
peace support operations involving more than one nation have serious 
command and control issues to face.
<P>As recent events have shown, few of these issues have been well 
worked out; resolving them will be necessary if U.S. forces are to 
participate with maximum effectiveness and minimum risk. The study 
will examine the inter-operability of U.S. forces with those of other 
countries, including command and control issues and the variability 
of equipment and training among the different nations participating 
in a mixed force. To this end, the study will draw both on recent 
examples, including the integration of forces in NATO, and on general 
analyses. Of particular interest will be the future of U.N. command 
and control structures, which are currently evolving. This work will 
also discuss and analyze doctrines and tactics required for various 
types of peacekeeping. The study will also address training requirements 
for peace support activities. Further, the assessment will examine 
technical requirements for the various kinds of peace support operations 
that U.S. troops may face, including less-than-lethal weapons, remote 
sensing, mine detection systems, and C3I technology.

<HR><H3><A NAME="altlaunch">Assessing Future Space Launch Industry Alternatives (R)</A></H3>
<P>For nearly four decades, the space launch industry has been one 
of the main elements of the U.S. high technology strategy. It has 
been used to demonstrate U.S. technological prowess; assure the nations 
strategic nuclear deterrent; supply policymakers with intelligence, 
geodesy, weather, navigation, and other vital information; generate 
and spin-off new technologies in a number of fields; and increasingly 
support space-oriented industrial growth, particularly in telecommunications. 
Once solidly based, its future is now very unclear. The U.S. space 
launch industry faces the challenge of having to adjust both to the 
political and economic realignments brought on by the end of the 
Cold War and to stiff competition from foreign launch systems, much 
of it subsidized. Already, the one-time American monopoly on commercial 
launch services has fallen to a 30-percent market share. This is 
not only a showcaseindustry involving many high-skilled jobs, but 
also one entwined with other technology-intensive industries that 
depend on access to space or technologies developed for space. It 
is also vital to future intelligence and defense missions. The response 
of government and industry to these challenges in the near-term will 
affect the health of the space launch and aerospace industry for 
decades to come. Building on OTAs previous work on the defense industry 
and space policy, and on recent NASA and DOD studies of space transportation, 
this study will:
<UL>
<P><LI>Estimate the U.S. governments space launch and ballistic missile 
modernization needs for the next two decades and analyze the implications 
for the launch industry.
<P><LI>Estimate commercial markets and identify factors likely to influence 
their growth.
<P><LI>Assess alternative government policies regarding the development, 
production, and operations of domestic space launch vehicles.
<P><LI>Analyze the economic and technological implications for the space 
launch industry of the expected defense industry contraction and 
consolidation.
<P><LI>Evaluate foreign launch industries and contrast their technical 
capabilities with U.S. industry.
<P><LI>Assess the technology base for developing the next generation 
of space-launchers and ballistic missiles, including the state of 
government research laboratories.

<HR><H3><A NAME="guns">Technologies for Tracking Ammunition and for Controlling the Inadvertent Use of Handguns (R)</A></H3>
<P>Residents throughout the United States are increasingly concerned 
about an epidemicof violence. The misuse of handgunsincluding accidents 
involving handguns and the use of handguns in crimesis an important 
source of this concern. Accidents involving children and guns are 
particularly unsettling. This assessment will examine technological 
aspects of potential measures to: 1) facilitate the identification 
and apprehension of those who have committed criminal acts of violence 
using handguns and 2) reduce handgun accidents, especially among 
children.
<P>

<HR><H3><A NAME="safety">Handgun Safety</A></H3>
<P>Handguns are intended to remain quiescent unless fired intentionally. 
However, children and adults who are not trained in the proper handling 
and ownership of firearms are a source of gun accidents. Inadvertent 
firings occur for a number of reasons, including such operator errors 
as failing to realize a gun is loaded or failing to handle a loaded 
gun in a proper manner.
<P>Many ideas have been proposed to reduce gun accidents. These often 
take the form of devices to force the use of a gun to become a more 
deliberate act and include such things as trigger locks, magazine 
safety devices, and load indicators. Ideas to make firearms less 
likely to be used by a child include special fire-safety devices 
and safer storage; for example, bedside lock boxes.
<P>This section of the assessment will survey such ideas, analyze 
their advantages and disadvantages, and assess their likely effectiveness. 
Issues related to the cost of implementation and market acceptability 
will also be addressed. In addition, OTA will survey programs to 
educate adults and children in the proper handling and ownership 
of firearms and assess their effectiveness.

<HR><H3><A NAME="track">Tracking Handgun Ammunition</A></H3>
<P>This part of the assessment will examine the feasibility of using 
new chemical or physical marking techniques to: 1) assist law enforcement 
officers in establishing links between a discharged handgun and a 
particular bullet; 2) assist law enforcement officers in tracing 
ammunition used in crimes.
<P>The effectiveness of ammunition tracking measures would be reduced 
if certain ammunition were difficult to trace, if ammunition casing 
were easily reused, or if it were possible to stockpile unmarked 
ammunition in significant quantities. OTA will provide the requesters 
with information on these questions.  In addition, OTA will determine 
if handgun ammunition has a shelf life,and, if so, what the likely 
consequences would be for using out-of-date ammunition.
<P>OTA will also report on typical consumer gun and ammunition buying 
patterns and the technical performance of modern handgun ammunition. 
This will include a summary of results obtained from the handgun 
ammunition/wound ballistics tests most recently conducted by the 
Firearms Training Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Finally, 
OTA will provide a brief analysis of computerized ballistic comparison 
systems and discuss their utility in linking ammunition to firearms. 
This analysis will include systems now in use by the FBI and the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

<HR><H3><A NAME="model">Defense Modeling and Simulation (R)</A></H3>
<P>Over the past three decades, the Department of Defense has relied 
increasingly on computer-based models of combat to support procurement 
and force structure decisions, and on simulations to train commanders 
and equipment operators. Controversy has surrounded these efforts, 
primarily on the basis thatas approximations of realitythey have 
the potential to introduce misleading unreality into decision-making 
and training. In the past few years, improvements in computing technology 
and data acquisition have made it possible to base models and simulations 
on much more complete and detailed data, greatly reducing a source 
of error and expanding the potential of these technologies. For example, 
models using detailed data about actual terrain can enable service 
people to train under the same conditions troops will encounter in 
combat, using simulators loaded with the same data as will go into 
the guidance systems of real weapons. Major changes that have accompanied 
the end of the cold warreductions in defense spending and the introduction 
of much greater uncertainty into planning scenarioshave increased 
the potential value of being able to solve problems through modeling 
and simulation rather than by more costly methods.
<P>Many technological problems remain to be solved, how- ever, before 
the full potential of this emerging technology can be realized. Over 
the next several years, Congress will be asked to fund development 
and application of these technologies, and to endorse major decisions 
made based on their use. This assessment will help Congress understand 
the potential of the technology as well as the remaining problems. 
It will: 1) explain the technology and how it has developed; 2) assess 
the current state-of-the-art and potential for progress; 3) present 
a synopsis of what has been learned from several decades of efforts 
in modeling, simulation, and analysis; and 4) analyze the implications 
and impediments to realizing them. It will help Congress to  understand 
the technology and its implications and issues raised by its development 
and use, and identify and choose among options for dealing with those 
issues.

<HR><H3><A NAME="mass">Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (R)</A></H3>
<P>The abatement of the strategic competition between the United 
States and the Soviet Union, the Gulf War, and the dissolution of 
the U.S.S.R. have all brought the issue of the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction into the forefront of national security planning. 
Such weapons, which can range from hundreds to millions of times 
more deadly than conventional weapons of the same size, pose a serious 
challenge to the United States. In addition to the acknowledged nuclear 
powers, three other states almost certainly either possess nuclear 
weapons or could produce them on short notice. Several more may be 
making efforts to acquire them. Some twenty countries may be seeking 
to produce chemical weapons; ten or so may be pursuing biological 
ones. Even if they lack the means to attack the United States directly, 
states possessing these weapons threaten U.S. allies and U.S. vital 
interests. Ultimately they may be able to strike the United States, 
either directly or via terrorist organizations. The risks of conflict 
will intensify if nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons spread 
around the world, falling under the control of unstable governments, 
or of authoritarian (or even megalomaniacal) leaders not subject 
to the restraints of democratic governance or civilian control of 
the military. This assessment compares the risks posed by proliferation 
of various weapons of mass destruction, assesses the effectiveness 
of current nonproliferation policies, and formulates relevant Congressional 
policy options, including measures designed both to impede proliferation 
and to expose it.

<HR><H3><A NAME="civmil">Assessing the Potential Integration of Defense and Civilian Technology and Manufacturing (R)</A></H3>
<P>The dissolution of the Soviet Union has dramatically changed the 
military threat to the United States. However, the Nation will continue 
to face future national security challenges. Major changes in world 
politics, the U.S. and global economy, and high technology industry 
are prompting the U.S. to pursue new strategies to ensure that a 
sufficient defense technology and industrial base is available in 
the future. One of the most widely discussed alternatives is increased 
integration of the civilian and defense technology and industrial 
bases. The national security objectives of such integration include: 
reducing total costs of military equipment, gaining greater access 
to advanced technology, increasing the two-way technology flow between 
the defense and civilian sectors, and broadening the defense base 
by increasing the number of potential defense suppliers. Such integration 
might also promote international competitiveness of U.S. industry 
in general. While the idea of increased civil-military integration 
is widely supported, there is a perception that actual implementation 
has been slow. Similarly, while there has been much discussion of 
the advantages of greater integration and of barriers to such integration, 
there has been relatively little hard analysis of specific opportunities 
to exploit civil sector technology and the implications of such exploitation. 
The relatively slow acceptance of greater integration has resulted 
in considerable frustration both in Congress and within the defense 
community.
<P>This assessment will 1) provide Congress a better understanding 
of the current level of integration, 2) identify characteristics 
of specific technology and industrial sectors that lend themselves 
to integration and those in which integration appears difficult, 
3) assess the implications of integration in specific cases, and 
4) provide Congress some options to support the objective of increased 
civil-military integration.

<HR><H3><A NAME="emerge">Innovation and Commercialization of Emerging Technologies 
(R)</A></H3>
<P>Technology commercialization is often named as one of the weaknesses 
of American firms. Concerns have been raised that both private and 
publicly funded U.S. technologies have found applications in foreign 
markets before they were introduced here. Examples include facsimile machines 
and winglets and laminar flow designs in commercial jet aircraft.
<P>While government funding of basic science is often viewed as compensating 
for a market failure, federal involvement in commercialization of 
technology is less often justified. Market forces and signals weed 
out many, if not most, technologies that get to the prototype stage, 
but this is an appropriate and valuable role for the market. Moreover, 
even without a technology policy that would be deemed interventionist 
by the standards of many East Asian or European developed nations, 
the United States remains a highly innovative nation, and in some 
sections (e.g., biotechnology) innovation in America clearly outdistances 
any foreign competition. Yet in other sections (notably electronics) 
some analysts are concerned that American firms face higher hurdles 
than do many of their foreign competitors in developing and deploying 
innovative new technologies.
<P>This study will assess the importance of several factors in decisions 
to develop and introduce products in several case studies. The cases 
selected will be emerging technologies in areas expected to make 
disproportionate contributions to the nations economic performance, 
such as, for example, electronics, composite materials, biotechnology, 
or massively parallel computation.
<P>The factors to be analyzed will include corporate strategies, 
technological uncertainties, market uncertainties, availability of 
finance, and government regulatory, tax, and technology policy. Depending 
on what case studies are chosen for deeper analysis, the focus on 
factors affecting decisions to commercialize technologies will become 
sharper.

<HR><H3><A NAME="hlth">Information Technology and the Health Care System (R)</A></H3>
<P>Health care services delivery and research are information intensive. 
Health professionals collect, create, and use large amounts of information 
while caring for patients; the clerical tasks involved in maintaining 
records are time consuming and divert time and energy from patient 
care. Sometimes previously collected information is not available 
when and where it is needed; the difficulties of communicating information 
can delay appropriate care or lead to expensive duplication of tests. 
Health care providers and others, like suppliers and payers, manage 
large amounts of information for administrative purposes, and the 
costs of processing this information adds to the cost of health care. 
In addition, providers, payers, medical researchers, and government 
policy makers need accurate information about the outcomes of various 
procedures and interventions in order to judge their effectiveness; 
this information is becoming especially important in managed care 
environments. Consumers, as well, could benefit from information 
on medical outcomes and on relative costs of care in order to make 
informed choices about their selection of providers and health plans.
<P>More use of information technology (computers, telecommunication) 
could address some of these information needs. Information technology 
might improve patient care by freeing health professionals from the 
burden of clerical tasks and by allowing both clinical and administrative 
information to be communicated more quickly and accurately. Automation 
of administrative tasks might help health care providers and payers 
to monitor and control costs more. Data on the effectiveness of medical 
interventions could be collected and analyzed more easily using computer-based 
records with standard formats or data elements, and appropriate information 
could be available to providers, payers, researchers, government 
agencies, and consumers.
<P>While information technology may reduce some costs or make some 
services more accessible, benefits might accrue only after large 
investments in new technologies have been made. Further, there are 
barriers to implementing computer-based applications that may prevent 
their widespread use or may reduce the level of expected benefits.
<P>This study is a cooperative effort between OTAs Health Program 
and its Telecommunication and Computing Technologies Program. It 
seeks to identify use of computer and telecommunication technology 
that might have a substantial payoff in monitoring or controlling 
costs or in improving the quality and accessibility of health care. 
The study will then assess selected applications in detail. The study 
builds on two current OTA assessments: one on the privacy of computerized 
medical records and the other on use of information technology in 
delivery of government services.

<HR><H3><A NAME="wireless">Wireless Technologies and the National Information Infrastructure (R)</A></H3>
<P>The development of a National Information Infrastructure (NII) 
to serve the Nations expanding communications and information needs 
is a high priority for both Congress and the Administration. Wireless 
technologies and systemssuch as TV and radio broadcasting, new personal 
communications services, and many kinds of satellite communicationswill 
form an integral part of the NII, but the roles they will play and 
the implications of their widespread adoption are not yet clear. 
In particular, integrating the many wireless and wireline systems 
that will comprise the NII will prove a difficult challenge for Federal, 
State, and local regulators. Many factors, including standards development, 
interconnection and pricing arrangements, and differing industry

systems can become an effective part of the NII.
<P>The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis 
of the problems and promises of integrating wireless technologies 
into the NII. This study would: identify and discuss the various 
wireless technologies that could contribute to the development of 
the NII; assess the barriers to greater or more efficient use of 
radio-based systems; and explore the economic, regulatory, and social 
implications of the convergence of wireline and wireless technologies 
in the NII. The study will also present policy options addressing 
relevant wireless/NII issues.

<HR><H3><A NAME="natam">Telecommunications Technology and Native Americans: Opportunities and Challenges (R)</A></H3>
<P>Native American communities including American Indian reservations, 
Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Native villages are working hard to surmount 
a variety of social and economic challenges. These communities typically 
are geographically remote and must cope with levels of unemployment 
and social distress that are higher than the national averages.  Pilot 
projects suggest that telecommunication and computing technologies 
can play a role in revitalizing Native American communities, as such 
technologies are already doing in other distressed areas of the United 
States.
<P>Prior OTA studies have found, however, that the potential use 
of telecommunications to significantly improve socioeconomic conditions 
is far from assured. Prerequisites for success include access to 
an affordable technology infrastructure, encouragement from local 
leaders and facilitators, involvement of the community infrastructure 
(e.g., schools and self-help groups), and appropriate training. As 
the United States accelerates the development and operation of a 
national information infrastructure (NII) or information superhighway,there 
is considerable risk that Native Americans will be bypassed.
<P>OTA will consider: 1) current knowledge of the needs of Native 
Americans and opportunities for application of telecommunications 
and computing technologies; 2) results of pilot projects and prior 
research on factors that might contribute to the successful use of 
these technologies by Native Americans; 3) current public and private 
sector technology-based activities directed toward improving the 
socioeconomic conditions of Native Americans, with special attention 
to economic development and job creation; and 4) current and prospective 
public policy initiatives on the national information infrastructure, 
telecommunications and information policies, and electronic service 
delivery that could affect Native Americans.
<P>OTA will include, as part of the study process, direct involvement 
of Native Americans and tribal and village organizations through 
interviews, advisory panel meetings, workshops, outreach meetings, 
and, to the extent practical, site visits.  Another form of information gathering
that will be used in this study is computer networking.  Project staff have created 
a Mosaic/Netscape home page that is a compilation of many electronically accessible 
Native American Resources.  The <A HREF="nativea.html"><strong>
Native American Resource Page</strong></A> can be accessed 
here or with a direct link through the World Wide Web at this address:

<HR><H3><A NAME="jobs">Technology, Jobs, and Productivity in the Service Economy (R)</A></H3>
<P>Technology has changed the production and delivery of many services. 
This is most evident in information-intensive sectors such as banking, 
but also, for instance, in travel and tourism (airline reservation 
systems, high-technology attractions such as Epcot Center).  Broadening 
the perspective to include "soft" technologies, such as total quality 
management and work reorganization makes it plain that new technical 
systems are pervasive in the service economy.
<P>Services now account for three-quarters of U.S. employment and 
output.  Some service jobs are good ones, with wage/benefit levels 
comparable or superior to manufacturing. But many service jobs offer 
low pay, few benefits, and limited prospect for advancement. As a 
whole, lagging productivity in the services appears to put downward 
pressure on U.S. GDP per capita and wage levels.
<P>Performance improvements through technology might make it possible 
raise wages and benefits, moving at least some service jobs from 
the "low-wage, low-skill, dead end" category to the "high-wage, high-skill, 
good job" category. On the other hand, because labor-intensive services 
have been major engines of job creation, rapid productivity increases 
could cut into job opportunities, perhaps contributing to "jobless 
growth"economic expansion alongside high or even rising levels of 
unemployment.
<P>OTA's approaches to these issues will include: (1) case studies 
of selected service firms and industries; (2) analysis of linkages 
among technology and other measures of firm performance; (3) analysis 
of labor markets by sector and occupation; (4) consideration of policy 
concerning, for example, training and work organization, labor law, 
business modernization, and job creation.

<HR><H3><A NAME="money">Information Technologies for Control of Money Laundering (R)</A></H3>
<P>Electronic funds transfer has become the preferred medium for 
money laundering, because it is swifter and more easily concealed 
than bulk transport of currency across national boundaries. Wire 
transfer of funds creates voluminous records, especially at a few 
major money centerbanks and some Federal Reserve Banks. Attempts 
to detect characteristic patterns from these data bases that might 
indicate systematic money laundering are promising, but are frustrated 
by the vastness of the data and by laws and policies designed to 
protect financial privacy. Existing and emerging information technologies 
(including computer profiling, computer matching, and natural language 
processing) may solve the technical problem of pattern recognition. 
A number of regulatory and enforcement agencies are considering developing 
such systems, but development and prototyping these systems are hampered 
by legal restraints, budgetary constraints, and possibly lack of 
interagency cooperation. Even if these efforts are successful the 
systems may not be sufficiently flexible or interoperable, or may 
threaten privacy rights.

<HR><H3><A NAME="global">Global Communications Policy: Issues and Technology (R)</A></H3>
<P>Recent advances in information and communication technologies, 
occurring in a newly deregulated and increasingly competitive economic 
climate, are rapidly reconfiguring national communication systems 
and linking them together into networks spanning the globe. Encouraging 
the flow of, and the demand for, information products and services 
across national borders, these networks are wearing away the lines 
that historically have divided domestic and international communication 
systems and markets. Thus, communication is today one of the fastest 
growing sectors in the international market and international conglomerates 
are increasingly being formed to provide products and services on 
a global basis.
<P>As communication networks became more global, so too will policy 
issues relating to their deployment, regulation, and use. Many governments, 
for example, have already been forced to harmonize their communication 
regulatory policies in order to forestall pricing arbitrage across 
national boundaries. Similarly, policy makers, communication vendors, 
and large business users are all being forced to pay much greater 
heed to international standards and the international standards development 
process.
<P>Globalization may also lead to greater difficulty in achieving 
multiple policy objectives. With the breakdown of geographic boundaries, 
for example, U.S. regulatory policies designed to encourage competition 
in the domestic communication marketplace may serve to give foreign 
communication vendors and information service providers an unfair 
trade advantage. Alternatively, U.S. policies designed to promote 
trade in communication and information products and services may 
come into conflict with communication-based foreign policy strategies 
to promote economic development.
<P>This report will examine U.S. international telecommunications 
technology and policy in terms of its ability to reconcile multiple 
national and international policy objectives. Special attention will 
be given to the areas of domestic regulatory policy, trade policy, 
and economic development policy. In analyzing these issues, the study 
will build on the previous OTA assessment, U.S. Telecommunication 
Services in European Markets.

<HR><H3><A NAME="develop">Development and Diffusion of Innovative Environmental Technologies (R)</A></H3>
<P>Many U.S. manufacturers anticipate that their environmental compliance 
costs will increase in the coming years.  In many instances, more 
cost effective technologies or techniques for environmental problems 
exist or could be developed, if obstacles to their use could be addressed. 
 This project examines (1) the role of research and development (R&amp;D) 
in overcoming barriers to private sector adoption and use of more 
cost effective technologies to address industrial pollution and waste; 
and (2) existing Federal and other programs for technical assistance 
and environmental compliance assistance to industry and municipalities. 
 The project will:
<UL>
<LI>examine current and prospective industry R&amp;D roles (including 
consortia and other collaborations) to develop innovative or more 
cost effective environmental technologies, including cleaner production 
technologies.  Activities in such sectors as semiconductors, pulp 
and paper, chemicals, food processing, and furniture making will 
be profiled;
<P><LI>identify existing state and federal technical and compliance 
assistance programs available to industry and municipalities, focusing 
on pollution prevention and pollution control;
<P><LI>assess current and potential roles of the private sector (including 
trade associations, industry organizations, supplier firm networks,

<H3><A NAME="res">Residential Design Technologies for Elderly People and People 
with Disabilities (R)</A></H3>

<P>There is growing awareness that the design of many nursing homes 
and residential care facilities for elderly people and people with 
disabilities can be improved. A growing body of knowledge supports 
the notion that improved design of living space has the potential 
to promote improved functioning among elderly people and persons 
with disabilities with physical and cognitive limitations and greater 
cost effectiveness in facility operation. With an increasingly aging 
population, and with greater protection now available for people 
with disabilities, the need for technology to create new and enhanced 
residential housing for these populations will increase.

<P>Innovative residential care facility design, however, is frequently 
deterred by multiple competing laws and regulations at the federal, 
state, and local levels. Many existing design codes and regulations 
focus on the physical building, often ignoring the environmental 
impacts on residents, staff, and families. These codes and policies 
cause nursing homes and residential care facilities to waste money 
trying to get approval for, and often abandoning, design innovations 
that would benefit their residents.

<P>This assessment would build upon OTA's report on "Special Care 
Units," which analyzed the competing regulations and interpretations 
of standards involved in constructing nursing homes and special care 
units (SCUs) for people with dementia. This assessment will: 1) examine 
literature on environmental features that foster adaptation and independent 
living; 2) discuss advances in housing design and technology (e.g., 
"Smart House" technology, computers as aids to independent living, 
speech activation systems); and 3) analyze government policies that 
promote or impede appropriate uses of design technology. The assessment 
will expand the population of interest beyond nursing home residents 
with dementia to include older people with a range of functional 
limitations and younger people with disabilities.

<H3><A NAME="work">Technology and Work-Based Learning (R)</A></H3>

<P>Concern about the preparation for work and careers of youth who 
do not go on to four-year colleges has been growing for some time. 
In the United States, we have primarily relied upon schools to provide 
this preparation. The assumptions have been that schools will motivate 
them to learn and provide them with the skills and education they 
need to be successful in the job market and in life. The large numbers 
of youth who do not gain skills and do not find stable employment 
until they are in their thirties seriously challenge these assumptions.
<P>
<P>One major difficulty may be that youth do not see much connection 
between doing well in school and in careers. One way of making this 
connection could be to combine work and learning directly, in programs 
of apprenticeship and work-based learning that lead to good jobs 
and skilled careers. We know that young people entering today's labor 
market can expect to change jobs and careers several times, and that 
skills of thinking, problem-solving and cooperation are increasingly 
valued by employers. We also know that the success of strategies 
of work-based learning will ultimately depend upon the involvement 
of employers; this would be especially true if substantial components 
of learning were expected to occur on the job. We need to know what 
factors will affect the decisions of employers to expand good opportunities 
for work-based learning.
<P>The School to Work Opportunities Act recently passed by the Congress 
and signed by the President has launched the nation on an experiment 
in school to work. States will receive major grants to rethink and 
redesign their strategies for preparing youth for work and careers. 
One of the major priorities of the legislation is to significantly 
expand opportunities for work-based learning. Proposals may be eventually 
advanced to develop large-scale systems of work-based learning through 
youth apprenticeships and other means.
<P>The OTA study will assess alternative approaches to work-based 
learning, and issues of the feasibility of expanding opportunities 
for youth apprenticeships, tech prep (programs that combine high 
school, community college, and work-based learning), and other alternatives 
in the U.S. The issues will include:
<UL>
<LI>What is known about the growth and quality of jobs for youth 
and young adults in the labor market, and where in the economy efforts 
to expand work-based learning should be directed?
<LI>What effects, if any, can strategies of work-based learning be 
expected to have on the participation of noncollege youth and young 
adults in the labor market and their longer term development of skills 
and careers?
<LI>What alternative models for combining work and learning can help 
to provide youth with the broad knowledge and skills they will need 
for jobs in the emerging economy of technology, information, services? 
What knowledge and skills are best learned at work? At school?
<LI>Should strategies of work-based learning be primarily directed 
to advanced levels of occupational preparation at the post-secondary 
level, or to the transition from school to work for noncollege students, 
and thus as a means of alternative education at the secondary level?
<LI>How can technology best assist in the learning effort? What at 
the advantages for students using technology? For employees?
<LI>What major factors would affect the rate at which work-based 
learning could be expanded as a strategy of youth and work force 
development in the U.S. economy? What are the incentives for employers 
to participate in programs of work-based learning? What lessons from 
other countries are relevant and not relevant to the U.S.?

<HR><H3><A NAME="genome">The Human Genome Project and Patenting Human DNA Sequences (R)</A></H3>
<P>As the 21st century approaches, Congress and the executive branch 
have committed to fund research to determine the location of all 
human genese.g., as has been done for sickle cell anemia, cystic 
fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy. The Human Genome Project, estimated 
to be a 15-year, $3 billion project, has been undertaken with the 
expectation that it will improve genetic diagnoses and advance therapies.
<P>In 1991, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) applied for patents 
on thousands of human DNA sequences of uncharacterized function, 
representing approximately 5 percent of all human genes. The move 
set off a storm of controversy in the United States and abroad, although 
the issues raised extend beyond the NIH applications. Who can "own" 
human DNA sequences and what must be known about a DNA sequence beyond 
the order of bases to permit patentability, if it should be permitted 
at all?
<P>This assessment will 1) examine the arguments for and against 
patenting human DNA sequences of the type encompassed by the NIH 
filing, as well as an analysis of the degree to which "found" DNA 
sequences can be incorporated into patents; 2) discuss the social 
and ethical issues of ownership of human DNA sequences; 3) examine 
the effect of the trend to file early patents on research conduct, 
and whether the effect is different for U.S. scientists, universities, 
industry, national laboratories, the Federal Government, and international 
research collaboration; and 4) assess the legal and economic impacts 
of existing technology transfer laws on human genome research.

<HR><H3><A NAME="eligibility">Eligibility Criteria and Assessment Technologies for Long-Term Care (R)</A></H3>
<P>Publicly-funded long-term care services for people with chronic 
disabilities are currently provided by numerous Federal, State, and 
local government programs with diverse eligibility criteria. The 
eligibility criteria often pertain to a person's age, a particular 
disease or physical or mental condition, or the person's need for 
a particular treatment. These criteria define categories of people, 
each of which includes some people who do not need long-term care 
services. Other people who do need long-term care services are not 
included in the categories. Still others who have multiple physical 
and mental disabilities could be included in several of the categories 
but do not fit well in any of them.
<P>Several recent proposals for long-term care reform are intended 
to provide services for people of all ages with severe, chronic disabilities. 
The proposals generally base eligibility on functional criteria, 
that is, criteria that measure an individual's ability to perform 
certain functions or activities. The most commonly used functional 
criteria are impairments in activities of daily living (ADLs), but 
advocates for some types of people with severe, chronic disabilities, 
including people with chronic mental illnesses, people with developmental 
disabilities, and technology-dependent children, point out that ADL 
criteria do not necessarily reflect the problems that result in a 
need for long-term care services for these people.
<P>This assessment will identify the problems with ADL-based eligibility 
criteria for various client populations, review the eligibility criteria 
and assessment technologies currently used in Federal, State, and 
local programs that provide long-term care services, and analyze 
the pros and cons of various eligibility criteria and assessment 
technologies for identifying people with severe, chronic disabilities 
who need long-term care. The assessment will provide options to assist 
Congress in defining eligibility criteria for a Federally-mandated 
long-term care program to serve people with such disabilities.

<HR><H3><A NAME="bacteria">Impacts of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (R)</A></H3>
<P>The development of penicillin to treat bacterial infections ushered 
in the age of antibiotics and offered the promise of elimination 
of death from bacterial diseases. For most of the 50 years since, 
the promise, although not reached, seemed a reasonable goal. Now, 
the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria lead many 
experts to wonder if current and under-development antibiotics are 
sufficient to contain certain lethal bacterial diseases.
<P>Antibiotic resistant bacteria are common in the nations hospitals 
because antibiotic sensitive bacteria cannot survive where antibiotics 
are commonly used. Antibiotic resistant bacteria infect about one 
million hospital patients each year. Antibiotic resistant bacteria 
are much less common in the community,the non-hospital environment. 
This may be changing. If antibiotic resistant bacteria are becoming 
more common in the community, the problems posed by bacterial infections 
will increase in parallel.
<P>OTA will analyze the literature and talk with experts to determine 
the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and changes in prevalence 
over time. A special focus will be placed on determining the extent 
to which bacteria such as pneumococcus and enterococcus, which are 
common causes of infection but treated with current antibiotics, 
are becoming antibiotic resistant. OTA will describe public and private 
commitment to antibiotic research and the factors which influence 
the level of effort.
<P>In addition to being used to treat human diseases, antibiotics 
are used in veterinary medicine and for prophylaxis against diseases 
in food animals and in fish farms. Experts agree that the widespread 
use of antibiotics favors the emergence and spread of antibiotic 
resistant bacteria, and OTA will discuss the relative importance 
of different uses of antibiotics. OTA will present options for dealing 
with the problems posed by antibiotic resistant bacteria.

<HR><H3><A NAME="issues">Issues Related to AIDS Technologies (R)</A></H3>
<P>The growing impact of AIDS on the Nations health continues, despite 
the optimism generated by the discovery and rapid approval of the 
first palliative drug against the AIDS virus and preliminary testing 
of possible vaccines. Preventing the spread of the AIDS virus is 
the primary strategy that is available, but is dependent on as yet 
unresolved differences on when testing for infection is appropriate 
and on how to alter the behavior of high-risk groups. The Nations 
and even many other countriessocial, economic, legal, and political 
systems have all been affected to some degree by the appearance of 
AIDS, and controversies over AIDS have even begun to affect international 
relations and comity among nations. Congress has responded with rapid 
increases in Federal funds for scientific and medical research and 
for research and services in preventive education, and has begun 
to grapple with the difficult issues involved in financing AIDS-related 
health care. These diverse issues warrant a different approach from 
the usual OTA assessment, so this project is oriented toward a monitoring 
and advisory capability within OTA to assist the increasing number 
of congressional committees that have AIDS on their agendas.

<HR><H3><A NAME="workforce">Improving the Distribution of the Medical Workforce (R)</A></H3>
<P>In the 1960s, shortages of health professionals received the most 
attention from policymakers. The Federal government responded with 
legislation to increase the supply of health professionals by providing 
grants to health professions schools for construction and loans to 
students. By the 1970s, efforts to increase the number of health 
professionals were succeeding, but policymakers recognized geographic 
and specialty maldistribution as a problem. The Health Professions 
Educational Assistance Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-484) emphasized 
training for primary care providers who would practice in underserved 
areas. Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act authorized 
programs to provide support to educational institutions (through 
grants and contracts), students, and residents (through loans, loan 
guarantees, and contracts) in the health professions. Those framing 
the legislation expected that the expansion of the number of primary 
care practitioners would also lead to more practitioners serving 
in rural areas and other medically underserved areas of the country. 
Despite these efforts, there is an increasing trend toward specialization 
among health professionals in this country. And many areas, particularly 
rural and inner-city areas, continue to be medically underserved.
<P>This study will assess the effectiveness of current programs funded 
under Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act in increasing 
the supply of primary health care providers and increasing the number 
of health professionals practicing in medically underserved areas. 
In addition, OTA will formulate policy options concerning optimal 
use of Federal funds to further Congressaims in this field.

<HR><H3><A NAME="tihcs">Technology, Insurance, and the Health Care System (R)</A></H3>
<P>Congress has been concerned for many years with serious and growing 
problems of health care costs, access, and quality. Too often, these 
problems have been addressed as independent issues. Recently, however, 
attention has been paid to their common elements and interactions, 
in particular the relationship between the level or type of individualshealth 
insurance coverage (or the lack of insurance coverage) and the individualshealth 
status, health outcomes for specific medical conditions, and the 
timing, nature, and location of health technologies used. The relationship 
between health insurance status (financial access), health outcomes, 
and use of health technology is critical because there are more than 
31 million uninsured people (nonelderly) and perhaps 20 million to 
60 million additional people with inadequate health insurance coverage 
in the United States (refers to those whose coverage does not protect 
them from health care expenses that equal or exceed 10 percent of 
their income). Insurance status and ability to pay for health care 
may not only affect the timing but even whether someone seeks care 
at all; and there is growing evidence that, in many instances, the 
eventual effects may be unnecessary deaths, more serious illness, 
and higher costs of health care. Thus, financial coverage (including 
public and private sources) affects not only access but also the 
quality and costs of health care.
<P>The goal of this OTA assessment is to provide an objective, rigorously 
critiqued analysis of the often complex, sometimes disputed, network 
of relationships between health insurance status (either lack of 
insurance coverage or having inadequate coverage) and negative health 
outcomes, poor health status, and the timing, location, and nature 
of health technologies and services delivered. It is the intent of 
OTA to provide Congress with a clear picture of these important relationships 
in the context of the U.S. health care system and its financing so 
that Congress can take them into account as it considers substantial 
changes in national health policy.

<P>The United States spends a larger share of its gross national 
product (GNP) on health can than any other country. This trend, which 
began about 12 years ago, shows no sign of abating. In 1988, U.S. 
per capita health expenditures wereat $2,140already $546 more than 
in Canada, which was in second place. By the turn of the century, 
according to Health Care Financing Administration projections, this 
sector of the Nations economy will consume 16.4 percent of the GNP 
(one dollar in six) up from 12.3 per cent (one dollar in eight) today. 
The goal of the proposed OTA assessment is to: 1) identify how differences 
in organization, adoption and use of medical technologies among industrialized 
countries contribute to differences in costs and health outcomes; 
and 2) how differences in the structure of health financing, payment, 
and regulation among industrialized countries contribute to the different 
patterns of technology use among countries.

<HR><H3><A NAME="osteo">Policy Issues in the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis 
(R)</A></H3>
<P>It is estimated that 15 to 24 million Americans have osteoporosis,a 
condition in which bone mass, density, and quality are diminished, 
causing a persons bones to be fragile and highly susceptible to fracture. 
Older people are far more likely than younger people to have osteoporosis, 
and women are more likely than men to have it, but 20 percent of 
people with osteoporosis are men. At least 1.3 million fractures 
attributable to osteoporosis occur each year. The cost of osteoporosisprimarily 
the cost of medical and nursing care for people with hip fractureswas 
estimated to be $6 to $10 billion in 1986. As the older population 
grows, so will the number of people who have it, the number of fractures, 
and the associated costs.
<P>Since there are no proven methods for reversing osteoporosis, 
prevention is a primary objective. Many people already have osteoporosis 
by the time they are 65, so prevention generally must take place 
in younger age groups. Some methods of preventing osteoporosis are 
medical treatments, and other methods involve lifestyle changes, 
including diet and exercise. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some 
people are worried about osteoporosis but confused about how to prevent 
it.
<P>Osteoporosis often is not diagnosed in an individual until he 
or she has sustained a fracture, by which time, prevention may no 
longer be a possibility. The capacity of existing technologies to 
detect bone loss early in the disease process and the cost of the 
technologies are key questions in deciding what the role of screening 
should be in any initiative to prevent osteoporosis.

<P>Studies of possible long-term health effects stemming from aspects 
of military service in Vietnam were mandated in 1979 (Public Law 
96-151) and 1981 (Public Law 97-72). Both laws require the approval 
of study protocols and monitoring of approved studies by OTA. The 
Centers for Disease Control were given responsibility for designing 
and carrying out these studies in 1983, and, with OTA approval, have 
been engaged in two studiesthe Vietnam Experience study and the Selected 
Cancers Studysince then. CDC has stated and OTA concurred that a 
large-scale Agent Orange study is not feasible. OTA will continue 
to monitor the two ongoing studies. A recent law (Public Law 99-272) 
contained a mandate for a study of women Vietnam veterans, and OTA 
is functioning similarly in regard to this study. Thus far, no protocol 
has been approved.

<li>Accounting Standards, Current Text or any other GAAP Guide </li>
</ul>
<h3>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>Intermediate accounting is truly the beginning of your accounting career. It may well be the most 
important accounting course you take in your undergraduate curriculum because it presents the 
foundation on which all accounting decisions are made. Accounting has both a theoretical/conceptual 
basis and a practical/issue-oriented basis. You will be exposed to both theory and practice in 
Intermediate Accounting. Specific course goals or objectives are as follows. </p>
<ol>
<li>To help students gain a deeper understanding of the foundations, concepts, and standards 
underlying accounting practices and techniques. (Theory) </li>
<li>To help students gain a deeper understanding of the knowledge and skills used in financial 
accounting. (Practice) </li>
<li>To help students develop analytical skills, logical thinking abilities, oral presentations skills, and 
written communication skills. (Please read the articles &quot;Good Writing Counts&quot; and &quot;Some 
Thoughts on the Uniform CPA Examination.&quot;) </li>
<li>To help students develop interpersonal skills, including the ability to work effectively with 
others. </li>
<li>To help students develop the skills and knowledge base necessary to successfully complete 
various professional examinations. </li>
</ol>
<h3>ACCOUNTING PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>The objectives of the accounting program at Idaho State University are spelled out in a &quot;Message to 
Accounting Students&quot; which is available through the office of the chairman of the Accounting 
Department. </p>
<p>*The practice set is not yet available in the bookstore. </p>
<h3>GRADING</h3>
<p>Because this course is the beginning of your accounting career, it has a variety of objectives. The 
course-specific objectives are presented in a preceding section of this Statement of Class Policies. 
The overall objectives of the accounting program are stated in a separate letter to accounting 
students. Because of the many course-specific and program objectives, grading in this class is much 
more than a quantitative analysis. Grades on exams and other class projects will most certainly be a 
determinate in the final course grade, but the instructor's professional judgment of your success in 
meeting course and program objectives will also be a determinate. Please remember that the overall 
grade in this course will be the considered opinion of the instructor with many variables taken into 
account. </p>
<p>To assist you in judging your performance on specific class examinations and assignments, the 
following schedule of possible points and a tentative numeric interpretation of those points is 
presented. Please remember that this schedule is for your benefit only. The overall grade in this 
course will take into account your professional demeanor and your progress as a professional. </p>
<table border=1>

<p>I do not post grades at the end of the semester, nor do I give grades over the telephone. You may 
leave with me a stamped, self-addressed envelope which will be used to send you your final grade. </p>
<h3>HOMEWORK/QUIZ POINTS AND CLASS PARTICIPATION</h3>
<p>Classroom attendance and advance preparation are expected. On the first day a chapter is assigned 
you are expected to have read the chapter before class. I may not lecture on the textbook directly 
since you are capable of reading it. On the dates assigned, you are expected to have the assigned 
problems completed (or at least significantly attempted) before class. We may use the assigned 
problems/questions as the basis for class discussion. Quizzes/homework points will consist of points 
for homework which will be collected on a random basis and/or problems assigned to be worked in 
class. If a problem is collected for a homework grade or a quiz is given unannounced and you are not 
present, you MAY NOT make up the points. </p>
<h3>EXAMS</h3>
<p>Unless your absence is excused in advance, missed exams cannot be made up! They will be 
recorded as a zero. If there are circumstances which the instructor feels warrants such action, exams 
may be taken early. </p>
<h3>WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
<p>Because accounting professionals are expected to communicate their thoughts and problem analysis 
in a variety of written forms, this course will require written papers on assigned topics. These papers 
are to be SHORT, executive-type summaries of the assigned material. The papers are to be created 
in a WordPerfect file and are to be transmitted via e-mail. </p>
<p>An Executive Summary is generally a &#147;paraphrased&#148; summary of the required reading material 
emphasizing the most important points of the material. Generally, SHORT shall mean three pages or 
less (but no more). In addition to being graded on content, your papers will be graded on grammar, 
sentence structure, and organization. Part of the assignment requires that you identify the important 
points in the reading material and include only the important points in your summary. </p>
<p>If you have trouble with this assignment, I suggest that you utilize the ISU writing lab. </p>
<h3>PRACTICE SET</h3>
<p>The practice set is to be an independent project to help you review the entire accounting cycle. 
Independent does not mean that you cannot confer with your classmates, but it does mean that you 
cannot copy your classmates. Please reread the section of the &quot;Message to Accounting Students&quot; 
which deals with ethics and professionalism. </p>
<h3>PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS</h3>
<p>During much of your professional career you will be expected to participate in professional 
organizations and continuing professional education. You are encouraged to begin this activity in 
college. Participation in the Accounting Club/Beta Alpha Psi is one, but not the only, way to 
demonstrate such participation. </p>
<h3>ACADEMIC DISHONESTY</h3>
<p>If, in my opinion, you have given or received unauthorized aid on an examination or outside project, 
you will receive a grade of zero on that exam or project. If the infraction warrants such action, your 
conduct will be reported to the appropriate university officials. </p>
<h3>USE OF TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>In this course you will be required to make extensive use of modern technology for communication. 
Your papers will be created in a computer word-processing package and submitted, as an attached 
file, via electronic mail. Your syllabus and class policies will be available on the ISU COB Home 
Page. I will use both the Home Page and electronic mail to communicate with you during the 
semester and you will be expected to check each regularly for communications. </p>

<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Auditing I is the only accounting course
you take in your undergraduate curriculum that presents material
specifically related to performing the attest function. Because
a thorough understanding of generally accepted accounting principles
and financial reporting is required in order to perform a financial
statement audit, Auditing is generally one of the last courses
taken in your undergraduate program. Specific course goals or
objectives are as follows.<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">1. To help students gain a deeper understanding
of the foundations, concepts, and standards underlying auditing
practices and techniques. (Theory)</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">2. To help students gain a deeper understanding
of the practices and procedures used in financial statement auditing.
(Practice)</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">3. To help students develop analytical
skills, logical thinking abilities, oral presentations skills,
and written communication skills.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">4. To help students develop interpersonal
skills, including the ability to work effectively with others.</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">5. To help students develop the skills
and knowledge base necessary to successfully complete various
professional examinations. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">ACCOUNTING PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</FONT></U></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The objectives of the accounting program
at Idaho State University are spelled out in a &quot;Message to
Accounting Students&quot; which is available through the office
of the chairman of the Accounting Department.<BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">GRADING</FONT></U></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Because this course is taken near the
<U>end of your undergraduate accounting program</U>, it has a
variety of objectives. The course-specific objectives are presented
in a preceding section of this Statement of Class Policies. The
overall objectives of the accounting program are stated in a separate
letter to accounting students. Because of the many course-specific
and program objectives, grading in this class is much more than
a quantitative analysis. Grades on exams and other class projects
will most certainly be a determinate in the final course grade,
but the instructor's professional judgment of your success in
meeting course and program objectives will also be a determinate.
Please remember that the overall grade in this course will be
the considered opinion of the instructor with many variables taken
into account. <BR>
</FONT></TT>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">To assist you in judging your performance
on specific class examinations and assignments, the following
schedule of possible points and a tentative numeric interpretation
of those points is presented. Please remember that this schedule
is for your benefit only. The overall grade in this course will
take into account your professional demeanor and your progress
as a professional.<BR>

<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">This course is the first accounting
course in which you will be exposed to an in-depth analysis of
accounting for governmental and other not-for-profit entities.
It is one step along the path of your accounting career. This
course presents the foundation on which all accounting for not-for-profit
entities is based. Accounting for these special entities has both
a theoretical/ conceptual basis and a practical, issue-oriented
basis. You will be exposed to both theory and practice in this
course. Specific course goals or objectives are as follows.<BR>
</FONT></SUB></TT>

step in your accounting career, it has a variety of objectives.
The course-specific objectives are presented in a preceding section
of this Statement of Class Policies. The overall objectives of
the accounting program are stated in a separate letter to accounting
students. Because of the many course-specific and program objectives,
grading in this class is much more than a quantitative analysis.
Grades on exams and other class projects will most certainly be
a determinate in the final course grade, but the instructor's
professional judgment of your success in meeting course and program
objectives will also be a determinate. Please remember that the
overall grade in this course will be the considered opinion of
the instructor with many variables taken into account. <BR>
o assist you in judging your performance on specific class examinations
and assignments, the following schedule of possible points and
a tentative numeric interpretation of those points is presented.
Please remember that this schedule is for your benefit only. The
overall grade in this course will take into account your professional
demeanor and your progress as a professional.</FONT></SUB></TT>

<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Classroom attendance and advance
preparation are expected. Homework is for your benefit, not course
credit. To the extent possible, the assigned problems will be
discussed in class. Because you are upperclassmen capable of reading
the textbook, class time will usually be devoted to discussing
your individual CAFR projects or analysis of the material presented.

<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Unless your absence is excused
in advance, missed exams cannot be made up! They will be recorded

warrants such action, exams may be taken early.<BR>

<P>
<TT><U><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">PAPERS</FONT></SUB></U></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">There are three papers assigned.
The subjects appear on the class assignment sheets. The reading
materials will be available in the library, through the reserve
desk. These papers are to be SHORT. Three pages, transmitted electronically,
are all that is expected. They are to be &quot;executive summaries.&quot;
The papers should demonstrate three things: (1) you read the assigned
material, (2) you understood the material, and (3) you can communicate
that understanding.</FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">An executive summary is generally
a </FONT></SUB></TT><SUB><FONT FACE="Arial">A</FONT></SUB><TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">paraphrased</FONT></SUB></TT><SUB><FONT FACE="Arial">@</FONT></SUB><TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">
summary of the important points in the reading material. In addition
to being graded on content, your papers will be graded on grammar,
sentence structure, and organization. Part of the assignment requires
that you identify the important points in the reading material
and include only the important points in your summary. </FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">If you have trouble with this
assignment, I suggest that you utilize the ISU writing lab.<BR>

</FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">CAFR Project</FONT></SUB></U></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The CAFR Project is an analysis
of an actual set of financial statements. You will be furnished
with a CAFR of a particular local government. You will be required
to write to a City of your choice (which I will approve) to receive
a CAFR for a student in the next class. </FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The purpose of the completed
report should be two-fold. First, the report should address the
particular reporting standards used by your entity and whether
or not those reporting standards are acceptable. If you find violations
of GAAP, discuss these violations in terms of what standards are
violated. (Please help me by identifying the page(s) of the CAFR
on which the error appears.) </FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Second, arrive at a decision
about the financial condition of the financial reporting entity
and/or any of its component units. Please document how you arrived
at your decision, including page references to assist the reader.
In addition, you should point out any implications of the financial
data. For example, if 75% of the structures of a school system
are over 50 years old, the logical interpretation is that a building
project is imminent. </FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">To assist you in your financial
analysis, a checklist is on reserve at the library. That should
not be your only means of analyzing the CAFR, but it should help
you.</FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The paper on the CAFR should
be about 25 pages. Fifteen pages would be acceptable, if it covered
all of the relevant material. The paper should be typed in WordPerfect
format, double-spaced, and submitted electronically by the due
date. You must also submit your CAFR so that I will have it when
I grade the papers. You may have your CAFR back when I have completed
the grading.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">PROJECT</FONT></SUB></U></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">You should participate in a
community project of assistance to a governmental entity or non-profit
agency. For example, you may participate in a project to analyze
NFP financial statements for United Way. You should do this project
in teams. Discuss your project with me before starting the project.
<BR>

</FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">ACADEMIC DISHONESTY</FONT></SUB></U></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">If, in my opinion, you have
given or received unauthorized aid on an examination or outside
project, you will receive a grade of zero on that exam or project.
If the infraction warrants such action, your conduct will be reported
to the appropriate university officials.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></SUB></TT>
<P>
<TT><U><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">USE OF TECHNOLOGY</FONT></SUB></U></TT>
<P>
<TT><SUB><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In this course you will be
required to make extensive use of modern technology for communication.
Your papers will be created in a computer word-processing package
and submitted, as an attached file, via electronic mail. Also,
your assignments and other communications from me will be available
on the ISU COB Home Page on the World Wide Web. You will be expected
to check the electronic mail and the Home Page regularly for messages.

</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>This menu option should be able to save the contents of the edit area to a file. if a file name is not already known to the program, this option should prompt for a file name (using the common dialog).</P>

</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Replace Menu Option</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The replace option should be similar to the find option except for the fact that the system will replace ALL occurrences of the &quot;search&quot; string with the &quot;replace&quot; string.

<P>The window itself should have its &quot;windowstate&quot; property set to &quot;0 - sizeable.&quot;  This will allow the user to adjust the window at run time.  As a consequence of this, the text edit area will have to resize when the form does.  To accomplish this task, use the &quot;resize&quot; event of the form and the &quot;move&quot; method of the text box.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Other Options (Optional)</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Any individual who would like to add additional options to this program may do so.

NOTE: all required materials must work properly before any additional features will be accepted for extra credit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Additional optional sections could include:</P>
<P>&#9;Adding a &quot;Find Next&quot; to the Search Menu</P>
<P>&#9;Modifying the replace function so that it may do either a single replace or replace ALL.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Product Delivery Requirements</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>This project should follow the naming convention for variables and objects.  This project will be graded based on the requirements listed in the &quot;Program Requirements&quot; section of the syllabus.</P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The &quot;Clear Errors&quot; menu option should clear the list box used to store errors or status messages (LSTBox.Clear).</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Start Menu Option</P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The &quot;New&quot; option under the file menu should clear the &quot;error display area&quot; as well as the &quot;text edit area&quot;.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><P>Interface Changes</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The text processor has a slightly different interface than the scripting program you are about to write.  The following sections itemize changes necessary to the interface to allow it to function in the script processor.</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>New List Box</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The new interface requires a text edit area like before and a list box at the top of the screen for status messages from the script process.  Directly below the list box should be the multi-line text box you used in your notepad program.</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Resize Event</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The Resize Event of the primary form may have to change.  If you coded the resize event to move your text box to the upper left position of the window, you will have to pass the left and top of the text box as the starting point for your move command instead of the hard-coded parameters used.   The resize event should resize the text box only not the list box.  See Figure 1 for a picture of the interface.</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Text Box</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The text box in your notepad should have the &quot;ScrollBars&quot; property set to &quot;Vertical.&quot;  For this new program, the &quot;ScrollBars&quot; property should be set to &quot;Both.&quot;  This will ensure that a command will not  wrap an look line more than one line when the use is modifying scripts.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><P>Script Description</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The scripts your program will process will have one command per line and will be loaded in to the text edit area by your File, Open command.  Because each command is stored on one line, they will be separated by Carriage Return  and Line Feed characters (Chr$(13) &amp; Chr$(10)) or  VbCrLF constant).  Each command will have a name (described below) and a series of command line parameters.  The parameters will exist in the same order as described in this document.  The processing of the script must not be case sensitive.  All command line parameters will be divided by spaces Chr$(32).  Any parameter that has spaces as part of the data will be passed will have the parameter enclosed in double quotes (Chr$(34)).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For example, one command you will execute is the copy command.  This command has the syntax: Copy c:\file1.txt c:\file2.txt; where &quot;file1&quot; is the source file to copy and &quot;file2 is the file to copy to.  Your program will be able to divide the command up into its sections:  &quot;Copy&quot;, &quot;c:\file1.txt&quot;, and &quot;c:\file2.txt.&quot;  After this point your program will execute the VB internal command: FileCopy and pass it the appropriate parameters.  Later in this document you will find a list of all command that must be accepted and their format.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When a command is processed, it should return any and status messages to the list box (as described below).</P>

Professors at Baylor University Use Visual C++&reg; and Visual Basic&reg; to Give Students Valuable 
Experience in Solving "Real World" Design Problems</center>
</b>
<P>

April 1996
<P>

For students seeking jobs in the area of computer systems design, Baylor Univerity, in Waco, Texas, offers 
a course which recognizes the importance of both hardware and software. Using Microsoft Visual C++ 
and Microsoft Visual Basic in a laboratory-based course, students create functional solutions to well-
defined design problems. 
<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

At Baylor University, EGR 4438 started as an advanced logic course. But with the need for practical 
experience solving real-world design problems, the class now concentrates on computer systems issues 
where both hardware and software are important elements. In the course, which emphasizes lab work, 
students are expected to design and integrate computer systems (hardware and software) that solve 
specific, real-world design problems.<P>

<b>Microsoft software adds to lab experiences</b><BR>

The goal of EGR 4438 is to teach students the principles of computer system design. Professor Steven 
Eisenbarth chose Microsoft Visual C++, Visual Basic, and Windows NT&reg; for the programming tools 
and development environment in the labs.
<P>

"I needed a stable environment for C/C++ to be used in the design of real-time and embedded computer 
systems," says Eisenbarth. "The target systems are embedded (Intel 386) systems which allow the software 
to be developed on a host system (Windows NT) and then easily transported to the target system for test 
and debugging."
<P>
Textbooks for the course include <u>BiCMOS/CMOS Systems Design</u> by Buchanan and 
<u>Definition of the Engineering Method</u> by Koen, but the focus of the class is definitely lab work. 
Products of lab and design projects constitute 60 percent of the course grade. Projects include designing, 
implementing, and testing a low-speed, shared-bus communications network and a distributed data 
acquisition system; and designing, prototyping, and testing an optical scanner. In these projects, students 
are able to choose which programming language (C/C++ or Visual Basic) suits their needs.<P>

<b>Students find success in real-world designs</b><BR>

With its emphasis on designing complete solutions, the class teaches students more than programming 
techniques or specifics about hardware issues. Project teams must consider system integration, packaging, 
design for testability and manufacturability. Projects are judged on the team's documentation and oral 
presentations, as well as the hardware and software the team has produced.
<P>

Success in class labs helps prepare students for successful job searches outside of college. "Companies 
such as Dell, Motorola, Texas Instruments, and AMD have hired these students," says Eisenbarth. "These 
jobs cover a wide range of positions from manufacturing to hardware and software systems design."
<P>

<blockquote><i>
"Microsoft's willingness to provide Visual C++ and Visual Basic for class/lab development made a 
considerable difference in the quality of the educational experience for my students"</i><p>

Using Microsoft&reg; Visual C++&reg; Helps a Struggling Community College Offer
"Real-World" Development Tools to Students</center>

</b>
<P>

April 1996

<P>

At North Idaho College in Coeur d'Alene, CS 150 offers an introduction to the field of computer science 
using Microsoft Visual C++  and Microsoft Windows&reg; 95. To help students understand the software 
development process, at least one program assignment is a team project in which the class creates a useful 
piece of software for the campus or a local business.

<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

At North Idaho College, administrators have revised several computer science courses to keep up with 
existing technology demands. Courses are now taught with Microsoft products such as Microsoft 
Windows 95, Visual Basic&reg;, and Visual C++.
<P>

<b>Choosing Microsoft Software</b><BR>

Professor David Mann uses Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft Windows 95 in his Computer Science 
150 course, an introduction to the field of computer science that includes computer organization, 
algorithmic problem solving, and structured program design. The class is a requirement for all Computer 
Science majors at NIC, and students must also take a concurrent CS-150 lab with the course.

<P>

CS-150 provides computer science students with an opportunity to gain experience and confidence to 
prepare them for a rigorous Data Structures/ Algorithms class. Required reading for the course includes 
<u>The Object Concept</u>, by Decker and Hirshfield, as well as the accompanying lab manual. 

<P>
Mann chose Microsoft programming languages in part because they are used to develop applications in 
businesses as well as in the academic sphere. In addition, evaluation of various software packages 
indicated that Microsoft programming tools were industry standards -- important for preparing students 
for life past college halls. "We felt that if the languages were understandable for our beginning students, 
then the students would be better off to learn these languages as opposed to some teaching language that 
they would never see again," says Mann.

<P>

<b>Helping Students Learn the Development Process</b><BR>

During the first month of the course, Mann has his students use Visual C++ to code both a half adder and 
a full adder inside the machine. Students then move to a more complicated programming project -- 
currently, CS-150 students are creating a UPS-style package tracker simulation.

<P>

At least one program assignment is a class project where students create a useful (but not too large) piece 
of software for the campus or a local business. Students are assigned to teams and have an opportunity to 
experience what it's like to develop software applications in the "real world" plus interact with each other 
on the development team.

<P>
Next fall, Mann plans on assigning a design problem that will provide a much-needed solution for the 
campus. CS-150 students will use Visual C++ to write a package for NIC administrators to manage and 
track faculty assignments to committees -- plus the terms of the assignments.

"It means a great deal to me and this department to have some direct support from the industry as we try 
to keep current in a rapidly changing field."</i><p>

Professors at Illinois Institute of Technology Use Visual C++&reg;
and "Real-World" Solutions to Get Students Excited About Computer Science</center>

</b>
<P>

April 1996
<P>

At Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago, Illinois, professors are using Microsoft&reg; Visual 
C++  in a new laboratory-based computer science curriculum. Students use Visual C++ to create 
functional solutions to well-defined design problems. They then attend review meetings where they 
receive constructive feedback on their project designs, preliminary programs, and final projects. 
<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

Seven years ago, IIT administrators asked themselves a difficult question: "What are we doing to excite 
students about computer science?" As a result, professors changed the way they taught their computer 
science courses -- creating a structure where students are challenged to be active, creative partners in the 
learning process, and providing ample support for their creative endeavors. 
<P>

<b>Giving constructive feedback</b><BR>

Associate Professor James Roberge' uses Visual C++ to teach a Data Structures and Algorithms class, a 
requirement for all CS majors. The goal of the course is for students to learn how to implement and apply 
the essential data structures used in computer science, with particular emphasis on object-oriented 
design/programming (OOD/OOP). 
<P>

Textbooks for the course include <u>Introduction to Programming in C++</u>: A Laboratory Course, by 
Roberge' and Smith, and C++: How to Program, by Deitel and Deitel.
<P>
A required, weekly hands-on lab complements the lectures. Professor Roberge' provides assignments in 
Visual C++ where students work with a lab instructor and their peers to eliminate any flaws in their 
designs. "Rather than simply returning graded homework, we give students support as they solve problems 
for themselves," says Roberge'. "The resulting self-confidence and sense of mastery is readily apparent, 
both to them and to us."
<P>

<b>Visual C++ -- the tool of choice</b><BR>

Because the interface is so easy to learn, Roberge' chose Visual C++ as the compiler of choice to teach 
students who are a mix of undergraduates and upper division students from other majors. "We're among 
the first programs to base our introductory courses on object-oriented programming in C++," says 
Roberge'.
<P>

Another reason for the choice is the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). At the introductory level, 
MFC makes it easy for CS professors to develop application frameworks for student programming 
projects. For more advanced courses, MFC vividly shows the ease with which powerful software products 
can be developed using contemporary tools and software development technologies.

<P>
Changing the way the school taught computer science has benefited students and faculty alike. Evidence 
of the success is that area corporations often demand IIT students for their summer internships and co-op 
positions. "Most important," adds Roberge', "our students are noticeably more excited about computer 
science as a profession."
<P>

<blockquote><i>
"Visual C++ and MFC make it easy to create lab exercises that are practical, pedagogically sound, and 
which focus on novel applications -- rather than simply reconstituted exercises that have survived since 
the 'Dawn of the Computer Age'."</i><p>

Computer Science Students at Moorpark College in California Use Visual Basic&reg; to Create Practical 
Applications for the Real World</center>

</b>
<P>
May 1996

<P>

At Moorpark College in Moorpark, California, the computer science faculty stresses hands-on learning, so 
CIS-3B, Advanced Visual Basic, is taught in the computer lab instead of in a classroom. For the final 
programming assignment, students must design and develop an application that could be sold 
commercially in either a vertical or a horizontal market. 
<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

When Professor Guy Campbell at Moorpark College designed his Visual Basic courses, he "built them 
from the ground up." Originally a C/C++ programmer, Professor Campbell became proficient in the 
Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic programming system to create more than 30 projects for classes that range 
from beginning to advanced.
<P>
"Advanced Visual Basic is a very hands-on course," explained Professor Campbell. "Because it is taught 
in the school's computer lab, students spend over two-thirds of their class time using Visual Basic."
<P>

<b>High-level programming topics</b><BR>

CIS-3B is required for all computer science majors at Moorpark. Students must have previous Visual 
Basic programming experience to enroll in the course.
<P>

The CIS-3B syllabus includes creating, accessing, organizing, and processing databases with Visual Basic 
and linking and embedding objects from OLE server applications, plus creating both OLE- and Visual 
Basic-based applications.
<P>
Required textbooks include <u>Essential Visual Basic 4</u>, by Mark Steven Heyman, and <u>The 
Visual Guide to Visual Basic 4.0 for Windows</u>, by Richard Mansfield. Professor Campbell also 
recommends that his students get Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0, Professional Edition, so that they 
can complete programming assignments at home.
<P>

<b>Students get real with Visual Basic</b><BR>

To help the class understand real-world program development, each student must design and code a 
commercially viable application.
<P>

One student used Visual Basic to create a home data center in which everyone in the family could write 
notes to the others, keep track of his or her favorite television shows and movies, and even maintain 
private diaries that were password protected.

<P>
Another student, an insurance adjuster, used the final programming project to streamline his business. He 
created a proprietary Visual Basic-based application to enter and maintain his clients' insurance 
adjustments (such as for earthquake damage) that were previously done only on paper.
<P>
In almost every case, the class's final projects have exceeded Professor Campbell's expectations. "I'm quite 
proud," he said, "that some of my students' ideas do become viable products."
<P>

<blockquote><i>
"With Visual Basic, students don't have to keep so much in their heads until the program compiles -- they 
can see how the program will run as they code. This makes it easy for them to construct programs that run 
right the first time around."</i><p>
                     <blockquote><font size=1>

Professors at Northeast Louisiana University Find Visual C++&reg; Flexible Enough to Use in Computer 
Classes That Range from Beginning to Advanced</center>
</b>
<P>
May 1996

<P>
At Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe, computer science students progress through a sequence of 
courses to learn to program in Microsoft&reg; Visual C++. Because Visual C++ presents an intuitive 
development environment, professors have begun to teach object-oriented programming in lower-level 
courses. An advanced class -- CSCI 498 -- now focuses on object-oriented design.
<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

When CSCI faculty at Northeast Louisiana University designed their curriculum, they agreed that the 
Visual C++ development system should be the primary language for computer science majors. 
<P>
The faculty adapted three required classes from earlier introductory material that had been taught in 
Pascal before the department switched to Visual C++. They then created a fourth course, CSCI 498, 
Object Oriented Programming, as an elective. CSCI 498 teaches object-oriented design to students who 
have been introduced to the concept in the lower-level courses.

<P>

<b>Learning object-oriented design </b><BR>

CSCI 498 was originally intended to teach students object-oriented programming. However, according to 
Professor Ron Classen, "As we include more object-oriented programming in the lower-level courses, 
CSCI 498 is evolving into an OO design course." The class learns methods of identifying classes and 
objects, the process and annotation for object-oriented design, and case studies of object-oriented systems.
<P>

Using Visual C++, students also develop object-oriented software, including a bank simulation and several 
programs for the Windows&reg; operating system that utilize the Microsoft Foundation Class Library.
<P>
<u>C++ Inside and Out</u>, by Bruce C. Eckel, and <u>The C++ Programming Language, Second 
Edition</u>, by Bjarne Stroustrup, are required textbooks for the course.
<P>

<b>Visual C++ language for all classes</b><BR>

Faculty members use Visual C++ as a programming environment in courses that range from basic to 
complex. According to Professor Classen, Visual C++ "allows development of simple applications so that 
beginning students do not have to know a great deal about the Microsoft Windows environment and 
Windows classes. On the other hand," he added, "there are professional-level capabilities -- such as the 
Microsoft Foundation Class Library, the menu editor, and the icon editor -- that are useful for students in 
the more advanced courses." 
<P>

Students in CSCI 498 enjoy learning object-oriented design using Visual C++. The reason? They can 
concentrate on interface design without having to handle vast amounts of code to implement it. According 
to Professor Classen, using Visual C++ helps his computer science students "become proficient at 
programming using an industrial-strength software development tool."
<P>

<blockquote><i>
"Visual C++ provides an excellent development environment. It allows programming of simple, MS-
DOS&reg;-type applications so that beginning students do not have to know a great deal about the 
Windows environment."</i><p>

Students in a Database Design Course at the University of Illinois Discover Their Skills Translate into 
Increased Job Opportunities</center>
</b>
<P>
May 1996

<P>
At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, CS 411 students use the Microsoft&reg; Visual 
C++&reg; development system to implement real-world database design projects. Exposure to database 
management and advanced programming tools gives these students a head start on their careers. Many 
receive job offers from industry leaders such as Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, and Informix.
<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

CS 411, Design of Database Management Systems, is a graduate-level computer science course at the 
University of Illinois. In the class, Professor Sharod Mehrotra teaches in-depth theory and database 
management implementation.
<P>
CS 411 is an elective for computer science majors at the college. A prerequisite course, CS 311, Database 
Systems, focuses on beginning-level database issues. 

<P>
Required reading includes <u>Optimized 2-Safe Approach</u>, by S. Mehrotra, plus a wide variety of 
research papers and conference proceedings on database topics.
<P>

<b>Microsoft products are first choice</b><BR>

The computer science faculty at UIUC chose Microsoft products to facilitate class projects. Students get 
hands-on experience with Microsoft Access, Visual C++, Microsoft SQL ServerTM, the Microsoft 
PowerPoint&reg; presentation graphics program, and the Windows NT&reg; operating system. "The main 
reasons for using Microsoft products are the students' desire to learn more about PC computing 
environments, the ease of use of [the] software, and its availability," said Professor Mehrotra. 
<P>

Class assignments and a project report represent 25 percent of a student's grade. Some of the projects are 
quite advanced, requiring students to use several software products. In one project, students implemented 
a workflow management system, which they developed on top of SQL Server. In another project, students 
designed a prototype multimedia retrieval system. 

<P>

<b>Experience leads to job offers</b><BR>

Because of their advanced knowledge of Microsoft tools and database management, students in CS 411 
receive job offers from leaders in the industry. Potential employers -- such as AT&T, UniSQL, Hewlett-
Packard, and the Army Research Labs -- post openings on the course's Internet home page and offer 
positions ranging from summer internships to permanent, full-time work. Informix (in Menlo Park, 
California) hopes to make offers to 40 percent of the department's graduates. 
<P>

According to Professor Mehrotra, taking CS 411 allows his students to choose from a variety of careers 
when they graduate. "Experience with database products helps them get database design jobs," he said. 
"And by understanding data management and implementation issues, students are better prepared to 
succeed in system engineering related jobs.
<P>
