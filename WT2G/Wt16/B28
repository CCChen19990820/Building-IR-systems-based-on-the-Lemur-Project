<h3>Union Members Resent AFL-CIO Aid to Dems  - Frank Luntz
The Hill, May 8, 1996

</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>

<P>
Virtually everyone inside the Capital Beltway is familiar with the much ballyhooed political campaign being waged against the Republican Congress by organized labor. In fact, Washington-based labor bosses have bragged openly of their plan to spend $35 million in a campaign to defeat targeted Republicans. They have already increased mandatory dues to foot the bill, aired some of the most negative ads in years, and organized at the grass-roots level. In fact, the only thing they have not done is to inform their rank-and-file membership and ask their approval.
<P>
So we did. On behalf of Americans for a Balanced Budget, Luntz research surveyed 1,000 union members nationwide from April 23 through the 28th. The margin for error is +/-3.1%.
<P>
What we found may not please the Washington union leadership. What is surprising is not  the rank-and-file's objection to their dues being used for political activity - they do - but the depth and breadth of that opposition.
<P>
Union members overwhelmingly prefer the leadership of their local chapters to the leadership of their national chapters. When deciding union policy and priorities, members feel better represented by local chapters by a sizable 66 percent to 21 percent margin. When asked who does a better job in terms of "candidates, politics and political issue," local leadership again beast national leadership - 44 percent to 32 percent
<P>
Furthermore, 25 percent told us they "rarely" or "never" follow the advice of their local leadership, and that reaction jumps to 33 percent for national leadership. If forced to choose, only 13 percent would support a nationally endorsed candidate, while 41 percent would be more likely to support the local candidate. That does not bode well for the unions' current political effort. In fact, opposition to the effort will undoubtedly increase the split between local and national loyalty - with local unions the benefactors.
<P>
Union members have activities other than politics in mind when asked to prioritize union efforts. Preserving jobs was by far the top choice (58 percent), followed by increasing wages (27 percent). Improving the image of unions was a distant third (8 percent), but still chosen more often than engaging in political election activities (at just 4 percent). Even when given a second choice, only 9 percent chose election activities - the lowest response of the four.
<P>
This brings us to the partisan political campaign being waged by the Washington leadership. More than half of the rank-and-file had no idea such a campaign even existed. After they were told the AFL-CIO was planning to spend $35 million in mandatory monthly dues to defeat congressional Republicans, their reaction was overwhelmingly hostile.
<P>
Overall, 15 percent of the rank-and-file "strongly support" the campaign, 16 percent "somewhat support" it, while 21 percent "somewhat oppose." The bulk of members (41 percent) are "strongly opposed."
<P>
These results don't change by gender, age, education level or income. Even a plurality of Democrats (48 percent) oppose the campaign against the Republican Congress.
<P>
The biggest surprise? Those who voted against a GOP candidate for Congress in 1994 (and should endorse this effort) are evenly split :46 percent support the union effort, 46 percent oppose it.
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, among newest union members, the political campaign is opposed by a 77 percent to 19 percent margin. For a national leadership that claims to be committed to rebuilding their image, this is a very dangerous result.
<P>
We asked members if they knew they were eligible for a refund of their due spent for political purposes. Less than one-fifth responded affirmatively.
<P>
And when union members were told they had a right to a refund of dues spent for political purposes, one 20 percent would "definitely" request their money back, and another 20 percent would be "very likely" to request a refund.
<P>
Regarding the upcoming presidential campaign, Bill Clinton holds a healthy 50 percent to 20 percent lead over Bob Dole among union members, with Ross Perot at 11 percent and the remaining 19 percent undecided. The president leads among every union demographic group.
<P>
But while rank-and-file union membership is predisposed to support Clinton and other Democratic candidates in 1996, Republicans should not give up hope.
<P>
The beliefs and priorities of union members ought not to be confused with the beliefs and priorities of union leadership. After all, on issues like welfare reform, a balanced budget amendment and tax reductions - all opposed by national labor leaders - union members agree with us (87 percent, 82 percent and 78 percent respectively).
<P>
A local campaign waged from union hall to union hall - emphasizing balanced budgets, welfare reform and family tax cuts - could deliver up to 40 percent of the union vote, enough to ensure a GOP sweep in November. From ideology to issues, the rank-and-file is still up for grabs. The fact is, the average congressional Republican has more in common with them than their own Washington leadership.<P>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Robert Udowitz<br>

<p>
April 30, 1996			
</b>

<P>
More than 60%of union members oppose the AFL-CIO's negative advertising blitz against Republican House members, according to anationwide poll released today by Americans for a Balanced Budget. National AFL-CIO officials have earmarked $35 million in members' compulory dues money to defeat Congressional Republicans who support a balanced budget, tax cuts and welfare reform.
<P>
The poll, conducted by Frank Luntz and Associates between April 23-28, shows that national union officials are oput of touch with their members on union politics and priorities.
<P>
<ul>
<li> 62 percent of union members oppose the use of their dues for negative political advertising against Republicna House members.

<li> 82 percent want a constitutional amendment that requires Congress to balance the budget each year.

<li> 87 percent favor work requirements for welfare recipients and limits on the limits on the length of time they can collect welfare checks.

<li> 78 percent support tax reductions that include a $500 per child tax credit.

<li> When informed of national union officials' campaign against Republicans who support these porposals, 59 percent say they would ask for a refund of their dues.
</ul>
<P>
"Clearly Washington union officials are hopelessly out of touch with rank and file union members," said ABB president Tony Zagotta at a news conference at the National Press Club. "They are shamelessly plundering workers; compulsory dues to promote tax-and-spend policies that union members oppose.
<P>
"Union members, like their fellow Americans, overwhelmingly support a balanced budget. Fiscally responsible House members should take heart from these figures, and continue to press forward with genuine budget reform proposals. The American people are on our side."
<P>

Labor Intensive
<P>
Republican leaders are preparing an all-out attack designed to counter a $35 million campaign mounted by labor unions to help elect Democratic candidates this fall. Among the legislative plans being considered: a proposal that would require more-detailed disclosure of political lobbying and contributions by union members and a bill that would make it easier for workers to resign from a union. In addition, GOP leaders are expected to tout a new poll of 1000 union members that purportedly shows a split between the AFL-CIO's official political policies and the view of its rank-and-file over such issues as welfare reform, the minimum wage and a $500-per-child tax credit. The sponsor of the survey, a conservative organization called Americans for a Balanced Budget, also claims that about 70 percent of union members would likely ask for part of their dues back if they were aware of the difference between their view and those of the union leaders.
<P>

The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, April 30, 1996   Page 1
<P>
Union Politics spark mixed reaction, survey shows.
<P>
With the AFL-CIO vowing to spend at least $35 million to defeat House Republicans this fall, rank and file union members have been mostly mute. But silence doesn't mean support, says Americans for a Balanced Budget, a right-leaning lobby. In fact, the group says its own poll, to be released today, shows widespread dissent.
<P>
Republican pollster Frank Luntz questioned 1000 union members last week and found that 41% "strongly oppose" the AFL-CIO's spending plan while only 14% "strongly support" it. The remaining 45% have no strong opinion. Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees union and head of the AFL-CIO's political efforts, said the AFL-CIO's own surveys show overwhelming support.
<P>

The Washington Times, Wednesday, May 1, 1996 Page A18
<P>
What union members think
<P>
Perhaps more galling than the fact that the AFL-CIO has launcheda massive - and dubiously legal - political campaign to unseat freshmen House Republicans is the fact that they are wagin this campaign with the wages of their members, and without the workers' consent.
<P>
A poll conducted by Frank Luntz for Americans for a Balanced Budget, released yesterday, reveals just how far the union bosses have strayed from the priorities of the union rank and file. When union members were asked whether they supported or opposed the AFL-CIO's decision to spend $35 million in dues in an effort to defeat Republicans, 62 percent said they opposed the unions' political use of dues. Only 31 percent supported the big l;abor campaign.<P>
Union bosses like to pretend that they are "representing" workers in the political arena. But it's news to the workers. Less than half of the union members polled knew that the national labor unions were garnishing their wages to pay for a national political campaign. And only 19 percent knew that they were entitled to demand a refund on the portion of their dues apenst on politicking. Told about that right, a majority of the worker said they wanted those dollars back. As od now, the unions do not have an accounting to members for how their union dues are spent. Asked if they would support a new law to require full disclosure of where their due dollars are going, an overwhelming 84 percent of union members said yes.
<P>
The disconnect between big labor bosses and the workers becomes even more pronounced whenthe union members are asked - free of partisan labels - what they think of key proposals being advanced by the Republican Congress. Not suprisingly, workers were not too patient with those who don't work: Eightly-seven percent support welfare that requires work and I slimited of duration. They also support a balanced budget ammendment by a huge margin, with 82 percent in favor of a constitutional requirement that Washington keep its fiscal house in order. And more than three-fourths of the union workers voiced their support for tax cuts for working families.
<P>
Twice as many of the workers describe themselves as Democrats than Republicans. But the real leanings of the workers come through when asked if they are conservative, moderate or liberal: 44 percent call themselves conservative, 32 percent are moderates, and only 18 percent say liberal. Given that union bosses are lobbying for liberal policies, is it any surprise that well over half of the workers polled say that the attack on the Republican Congress is no way to spend their union dues?
<P>
What could better illustrate the Democrats' true concern for the "workers" whose interest they are always invoking? Presidentr Clinton and his compatriots are more than happy to benefit from money that has been taken from workers against their wishes. Reductions in employees take-home pay are all right, it seems, as long as the differenc ends up in Democratic campaign coffers.

<h3>BLASTS AFL-CLO CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION EFFORT<BR>
$35 MILLION TARGETED FOR 75 DISTRICTS<BR>
</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Ben Magliano<br>
202-638-6124<br>
<p>
             February 1, 1996</B> -- The AFL-CIO is planning to punish Republican congressmen who voted in favor of a 
balanced federal budget by pouring over $35 million dollars into 75 congressional races this 
year. Their goal is to win back Democratic control of the House of Representatives.<p>

This years $35 million dollar expenditure is seven times the normal amount spent by the 
ALF-CIO during an election year and represents an average of $466,000 per race. This figure is 
substantially higher than the $322,929 expended on all 1994 congressional races, according to 
current FEC data.<p>

&quot;I am amazed at the lengths the AFL-CIO will go in order to kill the balanced budget 
initiative, &quot; says Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget. &quot;Next to Bill 
Clinton, organized labor is a balanced budget's worst enemy.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget recently launched a nationwide radio campaign to 
correct the lies being told by the AFL-CIO over Medicare. These ads have run in Illinois, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, and 
Wyoming over the past month.<p>

&quot;The AFL-CIO launched a dishonest campaign last year against 27 Congressmen for their 
courageous votes to balance the budget,&quot; says Zagotta, &quot;It now appears that the union leadership 
is poised to take their deceitful message to an even greater audience.&quot;<p>

In addition to the millions of dollars the AFL-CIO will pour into these congressional 
races, the labor giant will also make in-kind contributions of AFL-CIO personnel and facilities. 
These in-kind donations could easily double the $35 million dollar independent media campaign.<p>

&quot;The Oregon Senate race is a good example of the in-kind support that the AFL-CIO will 
be extending to upcoming congressional races, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;More than 25 union activists 
were sent to Oregon to work full-time for Ron Wyden - that's a force nearly as big as Gordon 
Smith's entire campaign staff! In addition, the AFL-CIO paid for over 200,000 pieces of direct 
mail and set up phone banks throughout the state.&quot;<p>

AFL-CIO Leaders met with President Clinton for nearly two hours on January 8th 
and urged him to hold fast against Republican budget demands. In particular, the union 
representatives wanted to kill Medicare reform and reject any budget proposed 
tax cuts.<p>

&quot;Actions speak louder than words, so it is readily apparent that Bill Clinton lied to the 
American people during his State of the Union Address, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;The era of Big 
Government is alive and well and has a good friend in the White House.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in 
all fifty states.<p>

<p>
          February 2, 1996</B> -- Americans For a Balanced Budget has launched the fifth wave of its nationwide campaign to correct the 
distortions and lies being told about Medicare spending. The first radio spots began airing in 
Wyoming today.<p>

Washington Congresswoman has been targeted by the AFL-CIO 
and other liberal special interest groups due to her votes in favor of the balanced budget. 
Numerous television and radio advertisements funded by these groups have made the erroneous 
claim that Congresswoman Cubin voted to cut Medicare.<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget has decided to answer this charge with the truth. The budget 
passed by congress and vetoed by President Clinton increases Medicare spending by 48%.<p>

&quot;Check with any major news organizations - The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC 
News - Their reports all prove that the congressional plan increases Medicare spending, &quot; says 
Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget, &quot;These lies and distortions are 
designed to divert our attention away from President Clinton and his unwillingness to propose 
his own seven year balanced budget .&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in

</center>
<P>
Americans for a Balanced Budget(ABB) was founded in 1990 by David Miner, a 	member of the North Carolina General Assembly.  With over 200,000 members in all fifty 	states, ABB is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal budget.
<P>
ABB is a non-partisan, grassroots lobbying organization and registered as a 
501(c)(4) with the Internal Revenue Service.
<P>
The mission of ABB is to promote a balanced federal budget, a Balanced Budget
Amendment -- with tax limitation -- to the United States’ Constitution, and pro-growth
economic policies.
<P>
ABB’s efforts in these areas have earned the respect of senior political leaders
like Senator Bob Dole, who recently said, "Long before it became popular, ABB was 	working hard for a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility in Washington.  And since
its founding, ABB has played a major role in exposing the dangers of the welfare state
and of big government."
<P>
The current president of ABB is Tony Zagotta.  He is the former National 		Chairman of the College Republicans, and he most recently managed a congressional
campaign in North Carolina. 
<P>
<h2>The People at ABB</h2>
<h3>Tony Zagotta</h3>
Tony Zagotta, president of Americans for a Balanced Budget, joined ABB in February of 1995. 
He has overseen the growth of the organization to over 200,000 members nationwide. He is also 
directly responsible for the success of ABB's latest radio ad campaign.<p>

In addition to his time at ABB, he is the Chairman of the International Youth Democrat Union, 
the conservative international youth organization. He was elected in 1994 to a two-year term.  
The parent organization, the International Democrat Union, was founded by Ronald Reagan and 
Margaret Thatcher in 1983. The current co-Chairman is Jack Kemp.<p>

Previously, Zagotta was the National Chairman for the College Republicans. Originally elected 
in 1989 for a two-year term, he was re-elected in 1991. With a staff of ten, he planned the largest 
College Republican event in history when over 1200 students showed up for the Centiennial 
Celebration in July of 1992. During that time he was served as the Honorary Chairman of Youth 
for Bush/Quayle `92.<p>

Zagotta has been involved in politics since his graduation from Illinois State University. He has 
had experience in all different fields, ranging from being a Political Instructor for the 
International Republican Institute, to an International Observer at the Guatemala Presidential 
Elections in 1990. He was also a field representative for Jack Kemp for President in 1988 and 
was employed as a legislative assistant in the Illinois General Assembly in 1988.<p>

Zagotta relocated to Washington, DC, from his hometown in Chicago six years ago.<p>
<h3>Emily McGee</h3>
Emily McGee has been  at Americans for a Balanced Budget since February 1995. In addition to 
her tasks as Program Director, she has recently been promoted to Director of Online Services.<p>

Before McGee joined ABB, she worked at Smith & Harroff, Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia as an 
intern during the 1994 elections. While there she focused on several different aspects of 
campaign work, most notably media buying. She also assisted on research for the corporate 
clients.<p>

While a student at Colgate University, located in Hamilton, New York, she was active in College 
Republicans at the school, state, and national levels. Not only was she the club chairman and 
state executive director, she also spent several summers in Washington, DC volunteering at the 
College Republican National Committee. During that time she helped with the College 
Republican Biennial Convention as well as the Republican National Convention.<p>

Originally from Massachusetts, McGee moved to Washington shortly after she graduated from 
college in 1994. <p>

<title>Current Program Interests</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/bradley/bg.gif">
<blockquote><blockquote>

<center>
<img src="/bradley/hdr-cpi.gif">
</center>
<P>
The Foundation's Board, on occasion, undertakes to define and redefine its current program interests. At present, the Foundation aims to encourage projects that focus on cultivating a renewed, healthier, and more vigorous sense of citizenship among the American people, and among peoples of other nations, as well.<p>

The free society so central to the convictions and success of the Bradley brothers rests upon and is intended to nurture a solid foundation of competent, self-goveming citizens, who are understood to be fully capable of and personally responsible for making the major political, economic, and moral decisions that shape their own lives, and the lives of their children. Such decisions are made on the basis of common sense, received wisdom, traditional values, and everyday moral understandings, which are in tum nurtured and passed on to future generations by healthy families, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associabons, schools, and other valuegenerabng "mediating structures."<p>

This expansive understanding of citizenship is being 
challenged today, however, by contemporary forces and ideas that regard individuals more as passive and helpless vicbms of powerful extemal forces than as personally responsible, self-goveming citizens, and that foster a deep skepticism about citizenly values and mediating structures. Consequently, authority and accountability tend to flow away from citizens toward centralized, bureaucratic, "service-providing" institutions which claim to be peculiarly equipped to cope with those extemal forces on behalf of their "clients." This systematic disenfranchisement of the citizen, and the consequent erosion of citizenly mediating structures, pose grave threats to the free society that the Bradley brothers cherished.<p>

In light of these considerations, projects likely to be supported by the Foundation will generally share these assumptions:<p>
<ul>

<li>They will treat free men and women as genuinely self-goveming, personally responsible citizens, not as victims or clients.

<li>They will aim to restore the intellectual and cultural legitimacy of citizenly common sense, the received wisdom of experience, everyday morality, and personal character, refurbishing their roles as reliable guideposts of everyday life.

<li>They will seek to reinvigorate and reempower the traditional, local institutions -- families, schools, churches, and neighborhoods -- that provide training in and room for the exercise of genuine citizenship, that pass on everyday morality to the next generation, and that cultivate personal character.

<li>They will encourage decentralization of power and accountability away from centralized, bureaucratic, national institutions back to the states, localities, and revitalized mediating structures where citizenship is more fully realized.

</ul>
<p>

In addition to these thematic considerations, eligible projects will exhibit these  features:<p>

<ul>
<li>They may address any arena of public life -- economics, politics, culture, or civil society -- where citizenship as here understood is an important issue. It is important to note that our view of citizenship is not primarily concerned with promoting civics education, voter awareness or tum-out, or similar activities narrowly focused on voting and elections.

<li>They may address the problem of citizenship at home or abroad, where the fall of many (and the perpetuation of some) totalitarian regimes has made this issue particularly urgent.  In light of our emphasis on decentralization, and considering the Foundation's deep roots in Milwaukee and Wisconsin -- areas with proud traditions of innovation and experimentation in democratic citzenship -- community and state projects will be of particular interest to us. Such projects will aim to improve the life of the community through increasing cultural and educabonal opportunities, grass-roots economic development, and effective and humane social and health services, reflecting where possible the Foundation's focus on the resuscitation of citizenship.  

<li>Projects may be actual demonstrations of the resuscitation of citizenship in the economic, political, cultural, or social realms; policy research and writing about approaches encouraging that resuscitation; academic research and writing that explore the intellectual roots of citizenship, its decline, and prospects for revival; and popular writing and media projects that illustrate for a broader public audience the themes of citizenship.
</ul>
<p>

Much of the creative and energetic leadership essential for a renewal of citizenship will be supplied by gifted individuals, who must receive challenging and stimulating programs and instruction at all levels of their education. The Foundation supports programs that research the needs of gifted children and techniques of providing education for students with superior skills and/or intelligence. Research programs investigating how learning occurs in gifted children and demonstration programs of instruction are to be considered.

<img src="/bradley/hdr-gmp.gif">
</center>
<P>

The programs and funding decisions of The Bradley Foundation are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. At the discretion of the Board, the policies set forth herein will be modified in response to changing conditions and priorities.<p>

The guidelines established by the Board of Directors will normally preclude funding for unspecified and undetailed overhead costs. No funds will be authorized for fees payable to fund- raising counsel. In addition, grants without significant import to the Foundation's areas of interest will only under special conditions be considered for endowment or deficit financing purposes.<p>

The Foundation will:<p>
<ul>
<li>Normally award grants only to organizations and institutions exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Intemal Revenue Code and publicly supported under section 509(a)(1), (2) or (3);

<li>Favor projects which are not normally financed by public tax funds;

<li>Consider requests from religious organizations and institutions only when the resulting impact of the project is not primarily denominational;

<li>Consider requests for building projects on rare occasions and, in such cases where projects are reviewed, limit grants to only a small fraction of the total project cost.
</ul>
<p>

Grantees must possess the resources to properly administer grants from the Foundabon. The Foundabon conducts an annual evaluation of grants, and grantees are asked to provide periodic reports on the progress of their work.

<P>
In 1903, Lynde and Harry Bradley established a new business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It took courage and confidence for them to risk resources in a new venture, based only on their judgement of what was and their vision of what could be. The Bradleys' confidence was bolstered by the knowledge that in America, not only were they free to start a business, they could also begin again if they failed. The Bradleys, however, would not fail. Their business grew to become the Allen-Bradley Company.<p>

When the Allen-Bradley Company was acquired by Rockwell Intemational Corporation in 1985, a significant portion of the proceeds was dedicated to establishing The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Although it has no direct ties to the Allen-Bradley Company, the purpose of the Foundation is to commemorate Lynde and Harry Bradley by preserving and extending the principles and philosophy by which they lived and upon which they built the company.<p>

As their efforts succeeded, their business grew and eventually extended far beyond its Milwaukee headquarters. Lynde and Harry Bradley remained devoted to the city where they began their enterprise and in which they lived and worked for so many years. Their foundation will continue the Bradleys' interest in helping to improve the quality of life in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.<p>

The Bradleys lived and worked according to several philosophical principles. They :believed that, over time, the consequences of ideas were more decisive than the force of political or economic movements. They recognized the interdependence of human endeavors --  cultural, educational, philosophical, economic -- and they rejected exclusionary emphasis on any single element. The brothers had an abiding belief in the dignity and decency of each person. They felt that only in an environment of political and economic freedom could individuals develop their talents, hone their skills and intellects, and contribute to the improvement of the human condition. The success of the Allen-Bradley Company stands in eloquent testimony to the enduring quality of these principles.<p>

The Bradley brothers were committed to preserving and defending the tradition of free representative govemment and private enterprise which has enabled the American nation and, in a larger sense, the entire Westem world to flourish intellectually and economically. The Bradleys believed that the good society is a free society. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation is likewise devoted to strengthening American democratic capitalism and the institutions, principles and values which sustain and nurture it. Its programs support limited, competent govemment; a dynamic marketplace for economic, intellectual, and cultural activity; and a vigorous defense at home and abroad of American ideas and institutions. In addition, recognizing that responsible self- government depends on enlightened citizens and informed public opinion, the Foundation supports scholarly studies and academic achievement.

<h3>Milwaukee's Bradley Legacy<br>
Continues as Foundation<br>
Moves to Historic "Lion House"<br>
</h3>
<img src="/bradley/lionhouse.gif">
</center>
<P>
In Milwaukee's sesquicentennial year, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation has taken stewardship for one of the community's architectural treasures, relocating it headquarters to the landmark "Lion House" in the First Ward Triangle Historic District. Noted as the city's "finest surviving pre-Civil War home" and named for the carved lions crouched upon its portico, the Lion House represents the aspirations of Milwaukee's immigrant settlers and the community's heritage of civic participation.<P>

Built in 1855 as the vision of German immigrant Edward Diederichs, the Lion House has been the home of many prominent citizens, including entrepreneur Henry Mann in the 1860's banker and civic leader John Johnston in the 1890's, and, in the 1940's, president of Marine National Exchange Bank, Eliot Fitch, who was also an active leader in many local civic institutions. Architecturally restored and converted to commercial office space by James A. and James D. Hummert in the 1980's, the building was chosen last year by the Foundation's Board of Directors as a headquarters that will mark the continuing and active presence of the legacy of Lynde and Harry Bradley in the Milwaukee community.<P>

Combining the institution's office needs with a project of historical restoration is particularly apt at the time of Milwaukee's 150th anniversary, said Foundation President Michael S. Joyce, noting that "our Board is very intentionally sending the message that the Bradley Foundation is at once rooted in Milwaukee's heritage and looking to its future." The move, Joyce added, "ensures the preservation and stewardship of one of our city's most charming landmarks and provides efficient office space in a convenient location for the Foundation's philanthropic operations."<p>

The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, established in 1985, is a private, independent grantmaking organization directed to supporting research and education. Due to its modest size and near-downtown location, the Lion House will be a suitable headquarters for the Milwaukee-based institution's small staff. Extensive renovations consistent with the building's architectural integrity were planned by Uihlein Architects and executed by D.G. Beyer, Inc. to coordinate operational and historic objective.

<P>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a federally 
funded agency designed to support legal services 
organizations that serve the poor, has been the focus of 
controversy almost without interruption since its creation in 1974. 
 Conservative critics charge that LSC funds are 
improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, 
represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class 
action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials.  
Liberal supporters counter that LSC-funded organizations 
spend most of their resources representing the poor and 
disadvantaged in routine legal cases such as landlord-tenant 
disputes.
<P>Until recently, however, few have questioned 
whether federal dollars are needed at all to provide legal 
assistance to the poor.  Whatever may have once been the case, 
are adequate private and non-federal resources available 
today to meet the legal needs of the poor?
<P><I><B>Unknown to many, legal services providers 
receiving LSC funds also take in at least $324 million from 
private and other public sourcesan amount in excess of 
the LSC's current federal appropriation of $283 million. 
 Moreover, there are an additional 1,350 providers 
of legal services to the needy who receive no 
government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. 
 Finally, some 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers perform 
an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work 
annually valued at $3.3 billion.</B></I>
<P>
<a name="1">
<B>The House of Representative's Aborted Plan</B>

<P>In 1995, the House of Representatives developed a 
three-step budget resolution to phase out the LSC's funding 
by October 1997.  Both the House and Senate took the 
first step last year by reducing LSC funding from $400 
million to $283 million.  The second step called for a 
further reduction of funding to $141 million for fiscal year 
1997, followed by an end to all federal support.
<P>The House Appropriations Committee voted earlier 
this year to take the second step.  But when the 
appropriations bill reached the House floor on July 23rd, 56 
Republicans voted with all but three Democrats to fund the LSC at 
$250 million.  Lobbyists for increased funding, led by the 
Americ Bar Association, had predicted a close vote and 
were elated by the comfortable margin of victory.  Their 
success was complete when the final fiscal budget figure came in 
at $283 million -- the same amount the LSC received in 
fiscal year 1996.  The House three-step plan, in other 
words, appears to have been aborted after achieving only 
one-third of its planned savings in federal expenditures.
<P>House reformers planned to phase out LSC funding 
in order to give LSC-supported legal services 
organizations sufficient time to acquire replacement funds.  Many of 
these organizations originally received all their funding from 
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a War on 
Poverty agency created in the mid-1960s.  However, other 
LSC-funded legal services providers that predate the OEO 
have had substantial non-federal funding for years.
<P>Today, almost all LSC-funded organizations 
receive funding from non-federal sources.  In fact, in the 
just-ended 1996 fiscal yearthe first year of the reduction in 
the LSC's budgetnon-LSC funding of these 428 
providers surpassed LSC funding.  That the LSC is now providing 
less than half the total funding of all its granteesand only 
a third of the funding of all providerswas never 
discussed in the lengthy debate preceding the recent House vote.  
Nor was there any mention that some 1,350 legal service 
providers receive no money from the LSC yet have 
budgets totalling over two hundred million dollars.  Although 
the House debate did address the question of whether pro 
bono lawyers who volunteer their services for the needy 
could &quot;fill the gap&quot; created by further cuts in the LSC's budget, 
no mention was made of how much non-LSC money the 
nation's legal services providers have at their disposal.
<P>

<a name="2">
<B>States Move to Fill the Gap</B>
<P>Less than a month before the House vote, the state of 
New Jersey, using court filing fee revenue, increased funding 
to its network of 15 legal services providers by an 
estimated $8.2 million.  The state legislature acted on the belief 
that LSC funding, already reduced, would probably be 
cut again, and might ultimately disappear.  New Jersey's 
legal services providers now have a total budget of $25.5 
million28 percent more than last yeardespite a $2.2 
million reduction in LSC monies.
<P>New Jersey is not the only state that has recently 
increased its budget for legal services.  Pennsylvania, only 
six days before the House vote, cleared the way for an 
estimated $6-million annual infusion of new money for its 
19 LSC-funded and 22 non-LSC-funded providers.  
The legislature's decision was based on the same 
argument made in the New Jersey legislaturethat LSC 
funding would likely be cut this year and eliminated next year.  
In fact, as <a href="#Table I">Table I</a> shows, at least six states have found 
their legal service resources greater this year due to new 
money from private and other public sources.
<P>The chief source of this money is state funding in 
the form of first-time or increased filing fee revenue and 
general operations revenue.  States that began funding 
civil legal services for the first time in 1995 include 
Kentucky, Missouri, and Rhode Island.  Still other states, 
including California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Tennessee, raised their level 
of support.  All told, an unprecedented surge of over 
$35 million in new state money was added to legal 
services budgets in the last year and a half in 17 states, 
including those in <a href="#Table I">Table I</a>.
<P>

<a name="3">
<B>A Conspiracy of Silence</B>
<P>Many LSC recipients and supporters know that the 
amount of non-LSC funding available to legal services providers 
is far more than anyone has ever communicated to 
Congress, but they have kept this fact well guarded.  For instance, 
all but one of New Jersey's thirteen members in the House 
of Representatives, including eight Republicans, recently 
voted to increase LSC funding.  None of them informed 
their colleagues during the July 23rd floor debate that 
New Jersey recently provided $8.2 million in new state 
money for legal services.  Likewise, Republican 
Representative Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, co-sponsor of the measure 
to increase LSC funding, was silent about 
Pennsylvania's allocation of an additional $6 million for legal services.
<P>This pattern of seeking federal funds for legal 
services with prior knowledge that one's own state is already 
providing state funds seems to be common.  Retiring 
LSC president Alexander Forger acknowledged the practice 
in an unguarded statement before the LSC Board in 1994. 
 While Forger was president of the New York State 
Bar, New York adopted IOLA. (Most other states use the term &quot;IOLTA,&quot; 
or Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts.)  
Under this program, most states require lawyers to turn 
over interest generated by their clients' trust funds to a fund 
used mostly to finance legal services programs.  Forger 
advised his colleagues, &quot;I would put in a footnote, for 
budgetary purposes in congressional presentations, that New 
York State... last year, in recognition of the decrease in 
IOLA funds at the state level and at the city level, 
appropriated unrestricted funds for legal services to poor people. . . .  
I trust Congress won't inquire as to whether local 
jurisdictions are undertaking some of that responsibility.&quot;  
The state funding referred to was $3 million, and it 
continued for at least three years.<B><I>1</I></B>
<P>Forger, no doubt, would excuse his failure to 
volunteer this information by arguing that this amount, even 
when supplemented by LSC funding, was inadequate to serve 
the legal needs of the poor.  But the flaw in this reasoning 
was identified by the executive director of Chicago 
Volunteer Legal Services, a non-LSC-funded legal services 
provider that relies on hundreds of pro bono lawyers.  In a 
public debate last year over whether filing fees should be 
increased to generate more revenue for legal services in 
Cook County (Chicago), M. Lee Witte remarked, &quot;what 
legal service providers want . . . is 
infinite.&quot;<B><I>2</I></B>
<P>

<a name="4">
<B>The LSC's Questionable Data</B>
<P>There is a wide disparity between the actual amount 
of funding for legal services for the needy and the figure 
the LSC has presented to Congress for the last ten years.  
This discrepancy exists because the LSC only disseminates 
information about providers who receive direct grants 
from the LSC.
<P>There are good reasons to question the LSC's figures. 
 First, the LSC compiles the amounts of non-LSC 
funding from paperwork submitted by providers when they 
apply for LSC grants.  These amounts are not audited.  
Furthermore, the amounts sometimes differ significantly 
from figures in other published sources.
<P>For instance, in 1995 the Legal Aid Society (LAS) of 
San Diego, an LSC-funded provider, reported to IOLTA 
administrators of the California State Bar that its non-LSC 
funding in 1994 was approximately $1.6 million.  LSC 
records, however, showed its 1994 non-LSC funding to be less 
than $1.1 million.  This half million dollar difference could 
be due to the LSC's failure to include the provider's 
so-called &quot;derivative income,&quot; such as attorney fee awards, 
publication and investment income, and unexpended or 
carry-over funds.  Until the early 1990s, such derivative income 
was always included in LSC figures presented to Congress. 
 This generally amounted to 15.2 percent of providers' 
non-LSC funding and 4.9 percent of their LSC grants.  For 
some individual providers, the amount was much higher.  But 
the $500,000 difference could also be due to the 
provider giving one figure to the LSC and another to the 
California State Bar.
<P>In any case, the LSC should inform Congress how 
much derivative income all LSC-funded providers have reported. 
 Providers are still required to submit this information to 
the LSC.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Subgrantees' Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>The LSC has also failed to provide Congress with 
adequate information on the many LSC subgrantees.  
These are providers who receive money indirectly from the 
LSC in the form of subgrants made by LSC-funded providers.
<P>No one knows the exact number of subgrantees.  In 
1995, the LSC compiled a list of subgrantees that was intended 
to be official.  It listed 98 subgrantees, some of whom 
received more than one LSC subgrant.  Since the list was 
released, however, research has identified another 12 to 14 
providers that claim to have received LSC funding in 1995, in 
some cases as subgrantees.  For instance, the LSC's list 
includes only ten California subgrantees.  However, 
Congressman Julian Dixon of California referred to 14 
California subgrantees as of 1995 during the recent House 
debate.<B><I>3</I></B>
<P>While the LSC has provided Congress with 
information on the non-LSC funding of its direct grantees, it has 
not offered amounts of non-LSC funding for its 
subgrantees, which in 1995 numbered at least 112.  <a href="#Table II">Table II</a> shows 
the total budgets of eight subgrantees in 1995.  (These eight 
had the largest budgets of 18 subgrantees for which total 
budget funding information was available.)  Total 1995 non-LSC 
funding for these eight subgrantees was nearly $29 million.  
Another $8 million in non-LSC funding derives from 
the combined budgets of the remaining 10 subgrantees 
and from a portion of the combined budgets of another 
27 subgrantees.  Together, these 45 subgrantees obtained 
$37 million in non-LSC funding.  This amount was not 
included in the LSC's non-LSC funding figure of $249 million 
for 1995.<B><I>4</I></B>
<P>Yet this $37 million figure is far from complete 
because it does not account for the non-LSC funding of at least 
67 remaining subgrantees for which adequate information 
is unavailable.<B><I>5</I></B>  Available data suggests that the 112 or 
more subgrantees of LSC monies spent over $75 million in 
non-LSC funds on legal services to the poor in 1995.  Added 
to the LSC's figure for 1995 of $249 million, total 
non-LSC funding for the 428 or more providers receiving 
LSC grants, directly or indirectly, probably exceeded $324 
million.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Total Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>This amount does not include the more than 1,350 
legal services providers, such as Chicago Volunteer Legal 
Services, that have operated year after year without any LSC funding.  
One must take into account over 950 largely 
pro bono &quot;private bar involvement&quot; (PBI) programs which 
the ABA lists in its annual PBI directory and over 1,110 
legal services providers that received IOLTA grants during 
the last year.  After adding the 428 direct and indirect 
recipients of LSC money in 1995 and eliminating duplicates 
from these three lists, over 1,625 providers remain.  To this 
can be added a number of providers who do not appear on 
any of these lists, such as the approximately 45 chapters 
and affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union.  All 
told, there are easily 1,800 providers of civil legal services in 
all 50 states.
<P>Although the combined funding of these providers 
has never been the subject of a comprehensive study, 
enough data exists to make a fairly reliable estimate of total 
non-LSC funding.  <a href="#Table III">Table III</a> shows the non-LSC funding of 
of all states that compiled and reported on their non-LSC funding
over a 12-month period during the last three years.  
These 13 states had combined non-LSC funding of $175 million.
<P>Extrapolating to the 50 states, total nationwide 
non-LSC funding for legal services is $463 
million.<B><I>6</I></B>  To this can be added the resources of the ACLU's network of chapters 
and affiliates -- $35 million.  This total of $498 million is 
more than double the $210 million in non-LSC funding that 
the LSC estimates its direct grantees received in 1996.
<P>Yet even this figure of $498 million is incomplete.  
It does not count, for instance, the hundreds of millions 
in public funds that each year support consumer 
protection and constituent service functions at the federal, state, 
and local levels of government.  Much of this addresses the 
civil legal problems of the poor in the same way as do pro 
bono and salaried legal services lawyers.  Nor does this 
amount include the hundreds of millions that government and 
private sources distribute each year to social services 
agencies that deal with non-legal problems often brought to 
legal services lawyers.  Considerable data show that most of 
the &quot;cases&quot; handled by LSC-funded lawyers are actually 
problems that can be addressed by non-lawyers.  To cite 
only one instance, the Legal Referral Service of the San 
Francisco Bar Association refers 75 percent of its 85,000 
yearly calls to government agencies or social 
services.<B><I>7</I></B>
<P>

<a name="6">
<B>The Future of Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<P>The impact of reduced LSC funding in 1996 
together with the potential loss of IOLTA funds resulting from 
a recent federal appeals court decision will be the 
overriding concern voiced by LSC supporters in the near future. 
 Whether further cuts are made in the LSC's budget 
will largely depend on whether Congress is convinced 
that private and other public resources can &quot;fill the gap.&quot;
<P>If LSC funding is reduced by another substantial 
amount, at least some LSC grantees may have to cease 
operations given the competitive and rapidly growing legal 
services industry.  Clearly, however, there are considerable 
private and other public resources for meeting the legal needs of 
the poor.  Alan Houseman, a key draftsman of the 1974 
LSC Act, has observed that &quot;There's an unfortunate notion 
in Legal Services that only experts like themselves can 
litigate these kinds of [class action] cases.  But there's a 
broad range of public interest programs around the country 
that don't take Federal money that can do them.  And we 
haven't really even begun to tap the private 
bar.&quot;<B><I>8</I></B>  Houseman would no doubt stress that his comments apply only 
to class actions, but they apply equally if not more so to the 
routine types of cases that Congress has said should be the 
only focus of LSC-funded providers.  Another longtime 
legal services lawyer, Mike Daniel, has remarked, &quot;I don't 
know how you can justify taking federal money to provide 
routine legal services.  There are other lawyers who will do 
those routine [cases].&quot;<B><I>9</I></B>  Indeed, not only are there other 
lawyers; there are considerable non-lawyer resources that can 
assist the needy just as effectivelyand for less 
money.<B><I>10</I></B>
<P>If the LSC were abolished, there would still be at 
least half a billion dollars available each year for legal 
services for the needy.  This does not count the far greater value 
of pro bono work on behalf of the poor.  Nor does it count 
the support of government and private consumer and 
social-service agencies whose work directly affects the poor.
<P>Is $283 million in federal legal services funding 
still necessary?  If Congress is serious about balancing 
the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, 
it might wish to revisit the LSC budget next spring.

<B>Pro Bono Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<BR>
Lawyers have a long and distinguished history of providing free or 
<I>pro bono</I> (from the Latin &quot;Pro bono publico,&quot; meaning &quot;for public good&quot;) legal services 
to the poora history that predates the nation's founding. 
 Accounts of the young lawyer Abe Lincoln 
representing poor clients for little or no compensation have 
always been part of the lore of the young Republic.  The 
history of formal pro bono legal service organizations is 
almost as long and equally distinguished.
<P>Organized delivery of free legal services began 
in 1876 with the founding in New York City of what 
became the Legal Aid Society (LAS).  Created to help 
poor German immigrants, by 1901 it was serving 16,000 
clients of all nationalities.  (Today, the LAS civil office 
has a $20-million budget, all of which comes from 
sources other than the LSC.)  Another venerable provider of legal services, the Chicago Bureau of 
Justice, was created in 1888 and was the first organization 
to provide civil legal help to the poor regardless of 
nationality or race.  By 1923, at least 33 legal aid societies 
in over 40 cities were providing basic legal services.
<P>According to the LSC, the number of private 
attorneys in the United States today who perform pro bono 
civil legal work for the poor is roughly 130,000.  This, 
however, was the figure cited by an ABA spokesman 
seven years ago when there were less than 500 organized 
pro bono programs.  Whatever the figure's accuracy then, 
it is totally unreliable today since the number of pro 
bono programs has increased to 950.  Moreover, ABA 
official Laurie Zelon recently conceded that the 130,000 
figure does not count the many lawyers who perform 
valuable pro bono service outside of organized 
legal-services programs.
<P>By conservative estimates, at least 400,000 and 
possibly as many as 600,000or between 44 and 67 
percent of all private attorneysdo pro bono work.  
These numbers are derived from surveys conducted in 
states with lawyer populations totalling half the lawyers in 
the U.S.
<P>Assuming that the remaining number of lawyers 
per forms an equal amount of pro bono work, the total number of lawyers rendering pro bono service in 
1991 was approximately 473,000.  Since the total lawyer 
population grew from 805,872 in 1991 to 896,172 in 1995, 
the number of lawyers currently providing at least some 
pro bono work is probably close to 525,000.  Thus, the 
range of 400,000 to 600,000 is realistic.  Whatever the 
exact number, it is far greater than the 130,000 
commonly cited.
<P>Information on the amount and value of pro bono 
work lawyers perform is available for six 
statesCalifornia, Florida, Maryland, New York, Oregon, and Texas.  
Together, these states contain 40 percent of all lawyers. 
 Assuming that these states and the value placed on their 
lawyers' time by their state bar leaders are representative 
of the total lawyer population, an estimated $3.3-billion worth of pro bono work is 
performed annually in the U.S.  That is over 8 times the LSC's 
1995 budget.
<P>Critics may dismiss this figure by arguing that 
most LSC-funded lawyers are full-time and compensated on 
a salary basis; their much lower hourly rate cannot 
be compared to this estimated value of pro bono hours.  
A more accurate analysis, they say, would compare 
the number of hours LSC-funded lawyers work to the 
number of pro bono hours.
<P>If we extrapolate the number of pro bono hours 
contributed in the six states surveyed (9,659,709) to 
all lawyers, this suggests that lawyers contribute 
over 24,000,000 pro bono hours per year.  In other words, 
pro bono attorneys contribute over five times the number 
of hours worked annually by the 4,749 staff attorneys of 
the approximately 281 providers in the LSC's network.

<B>November 1996</B>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="#1">
<P>
<BR>
<DD>This election year there has been much loose talk about the 
so-called religious right.  Mainstream media stories on the rise of the Christian 
Coalition speculate on its likely impact on 
national politics and generously quote those who warn that its activities will produce dire 
repercussions for the country in general and the Republican party in particular.  In all 
the clatter there is rarely any mention of the religious left.
But left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American 
politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. 
 For years the Rev. Jesse Jackson has asserted that political engagement from the pulpit is 
an essential part of the church's moral responsibility.  In 1988 Jackson's presidential 
campaign was financed in part with cash donations openly collected in black churches.  
In 1994 a group of black ministers led by Bishop L.E. Willis, Sr. endorsed Virginia 
Democratic Senator Charles Robb in his reelection 
contest against Oliver North.  Willis's group, the Third Jurisdiction of the Church of God 
in Christ, represented about 60 churches in Virginia.  Yet liberals routinely cite the 
North-Robb race as evidence of a one-sided Christian partisanship.
<P>No one seems to mind when liberal religious groups engage in political activities. 
 Left-wing church activists lobby in support of socialized medicine and racial 
preference programs, and against welfare reform.  
They organize boycotts against business and agitate for mandates and regulations in the 
name of &quot;corporate responsibility.&quot;  Liberation 
theologians make foreign policy pronouncements and lead crusades for nuclear disarmament. 
 Liberal church leaders denounce Republican policies as cruel and un-Christian.
<P>This kind of religious protest is not isolated and sporadic; it is organized.  
Religious groups on the left engage in the same 
activism  albeit on a smaller scale  as the Christian Coalition.  The Interfaith 
Alliance (TIA) is one such group that has lately 
been in the news.  Its organizers say it was 
created as an alternative to the &quot;divisiveness 
and intolerance of the extreme religious right.&quot;   
<P>The agenda of the Interfaith Alliance is far removed from that of conservative 
Christian groups  you won't hear much from them about the right to life   yet its methods 
are quite similar.  In July, it announced a 
&quot;Road to Renewal&quot; that will bring &quot;TIA's 
national religion leaders to local TIA chapters and 
the national party conventions to help empower mainstream people of faith.  TIA's 109 
chapters will distribute millions of voter guides. 
. . .&quot;  Distributing voter guides is exactly 
what the Christian Coalition does.  And it is 
exactly what has the Coalition's liberal critics 
so excited.  
<P>
Earlier this year, the Oregon Interfaith Alliance distributed its &quot;mainstream&quot; 
voter guides to Oregonians prior to that state's special U.S. Senate election.  Like the 
Christian Coalition's guides, they were supposed to provide Oregon voters with the 
candidates' &quot;positions on important issues.&quot;  
Distributed by the Alliance's network of grassroots activists, the guides covered 
such issues as the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, the environment and housing 
discrimination.  What party's candidate do you suspect ranked better on the Interfaith 
Alliance scale?   
<P>Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden narrowly edged out his GOP opponent to win the 
U.S. Senate seat.  Did the Interfaith Alliance's guides play a role in Wyden's victory?  
Probably.  But does that make them illegal?   
Where is the outcry from those who groan about religious influence?  
<P>
<a name="#2"></a>
<B>Just What is the Interfaith Alliance?</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance, a Washington-based 501(c)(4) organization, bills itself 
as mainstream and moderate.  Yet careful scrutiny reveals that it is anything but moderate. 
 Indeed, the Alliance clearly has a partisan purpose: to elect liberal Democrats.  
<P>It is not surprising to discover that this supposedly nonpartisan group was 
started with Democratic party money.  In 1994, the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee (DCCC) provided $25,000 in seed money to the Alliance.  The DCCC is 
the sister organization of the Democratic National Committee.  It recruits, and 
raises money for, Democratic congressional candidates.  Its current chairman is Rep. 
Martin Frost (D-TX).
<P>The DCCC's support for the Interfaith Alliance may reflect the growing 
awareness on the part of many Democrats that 
modern liberalism's hostility toward religion and 
traditional morality has alienated many voters and driven them into the hands of the 
Republican party.  Fearing a religion gap, they 
fund a group, nominally oriented toward religion, that promotes a secular agenda of big 
government while attacking religious conservatives who have decided to get involved 
in public policy.  
<P>The Alliance has found a friend in organized labor, which has committed 
itself--to the tune of $35 million--to defeating Republican congressional incumbents.  
Toward that end, the AFL-CIO has sought to take advantage of the Alliance's voter guides. 
 On August 29, the <I>Washington Post</I> reported that AFL-CIO field organizers  deployed 
to &quot;targeted Republican districts&quot;  have 
a &quot;special mission&quot;:  to &quot;persuade preachers 
in North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Washington, Oregon and Colorado to dump the 
voter guides issued by the Christian Coalition and instead give parishioners literature 
prepared by the Interfaith Alliance.&quot;
<P>Such activities are part of a resurgent alliance between labor and left-leaning 
church groups that has emerged in the wake of leadership changes at the AFL-CIO.  In 
the past, relations between big labor and liberal religious activists were strained.  Former 
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, a staunch anti-communist, had little patience for the 
religious left because of its uncritical sympathy for Third World revolutionary movements. 
 The deposed Kirkland's successor, John Sweeney, has much closer ties to 
radical elements in the liberal coalition, and he 
has worked to rebuild ties between labor union leaders and religious &quot;progressives.&quot;
<P>The Alliance claims that its voter guides are &quot;fair and honest&quot; and not slanted 
toward one particular party.  But the Alliance 
frames issues so as to make the final positions 
taken by the Democratic party leadership appear more favorable.  For instance, who 
could oppose &quot;Supporting families by 
advocating for a fair living wage,&quot; or &quot;child care 
that protects and nurtures every boy and girl,&quot; 
or "child care that protects and nurtures every boy and girl," or skill
training needed for good paying jobs." As Alan Wisdom, vice president of the Institute on Religion &amp; Democracy, noted 
recently, the Alliance is obviously trying to create the impression that the 
Democratic party &quot;is the party of righteousness 
and reason.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="#2"></a>
<B>Jill Hanauer: Abortion Activist and Party Regular</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance's partisan pedigree runs deep and it is most apparent in 
the group's leadership.  
<P>Alliance organizers have assembled a collection of clerics to serve as a board of 
directors.  Mostly representatives of mainline denominations, the list includes 
several prominent religious church figures such as Bishop Edmond L. Browning, primate of 
the Episcopal Church in the United States; Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of 
the National Council of Churches; Denise Davidoff, moderator of the Unitarian 
Universalist Association; and J. Philip Wogaman, senior minister of Foundry United 
Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., the church 
regularly attended by President and Mrs. Clinton.  (See box for complete list).
<P>Their names appear prominently in press releases and statements.  However, this 
seems more style than substance--window dressing to lend the group an air of reverence 
that it would not otherwise receive.  Boards of directors are rarely involved in the day to 
day operations of nonprofit lobby groups.  They may appear at conferences or serve as 
occasional spokesman, but generally they exist to authorize the activities of the full-time staff.
<P>In this case, the staff member who calls the shots is the Alliance's executive director, 
Jill Hanauer.  Her past disproves the Alliance's claims to moderation and calls into 
question its affirmations of faith.
<P>Hanauer's background is politics, not religion.  A long-time Democratic party 
operative, she was a staffer for former Senator 
Gary Hart and later worked on Rep. Patricia Schroeder's 1988 presidential campaign. 
 According to <I>National Journal</I>, she raised more than $3 million for the Democratic 
National Committee before joining the National Abortion Rights Action League 
(NARAL) as its political action director in 1990.  In 
1992, she joined Iowa Senator Tom Harkin's presidential campaign.  All in all, these are 
hardly the sort of activities of someone in the 
mainstream.
<P>
<a name="#3"></a>
<B>Hostility Toward Religion</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance presents itself as a faith-based organization, but Hanauer's 
past contains incidents of antagonism toward religion.
<P>
As a college student at the University of Colorado, she organized efforts to 
prevent the school's football coach from leading 
his team in a moment of silence before games  and she eventually got the American 
Civil Liberties Union to file suit against the school. 
<P>
The football coach, Bill McCartney, who describes himself as a &quot;born-again 
Catholic,&quot; was proscribed from asking his 
players to bow their heads in silent prayer before taking the field.  He was prevented 
from asking them to say grace before team meals.  He could not share his faith while 
speaking in his capacity as football coach to 
local community groups.  All this was the result 
of an agreement negotiated between the University and the ACLU. 
<P>
McCartney's more egregious offenses included Biblical references during practice 
 recounting the story of David and Goliath, for instance.  The 
<I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported that on one occasion when a player was seriously injured and lying in a 
coma, &quot;the team assembled after practice, 
dropped to one knee and joined hands for a moment of silence.&quot;  
<P>
Hanauer's efforts to keep prayer out of football were but one aspect of her 
campus activism.  During her time at the University 
of Colorado, she also garnered publicity for organizing anti-CIA protests. (This 
resulted in the arrest of 477 people.)  And she 
worked to make sure that abortion coverage 
remained a part of the student health insurance plan.
<P>
Hanauer's apparent antipathy toward religion  and for coach McCartney  did 
not fade after she graduated.  She has criticized Promise Keepers, the national Christian 
men's group that challenges men to be more involved with their wives, children, 
and churches.  Founded in 1990 by McCartney, the group extols personal responsibility 
and family commitment at gatherings across the country which regularly attract tens of 
thousands of participants.  But this is too much 
for Hanauer.  Quoted in the <I>Minneapolis Star 
Tribune</I> in July 1995, she accused McCartney of having &quot;a very extreme political agenda.&quot; 
<P>One telling characteristic about the Alliance is its conspicuous use of the 
word &quot;extreme.&quot;  For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> &quot;these extremists organizations preach . . . a destructive message of division, 
discord, and even outright hatred.&quot; 
<LI> &quot;Pat Robertson has long advocated many extremist . . . ideas.&quot;  
<LI> &quot;Help us prevent Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, as well as other extremists 
with religious claims for an exclusive political agenda, from writing their extremist 
views into the law of the land.&quot;
</UL>
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is ever-ready to cast stones and demonize its political 
oppo--odd behavior for a group that claims to &quot;promote the positive role of religion 
in public life.&quot; and asks candidates to take a &quot;Pledge of Civility.&quot;  It defines 
as  &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; those who 
would normally be associated with the cutting edge of liberalism, and everyone 
to the right of that (most people) must be an extremist.
<P>
<a name="#5"></a>
<B>Who are the Real Extremists?</B>
<P>
<DD>In trying to tar conservative Christians as religous extremists, the Alliance makes 
common cause with groups like Americans United for Separation of Church and State. 
<P>Americans United and the Interfaith Alliance Foundation jointly prepared a 
report that &quot;highlights the Christian Coalition's extreme agenda and its efforts to gain control of the Republican Party.&quot;
<P>The report maintains that the Christian Coalition has forced Republican politicians to embrace various &quot;extreme&quot; positions 
such as calling for the repeal of quotas, the adoption of English as the official language, 
and the elimination of the Department of Education and the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
<P>The head of Americans United is Barry Lynn, a Protestant minister and former 
legislative counsel for the ACLU.  Lynn is arguably the leading proponent in the country 
of the idea that the sale of pornography should be a protected First Amendment right.  
William A. Donohue documents this in his book <I>Twilight of Liberty: The Legacy of the 
ACLU</I>.  When President Reagan announced in 1984 that a commission would be formed to 
study pornography, Lynn &quot;took issue with the President's characterization of 
pornography as a `problem.'&quot;  According to Lynn, 
&quot;Although we are far from a sexually 
enlightened society today, our greater openness 
about sex should be viewed as a reasonable explanation for much of the growth in 
sexually-explicit materials.&quot; 
<P>Americans United is not an organization known for moderation.  Originally called 
Protestants United for the Separation of Church and State, it is committed to driving 
religion from public life.
<P>For instance, Americans United, together with the ACLU and the Milwaukee 
Teachers' Association, the local NEA affiliate, 
brought suit challenging Wisconsin's school choice plan, which would enable poor families 
to send their kids to private schools.  Americans United argues that the plan and other 
voucher plans violate the establishment clause of 
the first amendment.  The group also opposes a school-prayer amendment to the 
Constitution, opposes legislation to allow 
religious institutions to administer social service 
programs, and opposes parental rights legislation.
<P>Lynn has labelled as &quot;a religious tyranny amendment&quot; a proposed Religious 
Equality Amendment to the Constitution.  The amendment, which was submitted by Rep. 
Henry Hyde, states that neither the federal government nor any state government shall 
deny benefits to or discriminate against any per<BR>
son on account of religious expression.
<P>In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to dissuade 
churches from distributing Christian Coalition 
voter guides.  It warned churches that by doing so they, in Lynn's words, &quot;run the risk of 
having their tax-exempt status challenged and possibly revoked.&quot;  Lynn argues that 
Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition seek to &quot;create what amounts to a theocracy 
in America.&quot;  Americans United also has a project to encourage people to report to 
the I.R.S. churches that they believe are improperly engaging in politics.
<P>Lynn was quick to criticize Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia for an 
address he made at a Mississippi prayer breakfast this spring.  Scalia descried the 
scorn suffered by people of faith and criticized elites who denigrate religious belief.  As if 
to prove the point, Scalia was immediately pilloried by those who are uncomfortable at 
the mention of morality.  Lynn was quoted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> as commenting 
that Scalia's speech &quot;undermines public confidence in his objectivity&quot; on 
church-state issues.
<P>Lynn is also troubled by congressional chaplains who since the first Congress 
in 1789 have opened each day with prayer.  He believes the salaries Congress pays 
chaplains are a &quot;direct subsidy of religion which has no place in a Congress which ought 
to care about . . . the Constitution.&quot;
<P>It's ironic that the Interfaith Alliance, a self-proclaimed mainsteam faith-based 
group, is allied with an advocacy group dedicated 
to eradicating the public expression of religion.
<P>
<a name="#6"></a>
<B>Don't Tell Us What Your Against; Tell Us What You're For</B>
<P>
<DD>The irony disappears when you realize that the Interfaith Alliance has little to do 
with religion.  Rarely is there any mention of God in its literature.  It espouses no tenets 
of theology.  Even its professed values are generic and watery platitudes  &quot;The 
Interfaith Alliance believes in the dignity of the individual and the importance of 
community.&quot;
<P>Moreover, the Interfaith Alliance has no agenda of its own.  Although it clearly 
supports a raft of Democratic policy positions on health care, the environment, the 
minimum wage and so on, its raison d' etre is 
bashing the Christian Coalition.  Perusing press 
clippings one finds that the Alliance is rarely quoted in support of a policy or proposal. 
 Instead, it is almost always mentioned in context: denouncing the Christian Coalition.
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is a parasitical organization.  Without the activism of 
religious conservatives, the liberal left would have 
no use for it.

<center><h2>Why Did America's First Woman Televsion sportscaster become a
conservative radio talk-show hostess?</h2><BR>
</center>
<center><h3>by Laurence Jarvik</h3></center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2><I>J</I></FONT>ane Chastain lives about as far as it is possible to be from
Washington, DC's notorious Beltway. Her home sits atop a mountain
outside Palm Springs, California. She commutes to her apperances
on CNN and Crawford broadcasting's radio shows in her Cessna 336
from the landing strip in front of her home (both she and her
husband, Roger Chastain, are licensed pilots with multiand instrument
ratings). Chastain is a frequent guest on &quot;CNN and Company&quot;
and author of <I>I'd Speak Out On The Issues If I Only Knew What
To Say</I> (Regal Books, 1987). She contributed a chapter to <I>Good
Will Toward Men</I> (St. Martin's Press, 1994), a book in praise of
the masculine sex and has her own newsletter called <I>On The Issues</I>.
Her Crawford Broadcasting radio talk show, &quot;What Washington
Doesn't Want You To Know,&quot; is syndicated to l8 stations from
Southern California's KBRT. Chastain was one of the first &quot;Renaissance&quot;
women to join the prestigious Washington leadership group founded
by Ambassador Holland Coors and Nina May in 1983, which has grown
to 6,000 members.
<P>
Chastain began her career as &quot;Coach Friday&quot; on Atlanta's WAGA in 1963,
 eventually moving to Miami's WTVJ, where for 9 years she worked as a sports reporter. 
She syndicated a radio series called <I>Football for Women</I>--ironically designed to
explain the sport to her husband, a race car driver and designer
who didn't understand the principles of the game--followed by
another series of 260 shows called Girls Rules, syndicated to
205 radio stations. This led to a television deal: 195 90--second
spots syndicated to 88 television stations called <I>The Jane Chastain
Show: Evertyhing You've Always Wanted To Know About Sports But
Were Afraid To Ask.</I> Still in her twenties, Jane Chastain was a
television star. In 1974 CBS hired her as the first woman network
sportscaster in the country. She covered NBA basketball, the Pan
American Games, pro golf, tennis, cycling, and surfing. She was
a pit reporter for auto racing coverage. Most importantly, Chastain
covered NFL football, including the Sun Bowl and the Cotton Bowl,
and developed stong ties to the Miami Dolphins and their winning
coach, Don Shula.
<P>
<BR>
When Chastain first came to Dolphin coach George Wilson,  however, he objected 
to the idea of a woman sportscaster. &quot;Well, she won't come to my
camp, &quot; Wilson vowed. Chastain patiently persevered, attended
training camp, and by the end of the season Wilson had responded
to her determination. He came up to her and announced, &quot;I'll
give you that interview.&quot; After the session, she recalled,
&quot;the players ran over, picked me up, and threw me in the
Dumpster. And it was like saying, 'Okay, you've made it; you've
been accepted; you're one of us. Congratulations.'&quot; Unlike
some feminists who might have filed a harrassment complaint these
days, Chastain took her experience as a compliment. She later
told an interviewer, &quot;Well, I think it was a friendly gesture.
I hadn't tried to make an issue of what Wilson was doing. I never
went up to those players and bellyached and complained about their
boss; I never put them in a compromising position of having to
talk to me about what an awful person Coach Wilson was. I think
the fact that I didn't make an issue out if it is actually what
caused him to address it. If you have a disagreement with somebody
and you try to back them up against the wall, then they get caught
up in defending themselves rather than examining their own position
to see if it's tenable.&quot;  Chastain has overcome personal
obstacles as well. When an Atlanta station executive started giving
her a hard time, after confessing he was in love with her and
finding himself rejected, Chastain went looking for another job.
She got an interview at a Raleigh, North Carolina television station
and was hired by Jesse Helms -- over vocal objections from the
station's executive vice-president, who didn't believe women should
cover sports.  &quot;It makes the hair on the back of my neck
stand up when I hear accusations that Jesse's against women,&quot;
Chastain says. &quot;I expected my career was over, and he gave
me a chance. He did more for hiring women and people of color
than anyone I knew in broadcasting.&quot; 
<P>
<BR>
Locker rooms held no charm for Chastain at first, and she tried to avoid entering the male  
domain while working at local stations. &quot;I didn't think
they should have to give interviews in various stages of undress,&quot;
she says. But when she became the first woman sportscaster for
CBS in 1974, Chastain was required to go inside to conduct interviews
in order to meet -- and beat -- her competitors.  The invasion
of privacy still rankles her. &quot;You will not find any men
demanding access to the female's dressing rooms. They have not
allowed male reporters in there. Yet, on the other side, in the
male locker room, everyone is afraid to say no.&quot; Chastain
dealt with the challenge as discreetly as possible, setting up
her cameras facing a wall by the door so that she would not be
exposed to the athletes against their will, and arranging to leave
the locker room as soon as the interviews had been completed.
&quot;Now, that didn't mean I was a prude,&quot; she recalled.
&quot;I'd been married for a number of years and didn't expect
to see anything that I hadn't seen before. I just respected their
privacy.&quot; But her personal experience with the double standard
helped plant a seed of doubt about the claims of the feminist
movement.  Eventually, America's first female sportscaster would
become a devoted opponent of the goals and tactics of the women's
liberation movement.
<P>
<BR>
Motherhood made all the difference for Jane 
   Chastain. She realized her viewpoint was 
       no longer that of a careerist in 1975 while covering the
Pan American Games for CBS. &quot;When I called home every night
and heard my baby cry, that's when my own priorities changed,&quot;
she recalled.&quot; And it didn't take long for me to discover
that the quality of time I was able to give my family was actually
in an inverse ratio to the quantity of time I spent on my job.&quot;
In 1976 she became sports anchor at KABC in Los Angeles, and in
1978 struck out on her own as a documentary filmmaker, author,
and radio personality on both National Public Radio and the Sports
Radio Network. Yet in her work, Chastain decided to confront feminism
directly, pointing out that sixty-one percent of the nation's
top female executives are childless, as opposed to fourteen percent
of the women in the general population.&quot;I talked about the
fact that female physicians take fewer patients per hour, and
choose to work fewer hours,&quot; she says. &quot;You don't get
to the top job on flextime.&quot; Chastain said she realized that
feminists &quot;don't play fair, they want their piece of cake
and yours, too.&quot; Soon Chastain was in the public eye as a
vocal opponent of the movement. She testified to the Presidential
Commission on Women in Combat against sending women into battle,
in her newsletter she published the findings of the Center for
Military Readiness on double standards applied to female aviators,
and she wrote columns arguing that the feminists were prepared
to sacrifice the lives of American women to promote their ideology.
&quot;Is it fair that we ask these same women to go into combat
against the all-male armies of countries that are not equal opportunity
employers?&quot; she asked. &quot;Our women will be putting out
an equal effort, but in the end they will be dying in unequal
numbers.&quot;

<center><h2>Inside the Ford Foundation's Plan to Split Apart America </h2>
<h3>by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle</h3></center>
<p>
The roots of the Ford Foundation's support for Hispanic political activism can be traced to the late McGeorge
Bundy, National Security Adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
and president of the Ford Foundation from 1966 to 1979.  A high-minded
Boston Brahmin eager to turn from badly advising Lyndon Johnson
on Vietnam war policy to establishing domestic social priorities,
Bundy concentrated his efforts at Ford on improving American education
and on ending racial discrimination. 
<P>
&quot;He came to the foundation determined
to put as much distance as possible between himself and the horror
in the Far East,&quot; Waldemar Neilsen said in his book <I>The
Golden Donors</I>, &quot;to achieve high visibility for himself
as a liberal domestic reformer.&quot; Bundy made a dramatic series
of grants to change the direction of the foundation quickly. He
funded direct action protests by community groups, voter registration
drives, and even some outreach programs to urban street gangs.
With the Ford Foundation on their side beneficiaries quickly becme
&quot;more strident in their demands and more involved in local
politics,&quot; according to Neilsen. Congressman Wright Patman
went to the House floor to ask, &quot;Does the Ford Foundation
have a grandiose design to bring vast political, economic, and
social changes to the nation?&quot; The answer was yes. What Neilsen
called Bundy's &quot;sneering contempt&quot; during congressional
hearings led Patman to place legal prohibitions on &quot;political
and propagandistic grants&quot; and restrictions on voter registration
projects.
<P>&quot;Henry Ford II was close to 'going crazy'
with Bundy's 'progressive' _ and to his mind _  wastrel politics,&quot;
writes Georgie Anne Geyer in her new book <I>Americans No More
</I>[see review by Robert Huberty on page 8]. &quot;Ford dealers
across the country were bitterly complaining to him that Bundy's
policies were ruining their businesses: Thousands of Americans
were refusing to buy Fords.&quot;
<P>
As I first  pointed out in my book, <I>Out
Of The Barrio</I> (NY: Basic Books, 1991) Ford repeated  a pattern
characteristic of the political trends of the 1960s and 70s and
Bundy's liberalism played straight into the hands of ethnic activists.
They exploited liberalism's well-meaning and expansive social
concerns by advancing an aggressive political agenda undermining
America's tradition of equal opportunity.  The new Hispanic organizations
were products of  the Ford Foundation and it must bear a heavy
burden of responsibility for their actions. The Ford Foundation
was the leading funder of Hispanic advocacy groups.
<P>
Bundy's interest in Hispanic politics arose
from a 1968 study that the Ford Foundation commissioned on Hispanics
in America.  This was originally an internal document that would
guide the foundation and help direct its agenda and grantmaking
to Hispanics. 
<P>
The report concluded that Mexican Americans
were disorganized and fragmented and in need of a national organization
to serve their social, economic and political needs.  Siobhan
Oppenheimer Nicolau, a former Ford Foundation program officer
who guided Ford's early decisions to fund Hispanic organizations,
stated in 1990 that foundation officials thought Mexican Americans
were unable to create and sustain a network of viable institutions.
 Why?  &quot;They lacked the strong network of religious institutions
that had nurtured black leadership.  They lacked visibility outside
the Southwest, and they lacked a history of slavery, a powerful
tool that had galvanized white guilt and support for the black
civil rights movement.&quot;
<P>
To this day Ford officials use the same rhetoric.
Susan Vail Berresford, current president of the Ford Foundation,
wrote in the October 14, 1996 <I>National Review</I>, &quot;Our
grants to Hispanic-led groups to strengthen their communities
and improve their level of participation in American society hardly
constitute an &quot;attack on American democracy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="2">
<P>
<B>Present at the Creation</B>
<P>
Relying on these conclusions, the Ford Foundation decided 
to create two major Hispanic organizations.  In 1968 it established
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF)
which was intended to use lawsuits, and courtroom and legislative
 maneuvering to promote public policy. In fact, the organization
was a creature of the Ford Foundation, and as she wrote in response
to Berresford in the same issue of <I>National Review</I>, &quot;would
not exist without foundation funding.&quot;
<P>
In 1968, too,  Ford funded the Southwest
Council of La Raza as an organization coordinating other organizations
-- which later became the National Council of La Raza, described
as &quot;the Latino equivalent of the Urban League.&quot;
<P>
It was a still a creature of the Ford Foundation,
dependent on annual grants from New York City and unrepresentative
of Hispanic Americans.
<P>
In the nearly three decades since their establishment,
these organizations, MALDEF in particular, have played an enormous
role in shaping public policy toward Hispanics, on everything
from immigration to education to voting laws.  In 1975 MALDEF
was instrumental in amending the 1965 Voting Rights Act to force
jurisdictions with significant numbers of voters identified as
Hispanic to receive voting materials in Spanish.  Today, more
than 270 jurisdictions are affected by this requirement.  Under
the act, jurisdictions in Michigan and elsewhere are required
to print Spanish language ballots at considerable cost even though
practically no one uses them.
<P>
From 1968 to 1975, MALDEF pushed through bilingual
education programs and requirements across the country.  They
have trapped Hispanic students in what are essentially Spanish-language
maintenance and development programs.  A September 1996 poll of
Hispanic parents by the Center for Equal Opportunity shows that
the vast majority of Hispanics don't agree with groups like MALDEF
on bilingual education. [see box on p.4] This national survey
found that 63 percent of Hispanic parents say they want their
children to learn English as quickly as possible. Only 16.9% want
Spanish taught first. Over 80 percent want their children's academic
courses to be taught in English and not Spanish.  But the bilingual
education programs favored by MALDEF do just the opposite.  They
teach schoolchildren almost exclusively in Spanish throughout
grade school and sometimes through high school.
<P>
The Ford Foundation remains the largest single
source of funding for MALDEF and NCLR.  According to Geyer, NCLR
in 1989 received $590,000 from Ford, a major share of its $3.5
million budget that year.  In 1991 it received $1.25 million from
Ford.  From 1968 to 1990 Ford gave more than $9.6 million to NCLR
and $14.2 million to MALDEF.  Susan Vail Berresford, the Ford
Foundation's current president, was a keynote speaker at NCLR's
annual conference in Denver this past July.  She was given NCLR's
President's Award for her leadership and commitment to NCLR. 
With ten thousand participants, this was NCLR's largest conference,
and it featured sessions on issues like: How to defend affirmative
action. 
<P>
Yet, NCLR's growth has blunted some of its
ideological edge, at least when it comes to raising money, and
this has led to tensions within the organization.  Funding for
the Denver conference, which cost $1.2 million, left some activists
fuming.  Specifically, critics complained that NCLR should not
have accepted a $25,000 sponsorship fee from the Golden, Colorado-based
Coors Brewing Company.  Some conservative members of the Coors
family have supported proposals to make English the official language
of the United States and have opposed racial preference policies.
<P>
NCLR, however, has learned the political and
financial ropes, and it knows how to run its organization and
agenda along several tracks.  As Raul Yzaguirre, president of
NCLR -- and past Chairman of Independent Sector, a group founded
by Common Cause's John Gardner to promote networking for social
change among non-profits -- explained to a reporter for the <I>Denver
Post</I>:  &quot;We learned how to do things right.&quot; Yzaguirre
added. &quot;We analyzed public policy, earned a reputation the
hard way, as reasonable, hard&#173;minded, objective [people].
Developing friends on [Capitol] Hill, then moving on to new areas.&quot;
Yzaguirre denies that NCLR's competence in Washington lobbying
has put it out of touch with the average Hispanic.  He told the
<I>Post</I>,  &quot;Check the polls, on every issue -&#173; civil
rights, education, housing, equal access -&#173; we [Hispanics]
are together.&quot; 
<P>
But polling data shows that Hispanics are not united behind NCLR positions.
Nevertheless, Yzaguirre is among the organizers for a Columbus Day protest march in Washington
DC -- endorsed by the U.S. Catholic Conference, Congressional Hispanic
Caucus, and other organizations -- whose leader, Los Angeles activist
Juan Jose Guiterrez told <I>The Washington Post</I>, &quot;To
the best of my knowledge, the great majority of the American public
does not support a fascist police state.&quot;
<p>
Despite their ability to stage media events,
MALDEF, NCLR, and other Hispanic advocacy organizations funded
by the Ford Foundation are not directly accountable to the community
whose interests they purport to represent.  The Hispanic community
does not elect the members, officers, or board of these organizations,
most of which pursue their objectives with little public scrutiny.
 Because they are not membership organizations dependent on individual
contributions from the community at large, few Mexican Americans
can name these groups.  Their leaders are unknown despite their
influence on public policy affecting Hispanics.  The Hispanic
community does not control the funding of these groups and, most
importantly, it has virtually no say in the agenda they choose
to promote.  The Ford Foundation and other grantmakers have freed
these organizations from the need to be accountable to the communities
they are supposed to represent.  And they have created a cadre
of ethnic power brokers instead of identifying legitimate representatives
from the Hispanic community.
<P>
These groups believe they are on the cutting
edge of social change.  But the future they envision is one in
which Hispanics become wards of government permanently entitled
to public benefits because of their ethnicity.  Most  Hispanics,
like other groups before them, would choose to become part of
the mainstream. Instead, these groups speak of &quot;empowering&quot;
Hispanics by defining them as members of a protected class. They
want to empower Hispanic children by winning court battles that
will require them to be taught in Spanish for a society where
the best jobs go to those who speak, read, and write English well.
 They insist that the fortunes of middle&#173;class Hispanics
must be determined by the political battles over the most disadvantaged
Hispanics, making the former hostage to the latter.  Only the
lobbyists and activists who broker the policies of the welfare
state benefit from such strategies.
<P>
With $7.5 billion in assets, you would think
the Ford Foundation would want to do something other than fund
organizations intent on dividing Americans along racial and ethnic
lines. Yet Ford has been, and continues to be, the philanthropic
foundation most heavily involved in Hispanic advocacy politics.
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="3">
<P>
<B>WHO DO FORD'S HISPANIC GROUPS REPRESENT?
</B><P>
Ford's decision to create political advocacy organizations was not
  needed by the Hispanic community,. Hispanic have never required
 exclusive ethnic-based mediating structures to serve their
interests.  Working-class Hispanics, for example, have often
preferred labor unions to represent them.  Mexican Americans and
other Hispanic groups serve in leadership positions in the Steelworkers,
United Auto Workers, Food and Commercial Workers, and other industrial
unions in the Midwest and Southwest, as well as in the United
Farm Workers union in California.  The executive vice-president
of the AFL-CIO, Linda Chavez-Thompson, is an Hispanic. 
<P>
Other Hispanics turn to the Catholic Church
to mediate their grievances, and there is a growing evangelical
Protestant ministry to Hispanics.  Many middle-class Hispanics
have joined local civic and business groups that target their
economic or social interests rather than their ethnicity.  In
addition, there are well-established organizations such as
the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).  Founded
in 1929, it is the nation's oldest Hispanic organization dedicated
to assimilation and integration into the larger American society.
 The American G.I. Forum is also an Hispanic group which represents
the needs of  veterans. These Hispanic groups typically pursue
assimilationist goals.  LULAC, for instance, lists the following
member duty in its declaration of purpose: &quot;To foster the
acquisition and facile use of the official language of our country
that we may thereby equip ourselves and our families for the fullest
enjoyment of our rights and privileges and the efficient discharge
of our duties and obligations to this, our country.&quot; Unfortunately,
by the 1970s, LULAC too had veered far to the left, and now is
almost no different from NCLR and MALDEF.
<P>
The original goals of assimilation seemed to suit the majority of Hispanics in 
America --but not the Ford Foundation.  Ford has pursued an agenda that separates 
Hispanics from other Americans and classifies them as a permanent underclass.
 The Ford Foundation instead attempts to copy the political strategies
of the black civil rights movement.  Relying on the advice of
a handful of Mexican American activists like Chicano academics
Julian Samora and Ernesto Galarza and political operator Herman
Gallegos, Ford in the 1960s decided to create new Hispanic institutions
to adopt an anti-assimilationist agenda and supplant the
traditional voices of the Hispanic community in America.
<P>
In its eagerness to mobilize social discontent,
the Ford Foundation has occasionally helped its operatives go
over the line that separates dissent from incitement to violence.
 In 1969, Jose Angel Gutierrez, founder of the La Raza Unida political
party in Texas, told a group of reporters at a press conference
that, &quot;We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean
by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill
him.&quot;  Gutierrez was affiliated with the Mexican America
Youth Organization (MAYO) which had received a $10,000 grant from
a Ford Foundation grantee.  Texas Democratic Congressman Henry
B. Gonzalez was so enraged by Gutierrez' rhetoric that he took
to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to accuse him
of promoting racial hatred.  Gonzalez attacked the Ford Foundation
for indirectly supporting La Raza Unida through its grant to MAYO.
<P>
Fearing that the incident would strengthen
efforts then underway in Congress to limit political advocacy
by tax-exempt foundations, Ford announced at the time that
MAYO was barred from receiving additional Ford money.  However,
some at Ford continued to defend Gutierrez.  For instance, Siobhan
Nicolau, the Ford Foundation program officer, contended that Gutierrez
was provoked to make the statement by hostile questions from the
press.
<P>
Despite incidents like these, Ford has not
been deterred from its commitment to establish extremely political
Hispanic advocacy organizations.  Whatever activists claim, Hispanic
Americans simply have not faced the same level of racial hostility
that African Americans have encountered, and their history in
this country is very different from that of Hispanics.
<P>
Although they have had their difficulties,
Hispanics have never faced the kind of political and legal discrimination
suffered by blacks.  Segregationist Jim Crow laws did not cover
Mexican Americans in the Southwest, for example.
<P>
And although de facto segregation of Hispanic
children existed in South Texas and to a lesser extent in California,
this segregation was not sanctioned by law and it was struck down
when challenged in the courts. As early as 1931 Hispanic parents
had won the right to send their children to school with non-Hispanics
-- even where local officials tried to prevent it.
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="4">
<P>
<B>IN FORD'S DEEP POCKETS</B>
<P>
Despite these historical differences, Ford funds nonprofit
organizations that it hopes will recreate the black civil rights
movement for Hispanics. In 1968, it provided grants to ASPIRA,
the Spanish acronym for a New York City-based Puerto Rican education
group, allowing it to replicate its activities elsewhere.  ASPIRA
was instrumental in forcing New York City schools to test all
Hispanic children for placement in all-Spanish &quot;bilingual
education programs&quot; that claimed to be bilingual although
teaching in only one language -- Spanish.  The result of this mandatory
program has been that many non-Spanish speaking children
with Spanish surnames have been placed in Spanish language programs,
even if their parents wished the children to learn English. They
were segregated from the English speaking population. 
<P>
In 1972, Ford helped create the Puerto Rican
Legal Defense and Education Fund to mimic MALDEF's activities.
 In 1974, it provided operating funds for the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project and later the Midwest Voter Registration
Education Project.  All of these shared Ford's segregation-oriented
priorities, rather than respond to the needs of an increasingly
assimilated Hispanic population.  
<P>
Other Hispanic organizations and programs
that have received large Ford Foundation grants include the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO)
Education Fund, the National Puerto Rican Coalition, and the Hispanic
Leadership Opportunity Program, which provides internships in
government agencies and public policy groups.  In addition, the
Ford Foundation has contributed to a number of academic programs
for Hispanics, including grants for Hispanic research to the City
University of New York, the University of Texas, and the University
of Michigan. Some of this reasarch has been legitimate scholarship.
 It was in 1963 that Ford funded a major UCLA study of Mexican
Americans. The &quot;Mexican American Study Project&quot; would
span five years and it involved field research in twenty cities.
 What resulted was an authoritative work on the history, demography,
institutions, and political participation of Mexican Americans:
 <I>The Mexican American People: The Nation's Second Largest Minority</I>,
by UCLA professors Leo Grebler, Joan Moore, and Ralph Guzman.
However, many of the more recent Ford-funded programs have been
politically tendentious rather than scholarly.
<P>
Other grantmaking foundations like Carnegie
and Rockefeller also fund Hispanic advocacy organizations as do
the philanthropic arms of corporations like Coors, Kellogg's,
Anheuser-Busch, BankAmerica and Pepsico.  The federal government
has also provided grants to Hispanic advocacy groups for job training
and other programs.  But neither the federal government nor any
other grantmaker has matched Ford in terms of long-term commitment
or amount of money contributed.  Indeed, the Ford Foundation has
virtually created the infrastructure of the contemporary Hispanic
policy movement.
<P>
With the support of the Ford Foundation, the
anti-assimilationist Hispanic organizations have scored notable
successes in politics and public relations at the expense of the
rich vitality and diversity of the community of Americans of Hispanic
origin. 
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="5"><B>
<P>
PERPETUATING  STEREOTYPES</B>
<P>
Today, as a result of the efforts of the Ford Foundation,  in the
public mind and for all agencies of the U.S. government the
entire Hispanic American population is classified as a disadvantaged
minority group.  This encompasses the native-born and the recent
immigrant:  rich, white-European Argentine or Cuban Americans
as well as English-speaking blacks from Central America's
Caribbean coast.  It covers the Nahuatl-speaking Mexican
Indian and Peruvian-born descendants of Japanese immigrants to
South America.  For the purpose of political organization, it
makes no difference whether the &quot;Hispanic&quot; is a new
arrival or a citizen whose family has lived in the United States
for a dozen generations, descendants of holders of the Spanish
land grants covering millions of acres, or the head of the Coca-Cola
Corporation.
<P>
By linking disparate groups together and claiming
to represent them all, Hispanic organizations have been able to
acquire political power.  By promoting divisions between Hispanics
and non-Hispanics, they have maintained and strengthened
their power through &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics.  In
particular, they have encouraged the mind-set of the dependent
Hispanic &quot;victim&quot; _ something NCLR does especially well.
 Raul Yzaguirre, NCLR president, plays on these insecurities.
 He told the<I> Rocky Mountain News</I> this past summer:  &quot;The
bigotry and racism sweeping our country should be of concern not
just to minorities but to all Americans.  We will no longer tolerate
those in our society who fan the flames of this hatred to further
their careers or their political aspirations.&quot;
<P>
In 1994 Yzaguirre's inflamatory remarks were
reported in <I>Ethnic NewsWatch</I> published by a Hispanic news
group.  He told an Hispanic audience that &quot;every single federal
program and almost every public program discriminates against
Latinos.  That is not an accusation.  It's a fact.  Those realities
don't happen by accident.  Nobody else has less political power
in proportion to their numbers.&quot;
<P>
Yzaguirre also boasted of the increased political
clout Hispanic organizations like his could muster:  &quot;That
infrastructure has made it possible to have a rise in political
power. Now there are over five thousand elected Latino officials.
 <I>Hay orgullo.  Hay esperanza.</I>  We know we'll fulfill Walt
Whitman's prediction that Mexican Americans in the Southwest would
be the salvation of this country.&quot;
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="6"><B>
<P>
THE AGENDA BEHIND FORD'S AGENDA
</B><P>
That MALDEF and NCLR understand the political importance of
dividing Americans this way is apparent in the kinds of public
policy issues they pursue most vigorously.  In immigration policy,
they ardently defend high levels of immigration and generous social
and safety net programs for immigrants.  Yet according to the
National Latino Political Survey, 75 percent of Mexican Americans
feel that there are too many immigrants in the U.S. now.  MALDEF
ignores the opinions of the people it claims to represent because
it knows that high levels of immigration serve its own purposes.
<P>
In areas like income and education, the continued
immigration of low-skilled and poorly-educated Hispanics
keeps general Hispanic achievement levels below that of non-Hispanic
whites.  This justifies the panoply of government programs that
advocacy groups say Hispanics want and need.  In fact, second
and third generation Hispanics are very much assimilated and enjoy
earnings and education levels comparable to non-Hispanics.
 On average, the weekly earnings of native-born Mexican American
men are about 83 percent those of non-Hispanic white men.
 When variables like schooling, experience, hours worked, and
geographical region of residence are taken into account, Mexican
American men earn about 93 percent of the weekly earnings of comparable
non-Hispanic white men.
<P>
Because Hispanics do not share any common
racial characteristics or national histories, political advocacy
groups like MALDEF and NCLR focus on language and culture to reinforce
a separate Hispanic ethnic identity.  With this goal in mind,
programs such as bilingual education become tools used to maintain
Hispanic language and culture and reduce the possibility of assimilation,
particularly among children.  By devaluing the importance of English
to American citizens, the bilingual ballot elevates Spanish and
makes it a quasi-official language.  These ballots are also used
to include Hispanics under the provisions of the Voting Rights
Act, which virtually guarantees ethnically-gerrymandered Hispanic
congressional districts. 
<P>
Because Hispanic organizations want to segregate
the community they claim to represent from the mainstream of America's
democracy, they hold in contempt all proposals to make English
the official language of the United States.  Yet significant numbers
of Hispanics do not agree.  The National Latino Political Survey
found in 1992 that well over 40 percent of Mexican Americans and
almost 50 percent of Puerto Ricans support legislation to make
English America's official language. That is significant support
for &quot;English Only.&quot;
<P>
Affirmative action, a program that richly
rewards racial and ethnic identity politics, is also used to divide
us.  Middle and upper-class Hispanics have always been assimilated
into mainstream American culture to a very great extent.  The
intermarriage rate between Hispanics and non-Hispanics, which
is almost 50 percent for Mexican Americans in California, is only
one indication of the effects of the process of assimilation.
 But ethnicity-based preferences and set-asides are a great incentive
for any group to identify itself by ethnicity.  Any group that
is offered preferential treatment in admission to universities,
jobs and job promotions, and non-competitive awards of government
contracts that pay well above the market rate is sure to take
advantage.  But it is also likely eventually to lose support from
the majority of those who receive no such privileges.  And the
genuine achievements of members of a politically-preferred ethnic
group will come under unfair suspicion. 
<P>
Nevertheless, over the past year the Ford
Foundation has distributed $1.4 million in grants to a dozen organizations
for litigation, research, and advocacy in favor of affirmative
action.  This year the Ford Foundation has contributed over $500,000
to several organizations specifically opposing California's Proposition
209, which is also known as the California Civil Rights Initiative.
 MALDEF launched legal challenges and a media campaign to defeat
the ballot initiative that would bar the state of California from
using race, ethnicity, or gender to discriminate against or grant
preferential treatment to any person or group.  No doubt, if the
measure passes, groups supported by the Ford Foundation will challenge
its constitutionality all the way to the Supreme Court.
<P>
The success or failure of this ballot proposition
to endure such challenges from Ford and its operatives will determine
whether America takes a step forward or backwards from equal opportunity
for all.

<I>Americans No More: The Death of Citizenship by Georgie Anne Geyer (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1996, 352 pages.)

It is syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer's thesis that the concept of citizenship has lost meaning for increasing numbers of Americans.
The civic bond that links Americans of all backgrounds by a committment to certain universal ideas of freedom and equality is unravelling. The
signs are everywhere, not least in the debate over how we decide who is an American.

Geyer argues that the decline of citizenship has been hastened by political actions and economic developments that are driving us apart. At
home, politicians and advocacy groups are exploiting racial and ethnic conflict and are "retribalizing" communities to acquire political power.
This development is worldwide. In the former Yugoslavia, in India and Lebanon, and now in the U.S. politicians are making their careers by
demanding group rights and legal privileges for specific nationalities and subcultures. In America they are abetted by ethnic group advocacy
organizations that derive their support from private foundation grants and not from the ethnic groups they purport to represent. Geyer
describes how this process is fostering disunity in the name of diversity and only benefits those whose careers depend on it. As political and
media elites celebrate multiculturalism and denigrate individual merit and equal opportunity, the idea of a common American civic culture
atrophies. 
<P>
In contrast to domestic politics, U.S. economic institutions increasingly operate in a global marketplace. Politicians and government
bureaucrats are losing control over currency exchange rates, labor and capital markets, and the flow of information. Most conservatives
welcome this trend because it increases the power of the individual. But Geyer worries that globalization will make us less respectful of national laws and patriotic sentiments. American financial and government leaders will feel more at home dealing with their foreign counterparts over abstract issues than with the real problems of their fellow countrymen: No longer farmers and merchants in the town square, they will decide price changes and power shifts in conference calls at international airports between flights to high-level conferences. Officials of international agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) will also relax their national loyalties as they roam the world offering money and advice. Can such people recognize the tangible obligations and benefits of citizenship? 
<P>
In such a world what becomes of Americans who, as Tocqueville observed, join local associations to accomplish tasks without government
but with their neighbors? What will sustain citizens when the laws and institutions that guarantee equal opportunity are delegitimized at home
and displaced abroad? 
<P>
Geyer blames U.S. policymakers for letting special interest groups take the initiative in determining what new citizens and immigrants will think about America. As a journalist, she has roamed the country talking with scholars and public officials. Her interviews with those who are in charge of administering the laws regulating U.S. immigration and naturalization are especially revealing, and this reporting is the most valuable part of her book. 
<P>
For instance, Geyer reports in detail on the dumbed-down U.S. citizenship exams that the Immigration Act of 1990 now permits the nonprofit
Educational Testing Service (ETS) to administer. In place of requiring immigrants to give oral responses to questions posed by an Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) officer at a government office, officials say immigrants can choose to take a user-friendly ETS multiple choice test at a community center. And they can take the test as many times as they need to pass it. ETS proudly reports that it relies on a battery of Hispanic and refugee organizations like the Mexican American Legal Defense and and Education Fund (MALDEF) for advice on its testing policies and procedures. 
<P>
Instead of "Americanizing" new citizens, Geyer says ethnic advocacy groups are promoting a "reverse colonization" that would adapt our
citizenship to the ethnicity of the immigrant. Groups like MALDEF help immigrants become U.S. citizens without adequate knowledge of our
history, laws or language. They extract government entitlements for legal and illegal aliens, and raise obstacles to efforts to stop illegal
immigration. In lobbying over the content of civics in school textbooks and public ceremonies, ethnic advocacy groups too often sacrifice the ideas of the Founding Fathers to illiberal cultures of blood and soil. But most immigrants do not support their most strident demands. Surveys show that immigrants want to learn English quickly, to be assimilated to American culture, and to work and prosper. Far from being a cry of the people, MALDEF's legal briefs and the pronouncements of La Raza derive from the agenda of program officers at the Ford Foundation and other philanthropic grantmakers. Geyer's chapter on the Ford Foundation, excerpted in the National Review -- complemented by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle in this issue -- reviews the history of Ford's imposed revolution from above. 
<P>
Geyer's conclusion seems at odds with many of her findings. Apparently persuaded that Americans are throwing away their birthright and
overwhelmed by a sense of social breakdown, Geyer succumbs to emotions unsuited to the sharp reporting of her earlier chapters. She
describes the beauty of southern Wisconsin, where her family has a lakeside cottage, and compares it to an unlovely California marred by
criminal gangs, high taxes, overcrowding, gated communities, and illegal aliens. 
<P>
Instead of keeping her sights on the political and financial backers of ethnic political advocacy, she seems frightened by immigrants
themselves and appears to hold them responsible for the contrast that disturbs her. But America is more than southern Wisconsin, and the
type of political advocacy to which she objects would surely continue even without immigration. (If there were fewer universities, would
political correctness end?) 
<P>
Some argue that the alternative to the era of big government is big citizenship. Likewise, the alternative to the political demands of the ethnic
lobbies is to recognize and encourage the positive social achievements of immigrants.

Letters to the Editor</H3><BR>
<P>
 Thank you for the newsletter about
the Joyce Foundation. 
I know you write from a special viewpoint,
as is your right.  You'd have a better chance to sell
that view if you got the details right instead of getting into
a position where facts undermine your whole argument. Among the
serious errors in the article are these lesser ones pertaining
to me:
<P>
Daly is) &quot;a practicing Catholic.&quot;
That error made my Catholic mother-in-law happy but I remain a
non-practicing Protestant.
<P>
(Daly is) &quot;an active Democrat.&quot;
Nope,  just a registered, inactive Democrat who has crossed the
line often (and privately).
<P>
&quot;A lieutenant said...&quot; Nope.
Colonels makes those statements, lieutenants just get shot.
<P>
&quot;Daly did confess that he had
himself attended Columbia Journalism School on a $600 scholarship.&quot;
Wrong. I have never applied for or received a scholarship. At
Columbia I did get that money by winning a competition to determine
which student had acquired the best understanding of the laws
governing libel.
<P>
As your concluding lines suggested,
I have taken another look at the direction the Joyce Foundation
is heading. I am delighted with the course and hope I can help
Deborah Leff maintain it.

Congratulations on Alicia Shepard's meticulously researched and well written study
of Pew's foray into civic journalism [&quot;Buying Press Coverage:
How Pew's Civic Journalism Projects Put Newspapers, Radio and
Television Stations on the Payroll,&quot; vol. 1, no. 7].
<P>
While civic journalism may skew reporting
away from &quot;hard&quot; news and demanding examination of government
(and away form cynicism, its supporters would add), your article
displayed no such bias toward either side of the debate.
<P>
I was impressed and look forward to
future detailed examinations of foundations' activities.</FONT>

I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy
<I>Foundation Watch</I>. It tells me an awful lot about some villains
I didn't know nearly enough about, including the wicked Rebecca
Rimel. It is sickening to see what has happened to the Pew Foundation
under her regime, although there must have been some rot there
to have seen hiring her as a good idea in the first place. As
someone old enough to have recalled Howard Pew while he was still
alive (he was a doughty warrior in the labor-management wars of
the 30s and 40s, among other things) I can only be saddened by
yet one more 180 degree turn in a foundation that was set up for
totally different purposes than those which it now brazenly carries out.

In June, author Joe Maxwell attended the 
first-ever reunion of Booker T. Washington's descendants, which 
was held at the institution Washington founded, the 
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He records here his impressions of 
 the legacy of this great man.</font>
</td>

<P>
<a name="1">
<BR>
<P>Everything at Tuskegee seems to have changed for 
Ethelda Murray Hockett.  The room where once she learned 
the trade of &quot;domestic science&quot; is now a lavish testament to 
the man she reveres.  At one end of this massive boardroom, 
a life-size oil portrait of her uncle, Booker T. 
Washington, gazes from behind Mrs. Hockett's graying 
90-year-old head. Seated in her wheelchair, Mrs. Hockett has 
joined about 100 other relatives at a first-ever reunion 
of Washington's family.
<P>While Mrs. Hockett's creamy brown face registers 
justifiable pride, she also registers a melancholic hint of 
sorrow and regret as she wonders aloud what her uncle would 
think of his school today.
<P>&quot;You see,&quot; she notes in a wistful whisper, &quot;they've 
gotten away from the trades.&quot;
<P>In fact, Tuskegee University, a school founded with 
a $2,000 Alabama state grant in 1881 on the premise 
that every graduate should master basic academic 
disciplines and a marketable trade, no longer even has a &quot;trade 
building.&quot; Instead, the scores of stately Greek Revival 
brick buildings that Mr. Washington's early students built 
with their own hands are now completely devoted to 
&quot;higher&quot; academia.
<P>&quot;I have been told that the reason there has been such 
a transition is that the emphasis is more on the trades in 
higher development and sciences,&quot; continues Mrs. Hockett. 
&quot;Of course, in those early days, Dr. Washington was 
interested in young people who came to the school learning to use 
their hands so they could really help their family.&quot;
<P>Mr. Washington's niece is old enough to 
remember hearing her uncle preach his dignity-through-work 
vision for climbing out of slavery.  &quot;There is no position, 
however high in science or letters or politics, that I would 
withhold from any race, but I would have the foundation clear,&quot; 
Mr. Washington once said.  His goal crossed lines of race 
or class: &quot;Usefulness . . . is the supreme end of education.&quot; 
<P>Early in this century Mr. Washington's 
philosophical rivals overtook him, and they still reign today.  Where 
Mr. Washington emphasized respect earned, modern 
elitists have emphasized rights possessed.  Today, politicians 
and reporters now frequently babble that man's highest goal is education, 
defined most often in the narrow sense of 
a college degree.  Little is said about the usefulness of 
one's schooling.
<P>Yet market realities today vindicate Mr. 
Washington's wisdom: all-too-familiar are stories of college 
graduates who either can't find a job in their field, or find they 
have pursued a college degree that has prepared them for 
nothing useful.
<P>In the name of equality, Washington's opponents 
have virtually demanded that a college education be available 
to and sought by all, regardless of desires or talents.  No 
one, they suggest, should have to endure a life of manual labor.
<P>
This, of course, was just the sort of thinking 
Washington's life and words refute: &quot;The ambition to secure an 
education was most praiseworthy and encouraging.  The idea, 
however, was too prevalent that, as soon as one secured a 
little education, in some unexplainable way he would be 
free from most of the hardships of the world, and, at any 
rate, could live without manual labour.&quot; 
<P>
But Washington's opponents actually have erased 
the very thing they sought to achieve: options.  
Twenty-two-year-old John McLeod is a good example.  He feels 
torn between a truly valuable career and society's 
expectations. &quot;Part of me says that I ought to go on to college and get 
a degree just for the sense of accomplishment and 
because that is what society says I ought to do,&quot; confesses the 
lanky Mr. McLeod, adorned in a hairnet at the bagel shop 
where he works while considering his future goals.  &quot;But the 
other part of me says that I'm good with my hands--I can 
make a good living as a welder.&quot;
<P>Twice Mr. McLeod has entered Tennessee universities, only to exit 
without any clear goals.  He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, to apprentice as 
a welder.  &quot;I think I could make a living as a tradesman,&quot; he says. &quot;I'd like 
to have the option of schooling. . . .  But if I enjoy, say, being a mechanic or welder, I want to do 
it without any feelings of guilt or reservation because 
society might look down on a blue-collar job.&quot;
<P>Today's students often forgo the necessary and 
difficult training they need for a promising career in the 
trades. Many prefer the shiny bauble of an academic degree but 
no job prospects.
<P>
<a name="2">
<P><B>Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois</B>
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw the problem of the dumbing down of America.  He did not diminish the 
importance of ideas, but he showed the earthy wisdom of 
someone who does not need the accolades of others.  Throughout 
his life, Washington was attacked mostly by Northern 
liberals, including W.E.B. Du Bois, who argued that blacks 
could not achieve equal status with whites except by radical, 
top-down intervention.  Washington championed work; Du 
Bois called for political action.  By the time Washington died 
in 1915, Du Bois seemed to have won the argument, 
especially given the establishment of Jim Crow laws in the South 
to impede black economic progress.  Washington soon 
was being called an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot;
<P>&quot;Booker T. Washington was dealt one of the 
toughest hands of any black leader in American history,&quot; 
conservative black economist Thomas Sowell has written.  
Washington, says Sowell, understood that in the post-Civil 
War South, the fates of the black and white race were inextricably 
linked; merely looking at the statistical mix of the region70 percent white, 
30 percent blackmade that point clear. &quot;Washington was able to enlist 
the support of some whites by arguing that blacks would either help lift up the 
South or help to drag it down,&quot; says Sowell.
<P>
In actuality, argues Sowell, Du Bois and Washington were  
opposite sides of the same coin.  Du Bois concentrated his energy 
on ending the segregation which was held in place by the majority 
of whites, while  Washington focused on &quot;the internal 
self-development of blacks.&quot;  This led him to seek 
out and nurture positive relationships with those whites who would 
support his efforts.  &quot;The net result was that Washington was 
often praising whites of good will, while Du Bois was 
attacking whites of ill will,&quot; writes Sowell.
<P>
Both men recognized that, no matter when civil 
rights were secured, diligent, hard work would always be 
required for self-improvement.  Both men worried about those 
in their race who would seek a hollow sort of advancement 
that circumvented diligent labor.  Du Bois, notes Sowell, 
spoke of &quot;the Great Lack which faces our race in the 
modern world, lack of Energy,&quot; which he attributed to 
&quot;indolence&quot; growing out of tropical origins and which had now 
become a kind of &quot;social heredity.&quot;  Du Bois doubted that 
merely achieving certain rights would lead to the immediate 
improvement of his people: &quot;Some few would be 
promoted,&quot; observed Du Bois.  Nevertheless, &quot;the mass would 
remain as they are&quot; until the younger generation began to 
&quot;try harder&quot; as the race &quot;lost the omnipresent excuse for 
failure: prejudice.&quot;
<P>&quot;Du Bois' assessment of the black masses at that time 
was not very different from that of Booker T. Washington, 
who characterized many of them as sunk into `listless 
indifference, or shiftlessness, or reckless bravado,'&quot; asserts  Sowell.
<P>Over the long haul, however, the two men pursued 
different strategies.  Du Bois chose to concentrate his energies 
for improving his race on the &quot;talented tenth,&quot; those blacks 
who had been freed and gained social development before 
the Civil War.  Washington, on the other hand, staked his 
claim on improving the lives of the other 90 percent, those 
who lacked education and opportunities. Washington 
urged blacks to envision work as a divine right to be 
exercised along with the vote.  Washington also urged them to be 
self-reliant rather than reliant on whites, and he warned them 
not to be sidetracked by the &quot;geegaws&quot; of their 
newfound freedom whether they were material possessions or 
legal rights. Although the school now seems focused on 
the &quot;talented tenth&quot; approach,  Tuskegee Institute was 
founded to uphold Washington's teachings.
<P>In <I>The Future of the American Negro,</I> Washington  
states: &quot;An individual or a race that is strong enough, is 
wise enough, to disregard makeshifts, customs, prejudices, 
alluring temptations, deceptions, imitationsto throw off 
the mask of unreality and plant itself deep down in the clay, 
or on the solid granite of nature, is the individual or the 
race that will crawl up, struggle up, yes even burst up; and in 
the effort of doing so will gain strength that will command 
for it respect and recognition.&quot;
<P>Sadly, however, Washington's basic teachings on 
the dignity of hard work and earned respect have lost 
authenticity in modern America.  Being grateful for an 
opportunity, or the idea of  &quot;starting at the bottom and working to 
the top,&quot; has been supplanted.  In the process, too many 
people of all races have recklessly dismissed altogether the great principles of living espoused by Booker T. Washington.
<P>
<a name="3">
<P><B>The Washington Family Reunion</B>
<P> The Booker T. Washington reunion was attended 
by nearly 100 people.  The vast majority knew very little 
about their great ancestor's life, much less about his 
teachings. Almost none of Mr. Washington's descendants live 
either philosophically or geographically near the soil of 
Tuskegee. In fact, many of the descendants had for years concealed 
the fact that they were Washington's offspring.
<P>The widow of Booker T. Washington III, Joyce 
Washington, related to one group at the reunion how her husband, 
 Washington's own grandson, had been ashamed of 
his ancestry at times and had distanced himself 
geographically and emotionally.  &quot;Booker was not telling people in 
New York what his name was,&quot; she said.  &quot;He went through 
this whole story about what a difficult time he had with 
the name, and especially in New York City, where there are so many 
minorities.&quot;
<P>But, she says, later in life he began to see the value of his 
grandfather's teachings.  Similarly, many at the reunion seemed to realize for 
the first time the greatness of the man and his teaching.  Sarah Thrash is 
the great-granddaughter of Booker T. Washington; she attends church 
at the Allen Temple in Oakland, California, where several stained 
glass windows depict historic black figures including Frederick 
Douglass and Booker T. Washington. Though she was his 
direct descendent, Mrs. Thrash kept quiet about her relation 
to Washington.  But after the reunion weekend, she said 
she had gained a much greater appreciation for the man.  
&quot;It gives me a great sense of pride,&quot; she said. &quot;After 
this weekend, I'll feel so much more pride looking up at 
that window.&quot;

<P>
Throughout the Washington reunion weekend, Edith Washington, one of four living granddaughters of 
the Tuskegee legend, played the role of proud 
grandparent, great-grandparent, and great-great-grandparent.  At an 
introductory  gathering of the family outside Washington's home, 
The Oaks, at the edge of Tuskegee University, Edithwith microphone 
in handproudly introduced virtually all of the estimated 100 
attendants by name and explained their place in the family tree.
<P>When she got to one name, 26-year-old Douglass 
Washington Morris, she gushed about the recent Tuskegee graduate.  &quot;And 
back there is Douglass Washington Morris,&quot; she said, noting his 
amazing heritage: his great-grandfather is Booker T. Washington, while his 
great-great-grandfather on his other side is Frederick Douglass.
<P>&quot;Douglass is a consultant with IBM in Chicago,&quot; 
Edith boasted. &quot;He makes $100,000 a year.&quot;
<P>Everyone laughed at her grandmotherly candor; 
Mr. Morris seemed a bit embarrassed.
<P>
<a name="4">
<P><B>Education for What?</B>
<P>&quot;There are too many people in the world who give 
their whole lives grasping at the shadow instead of the 
substance&quot; wrote Booker T. Washington.
<P>Eleven out of the 13 great grandchildren at the Booker 
T. Washington reunion have achieved college degrees: 
surely their forefather would be proud, especially since most of 
them seem actually to be using their advanced educationthe 
very thing Mr. Washington called for.
<P>As the Washington family gathered at the old Oaks 
home on the grounds of Tuskegee University, Tuskegee 
president Benjamin Payton commended them for returning to 
their forefather's home.  He explained how difficult it has been to 
continue raising the money the university needed to 
keep growing and thriving.  He reiterated that Tuskegee's 
effort to carry on the Washington tradition remains strong.
<P>
Yet Payton never bothered to mention that the 
university now has no vocational offerings in its catalogue. 
What would the champion of dirt farmers and manual 
laborers have thought of that?  Would he be pleased or dismayed 
that none of the nearly 100 descendants at the reunion earn 
their living in a trade?  When asked whatever happened to 
the Washington emphasis on trade school training alongside 
traditional academic training, President Payton replied: &quot;We 
think that the education of the whole person is extraordinarily 
important.  We do it now at a different level.  What was being done 
in 1881 was to meet a need at that time.  There were so many 
African Americans that needed a knowledge of how to make 
the transition from agrarian to industrial [society]. . . .  We 
don't need a Tuskegee training blacksmiths now. . . .  We need 
blacks trained in electrical engineering, in aerospace 
engineering, and in health sciences. . . .  All these are contemporary 
expressions of providing an education that meets the needs of 
today's society . . . and not just what was going on in ancient 
Greece and Rome.&quot;
<P>
<a name="5">
<P><B>Work toward Usefulness</B>
<P>Later in the weekend, Edith sat with Washington's 
three other living granddaughters at a table of honor. The 
remaining family members sat at tables according to their 
age. Edith called for quiet and introduced Ethelda 
Murray Hockett, &quot;the oldest living descendent of Booker T. 
Washington,&quot; and the clan hushed to hear her memories of 
their family hero.
<P>Her uncle, she says, would love the pristine 
modern Tuskegee campus, built by early students who rotated 
three days of vocational training with three days of 
academic schooling.  &quot;He wanted students to use the knowledge 
they had and learn trades,&quot; she said, noting quietly: &quot;The 
trade building is gone now.&quot;
<P>&quot;It has been replaced by engineering,&quot; injected Edith, 
&quot;a higher step up.&quot;
<P>Throughout the weekend, Edith and other elders 
urged their youth to attend special college admittance 
sessions being offered by Tuskegee's recruitment staff.  The role 
and value of vocational training, however, was never discussed.
<P>Contended Agnes Louise Washington O'Neal, 
Edith's sister: &quot;[Washington] was a man of his times.  Times 
have changed.&quot;
<P>Have times changed?  Or has our understanding of 
what the times need changedand for the worse?
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw two courses that all 
Americans, regardless of color, could take.  One esteems a 
person for his degree of  work; the other merely esteems the 
degree worked for.  &quot;I would say to the black boy what I would 
say to the white boy, `Get all the mental development your 
time and pocketbook will allow,'&quot; said Washington.
<P>The earnest desire to work toward usefulness inspired Booker T. Washington.  
Today he would surely applaud those in his family whose work ethic has led them to 
become doctors and lawyers; but he would surely give an 
equally rousing round of applause to those whose hard work 
ethic has led them to become master carpenters or masons.
<P>At one point during the Tuskegee reunion, several 
family members visited a bronze statue that depicts the &quot;Wizard 
of Tuskegee&quot; standing to lift a veil from a kneeling black 
man whose face looks skyward.
<P>The statue begs this question: what does the veil 
symbolize?  Does it represent an ignorance of &quot;higher 
knowledge&quot; that is being removed?  Or does it represent the removal 
of another sort of ignorance: the myth that human dignity 
is rooted purely in the vocation chosen, rather than in 
the excellence of work done in a chosen vocation?  &quot;Any 
man,&quot; said Mr. Washington, &quot;regardless of color, will be 
recognized and rewarded in proportion as he learns to do 
something well, learns to do it better than anyone else, 
however humble.&quot;
<P>Life, he taught, is the greatest classroom, and its 
graduates earn the highest degree.  &quot;The person who has 
mastered something, who understands what he is doing . . . out in 
the world, master of himself everywhere, that person,&quot; said 
Mr. Washington, &quot;is a scholar.&quot;
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<B>Where Have All the Tradesmen Gone?</B><BR>
<P>
Washington understood what was at stake: &quot;We 
shall prosper as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour 
and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life; 
shall prosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between 
the superficial and the substantial, the ornamental gewgaws 
of life and the useful.  No race can prosper until it learns that 
there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.&quot;
<P>And now, a hundred years later, corporate and 
small-town America is begging for tradesmen.  From bricklaying to 
tool-and-die work, the sort of high-skill, brain-and-brawn 
labor that Mr. Washington advocated is in rare supply but 
high demand.
<P>A recent Arthur Andersen Enterprise Group survey 
revealed that 25 percent of 919 small businesses surveyed 
fret over a dwindling supply of qualified workers in the 
trades. &quot;People have aimed for what was considered the most 
prestigious positions.  We don't have people for the other 
technologies,&quot; laments Julianne Inverso, student personal 
supervisor at Mercer County Vocational Technical Schools in 
Trenton, New Jersey.  At the Mercer County facility, students can 
be trained in air conditioning and refrigeration, auto body 
repair, business technology, computer operation, electrical 
construction, graphic arts, plumbing and heating, general 
building construction, and visual communicationsjust to name 
a few.  The student pool is diverse, from local teens learning 
a trade while attending  high school, to displaced members 
of the modern workplace.
<P>If holding a steady job and achieving a certain salary 
level are the measures, then Mercer's graduates may outdo 
those bound for college.  In 1995, Mercer County's facility 
graduated all of its 132 students. Only eight of 125 who 
later responded to a follow-up survey were unemployed, while 
86 had gone on to full- or part-time employment (some 
part-timers were attending college).
<P>While the historic reason for attending a university 
&quot;to learn to think&quot; has been supplanted by a utilitarian 
one, &quot;getting a job,&quot; growing numbers of today's students 
aren't even achieving that.
<P>The result is twofold.  First, the quality of education is 
 diminishing today: an Association for American 
Colleges survey reported that 78 percent of modern college 
graduates never take a Western history course; 77 percent avoid 
studying a foreign language; and 45 percent end-run even 
basic literature courses.  Second, less-learned college 
graduates leave school with their Holy Grail degree, only to find 
their cup empty as they are unable to find decent work.
<P>&quot;There is clearly a supply and demand problem for 
many manufacturers,&quot; says Michael Cantwell, national director 
of manufacturing at a management consulting firm, Grant Thorton, in a 
<I>Wall Street Journal </I>interview.
<P>The <I>Journal </I>article cites several examples of the paradox 
 in the American workforce: Lincoln Electric Company 
in Euclid, Ohio, currently has about 200 openings, with 
hourly pay ranging from $8.39 to $20.  While some openings are 
at the lowest rung of the plant, the company also needs 
tool-and-die makers, mold makers and machinists.
<P>But few of the thousands who apply for jobs at Lincoln 
can do high-school trigonometry or read technical drawings, 
and most don't show an aptitude for learning how to 
operate computer-controlled machines--skills that Lincoln says 
even entry-level workers need.
<P>Employees with certain skills are hot commodities.  
&quot;A journeyman welder is like a free agent in baseball,&quot; says 
Walt Elish, executive director of the Economic Development 
Corporation of Waukesha County, Wisconsin.  &quot;We can't 
find welders, we can't find tool-and-die makers, we can't 
find [computer-controlled] machine operators.&quot; He says 
such workers can earn from $35,000 to $50,000 a year, and it 
isn't uncommon for a good toolmaker to pull down $60,000 
with overtime.
<P>But to command those wages, today's factory 
workers need to use advanced math, have good communication 
skills and understand the use of computers.  Most 
high-school students with those abilities are college-bound.
<P>&quot;It is very frustrating,&quot; says Bruce Cable, Lincoln's 
employment manager, whose eight-person staff has 
screened thousands of candidates.  &quot;These days even if 
high-school students have C-minus grades, they can go to college.  
So, instead of getting the B student to handle a manual lathe, 
we are now getting the D student.&quot;
<P>Conservative columnist Don Feder has noted the 
same trend: &quot;Memo to incoming college freshmen: Most of you 
are wasting your parents' money, society's resources, and 
your own time.  The typical collegian would be better off at a 
trade school or in a job training program. . . .&quot;
<P>Feder quotes author William Henry III's 1994 book, 
<I>In Defense of Elitism</I>: &quot;For many adolescents . . . college 
is simply a holding pattern until they can get on with their 
lives. It is understandable that they should want to extend 
their youth and ponder their identities (or navels) for a bit; what 
is rather less clear is why they should do so at public as well 
as parental expense.&quot;
<P>Adds Feder: &quot;For most students, it's a cruel hoax; 
for families, an onerous burden to buy their progeny a 
paper credential.  For society, degree-worship is a huge and 
growing drain on the economy.
<P>&quot;And so, dear freshmen, heed those ads offering training 
in the operation of commercial vehicles or the art of dying 
hair and giving perms.  Compared to what you'll be doing for 
the next four years, this would be time well spent.&quot;

<CENTER><h2>New CRC Book Frees Seniors <br>Held Captive
by the Age Lobby</h2></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Older Americans who join seniors advocacy groups
like the AARP are often attracted by insurance deals, credit card
offers and colorful publications.  But a new <B>Capital Research
Center</B> book entitled <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How
the Age Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U> shows seniors they are
really imprisoned by a rich and powerful lobby that promotes wasteful
government programs while taking tax dollars for itself.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;Establishment seniors groups have become as harmful and
counterproductive as the welfare state itself.  They have a vested
financial stake in maintaining the status quo, even if it leads
to the bankruptcy of programs that seniors depend on,&quot; writes
author and Loyola College of Maryland economist Thomas J. DiLorenzo.
 <BR>
<P>
 The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and dozens
of lesser-known organizations that make up the age lobby have
become expert at exploiting the fears and needs of the elderly
to build their own power.  This power comes courtesy of taxpayers.
 In 1993, the federal government gave AARP $86 million to show
seniors how to find jobs and do their taxes.  Yet a year later,
AARP itself had to pay the IRS $135 million in taxes and penalties
for a decade of business activities the government deemed unrelated
to its nonprofit mission.  AARP's 1994 earnings on the sale of
insurance, pharmaceuticals and auto-club services totaled $191
million.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The reader will come away from this text knowing far more
than even most AARP members do about the nature of that organization,&quot;
writes preface author<B> Sen. Alan K. Simpson</B> (R-WY).  Simpson,
chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security
and Family Policy, held hearings investigating the AARP's business
and lobbying practices.  &quot;As the possessor of a sizable stack
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I
commend Tom DiLorenzo and the Capital Research Center for condensing
this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
 Recently, AARP and friends raised their taxpayer-funded voices
loud enough to drown out reports of the impending bankruptcy of
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  Trustees of these three
federal trust funds, on which most elderly rely, report that America's
aging population will empty the coffers faster than the smaller,
working-age population can re-fill them.  But the seniors lobby
falsely labeled efforts to save the system by slowing growth as
an attempt to &quot;cut&quot; benefits.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;These special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied
to failed welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly</U>  alerts members of these
groups that their support is contributing to the decline of the
American way of life,&quot; said Capital Research Center President
Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby Holds Seniors
Captive</U> explores the activities of the coalition of seniors
advocates that DiLorenzo calls the &quot;dependency lobby&quot;:
 AARP's unfair business practices; the National Council of Senior
Citizens' labor union ties; the Gray Panthers' socialist agenda;
and others.  It also heralds the more recent formation of a new
generation of seniors groups that emphasize voluntarism, consumer
choice and fiscal responsibility.
<P>

 To order <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby
Holds Seniors Captive</U>, send a check or money order for $15

<CENTER><h2>New Monthly <I>Culture Watch</I></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Is &quot;True Alternative Arts and Culture
Coverage&quot;</h2><BR></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Capital Research Center in June begins publishing
<I>Culture Watch</I>, a new monthly newsletter which Editor
Laurence Jarvik calls &quot;true alternative arts and culture
coverage, highlighting those who have been sidelined by the shock
artists who have demoralized the intellectual community.&quot;
 <BR>
<P>
 &quot;We intend to raise the profile of those who defy the tide
of political correctness and stand up for the traditional values
of society,&quot; said Laurence Jarvik, Ph.D., Capital Research
Center cultural studies fellow and <I>Culture Watch</I> editor.
<BR>
<P>
 Every month, <I>Culture Watch</I><B> </B>will spotlight trends,
ideas and personalities that enrich the arts and cultural life.
 The June issue profiles Frederick Stocken, &quot;Britain's most
backward-looking composer.&quot;  Stocken is a musician dedicated
to classical musical ideals, despite the opposition of an avant-garde
power structure supported by public funds.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The official guardians of the English music establishment
obviously were out of touch with their audience when they rejected
Stocken for his adherence to traditional standards -- a composer
who ultimately created a best-selling recording widely embraced
because of its harmonious melody,&quot; Jarvik said.<BR>
<P>
 Subsequent issues of <I>Culture Watch</I> will feature Maureen
Dowd, feisty <I>New York Times</I> columnist;  Professor Alan
Sokal, the NYU professor who discredited the field of cultural
studies by publishing an article challenging the law of gravity;
Mrs. Eugene Casey, who single-handedly donated $18 million to
give the Washington Opera a new home; and Will Fitzhugh, editor
of <I>The Concord Review</I>, a journal written by high school
students devoted to non-PC interpretations of American history.
 Trend stories will include an analysis of how Republicans are
portrayed in pop culture; and a look at the aftermath of Senator
Bob Dole's attack on Hollywood.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;America's moral standards have strayed so far from decency
that the artists who believe in the positive aesthetic value of
their work have been outcast by their colleagues.  <I>Culture
Watch</I> is a forum for these creators,&quot; said Capital Research
Center President Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <I>Culture Watch</I> will be Capital Research Center's fifth
monthly newsletter. It complements the institutional focus of<I>
Foundation Watch</I>, a newsletter that monitors the activities
of private foundations and analyzes their impact on American society.
 CRC launched <I>Foundation Watch</I>, also edited by Jarvik,
in February.<BR>
<P>
 CRC's other existing newsletters are <I>Organization Trends</I>,
which monitors advocacy organizations; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
which provides fresh perspectives on current trends and issues
in philanthropy; and <I>Philanthropy, Culture and Society</I>,
which examines the impact of philanthropy on American cultural
institutions and traditions.

<title>Michael Lind's Ad Hominem Attack On Conservative Foundations</title>

<center><h2>Michael Lind's Ad Hominem Attack On Conservative Foundations</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Robert Huberty</h4></center>
<P>
<I>Up From Conservatism: Why the Right Is Wrong for America <I>
by Michael Lind (The Free Press, 1996, 295 pages, $23).
<p><br>
Michael Lind's hate letter to the conservative movement is a peculiar
production. It's a complex and sour brew of personal memoir and social
history, public policy analysis and political punditry. The author
deliberately aims to devalue
every intellectual and moral claim of Reagan-Gingrich conservatism.^M
 He is intent on revealing as counterfeit an inside-the-Beltway^M
Washington conservative establishment and the grantmaking foundations^M
that fund it.  Part expose and part bitter reflection, Lind proclaims^M
himself a one-time insider who has seen the belly of the beast.
<P>
Its title echoing William F. Buckley,^M
Jr.'s <I>Up From Liberalism</I>, Lind's book unfolds as an autobiographical^M
complaint.  As a young friend of Buckley's, Lind yearned to imitate^M
his mentor's feat of expelling someone from the conservative movement.^M
 But while Buckley won applause for criticizing Ayn Rand and the^M
John Birch Society, conservatives seemed not to care about Lind's^M
whistleblowing essays on what Pat Robertson believed about the^M
history of central banking, the Rothschilds and Karl Marx.  Conservatism^M
endent^Mement of combative writers and scholars had given way^M
to conservatism as a political movement, and theoretical and theological^M
differences among allies were downplayed for the sake of immediate^M
common ends in public policy.  The young writer was appalled.
<P>
Lind asserts that grantmaking foundations^M
have played the key role in orchestrating this development in^M
conservative opinion.  Through the power of the purse, he credits^M
them with an extraordinary capacity to advance careers, inhibit^M
dissent and shape public policies.  Like other conspiracy theorists^M
on the left and right, Lind sees interlocking directorates of^M
power in which orders are issued, tasks assigned, and projects^M
coordinated among favored writers and think-tanks.  [See the September^M
1996 issue of the radical <I>Z Magazine</I> which makes Capital^M
Research Center the center of a &quot;Meese/Simon axis.&quot;]^M
 Lind claims that conservative magazines and think-tanks are dep
on five conservative foundations: the John M. Olin Foundation,^M
Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust/Pew^M
Charitable Trusts, Smith-Richardson Foundation, and Sarah Scaife^M
Foundation.  But Pew has not been on anyone's list of conservative^M
funders in recent years while the others pursue more diverse and^M
fluctuating interests than he admits.
<P>
Lind construes the small number of^M
conservative grantmakers as evidence of a powerful conspiracy:^M
plutocratic pseudo-populists at work.  Of course, it's really^M
evidence of conservatism's weakness in the field of institutional^M
grantmaking and among foundation professionals.  Conservatives^M
are fortunate to have developed support from individual and foundation^M
donors.  And because they have lacked academic contacts, major^M
publishing outlets, and access to the national news media and^M
subsidized public broadcasting, conservatives have been entrepreneurial^M
in establishing their own think-tanks, newsletters and magazines,^M
creating direct mail and talk radio to get around the big media,^M
and securing footholds on the op-ed pages of major newspapers^M
through the excellence of their writing.  Lind mistakes initiative^M
for intrigue.  The liberal bias in major corporate giving to nonprofit^M
advocacy groups should be enough to undermine the claim that conservatives^M
are pampered mouthpieces of a corporate elite.
<P>
For someone with his intellectual ambitions,^M
Lind's writing can be incredibly snide and callow.  An advocate^M
of restricting legal immigration and an opponent of NAFTA, Lind^M
labels both Clinton Democrats and conservative Republicans as^M
members of the &quot;overclass.&quot;  He says both allow foreign^M
labor to dispossess white working class Americans and they do^M
it to justify their hired help:  &quot;Here, then, is a simple^M
test of overclass status.  Americans who do not have advanced^M
degrees and cannot afford maids or nannies are middle class; Americans^M
who have advanced degrees and can afford maids or nannies are^M
overclass.  It's as simple as that.&quot;  Lind's own opinions^M
are tinged with a nativist resentment and he insinuates that the^M
conservative movement is somehow alien.  He finds it peculiar^M
that so many conservative intellectuals have been Jews, Catholics^M
or foreign-born, and he disparages the major role &quot;foreigners^M
and immigrants&quot; like Rupert Murdoch play in funding journalists^M
of the right.
<P>
Because he covers so much political^M
and historical ground, <I>Up From Conservatism</I> could have^M
been an interesting book to argue with.  Lind believes conservatism^M
grew strong in the 80s because the culturally radical left destroyed^M
liberalism in the 60s and 70s.  An advocate of what he variously^M
calls &quot;national liberalism&quot; and &quot;neo-paleo-liberalism,&quot;^M
Lind argues that the modern Republican party is radical, not conservative,^M
and that its anti-tax, anti-regulation policies derive from a^M
&quot;Jefferson-Jackson populist liberalism.&quot;   Lind also^M
attacks the obsessive identity politics of the multi-culturalist^M
Left, and he faults New Democrats for promoting free trade and^M
entitlement reform instead of cultivating the FDR/LBJ legacy of^M
labor unions, social insurance and income redistribution, which^M
are the core of his own welfarist politics.  It is a mystery,^M
however, why this former Heritage Foundation fellow  should think^M
conservatives betrayed him by failing to honor these opinions.^M
 That sense of personal betrayal warps everything he has to say^M
about conservatism, and it gives his book its irate and even demented^M
tone.
<P>
Michael Lind is now a staff writer^M
at <I>The New Yorker</I> (edited by the British-born Tina Brown).^M
 HarperCollins (owned by Rupert Murdoch) has just published his^M
first novel, <I>Powertown</I>, a  depiction of greedy, conniving,^M
degraded residents of Washington, D.C.  which helps explain why^M
he might have written <I>Up From Conservatism. </I>The first reviews^M
of the novel should help Lind decide whether his new colleagues^M
in the New York literary world are more fair-minded and generous^M
than the conservatives he thinks let him down.<BR>^M

<title>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</title>

<center><h2>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Thomas DiLorenzo<BR>
(As seen in The Washington Times on August 17, 1996)
</h4></center>
<P>
<DD>	Small business is raising hell as it discovers that some of America's largest nonprofit charities unfairly earn millions of dollars by "hocking their halos."<BR>
<DD>	The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, Arthritis Foundation and others are entering the business world and setting up operations that sell everything from vacation packages to mutual funds.  
Small businesses complain they can't match the deals offered by their tax-exempt business rivals.  They say such practices are "unfair competition."  Some businesses even accuse charities of "ripping off" their products and customers and trading on the charity's good reputation.<BR>
<DD>	A recent news story described how small businesses that sell turbans, hats, scarves and prostheses to female cancer patients have attacked the American Cancer Society (ACS) for distributing a new, mail-order catalogue peddling the same products they sell for a living.  The catalogue sales undercut small business in two ways:  ACS's tax-exempt status allows it to offer the products at a lower price, and its charitable status gives the products an perceived seal of approval.  The ACS is "using its vast reservoir of goodwill and trust to sell products," complains Peggy Childs, proprietor of Designs for Comfort, a Chicago business that is forced to compete with ACS products.<BR>
<DD>	The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) is the most notorious example of a non-profit organization that uses its good name to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of products annually.  AARP sells insurance policies, mutual funds, mail-order pharmaceuticals, auto rental s, auto club memberships, Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and hotel discount packages.  Companies like Scudder Financial Services, Prudential Insurance, American Express, New York Life, JTT Hartford, Amoco, and Bank One provide the products and services.  Then they pay AARP a percentage of their sales in return for the use of the charity's name and reputation.<BR>
<DD>	AARP pays taxes on ad revenue from its Modern Maturity magazine and on income from its money market funds and credit cards.  But its pharmacy, auto club and insurance profits are not taxed, prompting the charges of  "unfair competition."  Business has a good point:  Why should AARP be exempt from taxes when virtually identical companies not affiliated with the non-profit giant must pay taxes to provide the same services?  <BR>
<DD>	Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) aptly summarized this conflict at a 1995 Senate hearing.  It is as if "U.S. Steel decided to rename itself the 'American Association of Steel Enthusiasts,' offered some discounts and rebates to millions of Americans in exchange for a strictly nominal contribution, and then used that incidental association to gain tax-exempt status."<BR>
<DD>	There is evidence, moreover, that AARP members relying on the group's good reputation are buying inferior products. For instance:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Last year, Money magazine evaluated AARP's businesses and concluded that of AARP's ten types of insurance, only its supplemental Medicare insurance deserved high marks; the rest were rated "decent to dreadful."  
<LI>	In 1994, 25 mutual funds did better than AARP's best performer, its Growth and Income fund.
<LI>	And in 1983, 500 San Diego AARP members purchased cellular phones for $209 each from a firm that promised to pay AARP $5 for each phone sold to a member.  But the company went bankrupt, the members did not receive their phones or a refund, and AARP -- with $358 million in revenues that year -- refused to reimburse them, saying it "couldn't afford" the cost.<P>
<BR>
<DD>	Other charities are jumping on the commercial bandwagon.  The American Heart Association sold its "Heart Check Seal of Approval" for $550,000 to the Florida citrus industry.  (Earlier, it abandoned its "HeartGuide Seal" program after the FDA warned the public that some of its claims might be "illegal" and "unproven.")  The American Lung Association endorses home carbon monoxide testing kits for a fee.  The Arthritis Foundation has endorsed Johnson and Johnson products in return for $1 million in annual donations.  And the Skin Cancer Foundation's "Seal of Recommendation" is for sale for $100,000 per year.<BR>
<DD>	The commercialization of non-profit activities is a disturbing trend, because it squanders the organization's most valuable asset, the public's trust.  In the long run, the nonprofit sector is jeopardized.  The mere perception that a charity is hocking its halo -- its good name -- for profit will scare donors away.  They won't contribute to a charity that prefers to sell its services instead.

Traditionally, newspapers have shied away from developing close relationships with the foundation world. Because newspapers and television have long ago taken  the position that outside money is tainted, they'd sooner turn to advertisers for revenues -- even advertisers they don't like -- than apply for a grant.The code of ethics of Sigma Delta Chi (the journalists' professional organization) prohibits accepting "any thing of value" in exchange for covering a story. But lately things have changed. On June 20, 1996 the Pew Charitable Trusts announced grants of  $4.3 million over the next three years to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C. as one component of an enterprise called "Renewing Our Democratic Heart."
Pew is composed of  seven named charitable trusts with different missions, established from 1948 to 1979. One hundred fifteen employees give out $180 million each year, making Pew the nation's third largest foundation. Pew is currently footing the bill for 34 media projects nationwide as part of a movement known as civic journalism (the movement is more commonly called public or community journalism depending on which group is pushing it). Although the names are different, the purpose is the same. However, civic journalism  remains controversial among editors such as Howell Raines of the New York Times and Leonard Downie of the Washington Post chary about outsiders influencing their editorial decisions. Smaller papers seem to have fewer hesitations about taking Pew's money.
And so Pew, with no previous track record in journalism, has suddenly emerged as a major player in the news business. Foundation president Rebecca Rimel proudly declares that thanks to her multi-million dollar expenditure, civic journalism "is becoming the way to do business in many newsrooms across the country." This is happening, in large part, because Pew is paying newspapers, and radio and television stations to cover stories in the way it wants to see them covered.
Pew's $4.3 million commitment is only the most recent development in Pew's onging love affair with the media. Since fall 1993, the foundation has pledged at least $19.7 million to various media enterprises, $10.7 million of it to support civic journalism. In some cases, Pew provides lump sums to newspapers and broadcast outlets so they can conduct opinion polls and convene focus groups. Pew pays newspapers to send reporters out of town and even to rent apartments for reporters to live in selected neighborhoods. The overarching goal of these activities is to use the "extradordinary power" of the media to stimulate the public "to participate in community life," as Rimel puts it. "Civic journalism is one way to engage people in seeking solutions to their local problems."

<h3>THE PEW MEDIA MONOPOLY</h3>
<p>
The Philadelphia-based Pew 
		Charitable Trusts established a 
		Washington, D.C. beachhead for its Pew Center for Civic Journalism in September 1993. The Center's staff of three is run by Walter Cronkite's former CBS News producer, Edward Fouhy. The Center distributes money to news organizations, holds seminars around the country and spreads the gospel of civic journalism to newsrooms across the land [see grants list box on page 4]. Last year, Pew gave Ed Fouhy's group an additional $300,000 over three years to "raise the visibility and stature of civic journalism through an awards and symposium program."
	This spring,  the Pew Center for Civic Journalism awarded prizes of  $25,000 to three newspapers _ The Charlotte Observer, The Kansas City Star and The Argus Leader in South Dakota _ for: "Doing journalism in a manner calculated to re-engage people in the process of public life."  While significantly smaller than a MacArthur "genius" award, the  $25,000 sum is among the more lucrative in the field.
	And when The Times-Mirror Company announced last year it would be forced to shutter its well-respected  Center for the People and Press, Pew donated money to keep the Washington-based polling organization open for three more years, and asked that it be called the Pew Research Center.
 	Pew is bankrolling former Washington Post reporter Paul Taylor's efforts to the tune of $111,864 for a six-month consulting contract, which includes salary, travel expenses and setting up conferences, to convince television networks to give free air time to presidential candidates. Taylor teamed up with Fouhy's old partner, former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite. Together they have successfully convinced Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television network to provide one hour of free airtime this fall. However, while candidate Bob Dole has agreed to participate,  President Clinton has not yet accepted.
       	Both through its Washington Center and directly, the Pew Charitable Trusts have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Radio-Television News Directors Foundation for community journalism projects, to the Citizens Election Project and National Public Radio and to Soundprint Media Center for online civic journalism through the World Wide Web. Pew has provided $3.2 million over three years for the National Arts Journalism program at the University of Georgia, as well. And, as devotees of National Public Radio hear over and over, the Pew Charitable Trusts sponsor the radio network's reporting on culture, the environment and religion. 
	Once a relatively obscure charity, Pew is sending shoots and tendrils everywhere in the world of journalism. "You mean the Pew media monopoly," jokes John Dinges, NPR editorial director. "It's an interesting experiment by a foundation to get into the world of media with some definite ideas for innovation and change."

<a name="Rimel"></a>
<h3>THE RIMEL REVOLUTION</h3>
<p>
Why are the Pew Charitable Trusts so interested in this new and controversial civic journalism movement? The answer lies more with president Rebecca Rimel  than with the nine trustees who ultimately decide how to spend Pew's millions. Rimel, aged 45, is a former emergency room nurse and assistant professor of neurology at the University of Virginia, who has done much to change the direction of a foundation once known for its low profile and conservative leanings. 
	Rimel joined the Philadelphia-based Pew foundation in 1983 as manager of its health program and quickly rose as former Pew president Thomas Langfitt's protege (he is an eminent neurosurgeon) to become vice president, then president in July 1988.  Today she earns $318,213 a year. After an administrative shake-up in which nearly two-thirds of  Pew's permanent staff departed Rimel has concentrated Pew's giving in six major program areas:  culture, education, health and human services, religion, public policy _ and an interdisciplinary grab-bag including the Children's Television Workshop's production of Ghostwriter for PBS, the Center for Community Change's anti-poverty initiatives, the Global Action Plan for the Earth, Inc. and San Francisco's Tides Foundation for the Global Stewardship Initiative. Rimel favors working in partnerships with other foundations, something Pew rarely did before.
	The Pews were an old Philadelphia family whose fortunes derived from the Sun Oil Co. (now Sunoco). Joseph N. and Mary Anderson Pew had four children who set up seven separate trusts between 1948 and 1979 which are jointly administered as the Pew Charitable Trusts. Together they became a major charity, generously handing out money _ mostly to local  Philadelphia organizations which helped the neediest. They didn't call press conferences. The Pew style was to quietly, often anonymously, dole out their largess. Until 1987, there was no listing for the Pew Charitable Trusts in the Philadelphia telephone directory. This was due to a "a very deep religious conviction that one does not need recognition for their good deeds," says Rimel. 
	 It was J. Howard Pew who built the family business into a global enterprise. And he left the strongest imprint on the family trusts created in 1957 to further the free enterprise system. Under his direction, it supported such causes as open markets, lower taxes and less government regulation.When J. Howard Pew died in 1971, the philanthropy began to evolve, while it remained committed to giving in Philadelphia. The board decided in the late 1980s  that  it would seek national attention. Part of that push came from Rimel. 
	"It had been a bit of a mom and pop operation," says Rimel. "We had grown up slowly. We had a very small staff. The board gave me the directive that we want this to be a national foundation with a  local commitment." With assets of $3.8 billion, the trusts give 20 to 30 percent of their annual contributions to Philadelphia arts and human service groups. Pew also supports population control efforts and contributes to national and international organizations organizations to help meet health needs of at-risk women and children. "I guess if you had to put a tag on us," Rimel says, "we are really trying to help a lot of the organizations and institutions we work with recapture the middle ground."
       But a middle of the road approach is not what some observers see. "I call them liberal, " says Althea K. Nagai, a political scientist who has done statistical grant analyses of the Pew foundation.  "Rimel herself is not a conservative. In one piece about her, she says she was a sixties liberal and wanted to recall the spirit of the times. She says she wanted to bring that kind of spirit to the Pew. But looking at the J. Howard Pew charter, you can see that J. Howard was very much against what we would call today traditional liberalism. He was very conservative."  [see Alternatives in Philanthropy, "The Pew Charitable Trusts: Revitalizing 'the spirit of the 60s,'" November, 1995]
	But today Pew has a full-time director of communications. Its offices are housed on two floors of a swank high-rise office building at 2005 Market Street in Philadelphia's financial district. Each year, Pew receives between 5,000 and 6,000 proposals but generally awards only 500 grants, a ratio of one in ten. In 1995, Pew gave 33 grants of $1 million or over. The majority of the grants _ 35 percent _ were in the $200,000 to $499,999 range. Sixty-seven percent of the grants were distributed nationally, while 24 percent were targeted for Philadelphia-based groups and 9 percent were given to international organizations. 
	The Pew board meets in March, June, September and December to review grant proposals, which generally take up to six months to consider before a decision is made.	
       Six program officers gave $162 million in 1995 in the areas of culture (52 grants), education (43 grants), environment (58 grants), religion (26 grants), public policy (12 grants), health and human services (109 grants) and interdisciplinary (74 grants).
       *Marian A. Godfrey is director of the culture program, which supports working artists and says she wants to strengthen the role of arts and culture in Philadelphia and across the country. Pew is the home base for the Council on Foundation's "Grantmakers in the Arts" affinity group, which has championed  "arts advocacy" and funded many  groups supporting the National Endowment for the Arts in its conflicts with Congress over the use of federal funds for profanity, obscenity, blasphemy and anti-American propaganda.
	*Robert B. Schwartz is director of the education program, which funds elementary and high school education. Pew's emphasis on public school reform does not include support for vouchers, which would enable poor parents to enjoy the same freedom of choice already available to the affluent. 
	*Joshua S. Reichert is director of the environment program, which is interested in global warming, global climate change and global pollution prevention rather than challenging doomsday prophets in the manner of Dr. Julian Simon. 
	*Tamar R. Datan is program officer for the Interdisciplinary Fund, which gives money to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism and last year gave $600,000 to the Academy of Teleivsion Arts and Sciences Foundation for a two-year project to educate and train television writers about the negative effects of gratuitous TV violence, a public relations campaign along the lines of the Joyce Foundation's anti-gun efforts [for a parallel case, see vol.1 no.6, "How Does The Joyce Foundation Deal With Dissent? 'Squash It!'"].
	*Paul C. Light is director of Pew's Public Policy program, whose 1995 goals included promoting economic and political freedom abroad. Over the past six years, Pew has spent nearly $40 million in this program area giving more than 100 grants to promote democracy and market reforms in Eastern and Central Europe. 
	*Joel A. Carpenter is director of religion, a program which offers scholarships and has programs designed to make community ministries and religious leaders more effective.

<h3>USING JOURNALISM AS A TOOL</h3>
<p>
One of the ways to improve civic democracy in America, Rimel believes,  is through what Pew calls civic journalism. Rimel doesn't pretend to be a media junkie. She's a self-avowed techno-peasant who grew up on a farm, and admits she'd be lost on the Internet. Pew recently started up a home page (http://www.pew-trusts.org) that Rimel will have to learn to surf. But she believes the press can be a vehicle for reaching out to citizens and getting them to care about their government and community. Rimel is careful to point out that Pew is not interested in running a newspaper or reforming or reviving a failing newspaper. It is interested in supporting "civic journalism experiments."
	Civic journalism is a theory developed by some academics and old-hand journalists such as David Broder who worry about the future of journalism and what they claim to be its growing negative effect on democracy. Some well-known figures such as Carter speechwriter and Clinton appointee James Fallows say the press' growing cyncism has infected their work and therefore poisoned how Americans view the political process.
	"Our foray into civic journalism is really via the back door," Rimel says. "I've never had any particular interest _ didn't see it as our role, still don't _ how journalism goes about its business. Except we do see it as an issue if journalism can be used as a tool, as a way to get the public reconnected, reinvigorated, recommitted to democratic values," she says. "Increasingly, we understand the power of the press. They  are extraordinarily powerful in shaping opinions and giving people information," she explains. 
	"Given that power, any way that the press might play a role in any kind of experiment in journalism to provide that information in a more effective,  efficient, user-friendly way appeals to us," Rimel says. Rimel first heard about civic journalism from former Knight-Ridder chairman  James K. Batten. As head of the country's second-largest newspaper chain, Batten (who died last year) had already pushed public journalism at some of his 32 newspapers, including the Charlotte Observer, which covered the 1992 elections as a major public journalism project.
	Batten met Rimel in January 1993 when he came to Pew seeking money to help rebuild Miami houses destroyed by Hurricane Andrew.  The subject changed into the depressing topic of how alienated American citizens were becoming from their community, their government and each other. Both were eager to find ways to get citizens more deeply involved in the democratic process. By September 1993, Pew had given television journalist Edward M. Fouhy $3.6 million to open the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C.
<p>
<a name="Tides"></a>
<h3>PEW'S WASHINGTON CENTER:  ADMINISTERED BY TIDES</h3>
<p>
Federal law prohibits foundations from donating money to for-profit organizations, such as newspapers.  That's why the Pew Charitable Trusts makes its donations to the Tides Foundation, which in turn funds the Pew Center,which pays the newspapers. Tides handles all the Center's paperwork and medical benefits as well as adminstering the grant from one Pew entity to another. On March 15, 1996 the Tides Foundation staff distributed a memorandum to its board of directors denouncing the "disastrous 1994 elections" and "the urgent need for progressives to reverse the gains made by the radical right."
	On the other hand the Center's Washington director, Edward Fouhy, has solid establishment credentials. Fouhy, 61, had been CBS's Saigon bureau chief during the Vietnam war, personally ran both the CBS News and ABC News Washington bureaus.When Batten spoke glowingly of  Fouhy, Rimel sought out the TV veteran in an effort to focus amorphous talk about the media's role in "reconnecting" citizens into a plan for action. 
	Rimel had been prepared to woo Fouhy with flowers and chocolates. But it wasn't necessary. Fouhy says that he had become disgusted with how turned off the public was to the political process. He told Rimel that he thought the press held some responsibility for that.
	Pew "asked me if I could think of a strategy to deal with this growing sense of alienation which they had already sensed," Fouhy says. "It became pretty obvious that if you were going to do the kind of outreach that I recommended in a strategy paper, that you have to have some kind of base." The Pew Center for Civic Journalism was set up to underwrite media partnerships based on Fouhy's strategic recommendation that it was crucial for money be given to television, radio and newspaper partnerships, since that each medium has a particular strength which could be exploited together.   Typically, television and newspapers or radio rarely share information. But Pew-backed media partners are doing just that, co-operating rather than competing in their news coverage.
	 To help this along, Pew gave $600,000 to the Radio-Television News Directors' Foundation to foster partnerships between electronic and print media. "We have some money that we can give $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 out to projects for focus groups, surveys or town meetings,"  says Eric Swanson, director of the Radio-Television Directors' Foundation,  "Whereas the Pew Center for Civic Journalism has more money and can give out $50,000 to $100,000 grants." Swanson's foundation funded five partnerships in 1995.  "Other than the price tag, we are both up to the same goal which is to get enhanced or greater coverage of issues of concern in communities by structuring partnerships between radio, television and print. The typical makeup has been a partnership with a leading daily, a local commercial TV outlet and local radio _ typically it's public radio."
	Pew gave National Public Radio $290,000 directly for its Voter Project in which five public radio stations, tried to cover the 1994 elections in ways that would stimulate citizen interest. Pew gave the project another $250,000 for 1996. To improve election coverage, the Pew Center gave $835,000 to the 1996 Citizen's Election Project, which is run by Stan Cloud, former Time magazine Washington bureau chief. "To me the interesting thing is Pew has set up an election and civic journalism part of their operation  and they distribute their money in lots of different chunks which are kind of all operating independently," says John Dinges, NPR editorial director.  
	Sometimes too independently, it seems. This has led some to question whether Pew is properly overseeing the use of its money. Take for example, overlap between the NPR election project and Cloud's Citizens Election Project. "The strange thing is that the Citizens Election Project funded a number of my stations independent of the NPR Election Project,"says NPR's Dinges.  "I did the election project in 1994 for the '94 election. During 1995, Stan Cloud came in and funded a number of projects for the same partnerships that I set up the previous year. They did Boston, San Francisco, Seattle. All of which I had set up. Stan's projects were for early '96 to focus on the primaries. But my project continues through the election."
	A good example of duplication, says Dinges, is the Voters' Voice project with New Hampshire public radio and a statewide coalition of the Associated Press.  "We weren't able to give them as much money as Stan did," says Dinges. "It turned out it was not a very well coordinated project. Stan came in in the middle, did his thing and most of the time it worked out all right. But it could have been better. The question I would pursue is the separate funding operations. Pew could have made sure they were coordinated. If Ed Fouhy had run the whole thing it probably would have been smoother."

<h3>OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY</h3>
<p>
One of the tenets of public journalism is that reporters need to learn what people are really thinking about. The view among Washington journalists last fall was that the Republican primary would revolve around which candidate was best qualified to help House Speaker Newt Gingrich advance his "Contract with America,"  says Don MacGillis, who coordinated the Boston Globe's Pew-funded civic journalism election project, "People's Voice."  It was Washington wisdom that people outside the Beltway were eager to have the federal budget balanced and taxes cut.
	"The goals of our project were to find out if these really were the issues of concern to New Hampshire voters and then, whatever those concerns turned out to be, to get the candidates to address them," says MacGillis, who spoke at a Pew Center symposium in Washington, D.C. this spring.  Through Pew-funded polling and focus groups and getting to know the people of Derry, N.H. participants learned  residents feared  losing their jobs (even though the state has an extremely low unemployment rate). MacGillis felt vindicated when a surprised, somewhat befuddled Bob Dole announced: "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last days of this campaign." 
	A bemused MacGillis told guests at the Pew symposium: "If Dole had been reading the People's Voice articles or listening to the radio and TV programs of our partners, he would have known way back in the fall of 1995 that economic insecurity was a major concern, probably the major concern of New Hampshire voters." Of course, Pat Buchanan's campaign efforts helped draw attention to the pocketbook issue without Pew's subsidy.
	Pew's hope is to find a way to re-connect citizens to the election process by encouraging them to participate in candidate forums and advocating that people _ who often are too apathetic to vote _ go to the polls. The point of civic journalism, say those who practice it, is to take back control of election dialogues from political handlers and candidates.
<p>
<a name="Nobody"></a>
<h3>WHAT IF THEY GAVE A FORUM AND NOBODY CAME?</h3>
<p>
Sounds noble. But what if the candidates just don't want to listen or participate in a civic journalism experiment?  It happened to Dave Iverson,  executive producer for "Citizens '96" sponsored by the Pew-supported Voice of the People Iowa Coalition for Wisconsin Public TV, the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison, six different Iowa newspapers, the Iowa AP, Iowa Public Television, Iowa Public Radio and two commercial TV stations. 
	Their goal was to gather an audience to question the nine presidential candidates in a debate before the Iowa caucuses. About 300 Iowans were primed to ask questions. "Just one problem," says Iverson, "the candidates. Now for months we had done the candidate dance. They were in. They were out. They were in. They were out. They told us every possible version of, this looks good, without ever getting final commitments." 
	On the eve of the broadcast, Iverson had promises from five candidates. Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander agreed to participate if Bob Dole appeared.  "About 24 hours before the debate itself, Dole made his final decision _ he had been back and forth about it _ and said he wouldn't do it," Iverson says. "Alexander, Buchanan and Forbes who had all made those "this looks good" noises then backed out." Then Phil Gramm pulled out. Then Dick Lugar withdrew. 
	"So we were left with -- and I bet you remember this trio -- Alan Keyes, Bob Dornan and yes, Morry Taylor," says Iverson. "It wasn't a pretty prospect." Six hours before the broadcast, Lugar decided he'd made a promise to the people of Iowa and he'd come. One of the lessons Iverson shared at the civic journalism symposium in Washington, D.C. was that "no matter how sophisticated a media consortium you build, candidates will still act like candidates and make their own strategic decisions."
<p>
<a name="Threats"></a>
<h3>THREATS TO INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>
Pew is undeterred by failures such as Iverson's Wisconsin debate. It is similarly resistant to criticism from skeptics such as Washington Post editor Leonard Downie, former New York Times executive editor Max Frankel, columnist Maureen Dowd [see "Why is New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd driving the White House crazy?" in Culture Watch, vol.1, no. 2] or editorial page editor Howell Raines. 
	Frankel told this reporter he has read much of the literature on public journalism and still doesn't get it.  "Some of it sounds like old fashioned reporting," says Frankel, "some of it sounds like getting in bed with the promotion department and that's unfortunate. Some of it sounds downright political."
	However, increasing numbers of journalists seem, in Fouhy's words, to "get it," which often gives critics the impression that public or civic journalism is some kind of growing religious-like movement.  It is difficult for some outsiders to grasp because there are few texts and no specific guidelines or concrete definitions of exactly what is a civic journalism project. 
	Some newspaper veterans are uncomfortable with sponsoring events that they have traditionally covered. Nonetheless, newspaper-radio-television partnerships are lining up with their hands extended for Pew Center grants. To date, the Pew Center has doled out $575,000 to 17 newspaper-radio-television partnerships for community-oriented projects in 1996. This year it will also co-sponsor four seminars on civic journalism in locations around the country.
	"The first year was all criticism," says Jan Schaffer, the Pew Center's deputy director and a former Philadelphia Inquirer business editor. "The second year there was a lot of curiosity and people trying it. The third year is, "How exactly do I do this?"  Over the past three years, the Pew Center has provided money for 34 projects in 24 cities involving partnerships among newspapers, television and radio outlets. Recipients include 22 newspapers, 24 television stations and 20 radio stations. Pew grants pay for items that would normally be outside a newsroom's normal operating budget. It is not to be used to buy newsprint or cover a reporter's salary.
	Moreover, the money comes with strings. It may only  be used for such items as polling, an expense many news outlets say they can no longer afford. The pressure for high profits, particularly at corporately-owned newspapers, has forced many newsroom managers to slash budgets to raise revenue. So Pew money fills in the gaps. Pew money is also used to hold town meetings, conduct focus groups to learn what people are thinking about _ and sometimes Pew  pays for the salary of a "newsroom coordinator," who sets up town meetings and functions much like a community organizer.
	This year's Pew grants range in size form $5,000 to $61,000. While large foundations such as Ford, Robert Wood Johnson, Knight and Kaiser have given money to the press, it is often used for seminars, press education or for fellowships to individual reporters. It is rarely given directly to newspapers or commercial electronic outlets. For example, Harvard's Nieman fellowships are given to reporters, not to the newspaper. They are stipends which replace salaries while reporters conduct their studies.
	These sorts of grants can generate controversy themselves. Two years ago a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to NBC for a two-hour televised discussion on health reform aroused criticism from other members of the media _ even though that foundation, like the Pew trusts, claimed it had exercised no editorial control. "For foundations to give grants to commercial newspapers to carry out tasks or information gathering would be very unusual," says Waldemar Nielsen, a noted author on the activities of foundations and columnist for the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
	A thirteen-member advisory board, made up mostly of journalists (many of them Fouhy's friends), decides how Pew's money should be spent. Money goes only to media partnerships _ as opposed to a single news outlet _ for projects that carry out a civic journalism project. The goal is to reach consensus about a problem and its solution.  Funds cannot  be used merely for research. Eligible  media projects might focus on education, transportation or neighborhood safety. Members of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism advisory board, made up largely of journalists, approve the topics. "I don't have any relationship with the Pew Board," says Fouhy. "If they walked in the door, I wouldn't recognize them. I've never met them. They don't know who we fund until we let them know. Independence is one of the tenets of this whole thing. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have that independence."
	Pew grantmakers hope their money will be used to start an experiment  which media outlets will continue. "A lot of papers are going to be increasingly saying:  'We ought not to take money,' " says University of Maryland journalism professor Hodding Carter III, a member of the advisory board. "Pew is not in the business of subsidizing newspapers. We are in the business of encouraging the idea" of civic journalism.
	But Roberto Suro, deputy national editor of the Washington Post,  has taken the role of resident skeptic on the Pew advisory board. Suro is concerned about the threats to the independence and integrity of reporters dependent upon Pew-funded coordinators. 
	For example, Charlene Price-Patterson handled logistics for public journalism events sponsored by the Charlotte Observer, WSOC-TV and two radio stations. Price-Patterson only worked temporarily at the paper.  She is not a reporter but a community activist. Although technically she did not work for Pew, her Observer salary did not go towards traditional news-gathering activities. Price-Patterson arranged child care, refreshments and transportation and spent some time "knocking on doors to publicize the event," she wrote in the Pew Center's newsletter.

<h3>"WE MAKE PLENTY OF MONEY"</h3>
<p>
Some journalists by nature prefer to think of themselves as lone cowboys who have the skills to go in and rope their own cattle. They don't need to hire someone else to do the job, many would say. "If I was a newspaper editor," says Suro, "I would not feel comfortable having someone in that position and particularly not in the newsroom." Price-Patterson's desk was located in the newsroom.
	Jim Walser coordinated the Observer's "Taking Back Our Neighborhoods" project which won last year's $25,000 James K. Batten  award. He says some reporters did feel uneasy about having a coordinator in the newsroom. "But from the standpoint of the editors, it worked well," he adds. "Charlene wasn't putting stories in the newspaper. She was giving us information. She knew a hell of a lot more people in the neighborhoods than any of our neighborhood reporters."
	Last year, former Philadelphia Inquirer associate editor Fran Dauth was in the market for a new job. One of the many newspapers that was interested in hiring her was the San Francisco Chronicle. In talking with Chronicle managing editor Dan Rosenheim, she asked if his paper had taken any Pew money. He told her it had for an election project. Dauth questioned why the Chronicle didn't use its own money to pay for reporting. Rosenheim cited budget constraints, although the paper was making a profit.
	"I don't know any particular evil about taking money from Pew," Dauth says.  Now an editor with New Jersey's Newark Star Ledger, she adds, "But it seems to go against the training of what we do. The newspapers are taking money from an outside source. The outside source says, "You can have this money if you do this kind of story." It also seems to me once you become dependent on an outside source to finance the project, you give up independence."
	Witness the Philadelphia Inquirer, a prestigious Knight-Ridder newspaper with a slew of Pulitzer prizes. Last year, the Inquirer found itself at the center of a media flap when it hired urban expert Neil Peirce for an editorial board project on regionalism. The Inquirer paid for the project. But Peirce had received money for expenses indirectly from the New Era Foundation. When the Wall Street Journal reported New Era was an elaborate Ponzi scheme which had ensnared dozens of charities, the Inquirer was tarred.  
	Ironically, the Inquirer had earlier applied to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism, but had been turned down. However, the paper was invited to resubmit its application after making a few changes. 
	But Inquirer Editor Maxwell E. P. King says the paper has since decided it should not take foundation money and did not reapply.  "At this point," says King, "I'd be very, very reluctant to take any funding from any foundation for a journalism project because I'd worry whether that would impinge on the independence of the newspaper. Besides, we make plenty of money. We can fund our own journalism."

<h3>MONEY AS GUILT, PHILANTHROPY AS THERAPY, AND THE LEGACY OF WEALTH</h3>
<p>
<I>by Robert Huberty</I>
<p>
	<I>The Legacy of Inherited Wealth: Interviews With Heirs</I>, edited by Barbara Blouin with Katherine Gibson and Margaret Kiersted (Trio Press, 1995, paperback, 185 pages, $14.95.  Available from The Inheritance Project, Inc., 3291 Deer Run Rd., Blacksburg, VA 24060, 540/552-8436.<P>

	Karl Marx thought capitalism would make workers so miserable and angry that they would develop a class consciousness, rise up in revolution, and overthrow their oppressors.  Marx's social theory, which disastrously misled politicians and intellectuals for a century, failed in a number of ways.  It did not forsee the astonishing productivity of the free market.  It cannot account for the enormous middle class of producers and consumers that Western society has created.  Finally, it did not anticipate that successful capitalists would apparently make their own children so miserable and angry that they would throw away their opportunities, seek therapy, and they (not the workers) would use their inherited wealth to create the collectivist society Marx wanted. 
	The editors of this volume have identified such people.  The children of the very rich are much envied but little studied. Unlike most citizens in a modern competitive marketplace, they are not compelled to make enough money to acquire goods.  Like the poor, they have been left out of our wealth-producing system.  But while the problems of poor people occasion much public policy debate, no one pays much attention to those who inherit so much money that working is purely a matter of personal choice.  The editors, themselves heirs and founders in 1992 of a group called The Inheritance Project, Inc., have remedied this neglect by interviewing seventeen adult heirs.  The Legacy of Inherited Wealth records their stories.  In their own words, they tell us what it's like to grow up rich. 
	Now for those of  us who didn't grow up rich, it is tempting to report gleefully that most heirs, as recorded in these narratives, seem pathetically unhappy.  Gifted novelists of manners have written many stories about lives like theirs, often with comic irony or as satires.  But these first person accounts of messy and misspent lives deserve sympathy.  The stories perceptively weave sad self-descriptions with compelling sagas of family life over several generations.  (The editors, who hold advanced degrees in literature, have no doubt helped here.)  One cannot help but feel pity for sons and daughters raised to be so financially secure, yet so emotionally lost and economically ignorant. 
	The legacy of inherited wealth described here is not one of personal pride in family accomplishments.  Instead, it is one of acute psychological distress over not knowing how to handle amounts of money that others can only dream of.  Confusion, self-pity and guilt permeate the tales of these heirs who have intense memories of their families, but who often seem to enjoy no personal ties to them.  The heirs' stories show how deeply affected they are by the strong wills and striking personalities of their parents and grandparents, but they describe their own lives as drifting and listless.  As each tells his own story, certain common patterns emerge.
	*Money is a crutch:  David Bowman wants a serious and creative career, but he notes how easily he falls back on the privileges of his wealth when the demands of his projects become too stressful.
	*Money is a puzzle:  Rebecca Hutchins receives regular dividends from her grandfather's trust.  She is bored and confused by financial advice and is ashamed to admit it.  But trying to actively manage her wealth would require that she overcome her passivity and deal with her difficult family.
	*Money is a trap: Rachel Halpern was taught the work ethic by her parents.  She thinks she should be paid for her work and treated no differently from her co-workers.  But she feels guilty demanding a wage from a hard-pressed employer when her trusts are worth $<br>6 million.  
	*Money is a threat:  Fred Hopgood is afraid that others will take advantage of his money.  His friendships and marriage end because of his suspicions.
	*Money is a double-edged weapon:  Several heirs choose marriage partners to spite their families and repudiate their privileged upbringing.  But then they resent writing checks to support their poor, unfashionable or reckless spouses.
	The founders of The Inheritance Project have encouraged heirs to tell their stories for reasons they provide in a project brochure.  They think that by talking about the impact of inherited wealth on their lives, heirs will "break the isolation and challenge the taboos surrounding wealth."  Heirs will also learn how others have "claimed their personal power and used it to benefit others."  And they will become familiar with "networking and educational resources to heirs and professionals who work with them."
	The Inheritance Project at first appears to be some sort of recovery group, albeit one serving a very exclusive clientele.  Heirs are invited to set up confidential appointments to share their feelings and experiences with a sympathetic listener.  But some aspects of it (evident in lists of workshops, contacts, and publications) suggest that the Project encourages yet another bizarre form of postmodern identity politics.  It is intimated that heirs _ the term "heiress," I suspect, is inadmissable _ will discover their common victimization, become empowered to reclaim their identities, and will work to overcome the forces that oppress them and separate them from others.  
	Several heirs explain in their interviews that they are doing just that.  Wendy Johnson reports that she no longer feels guilty about her wealth.  She has sold the defense stocks in her $1 million investment portfolio and invested her daughter's trust in Working Assets Mutual Funds, which screens out companies that are not socially responsible.  Chuck Collins has given away his inheritance and attends "wealth conferences" organized by the Haymarket People's Fund which is committed to funding "change, not charity."  (Collins' work with community housing loan funds and land trusts has taught him that the home mortgage interest deduction is a "mansion subsidy" for the rich.)  Deborah Frank contributes her income from seven irrevocable trusts to grassroots community development groups.  "With one stroke, I am able to help support community development and get even with my parents, too."
	But this poses a problem, in that it discourages heirs from becoming true philanthropists and helping others to escape poverty. Heirs who think they are not really entitled to their families' fortunes are not likely to support philanthropies that offer the poor the means to acquire wealth.  After all, if wealth only creates unearned privilege, then there is no nobility in encouraging others to pursue it.  Heirs who contribute instead to causes that prevent the accumulation of wealth will overcome the conditions that leave them feeling guilty.  The resulting condition leaves everyone poorer. Karl Marx, call your psychiatrist!

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>
	Regarding your recent essay about the Joyce Foundation [vol. 1, no.6, July, 1996], there are several factual errors in the few paragraphs relating to the Joyce-funded project in Indiana. As a journalist for the past 19 years, I have always found it useful to actually interview the people I write about -- no one called me. Most notably, you criticize the Indianpolis Star over its excellent series of stories about the role of money in the state legislature, "Of course, the story paid scant attention to the interests of foundations or the power of their money."
	Such a comment is flat-out wrong. The Indianapolis Star coverage disclosed and credited both the Joyce Foundation support and the Center for Public Integrity for creating a 19,000-document database from 1994 campaign records chronicling contributions to Republicans and Democrats, from individuals, labor unions, law firms, etc. If someone contributed money to the process, it was recorded at the state election commission, in the Center database, in the Indianapolis Star, and elsewhere. As you know, philanthropic foundations do not make political contributions.	
	The work in Indianapolis is a spectacular, unprecedented example of vital information about our democracy being made availabe to the public. Legislators in Indiana and other states use taxpayer money to buy themselves laptop computers, but keep information about who is bankrolling their political campaigns on less accessible "paper" records physically kept in a single location in the state.
	The project is nonpartisan, non-ideological and about something every American today supports: free and open public discourse and disclosure about our political process. Today, the citizens of Indiana know more about who funds their state legislature than they ever have. Humbly stated, we think that is important.
<p>Charles Lewis <br>
Executive Director<br>
The Center for Public Integrity<br>
Washington, DC<br>
<p>
<p>
	We did not call Charles Lewis because we had already talked to  him in person on April 14, 1996 at the Council on Foundations meeting in Atlanta after he presented the results of  the Center for Public Integrity's  "Statehouse Sellout" project -- on a panel which did not contain a single conservative or Republican representative [for more on the conference, see vol.1, no. 5, "The Council on Foundations Message To America: The Era Of Lady Bountiful Is Over"].
	Our account of the Center for Public Integrity's activies in Indiana is accurate. In fact, Lewis now confirms that his series ignored political activities of foundations such as Joyce, using the legal prohibition on philanthropic campaign contributions as a rationale. That is a legalism that has nothing to do with the question of  integrity with which his organization purports to be concerned. Many foundations classify political activities as "educational" or "outreach" in order to get around such strictures. 
	Lewis's claims to non-ideological  nonpartisanship are similarly suspect. The advisory board of the Center for Public Integrity on his letterhead lists Mother Jones contributor Molly Ivins, Carter administration State Department spokesman Hodding Carter, and Kennedy administration aide Arthur Schle-singer, Jr. on a clearly pro-liberal Democrat roster of names.
	We raised this issue of bias to Lewis in the specific case of ties between Minister Louis Farrakhan, his affiliated organizations and individuals, and the Democrats.  When we personally spoke with Lewis in Atlanta we had asked: Had his organization ever published a single investigation of ties between the Nation of Islam and the Democrats? His reply was negative. When will you do so?, we pressed. "You'll have to read our magazine," he said. We are still waiting.

<h2>Federal Funding for the CPB Is Neither Necessary Nor Deserved</h2>
<i>March 6, 1996</i>
<P>
WASHINGTON - When the 104th Congress cut federal payments to the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1995, funding pledges to
CPB-funded stations increased 12.9 percent in a single month,
and total dollars pledged grew by 15.3 percent This rise in private
donations is one of two major reasons why taxpayer dollars should
no longer be used to support the CPB.
<P>
&quot;Events have shown that public broadcasting has other sources
of revenue which, if properly utilized, can more than make up
for the small fraction of the budget provided by the federal government
through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,&quot; said Laurence
Jarvik, Ph.D., <A HREF="/crc/fw">Foundation Watch</A> editor and
cultural studies fellow at Capital Research Center. <I>Foundation
Watch</I><B> </B>monitors the activities of philanthropic foundations
such as those which support the CPB and its affiliates.
<P>
In <A HREF="#testimony">testimony</A> Wednesday before the House
Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, Jarvik cited facts and figures proving private
donations to public broadcasting entities around the country can
more than make up for cuts in federal funding. For instance, Santa
Monica, California's National Public Radio (NPR) station, KCRW,
raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge drive, a 26 percent
rise over the previous year.
<P>
Not only does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting need no
taxpayer dollars to fund its operations, Jarvik said it doesn't
deserve them either. He listed nine examples of politically-biased
decisions from the CPB, the Public Broadcasting System and NPR,
including the rejection of Christian Coalition Executive Director
Ralph Reed's request to reply to NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru's
declaration that some basic evangelical Christian beliefs are
&quot;crap&quot; and that he hoped four million believers would
be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its
own failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting
system, maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity or guarantee
its managerial competence,&quot; Jarvik said.
<P>
Jarvik has testified before this congressional committee in the
past, and has edited three books concerning the federal government's
role in the arts: &quot;The National Endowments: A Critical Symposium&quot;;
&quot;Public Broadcasting and the Public Trust&quot;; and &quot;Masterpiece
Theatre and the Politics of Quality.&quot; He earned his doctorate
and master of fine arts in film and television from UCLA, where
he was Hugh Downs Fellow and winner of the Distinguished Scholar
Award.

<P>

Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting
me to testify today regarding the appropriation for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1999. I am Cultural
Studies Fellow at the Capital Research Center and editor of <I>Foundation
Watch</I>, a newsletter which covers the activities of philanthropic
foundations such as those which support PBS and NPR.
<P>
Last year, when I testified before this subcommittee, the Speaker
of the House had just announced that in order to help balance
the budget and reduce the federal deficit, he would &quot;zero
out&quot; the federal subsidy for public broadcasting because
it was an unnecessary Federal expenditure. The Speaker was right
then, and his statement has withstood the test of time. Events
have shown that public broadcasting has other sources of revenue
which, if properly utilized, can more than make up for the small
fraction of the budget provided by the Federal government through
the CPB. According to &quot;MediaNomics,&quot; (a publication
of Brent Bozell's Media Research Center) an analysis by editor
Tim Lamer of PBS's reported fundraising totals reveals that after
Congress cut the federal payment to PBS last year, overall revenues
to local stations from private donors <I>increased substantially</I>
more than making up for the reduction in federal spending, at
no cost to the American taxpayer.
<P>
According to Lamer, for example, Santa Monica California's NPR
station, KCRW, raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge
drive, a 26 percent rise over the previous year. Arkansas Educational
Television surpasssed its $350,000 fundraising goal while reducing
pledge breaks by 10 percent. KRMA, in Denver, Colorado, reported
a 13 percent uptick, and WETA in Washington, DC announced 62 percent
of a $1 million drive came <I>from new members</I>. KCET, Los
Angeles released a figure of $1.68 million, some $205,000 more
than in 1994. Overall, March 1995 pledges were 12.9 percent higher
than in 1994, and total dollars pledged were up by 15.3 percent.
Lamer notes private foundations also increased their contributions.
In 1994 Chicago's MacArthur Foundation gave $1,295,470. Last year
it provided $4,139,700. The Mott Foundation gave $590,000 in 1994,
$935,000 in 1995. The Pew Charitable Trusts increased its contribution
level from $2,740,000 in 1994 to $3,896,000 in 1995.
<P>
And successful private fundraising continues. Just this week,
for example, Channel 26 reported some $177,820 in pledges, including
over $35,000 from an airing of a Peter, Paul, and Mary concert
film, and what the <I>Washington Post</I> called an &quot;astounding&quot;
$94,389 from a one-night-only &quot;Les Miserables in Concert.&quot;
In New York, the same program netted $400,000 in only 3 1/2 hours.
PBS has been proud to announce a number of lucrative business
deals, most notably as $75 million agreement with <I>Reader's
Digest</I> to produce new programs for the network.
<P>
PBS program producers have also managed to make a number of new
deals, with Children's Television Workshop (CTW), producers of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, announcing the start of a children's cable
channel, for example. One might remind the subcommittee that Children's
Television Workshop continues its lucrative licensing, merchandising,
and other fundraising endeavors which result in gross sales of
almost a billion dollars a year in related merchandise, and gross
revenues to CTW of approximately $100 million annually.
<P>
Despite recent revelations about Chinese human rights violations
by activists such as Harry Wu whom I was honored to meet at a
Progress and Freedom Foundation reception &quot;Sesame Street&quot;
products can be found today on the shelves clearly marked &quot;Made
In China.&quot; China still bans political dissent, persecutes
Christians, forces women to have abortions, and operates orphanages
which are unhealthy for children. And, as AFL-CIO spokeswoman
Chyrol Graeve has noted, &quot;toy workers are paid less than
a dollar an hour.&quot; More than 250 Asian toy workers have lost
their lives in the past two years as the result of fires and other
industrial accidents. Nevertheless, Children's Television Workshop
continues to pay its top executives six figure salaries while
licensing to toy companies who manufacture in Asia. It is highly
questionable whether a reasonable case can be made that enterprises
with such manifest insensitivity to human rights violations deserve
continued federal subsidy at any level.
<P>
There can be no doubt that had Congress followed through on the
original privatization plan endorsed at the time by the entire
Congressional leadership including Appropriations Committee Chairman
Livingston and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler and
still evident in the public positions taken by the Dole and Buchanan
campaigns, for example public broadcasting might have been fully
self-sufficient today. We would not need to be spending time discussing
appropriation levels for 1999, some three years hence, for an
entity which has not been reauthorized.
<P>
In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its own
failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting system,
maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity, or guarantee its
managerial competence. CPB's record was called &quot;contempt
of Congress&quot; in an issue of <I>Comint: A Journal About Public
Media</I> last year. Nothing has transpired to change that evaluation.
Certainly, CPB does not deserve any sort of &quot;trust fund&quot;
because it has lost its right to the public trust through its
own mismanagement.
<P>
Evidence of CPB's failure to exercise effective oversight of the
public broadcasting system has been widely reported over the last
year. Some examples of problems which CPB has failed to resolve
are:
<UL>
<LI>As I reported in the <A HREF="/crc/fw/fw-v1n1.html">premiere issue of Foundation Watch</A>,
(February, 1996) PBS's so-called &quot;Democracy Project&quot;
has been more like the Democrat project. I could not get the name
of a single Republican staffer in a decision-making job dealing
with coverage of the 1996 election at PBS from the director of
the project, who happens to be the wife of a Clinton political
appointee in the State Department. In what seems like deliberate
challenge to even the appearance of balance and objectivity as
required by law, PBS's new director of communications is the former
political director for the Clinton White House. Incredibly, PBS
does not feel the slightest obligation for even a token Republican
executive in the programming department.
<LI>PBS's so-called &quot;National Issues Convention&quot; was
rife with the appearance of conflict-of-interest and misrepresentation
of its goals and methods. Misleading at best in its claim to be
a &quot;deliberative poll&quot; former CBS polling chief Warren
Mitofsky declared it &quot;was not deliberative and not a poll&quot;
false and deceptive at worst, PBS had sponsored a &quot;pseudo-event&quot;
which wasted some $4 million dollars, approximately half of which
is reportedly straight from the PBS budget. PBS also provided
some nine hours of valuable airtime which could have produced
additional revenue streams to the network.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>The Children of Table 34</I>, a documentary
produced in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.frc.org">Family Research Council</A>
(FRC), about the controversy over the use of underage children
for sex research by Dr. Kinsey. The story was reported in <I>The
Washington Post </I>Style section. But PBS declined to help the
Family Research Council to bring this case before the American
public. Yet, as Robert Knight, director of Cultural Studies for
the FRC points out, PBS stations repeated <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a program many found highly offensive for its use of profanity,
glamorization of drug use, and sexual promiscuity.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>Covering Cuba</I>, and independent film by
Augustin Blazquez, which detailed the mainstream media's infatuation
with Fidel Castro since 1959. He first offered his picture in
October, 1995 and Blazquez volunteered to re-edit the film to
meet PBS standards. Despite numerous pro-Castro films on PBS,
and an obvious need for balance in this regard, Blazquez was not
given a chance to air his picture on PBS. Ironically, only a few
weeks ago, Castro's planes shot down American citizens in an incident
which confirmed Blazquez's depiction of the Cuban dictator and
his policies.
<LI>PBS has still not aired an episode of <I>The American Experience</I>
to correct &quot;Holocaust revisionism&quot; in <I>Liberators:
Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II.</I> Congressman Laughlin
of Texas has delivered a speech denouncing this hoax on the House
floor. Colonel James Moncrief, Jr. the senior surviving officer
of the Sixth Armored Division which actually liberated Buchenwald
presented written testimony to the authorizing subcommittee asking
that PBS correct the historical record. I personally met with
Congressman Joel Hefley of Colorado and Col. Moncrief right here
in the Rayburn Building to discuss this problem. Colonel Moncrief
has written numerous letters to PBS and CPB, yet the network still
refuses to air a documentary about the actual liberators of the
Nazi camps. If I could find them and I introduced Col. Moncrief
to a senior staffer on Senator Pressler's Commerce Committee as
well so could PBS. CPB has done nothing whatever in this case,
despite its legal obligation to insure the excellence and integrity
of public broadcasting, and the offer of Col. Moncrief's help.
<LI><I>Frontline</I> has aired a number of troubling documentaries
in the past year, including a show about the Speaker of the House
which included gratuitous footage of a heckler making offensive
and possibly obscene remarks about allegations of sexual indiscretions;
another program about killings at an abortion clinic in which
four-letter words were used without being bleeped, and in relation
to which a number of women came forward to allege (in a story
reported by Peter Steinfels in the <I>New York Times</I>) that
their point-of-view had been omitted by the producers as a symptom
of anti-Catholic bias; and a third program this year, about campaign
contributions, which was so unbalanced that even liberal columnist
David Broder condemned it in <I>The Washington Post </I>for presenting
a distorted portrayal of both the Clinton administration and Congress.
Neither CPB nor PBS have announced any balancing programming for
any of these cases.
</UL>

<P>
At NPR, the situation has not been any better. Some examples give
evidence of CPB failure to provide reasonable oversight:
<UL>
<LI>NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru declared that some basic
evangelical Christian beliefs were &quot;crap&quot; and that he
hoped four million believers would be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
Although after protests, did NPR issue a lame apology, Christian
Coalition executive director Ralph Reed's request for two minutes
of NPR airtime to reply to the attack was flatly refused. No editors
or executives have been publicly disciplined for permitting the
commentary on the air.
</UL>

<P>
In a letter dated February 27, 1996, Rev. Donald Wildmon of the
American Family Association wrote that &quot;it is absurd for
the government to be in the public broadcasting business...There
are more than 1300 Christian broadcasters in America. Our government
will not give them one penny. But we readily give those billions
to PBS, NPR and CPB. This is nothing more than censorship by the
government, to fund one perspective and not another...It is time
for PBS, NPR, and CPB to get off the government welfare dole and
get out and raise their money like other broadcasters do.&quot;
<UL>
<LI>NPR has not yet asked for a refund of commentary fees paid
to convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal for his <I>Live from Death
Row</I>, the book based on these un-aired programs (because of
protests from critics such as Senator Dole) which is being sold
commercially.
<LI>NPR stations recently broadcast &quot;Blacklisted&quot; at
a cost of $160,00, half of which was paid by CPB itself. The three-part
series was produced by the son of screenwriter Gordon Kahn, and
portrayed his father as &quot;unjustly persecuted,&quot; by anti-Communists,
as Accuracy in Media's Reed Irvine notes, in &quot;an extreme
form of the sanitized obituary.&quot; Irvine points out that Kahn,
as a Communist Party member, was &quot;part of Stalin's secret
team in Hollywood...no more decent and honest than Hitler's favorite
movie maker, Leni Riefenstahl.&quot; According to Irvine, &quot;Communists
were trying to impose upon America and the world a system that
was at least as evil, oppressive and dangerous as the Nazism we
fought a war to defeat and destroy.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
&quot;Kahn and his comrades failed to bring about the triumph
of Communism,&quot; says Irvine. &quot;It is not they, but those
who worked to stop them that NPR should honor.&quot; As of this
date, I am not aware of any three-hour NPR series presenting Reed
Irvine's point of view, or honoring anti-Communists in Hollywood
such as former President Ronald Reagan.
<P>
Unfortunately, time does not permit mentioning all the outstanding
problems in public broadcasting. Let me just conclude with the
scandal reported in the <I>Washington Post</I> recently, where
an innocent member of the CPB board of directors who had been
concerned with questions of financial mismanagement found herself
smeared as a sex harasser after confidential personnel documents
were leaked to reporters. CPB spent an estimated $20,000 on lawyers
&quot;investigating&quot; this matter, yet never managed to get
around to asking the alleged perpetrator what had happened, nor
giving that person the right to self defense.
<P>
Yet CPB has never managed to explain precisely how the documents
got to the press, nor how management could justify the expenditure
of tax dollars <I>when no formal complaint of sexual harassment
had ever been filed. </I>This widely reported case is evidence
that there is something very wrong in public broadcasting, sufficiently
wrong that even thinking about funding for the year 1999 should
simply be postponed pending the outcome of an investigation into
how CPB treats such questions as allegations of sexual harassment,
and what efforts are made to preserve the privacy of personnel
files.
<P>
In addition, articles in the <I>Sunday Times of London</I> contained
allegations attributed to CPB officials which were later found
to be without a basis in fact against the First Lady. As of this
date, I have not been able to find out who made the charges, which
were characterized at the time by CPB board member Victor Gold
as part of a &quot;smear.&quot; Insofar as CPB is required to
maintain the integrity of news and current affairs programming
for PBS, NPR, and Pacifica, CPB should determine who was behind
this &quot;smear,&quot; and invoke appropriate sanctions. If CPB
will not do this, Congress has an obligation to investigate this
matter, which is a serious blemish on the character and trustworthiness
of public broadcasting.
<P>
Until such basic questions as those above have been fully answered
by CPB, it certainly should not receive any advanced appropriation.
There are two years for CPB to resolve these concerns by 1998,
when appropriations for 1999 are to be determined by Congress.
The intervening period should be used by Congress to fully exercise
its oversight responsibilities. I remain confident any reasonable
review will conclude that continued federal funding for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting is unnecessary, unwise, and contrary to
the best interests of the American public and public broadcasting
itself.

<CENTER><H2>If They Only Knew Then What We Know Now About the AARP</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>by Terrence Scanlon</CENTER>
<CENTER>President, Capital Research Center</H3><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
 When my parents joined the American Association of Retired Persons,
they thought like many seniors that they were getting affordable
supplemental health insurance, manageable credit card interest
rates and an attractive magazine.  But there is much more to the
AARP than most of its members know.  The AARP is a taxpayer-funded
lobbyist that actively promotes bigger government and, ultimately,
more spending on itself.<BR>
<P>
 The federal government uses tax-exempt, non-profit organizations
like AARP to run the thousands of programs that make up the welfare
state.  These groups receive, on average, about half their funding
from Uncle Sam.  These subsidies give them the clout to form a
&quot;shadow government&quot; inside the Washington Beltway to
lobby incessantly for more welfare programs, more regulation and
higher taxes.  AARP promotes rent control laws, raising the minimum
wage and increa sing the gasoline tax.  All these programs make
seniors more dependent on government.<BR>
<P>
 The AARP, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC) and
dozens of lesser-known organizations that make up the seniors
lobby have become expert at using the elderly to build their own
power.<BR>
<P>
 For instance, in 1992 the federal government gave the AARP $86
million for senior employment and tax preparation programs.  Additionally,
because the AARP is a tax-exempt, non-profit organization, you
and I worked to make up the difference on the taxes the AARP did
not pay on the $191 million it earned in 1993 by selling insurance,
pharmaceuticals and auto-club services.  <BR>
<P>
 Another big recipient of federal funds is the National Council
of Senior Citizens (NCSC). In 1993, it received 96 percent of
its $76-million budget ($73 million) from the federal government.
 While this money can't legally be used for lobbying, taxpayers
still indirectly finance AARP and NCSC lobbying.  Money is &quot;fungible,&quot;
which is another way of saying that government dollars free-up
other dollars for lobbying.<BR>
<P>
 Recently, these two organizations raised their taxpayer-funded
voices loud enough to drown out reports on the coming bankruptcy
of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  These are the three
federal programs on which the elderly rely most.  Trustees of
these programs report that America's aging population will spend
the money in their coffers faster than the smaller, working-age
population can re-fill them.  That leaves America with two alternatives
-- reduce benefits for the retired or increase taxes on workers.
<BR>
<P>
 If we raise taxes, the cost of Social Security and Medicare by
2040 will eat up an economy-busting 35-55 percent of every worker's
paycheck.  The 104th Congress decided instead to slow the rise
in Medicare benefits, proposing an increase from $4,800 per patient
in 1995 to $6,500 in 2001.  But AARP and NCSC shouted down this
attempt at true reform with bogus charges of &quot;cutting&quot;
benefits for enrollees.<BR>
<P>
 In its new book, <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age
Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U>, Capital Research Center documents
how the seniors lobby promotes costly and inefficient government
programs, mandates and regulations while securing tax dollars
for itself.  Author Thomas diLorenzo alerts seniors that such
programs are bankrupting our country and jeopardizing their grandchildren's
futures without increasing their own security and independence.
<BR>
<P>
 The special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied to failed
welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.  Americans,
young and old, need to know what they are doing.  <U>Frightening
America's Elderly</U> is the first step toward opening our eyes.
 I wish my parents had known then what I know now.<BR>

<center><H3>Preface<br>
by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)</H3></center>
<P>
<P>
<P>        Imagine for a moment a thriving business enterprise, pulling in annual revenues of hundreds 
of millions of dollars.  Imagine, too, that through a quirk in the law, this business pays none of the 
income taxes to which its competitors are subjected.  Exorbitant salaries and benefits are paid from 
this huge tax-free income, and employees work in splendor in an enormous palace complete with 
marble floors and every possible manner of technological luxury.
<P>        Let us also imagine that this business has also succeeded in becoming the most powerful 
lobbying force in Washington, completely dwarfing and dominating some of the more publicized 
groups such as the NRA, the NEA, or the Christian Coalition.  The surest measure of its success is 
the amount of federal spending which its lobbying has succeeded in persuading Washington to 
spend on its clients--in this case, the business's millions of loyal customers.  Year upon year, 
without exception, the largest increases in federal spending are awarded to those in the group, even 
to the point where the projections are that every penny of federal tax revenue will be awarded to 
them in the early 21st century.
<P>        Imagine as well that most of the customers of the business have little or no idea of what it is 
up to.  Suppose that many of the customers believe in limited government, and firmly and 
repeatedly say that they oppose continued escalations in tax rates.  Suppose that the executives 
controlling the business are aware that many of their customers either do not favor the huge 
escalation in federal spending which they are advocating, or are unaware of it.  Nonetheless, this 
influential business informs officeholders in the national government that failure to continue to 
increase spending in this manner will draw the united electoral wrath of the customers--33,000,000 
strong.
<P>        Now suppose that this business is favored each year with tens of millions of dollars in direct 
grants from the federal government.  The American taxpayer thus pays directly for the services 
purchased by the grants, activities which serve to spread the good name and reputation of our 
"hypothetical" business.
<P>        Ah, but--incredible though it may seem, there is such a business--the American Association 
of Retired Persons.  Only recently have many Americans come to understand what this group is 
really all about.  I have often referred to them as 33,000,000 people bound together by a common 
love of airline discounts--and insurance discounts--and pharmacy discounts.  Because, in my view, 
that is exactly who their members are--common, thoughtful, patriotic people who know a "pretty 
good deal" when they see one, and yet have no desire whatsoever to bankrupt the government, the 
nation, and their grandkids.
<P>        While I was serving on the President's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax 
Reform, I was intrigued and perplexed by the testimony that the AARP presented before the 
Commission.  We showed the AARP representatives the clear and irrefutable data revealing that the 
federal government was headed towards extremities of debt, driven almost wholly by growth in 
spending on the AARP's membership (i.e., senior citizens.)  We sought the counsel of the AARP 
about just how to avoid the certainty of national ruin that resided in maintaining the status quo.  
They didn't bat an eye.  They not only defended every single penny of projected federal spending 
increases, but presented more demands for an additional trillion dollars in spending above that.  
They could just as easily have said, "Let them eat cake."
<P>        Mystified by the willful irresponsibility of this
organization, I determined to learn more about who they were and what was driving their activities. 
<P> I was intrigued to learn that most of the AARP's money did not come in the form of dues from the 
people it claimed to represent, hut rather from an enormous tax-free business empire.  I was 
absolutely flabbergasted to find that the federal government had given $86,000,000 in grants to this 
political behemoth in just the past year.
<P>        When I became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, I 
began to hold hearings into the nature of this beast.  A story began to unravel, of a complexity 
which I could not possibly track.  I had no special investigative staff and quickly found that there 
was no simple answer to the question, "What is the AARP?"
<P>        When asking about how it was founded and funded, we learned that its origin lay with a 
man who once had been stripped of his license to sell insurance and had hit upon this ingenious 
method of running an awesome insurance empire tax-free.  When asking about how AARP became 
hooked up with Prudential Insurance, we found that the precipitating event was a lawsuit involving 
a former AARP Executive Director who, after being sacked by the AARP, alleged various 
corruptions and illegalities in the relationship between AARP and Colonial Penn insurance, its 
previous carrier--all now well described, apparently, in sealed court records.
<P>        When we asked about AARP's advertisement of commercial products, we found that it 
repeatedly had been assessed penalties by the Postal Service for failing to pay the proper rates.  
When we asked about the purposes of federal grants to AARP, we found that the organization was 
providing "tax counseling" to senior citizens, while at the same time it was required to make a 
$135,000,000 payment in lieu of taxes to the IRS--for failure to adhere to our tax laws.  And the list 
went on, and on, and on.
<P>        I did not possess anything close to the resources necessary to get to the center of this 
labyrinth, and it is doubtful that anyone ever will.  I am told that the AARP is attempting to "turn 
over a new leaf," that it no longer wishes to be synonymous with ever-expanding government.  I 
certainly hope that is true.  During my hearings, the AARP was still claiming that its legislative 
stances were the product of careful consultation with its membership.  Yet at the same time, internal 
AARP polling data was showing us how the AARP was losing membership precisely because it 
was taking positions against balanced budgets and in favor of many massive new health care 
entitlements.  Those internal contradictions, I am told, are now being felt and fully addressed by the 
AARP itself.  In any event, let us hope that this is the case.
<P>        <I>Frightening America’s Elderly</I> provides a brief and valuable synopsis of the 
principal facts about the AARP and other seniors organizations.  As the possessor of a sizable stack 
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I commend Tom DiLorenzo and the 
Capital Research Center for condensing this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.  
The reader will come away from this text knowing far more than even most AARP members do 
about the nature of that organization.
<P>        Our national motto is, "E pluribus unum"--"Out of many, one."  Our great strength as a 
nation has always been the openness and tolerance which has allowed us to transform a huge 
diversity of viewpoints into instruments of our great national interest.  But it is this forging of 
diversity into unity that is all-important.  When speaking to constituents, I am often compelled to 
remind them that "You are citizens first.  You are not Farm Bureau members first, or NEA 
members first, or journalists first, or NRA members first, or members of the AARP first.  You are 
citizens first!  Your first obligation is as a citizen of this nation, and every other membership is 
secondary."  
<P>        Too often in Washington, the voices we hear are the sum total of the special interests which 
have converged upon the nation's capital, drowning out the voice of the general interest of the 
American citizenry.  There are huge organizations devoted to protecting and defending the dollars 
being shipped to every imaginable organized constituency--and the more sympathetic the cause of 
the recipient, the easier the lobbying for it.  The elderly, the children, the middle class, the poor, the 
veterans--it seems there is no amount of money that Congress can spend on such groups that will 
grant it immunity from the charge of heartless cruelty to the downtrodden.
	We are now truly at a crossroads in American political history.  To continue to heed the hyperbolic, harsh and hyped rhetoric of one particular lobbying behemoth--the AARP--will spell mortal peril for the economic future of the nation.  The more we know 
mission, and structure, the better.  Accordingly, the descriptions that you are about to read are 
exceptionally important ones, and they provide critical knowledge relevant to any discussion about 
this country's budgetary priorities.  I trust that the gentle reader will find <I>Frightening America’s 
Elderly</I> most intriguing and informative!  Enjoy!

<P>
	“If the Social Security and Medicare balance sheets were evaluated according to private-
sector accounting standards, both would be declared disastrously insolvent.” -- Peter G. 
Peterson
<P>
<P>
<P>
	The "baby boomers"--the huge generation born between the late 1940s and mid-1960s--
have dominated America's commercial life for decades.  American business has long understood 
that the key to selling goods and services to this generation is to cater to its needs and preferences.  
The baby boomers have not only reshaped markets but have had a profound impact on our most 
enduring social and political institutions.
<P>        In the very near future, demographic trends will dictate that the interests and demands of 
baby boomers dominate government retirement and health policy, particularly Social Security and 
Medicare policy.  Together, Social Security and Medicare are the largest items in the federal 
budget: they account for about 34 percent of all federal expenditures and are projected to reach 39 
percent by 2005, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
<P>        Policymakers will have to face up to some unavoidable facts about the aging baby boomers 
and about the American population in general.  These realities will have a major impact on 
government retirement and health programs:
<UL>
	<LI> People are living longer.  In 1935, when the Social Security system was established, the 
average life expectancy was 61 years.  Today, it is 77 at birth and 82 if one reaches age 65.  Since 
the turn of the century, the number of Americans over 65 has increased almost elevenfold.  By 
contrast, the under-65 population only tripled during the last 100 years.  In 1900, one out of 25 
Americans was over 65; today the number is one in eight.  And the elderly population is expected 
to continue growing: a big jump will occur between 2005 and 2030 as the baby boomers reach 
retirement.  By 2025, as former U.S. Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson recently noted in the 
<I>Atlantic Monthly</I>, America will become "a nation of Floridas," with the proportion of all 
Americans who are elderly the same as the proportion of elderly in Florida today.
	<LI> In 1950, there were approximately 16 working-age Americans for every person over age 
65.  But by 2030, there will be just two working-age Americans for every person over 65.  Far 
fewer workers will have to support far more retirees if we continue to rely on the current Social 
Security and Medicare systems.
	<LI> The graying of America will increase demands on the health-care system, leading to much 
higher health-care costs if fundamental changes are not made to Social Security and Medicare.
	These trends, <I>Newsweek</I> recently noted, "doom Social Security and Medicare in 
their present form" because "the required tax burdens would be horrendous" and ultimately 
unacceptable to taxpayers.  With fewer taxpayers supporting more Social Security and Medicare 
recipients, either massive tax increases or significant benefit reductions will be necessary if these 
programs are left unchanged.  Peterson argues that if the system is not reformed, the cost of Social 
Security and Medicare by 2040 will take between 35 and 55 percent of every worker's paycheck 
"before we even start to pay for the rest of what government does.  Obviously, tax increases of this 
size would destroy the economy."  This kind of tax burden would also likely create 
"intergenerational warfare" as younger generations revolted against working half a year or more 
just to pay for the benefits of retirees.

<CENTER><H3>Fueling the Welfare State</H3></CENTER>
<P>
	In our book <I>Destroying Democracy: How Government Funds Partisan Politics</I>, 
economist James T. Bennett and I describe how the government uses thousands of tax-exempt 
nonprofit organizations to administer the myriad programs that comprise the welfare state.  These 
organizations receive on average about half their funding from government, and they form a 
"shadow government"--a virtual appendage of government--that lobbies incessantly for expanded 
welfare programs. Incredibly, much of this lobbying is funded either directly or indirectly with tax 
dollars.
<P>        The seniors lobby is typical of this phenomenon.  The American Association of Retired 
Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), the Gray Panthers, and dozens 
of lesser-known organizations were created over the last few decades to ostensibly represent the 
concerns and interests of senior citizens.  But as this study will show, the so-called seniors lobby is, 
for the most part, a coalition of self-appointed activists favoring more government, more regulation, 
and higher taxes--all of which would increase seniors' dependence on government.  A vastly 
expanded government is not in the best interests of the elderly, but it <I>is</I> in the best financial 
and political interests of the seniors lobby.
<P>        This study describes how organizations comprising the seniors lobby promote costly and 
inefficient government programs, mandates, and regulations which they claim are the best way to 
meet the needs of seniors.  Their push for more government continues despite the worldwide 
failures of socialism and the welfare state.  Even democratic countries that have recently elected 
socialist governments--New Zealand is a notable example--are privatizing industries, cutting taxes, 
and discarding many once-sacrosanct welfare programs.  Other countries have abandoned 
government-run insurance programs and are developing creative alternatives that rely on free-
market competition and consumer choice to provide for the elderly.  Their policies, whose features 
can serve as models for U.S. reforms, are described in chapter six.
<P>        Reform-minded policymakers in the U.S. face powerful political opposition from the 
seniors lobby.  As James Bennett and I have shown in <I>Destroying Democracy</I>, entrenched 
special interests whose economic livelihood is tied to the continued expansion of failed welfare-
state programs are stalling innovative changes that are succeeding around the world.  These special 
interests have found it advantageous to organize themselves as tax-exempt, tax-deductible--and 
increasingly taxpayer-funded--nonprofit organizations.
<P>        This is the case with AARP, NCSC, and other seniors groups that have long been part of the 
Washington welfare establishment.  They devote enormous resources to fending off any efforts to 
fundamentally reform Social Security, Medicare, and other government programs.  Ignoring the 
consequences to future retirees, they seek to convince seniors and the public that these programs are 
financially sound and that any problems can be fixed by minor adjustments and tax increases.
<P>        Some of Social Security's most committed supporters have been honest enough to admit 
that it is essentially a Ponzi scheme.  They argue only that it is a darn good one!  Paul Samuelson, a 
Nobel laureate economist at MIT, argued back in 1967 that the "beauty" of Social Security is that 
"everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far exceed anything he has 
paid in [because] the national product is growing at compound interest and can be expected to do so 
for as far ahead as the eye cannot [<I>sic</I>] see. . . .  A <I>growing nation is the greatest Ponzi 
scheme ever contrived</I>" (emphasis added).6
<P>        Charles Ponzi, it should be recalled, was a finance and land speculator who in the 1920s 
gave investors the assurance that inexhaustible supplies of new money from future investors would 
guarantee high rates of return on earlier loans and purchases.  Of course, it all came tumbling down. 
<P> It may have appeared likely to Samuelson in 1967 that Social Security could also continue "as far 
ahead as the eye cannot see."  But America's population trends have changed everything: the annual 
report of the Social Security Trust Fund now projects that the system will be bankrupt by 2029 if it 
remains on its current path.  Medicare is on the same precarious financial course, and is projected to 
go bankrupt much earlier.
<P>        But none of this seems to matter to the seniors lobby.  Claiming that their own interests 
reflect the interests of tens of millions of seniors, organizations like AARP are quick to oppose 
policymakers who seek fundamental reform of programs for the aged.  They try to lull working-age 
Americans into complacency about the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare 
while frightening the elderly about constructive efforts to resolve the crisis.

	This study describes the agendas, activities, and funding of organizations that comprise the 
seniors lobby and analyzes the social and economic implications of their policy positions.  It 
focuses mostly on the activities of the larger and more established seniors groups since they are the 
most influential.
<P>        Chapter two focuses on the American Association of Retired Persons, specifically, the 
business practices of its $191,000,000-a-year money machine.  It questions whether any of AARP's 
commercial activities, from selling insurance to mutual funds, is appropriate for an organization 
that claims to be a charity.  Does Congress turn a blind eye to AARP's tax-exempt commercial 
businesses because AARP has powerful political ties and clout?
<P>        Chapter three also examines AARP, focusing on its tax-funded political agenda.  It 
describes how AARP lobbied for the failed Clinton health plan as well as for the catastrophic 
health-care plan that Congress enacted in 1989 and later repealed.  It also discusses AARP's efforts 
to dramatically raise taxes, increase government spending, and expand government programs that 
are demonstrably harmful.
<P>        Chapter four provides an overview of the activities and funding of the second most 
politically powerful seniors organization, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC).  
Founded by the Democratic National Committee and AFL-CIO, NCSC received about 96 percent 
of its funding in 1993 from federal tax revenues.  It is less a seniors organization than a labor-union 
front whose political agenda mirrors that of the AFL-CIO--even when that agenda is odds with the 
best interests of most seniors.
<P>        Chapter five reviews the activities and funding of other prominent seniors organizations, 
including the National Council on the Aging, Families U.S.A., National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, Save Our Security Coalition, Older Women's League, and Gray 
Panthers.  These organizations share a dedication to tieing the well-being of seniors to an 
increasingly powerful federal government.
<P>        Not all seniors organizations promote welfare-state dependency for the elderly.  Chapter six 
discusses three groups--The Seniors Coalition, United Seniors Association, and the 60 Plus 
Association--that promote policies based on individual responsibility, consumer choice, free-market 
competition, and limited constitutional government as the best means for meeting the needs of 
seniors.  These organizations understand the seriousness of the financial problems facing Social 
Security and Medicare, and they are developing policy ideas that will guarantee benefits to current 
retirees while reducing the burden on younger generations.  Chapter six also examines the 
promising old-age insurance systems in Chile and Singapore and their implications for the U.S.
<P>        The graying of the baby boom generation will place unprecedented stress on both Social 
Security and Medicare.  As we stand on the threshold of the 21st century, we know that socialism 
and the welfare state have been colossal failures.  It is imperative that public policy for the aged be 
redesigned with this reality in mind.
<P>        Unfortunately, Washington, D.C.-based seniors organizations are defenders of the failed 
Great Society.  They have become a major stumbling block to reform.  If this study can persuade 
more Americans to question the failed ideologies that continue to govern public policy for the aged-
-policies that, if left unchallenged, will spoil the retirement years of the graying baby boomers--it 
will have achieved its purpose.

<a name="intro"></a><h3> Introduction</h3>
<P>
 Concern for the natural environment is an American tradition
with a long and proud history.  The Americans who created modern
industrial society and populated its urban centers in the late
19th and early 20th centuries also established national conservation
organizations.  Because they wanted to retain and enjoy the resources
of nature and pass them on to later generations, they organized
the National Wildlife Federation,
the National Audubon Society and
the Izaak Walton League of America,
and worked with local conservation groups to protect habitat and
maintain the amenities of environmental beauty and recreation.
<P>
 In 1970, millions of Americans celebrated the first Earth
Day.  This event mobilized thousands of activists and spawned
a new generation of environmental groups: The Natural
Resources Defense Council, the Environmental
Defense Fund, Environmental Action,
and the Environmental Policy
Institute were among the new advocacy groups that joined the older
resource conservation and wilderness preservation organizations.
 These groups, however, wanted to impose on the United States
a new philosophy of environmental protection.  They believed the
federal government should exercise primary responsibility for
solving environmental problems, and they aggressively promoted
an agenda of national public policies.  Their ideas were rapidly
adopted by the old-line conservation groups.  A new and powerful
political force was born.
<P>
 The new environmental movement provoked a flurry of legislative
activity.  The National
Environmental Policy Act was signed into law on January 1, 1970.
 Congress then passed the Clean Air
Act (1970), the Clean Water Act
(1972), the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (1972), the Endangered
Species Act (1973), and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (1976), among many others.  More
laws followed.  By the end of the 1980s, environmental bills accounted
for nearly one-fifth of bills presented to Congress
and almost one-quarter of those enacted into law.
<P>
 The Reagan Administration
has been portrayed as opposed to environmental legislation, but
President Reagan signed laws like
the 1984 amendments to the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which gave the federal government
&quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; authority over waste management. 
The Reagan Administration also dramatically increased environmental
enforcement.  For instance, between 1983 and 1989 the Justice
Department more than tripled the amount of fines levied against
those found guilty of &quot;environmental crimes.&quot;
<P>
 George Bush rapidly accelerated
the process.  He pledged to be the &quot;environmental president&quot;
and introduced and signed into law the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, which regulates actual and potential
sources of air pollution from factories and autos to lawnmowers
and grain silos.  It is the nation's most costly environmental
legislation.  His Administration presided over an explosion in
environmental rulemaking--<I>National
Journal</I> labelled Bush the &quot;regulatory president&quot;--as
well as substantial increases in environment-related spending
and federal land acquisition.<BR>

<P><a name="what"></a>
<B>WHAT PRICE ENVIRONMENTALISM?</B>
<P>
 The government's environmental activism has been costly.  The
Environmental Protection
Agency has estimated that Americans spend well over $150 billion
per year complying with environmental regulations--over two percent
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
 Local governments must comply with nearly 175 unfunded federal
mandates and have to test drinking water for over 100 separate
substances.  Under one hypothesis of risk and cost,
the Office of Management
and Budget has estimated that one waste disposal regulation--a
listing of certain wood-treating chemicals as hazardous wastes--imposes
costs of $5.7 <I>trillion</I> to avert one premature cancer death.
<P>
 When businesses try to absorb the costs of complying with complex
environmental rules and permits, they are likely to pass on the
cost to consumers by raising the price of their products.  And
when they are confronted by the uncertainties of statutory interpretation
and the regulatory enforcement of environmental law they may decide
to slow the development and application of new technologies.
<P>
 Environmental regulation is increasingly expensive and, many
argue, less effective in achieving its goals, particularly in
the area of risk reduction.  Dr. William Cooper,
an ecologist at Michigan State
University, observes: &quot;We're really just about at the end
of the reductions in risk that you can achieve by the conventional
approach, which is to crank down on the pollution coming out of
the end of the pipe.  Now we're into more subtle issues.  How
clean do we really want our environment?  How much are we really
willing to pay for it?&quot;
<P>
 Nor are the regulatory trade-offs only ones of cost against benefit.
 It is also increasingly clear that attempting to improve environmental
quality in one area can hurt the environment in other areas. 
For example, EPA regulations
require the incineration of certain dioxin-contaminated wastes.
 Yet an incinerator that cannot meet the EPA's destruction standard
for dioxin may produce two barrels of dioxin-contaminated ash
for every barrel of dioxin-contaminated waste that it burns. 
Under current federal law, this ash cannot be put in a landfill.
 <I>The </I><I>New York Times</I> revealed
that ash of this kind from an incinerator at an abandoned Arkansas
chemical factory had to be stored in perpetuity in a $300,000
facility built for that purpose.  The total cost of that single
&quot;cleanup&quot; operation was over $25 million and could reach
up to $175 million.
<P>
 Or consider the Endangered
Species Act (ESA).  Under the Act, landowners lose the right to
use their land as they see fit when an endangered animal is discovered
on it.  Landowners cannot build or enlarge their homes, plant
crops, or cut down trees.  Rather than protect wildlife, the ESA
punishes landowners, in effect, for creating or maintaining a
species habitat.  The Act creates disincentives for protecting
endangered species.  Michael Bean of the
Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)
observes that landowners who find an endangered species on their
property may well decide to destroy it and its habitat before
it is discovered by federal authorities--a process
some call &quot;shoot, shovel, and shut up.&quot;  Nonetheless,
EDF and most other environmental groups remain steadfast supporters
of the ESA.<BR>

<P><a name="media"></a>
<B>MEDIA SKEPTICISM</B>
<P>
 The late journalist Warren Brookes was
among the first writers to expose the economic ignorance of environmental
policymakers and challenge their misuse of science.  His example
has been followed by writers for <I>Forbes</I>,
<I>The </I><I>Washington Times</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I>, among other publications.
 Conservative and libertarian publications like <I>Reason,
</I><I>Insight, </I><I>Human
Events</I>, and <I>National Review</I>
also have focused attention on the failings of conventional environmental
analysis.  More recently, the major media have begun to look skeptically
at the claims of environmentalism.
<P>
<ul>
 <li>In December 1990, the popular
CBS News program &quot;60
Minutes&quot; aired a story which concluded that acid rain posed
little environmental threat.  The program quoted scientists who
refused to justify the $4 to $7 billion cost of an acid rain control
program that Congress had passed earlier
in the year.
<P>
 <li>In March 1993, the <I>New
York Times</I> published &quot;What Price Cleanup?&quot; a five-part
series that asserted &quot;many scientists, economists and Government
officials have reached the dismaying conclusion that much of America's
environmental program has gone seriously awry&quot; because &quot;environmental
policy has too often evolved largely in reaction to popular panics,
not in response to sound scientific analyses of which environmental
hazards pose the greatest risks.&quot;  The series challenged
the Superfund program, the reliability of animal
tests to assess chemical risk, and the need for a ban on ocean
dumping, among other policies.
<P>
 <li> In November 1993, ABC
News' &quot;20/20&quot; documented how enforcement of the Endangered
Species Act devastated some Riverside County, California homeowners.
 To protect the endangered Stephens'
Kangaroo Rat, homeowners were forbidden to clear firebreaks around
their homes.  When fires swept through the county in 1993, 29
homes (and rat habitat) were lost.
<P>
 <li>In December 1993, <I>U.S.
News &amp; World Report</I> published an in-depth look at &quot;The
Doomsday Myths&quot;--fear of species extinction and overpopulation.
 The story's conclusion: &quot;Environmentalists' penchant for
doomsaying is coming back to haunt them.&quot;
<P>
 <li>In April 1994, a highly-rated
ABC
News special  &quot;Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?&quot; showed
how the federal Superfund program actually <I>increased</I> the
risk to public health and safety.  An abandoned Colorado silver
mine called Smuggler Mountain was designated
a federal Superfund site in 1986.  Though there
was no evidence that local residents were in danger, the federal
cleanup plan called for the physical dislocation of 150 homes
so that four feet of dirt could be removed from the site.  Local
leaders opposed the EPA plan, and one doctor told ABC, &quot;If
you want to save lives in this valley, build us a new road.  Our
road is what kills people.&quot;
<P>
 <li>In September 1994, the <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> ran a three-part series, &quot;Living Scared:
Why Do the Media Make Life Seem So Risky?&quot; on the &quot;cry-wolf&quot;
stories that dominate media coverage of the environment.  The
series' headline declared &quot;We're safer and healthier than
ever--and also more afraid of what we eat, drink and breathe.
 Why the reality gap?  Too often, critics say, the media's coverage
fuels our fears.&quot;
<P>
</ul>
 These stories criticize failed government environmental policies
and the nonprofit lobbying organizations that helped put them
in place.  NRDC senior
attorney David Hawkins said as much on &quot;60
Minutes&quot;: &quot;The environmental community has spent almost
no effort attempting to even monitor the progress&quot; of government-sponsored
acid rain research.  Instead, &quot;we have been working on trying
to get legislation in Washington.&quot;
<P>
 Public dissatisfaction with &quot;regulate first, ask questions
later&quot; policies is growing.  In 1991, only 28 percent of
the American public thought environmental groups exaggerated threats
&quot;in order to get the public to pay attention to them.&quot;
 By 1994, the number was 42 percent.
<P>
 Yet although many policy experts and the public now recognize
the failings of much environmental policy, Washington's environmental
lobbies are unyielding.  &quot;We don't need a new paradigm&quot;
said David Doniger, a senior attorney at the Natural
Resources Defense Council who later joined the Clinton
White House.  Fifteen environmental groups that participated
in a joint fundraising appeal opposed any efforts to reform existing
environmental laws and called instead for their strengthening.
 Leaders of the groups typically have attributed public dissatisfaction
to bad publicity and poor public education, not inadequacies in
policy.  &quot;Our business is basically communications and we've
lost the imagination of the guy on the street,&quot; says Ted
Lee Eubanks of the National
Audubon Society.
<P>
 The <I>New York Times</I> series, &quot;What
Price Cleanup?&quot;, was particularly threatening to environmentalists.
 Keith Schneider, the lead author of the
series, was called a mouthpiece for polluting corporations in
a September 1993 article in <I>Sierra</I>, the magazine
of the Sierra Club.  An official
of the Hudson County Sierra
Club earlier published similar charges, as had former Greenpeace
analyst Peter Montague, founder and director
of the Environmental
Research Foundation.  One year later, the National
Wildlife Federation published &quot;The Truth About Dioxin&quot;
in the pages of <I>National Wildlife</I>.
 It too charged Schneider with inaccuracy, but provided little
substantive documentation.
<P>
 These stories side-stepped Schneider's main point--that environmental
regulations cost a lot and produce little.  Instead, they targeted
Schneider's sources--corporate executives or scientists who received
corporate research funding--and the alleged interest of corporations
like the <I>Times</I> in underplaying the risks of dioxin and
other chemicals.  Schneider replied in his own defense: &quot;By
trying to portray others as enemies, and by failing to understand
the cultural shifts in understanding in the U.S., the national
environmentalists have become an enemy of the very programs, policies
and laws they themselves espouse.&quot;<BR>
</SUP>
<P><a name="env"></a>
<B>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN THE POLLING BOOTH</B>
<P>
 The election returns of 1994 are one gauge of public attitudes.
 Polls show that voters support strong environmental protection,
but they also elect candidates who campaign for regulatory reform.
<P>
<ul>
 <li>The Endangered
Species Act was a central issue in the Texas Governor's race between
incumbent Ann Richards and challenger
George W. Bush, Jr.  Two Bush radio
ads attacked Richards for not working hard enough to protect property
owners' rights.  Attempting to save Richards from defeat, the <!--Clinton (Bill) Administration,-->Clinton
Administration announced that it would not restrict development
in central Texas to protect habitat for the golden-cheeked warbler.
<P>
 <li>In Pennsylvania, successful gubernatorial
candidate Tom Ridge campaigned against
costly federal air pollution control mandates on the state that
included more stringent new car emission standards and a requirement
that automakers sell electric cars.
<P>
 <li>In Oklahoma, Representative Mike
Synar was defeated in the Democratic primary
&quot;in part because of his steadfast support for tougher rules
on a range of environmental issues.&quot;  Other
environmental allies, including Representatives Dan Hamburg
(D-CA), Dan Glickman (D-KS), Karen Shepard
(D-UT), Tom Andrews (D-ME), Karan English
(D-AZ) and Senator Jim Sasser (D-TN) also
lost their seats.  Of 15 legislators whose reelection was a priority
for the League of Conservation
Voters, seven lost.
<P>
 <li>New freshmen were elected on
platforms to reform or repeal laws like the Endangered
Species and Clean Water Acts. 
They include Republicans Ed Brant of Tennessee,
Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, Wes Cooley
of Ohio, John Shadegg of Arizona, Linda
Smith of Washington, and William &quot;Mac&quot;
Thornberry of
Texas.  Indiana voters elected David McIntosh,
the former executive director of Vice President Dan Quayle's
Council on Competitiveness,
an agency that infuriated environmental lobbyists with its deregulatory
initiatives.<BR>
</ul>
<P><a name="unholy"></a>
<B>THE &quot;UNHOLY TRINITY&quot;</B>
<P>
 Dissatisfaction with much current government environmental regulation
centers on three issues--risk assessment, unfunded mandates, and
property rights.  They have been dubbed the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;
or the &quot;triple threat&quot; by environmental lobbyists. 
Environmental groups consider them the greatest threat to their
legislative and regulatory agendas, short of wholesale budget
cuts or the repudiation of government regulation as an environmental
protection strategy.
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Risk
Assessment</I>--The premise underlying much federal environmental
regulation is that people's lives can be made safer by eliminating
or reducing human exposure to any number of dangerous substances--from
industrial air emissions to household chemicals.  But instead
of focusing on genuine, i.e., scientifically demonstrable, threats
to public health and safety,  the regulatory process often targets
risks that the public fears most or that have public relations
or political value.  Federal agencies spend millions
of dollars that do comparatively little to improve public health
and environmental quality.  According to analysts at Harvard's
School of Public Health, the cost-per-life-saved of the average
EPA regulation--over $7.5
million--is 87 times higher than the cost-per-life-saved of an
average regulation issued by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.  Moreover, some
federal regulations make the questionable scientific assumption
that any dose of a substance found to be toxic in certain dosages
and under certain conditions must therefore always be considered
dangerous to human health.  But a central principle of toxicology
is &quot;the dose makes the poison.&quot;
<P>
 Critics of agencies like EPA
are demanding more openness about the methods used to draft environmental
regulations.  They say that decisionmaking would improve if agencies
had to rely on peer-reviewed science and conducted cost-benefit
analysis of proposed regulations.  &quot;Such analysis permits
comparison of various options, all of which may be beneficial
in some way, but not all of which can be simultaneously taken,&quot;
explains environmental analyst Kent Jeffreys.
<P>
 Some environmentalists agree in principle.  According to former
National Audubon Society president
Peter Berle, &quot;Clearly it is a useful
way of establishing priorities.  We've got to ask ourselves whether
[policies] make sense from a cost point of view.&quot;
 Nonetheless, all major environmental groups formally oppose requiring
agencies to perform risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses
on the grounds that such analyses are &quot;pseudo-scientific.&quot;
<P>
 <li><I>Unfunded
Mandates</I>--Congress creates an &quot;unfunded mandate&quot;
when it passes a law that requires state or local governments
to meet goals or create programs, but fails to provide the money
for its implementation.  Under pressure to reduce the federal
deficit, Congress has increasingly relied
on them to meet environmental goals.
<P>
 State and local officials naturally oppose unfunded mandates
because their local priorities must be subordinated to Washington's
dictates.  Currently, it is estimated that up to 12 percent of
municipal revenues are spent to comply with unfunded mandates
of all sorts.  Local concerns are well-articulated by Michael
J. Pompilli, head of the environmental
health division of the Columbus, Ohio,
Health Department: &quot;What bothers me is that the new rules
coming out of Washington are taking money from decent programs
and making me waste them on less important problems.  It kills
you as a city official to see this kind of money spent for nothing.&quot;
<P>
 <li><I>Property
Rights</I>--Many environmental regulations override private land-use
decisions.  For example, the Fish
&amp; Wildlife Service will routinely deny property owners use
of their land if endangered species are present.  Policies to
protect wetlands and scenic rivers also supersede private property
rights.
<P>
 Many landowners say these policies violate the &quot;takings
clause&quot; of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, which states &quot;. . . nor shall private property
be taken for public use without just compensation.&quot;  Property
rights advocates would reinvigorate this provision of the Bill
of Rights.  If the public wants to protect endangered species
or preserve a scenic vista, they say the public should be willing
to pay for it, just as it pays for highways, military bases, parks,
and other &quot;public goods.&quot;
<P>
</ul>
 Washington environmental lobbyists steadfastly oppose risk assessment,
relief from unfunded mandates, and greater protection of property.
 Thus, the Natural Resources
Defense Council announced that opposing such proposals would be
its &quot;single most important environmental campaign ever.&quot;
 The Sierra Club's executive director calls
these three issues &quot;pure and simple, an overt and calculated
attack on the environment,&quot; and &quot;an assault on the guiding
principle of virtually all laws governing air, water, and waste
disposal.&quot;  Most Americans, however, do not
appear to agree.  Indeed, many support these reforms while strongly
favoring environmental protection.  To most Americans, the two
are not incompatible.

<P><a name="envi"></a>
<B>ENVIRONMENTAL BACKLASH AND THE 103RD CONGRESS</B>
<P>
 The extent of the backlash against environmentalists can be seen
in the record of the 103rd Congress (1993-1994).  As environmentalists
see it, that Congress was an unmitigated
disaster.  The League of
Conservation Voters rated it the worst in 25 years.  Although
environmental lobbyists expected much from a Democratic President
and Congress, only one notable bill was signed into law, the California
Desert Protection Act.  Despite environmentalist cries of urgency,
Congress was unable to reauthorize several expired environmental
laws.
<P>
 Partisan gridlock is how pundits have explained Congressional
inaction: Republicans and conservative Democrats from the South
and West blocked good bills to placate industry lobbyists or for
partisan advantage.  EPA
Administrator Carol Browner told journalists,
&quot;What we've run into is gridlock and obstructionism that
is truly unprecedented.&quot;
<P>
 This argument may work in other areas, but not for environmental
legislation.  Little was attempted on the House
or Senate floor that culminated in gridlock.
 Rather, back room agreements were reached between influential
liberal legislators and the representatives of Washington's largest
environmental groups that doomed passage of the reauthorization
bills that environmentalists claimed they wanted.
<P>
 In February 1994, the representatives of six major environmental
groups--the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the Sierra Club, the National
Audubon Society, the National
Wildlife Federation, the Friends of
the Earth, and the Environmental
Defense Fund--met with California Democratic Representatives George
Miller, then-chairman of the House
Natural Resources Committee, and Henry Waxman,
then-chairman of the Environment
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to discuss
legislative strategy.  Because they anticipated that serious efforts
would be made to attach &quot;unholy trinity&quot; amendments
to upcoming environmental legislation, the lobbyists decided it
was better to hold off on consideration of any important environmental
bills.  They thought they had the strength to stop bills from
moving, but not enough to defeat the hostile amendments.  As Jim
Maddy, former president of the League
of Conservation Voters later explained, &quot;The best we can
do is prevent Congress from weakening the Clean
Water Act, prevent this Congress from weakening Superfund,
prevent this Congress from weakening the Safe
Drinking Water Act and prevent this Congress from weakening the
Endangered Species Act.&quot;
<P>
 This decision was documented in an extremely controversial memo
leaked on Capitol Hill in March 1994.  Written by
the NRDC's chief lobbyist,
Erik Olson, the memo outlined &quot;the legislative
agenda for this Congress&quot; on environmental issues as determined
at the lobbyists' meeting with Miller and Waxman.  The memo explained
that &quot;kill strategies&quot; were to be adopted for environmental
legislation that was susceptible to amendments of the kind that
the memo labeled &quot;unholy trinity.&quot;  Reauthorization
of the nation's solid waste law--the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA--and the Endangered
Species Act were to be &quot;taken off the table.&quot;  A &quot;kill
strategy&quot; was also intended for the reauthorization of the
Clean Water Act.  National
Audubon Society vice president Brock Evans
later described the strategy: &quot;We are slowing down on some
of our agenda because it is just too risky to reauthorize the
<!--Endangered Species Act of 1973,-->Endangered Species Act,
for example, with all these amendments locked into it.&quot;
<P>
 The only bill the group decided to allow on the floor was the
reauthorization of the Safe Drinking
Water Act.  Because it applies primarily to municipal water systems,
the lobbyists presumed it would attract less industry interest
and would more easily be kept free of reform amendments.  Yet
Olson and the others did not appreciate the
extent of opposition to their agenda.  They did not realize that
their primary opponent was no longer industry.  As one Senate
staffer explained, the &quot;primary adversary on many of these
issues isn't the National
Association of Manufacturers--it's the National
Governors' Association.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of the miscalculation the strategy failed.  The Senate
approved hostile unholy trinity amendments and proceeded to pass
the Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization
by a large margin.  Even though a &quot;clean&quot; bill emerged
from the House, environmental
lobbyists recognized that an agreement with the Senate to strip
the offending provisions could not be reached and opted to let
the bill die before a House-Senate conference rather than allow
it to be enacted into law.  Thus even a relatively non-controversial
bill--it passed by wide majorities in both Houses of Congress--was
killed by environmental lobbyists opposed to the &quot;unholy
trinity.&quot;
<P>
 Environmental lobbyists have blamed this and other failures on
special interest groups who &quot;profit from pollution and from
exploiting public lands and resources.&quot;  A joint letter,
characterized as a &quot;Fourth of July 'wakeup call',&quot; was
signed by fifteen environmental lobbying organizations.  They
charged that &quot;At every turn, members of Congress are getting
more pressure from those who want to weaken environmental laws
than from those who want to strengthen them.&quot;
 The letter, sent to 400,000 people on the mailing lists of the
participating groups, was meant to revive grass roots activism
and offered a &quot;citizen action guide&quot; with counter-arguments
on &quot;unholy trinity&quot; issues.  One House aide explained
the approach, &quot;Without local-level support, there's no reason
for congressional moderates to vote with the environment.&quot;
<P>
 Neither lack of effort nor misallocation of resources explains
why the environmental movement failed to pass its legislative
agenda.  Rather, the leaders of environmental groups misunderstood
public sentiment.  Looking at polling data showing broad support
for environmental protection, they assumed the public must support
the agenda of the National
Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club and the
League of Conservation Voters.
 But the same polls often show public support for reforms such
as the compensation of property owners for the adverse impact
of land-use regulations intended to protect wetlands or endangered
species.
<P>
 Environmentalists do not see that the public's interest in economic
common sense and fairness is compatible with support for a clean
environment.  Senate
Environment Committee staffer Michael Evans
tried explaining this at a seminar organized by the League
of Conservation Voters: &quot;Each of [the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;]
issues embodies a core truth.  It's important for you to concede
the truth, embrace it.  That's what's happening on the other side.
 They concede the principle of environmental protection, and they
talk about the need to prioritize resources.&quot;<BR>

<P><a name="increasing"></a>
<B>INCREASING PUBLIC DISSATISFACTION</B>
<P>
 Environmentalism's political failures coincide with a decline
in public support for Washington's environmental establishment.
 Since 1990, the ten largest environmental groups have lost members
and their annual revenues have been stagnant.  After a decade
of tremendous expansion, the ten largest groups--Ducks
Unlimited, the Environmental
Defense Fund, Greenpeace, Inc., the National
Audubon Society, the National
Parks and Conservation Association, the National
Wildlife Federation, the Sierra Club, the Nature
Conservancy, the Wilderness Society,
and the World Wildlife Fund--saw their
collective membership drop 6.5 percent from 1990 to 1993.
 &quot;It was easy for environmental groups to raise money&quot;
in the 1970s and 1980s, explains Dan <!--Borochoff, Dan,-->Borochoff
of the <!--American Institute of Philanthropy,-->American Institute
of Philanthropy, &quot;Now they're having to justify themselves
more.&quot;
<P>
 Worse, the problems are not just financial.  &quot;The green
groups also are faced with widespread cynicism about institutions
in general&quot; and public distrust of Washington, D.C.
 When Cindy Gabriel learned that former
National Wildlife Federation
president Jay Hair,  earned over $230,000 per year,
she told <I>The </I><I>Wall Street
Journal</I> she probably would quit the organization.
 If she saw the salaries of the other environmental C.E.O.s, Ms.
Gabriel might never contribute again to a national environmental
lobbying group.  Many environmental leaders are paid like high-powered
inside-the-beltway lobbyists, which is what they have become:
<P>
 <ul>
<li> Jay D. Hair
(former president), National
Wildlife Federation ($242,060);
<P>
<li>Fred Krupp,
Environmental Defense Fund ($213,504);
<P>
 <li> Kathryn Fuller,
<!--World Wildlife Fund,-->World Wildlife Fund ($185,000);
<P>
<li> Peter A.A. Berle
(former president), National Audubon
Society ($171,154);
<P>
<li> Karin Sheldon,
Wilderness Society ($90,896);
<P>
<li> Carl Pope,
Sierra Club ($77,142);
<P>
<li> Barbara Dudley,
Greenpeace ($65,000).
</ul>
<P>
 Left-liberal critics like writers for <I>The </I><I>Nation</I>
take particular exception: &quot;The mainstream high brass is
elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to
the working class and a firm ally of big government.&quot;
 A recent controversy inside the Sierra Club
about logging in the Northern Rockies is illustrative.  Local
chapters in Montana and other states have called for an end to
logging on federal lands there.  But the Sierra Club's national
leadership has opposed such a blanket policy, and responded by
threatening to depose local elected officials.  &quot;What we
are seeing here is how an environmental organization becomes a
bureaucracy,&quot; said Andy Mahler, a Sierra
Club member in Indiana.  &quot;The higher up in the organization
you go, the impulse is to protect each other, to protect funding,
to protect political access rather than take a stand.&quot;
<P>
 A study from the Center
for the Study of American Business confirms the suspicion that
environmental organizations have become more bureaucratic over
the past two decades.  Authors Christopher Boerner
and Jennifer Chilton Kallery
find that staffs at the major groups have skyrocketed since 1970.
 The most rapid growth occurred in the 1980s, with many employees
working in fundraising and membership development.  Some groups
may devote as much as 25 percent of revenues to fundraising and
20 percent more to membership development.  &quot;Such hefty investments
in promotion and development by [some] environmental groups have
almost certainly been primary contributors to their growth over
the last fifteen years,&quot; they note.
<P>
 Dave Foreman, a former Wilderness
Society lobbyist and founder of Earth First!
and The Wildlands Project speaks with
characteristic fervor:<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> As in most business, government, and citizen organizations,
the technicians--accountants, lawyers, public-relations-experts,
and political pros--have taken over from the idealists. . . .
 Political operatives, not conservationists, are sought for jobs
with environmental groups. . . .  A salaried elite has formed
that elevates itself above the volunteers.
</blockquote>
<P>
 This concern is summed up by Bill Gifford
and the editors of <I>Outside</I> magazine: &quot;If
only some of the larger groups didn't have vast bureaucracies,
publicity machines, and presidents like the National
Wildlife Federation's Jay Hair, who is accustomed
to being squired about by a chauffeur.&quot;
<P>
 When the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>
polled attitudes toward charity it found that no environmental
organization made the public's list of the twenty &quot;Best Liked&quot;
or &quot;Most Credible&quot; charitable causes.
But the twenty &quot;Most Opposed&quot; groups included Greenpeace
(6th), the Sierra Club (12th), and the Environmental
Defense Fund (20th).  Among the twenty &quot;Least Credible&quot;
were the same three organizations--7th, 14th, and 18th--and Friends
of the Earth Foundation (19th).  Greenpeace,
the National Audubon Society and
the Sierra Club were also on the list of top
twenty &quot;never donated to&quot; charitable causes.  Similarly,
a poll conducted by <!--American Forests,--><I>American Forests</I>
found that in the northwestern United States environmentalists
are less trusted than timber industry scientists.
<P>
 Changing public attitudes toward environmental lobbyists hurts
some groups more than others.  Four groups have been hit hard
by falling memberships and revenues: the Sierra
Club, the National Audubon Society,
the Wilderness Society, and Greenpeace.
<P>
<ul>
<li> <I>Sierra
Club</I>--From 1990 to 1993, membership fell from almost 630,000
to 500,000.  In one year, 1992-1993, membership dropped
15 percent.  Sierra has accumulated deficits of almost
$3 million since 1990.  The Sierra Club recently announced plans
to reduce its coverage of policy issues.  In 1995, it will focus
on pollution prevention and scenic preservation, and drop work
on population issues, energy conservation and other issues.  The
Club plans to cut its budget by $3.7 million and lay off 350 employees.
 As Sierra Club executive director Carl <!--Pope, Carl,-->Pope
explained, &quot;We had been spending our reserves but no longer
felt this was prudent.&quot;
<P>
<li><I>National
Audubon Society</I>--Membership dropped by 8 percent from 1992
to 1993, and donations also slipped slightly.  Membership
growth has waned since Audubon refashioned its image as an activist
group.  In 1993, it ran a $1.7 million deficit. 
Audubon officials hope to balance their budget by 1996.
<P>
<li><I>Wilderness
Society</I>--Membership plummeted by nearly a third between 1990
and 1993 and finances dropped by $2.9 million--almost
one-sixth.  Field offices were closed in Oregon,
Utah, and Maine.  Society staffers &quot;now must plunk down a
quarter for office coffee.&quot;
<P>
<li><I>Greenpeace</I>--In
1990, Greenpeace had approximately 2.5 million members, but membership
has dropped by 800,000.  Greenpeace's funding dropped
by nearly a third in 1991.  Revenues for Greenpeace
dropped by nearly 10 percent more between 1992 and 1993,
forcing the group to lay off 100 staff members.  Explains Greenpeace's
development director, David <!--Lemos, David,-->Lemos, &quot;We
had gotten used to having a lot more money.&quot;
</ul>
<P>
 Not all environmental groups have done poorly in the 1990s. 
The Environmental Defense Fund
(EDF) had increases in membership (25 percent) and revenues (6
percent) between 1992 and 1993.  The World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) lost 7 percent of its members during the period,
but revenues increased 10 percent.  Donations may
not be dramatically increasing at the Nature
Conservancy (TNC), but <I>Outside</I> magazine
characterizes its finances as &quot;cash-flow heaven.&quot;
<P>
 EDF, WWF and TNC benefit from perceptions of them as more conservative
than other environmental advocacy organizations.  Bush EPA chief
William Reilly was tapped from the ranks
of WWF, and the Administration's 1990 Clean
Air Act proposal borrowed heavily from the work of EDF.  Unlike
most environmental groups, TNC eschews high-profile lobbying campaigns.
 To promote conservation, it directs most of its resources towards
the purchase of lands and easements.
<P>
 Still, the fortunes of environmental groups may be tied, at least
in part, to the health of the economy.  Charitable giving tends
to increase in times of economic prosperity.  &quot;Giving by
individuals and corporations jumped dramatically in the 1980s&quot;
explains economist Richard B. McKenzie.
 Private charitable giving, which increased by less than 3.5 percent
per year from 1955 to 1980, increased over 5.1 percent annually
during the 1980s, from $77.5 billion in 1980 to over $120 billion
in 1989.  When the economy slowed in 1989, the rise in charitable
giving came to a standstill and began to rise only after the economy
picked-up in 1991.
<P>
 This trend certainly affects the finances of environmental groups.
 Boerner and Kallery
found a correlation between per capita GNP and organizational
membership and revenue when they examined the Wilderness
Society, Sierra Club, National
Audubon Society, Natural
Resources Defense Council and the Nature
Conservancy.  Moreover, polling data showed that
support for environmental policy tracks economic concerns.  A
1992 survey found that 80 percent of the public agreed with the
statement &quot;protecting the environment is so important that
requirements and standards cannot be too high, and continuing
environmental improvements must be made regardless of cost.&quot;
 Yet in 1993, only 58 percent agreed with the statement.<SUP>67</SUP>
<P>
 Another factor is political leadership.  Environmentalists certainly
credit Reagan Interior Secretary James Watt
and EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch for their
own good fortune in fundraising.  As the radical <I>Nation</I>
columnist Alexander Cockburn and <I>Wild
Forest Review</I> editor Jeffrey St.
Clair argue: &quot;The venal but entirely harmless Watt was a
bankbook extravaganza to the mainstream environmental groups,
who sold him as Genghis incarnate.  Memberships doubled, budgets
tripled.  Everyone packed up, hired C.E.O.s at six-figure salaries
and moved to spacious quarters in D.C.&quot;
<P>
 The <I>Exxon Valdez</I> spill also filled
environmentalist coffers.  The dramatic spill off Alaska's coast
&quot;just really presented an opportunity,&quot; said Keller
Ries of the National
Wildlife Federation.  In 1990 membership for some groups, such
as Greenpeace and the Sierra
Club, peaked.  &quot;We're in the ironic situation where possibly
the nation's greatest environmental catastrophe ever is causing
this increased interest in environmental organizations,&quot;
noted Robert SanGeorge of the National
Audubon Society.
<P>
 The reverse may be happening now.  Susan Carson,
a former National Audubon Society
staffer told <I>The </I><I>Wall Street
Journal</I> that environmental groups are suffering from the &quot;Gore
effect.&quot;  &quot;The basic theory is that with Gore and Clinton
in power, the environmental shtick is being handled,&quot; she
says.  Environmental leaders think both economics
and politics are at work.  &quot;The No. 1 cause of our problems
has been the economy,&quot; said Ben Beach,
a Wilderness Society spokesman.  &quot;When
the economy went down, so did our membership.  The election of
Clinton and Gore
also didn't help.  Some people believed there was less need to
support environmental causes.&quot;
<P>
 Environmental groups have begun demonizing their opponents to
revive their sources of support.  The July 1994 joint fundraising
appeal signed by fifteen groups charged that &quot;even during
the Reagan / Watt / Gorsuch years, we have never faced such a
serious threat to our environmental laws in Congress.&quot;  Since
the November 1994 election, the rhetoric has sharpened.  Wilderness
Society president Jon Roush signed a fundraising
appeal claiming that &quot;Today, the Wilderness Society must
adapt to a new climate that flings storms of opposition against
our efforts to conserve America's precious natural heritage.&quot;
 The Sierra Club labeled the regulatory reform
proposals in the Republican &quot;Contract
With America&quot; a &quot;polluter's bill of rights&quot; and
an undeclared &quot;war on the environment.&quot;
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a former
President of the League of
Conservation Voters, explained the fundraising tactics of environmental
lobbying organizations.<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> The bottom line for the environmentalists is how
do you induce people to send money to sustain the movement. .
. .  For years and years, they said, &quot;James Watt is out to
destroy life on Earth as we know it--send money.&quot;  &quot;The
Exxon Valdez just crashed--send money.&quot;  The game has changed.
 It's a lot harder now to begin the sentence that ends with &quot;Send
money.&quot;
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>OUTLINE</B>
<P>
 The environmental movement is at a crossroads.  Once environmental
groups made consistent strides towards ambitious policy objectives.
 Today, environmentalists are running into a brick wall.  Assorted
items on the environmentalist agenda face a variety of opponents
in statehouses and in the U.S. Congress,
and green fundraising has started to lag.  Can America's environmental
establishment overcome its recent failures?  Or will American
environmentalism take a new course?
<P>
 This book will survey recent developments that are affecting
environmental groups.  They are suffering declining memberships,
declining political fortunes, and the challenge posed by a so-called
&quot;environmental backlash.&quot;  But they remain a formidable
power in the world of Washington special interest lobbies.
<P>
 Chapter One reviews the &quot;first wave&quot; of environmental
groups--the conservation organizations that focused on land, resource
and wildlife conservation.  It examines their increasing reliance
on centralized federal regulation and government land ownership
to achieve their objectives.
<P>
 Chapter Two focuses on the &quot;second wave&quot; of groups
that were, almost literally, the products of Earth
Day 1970.  These groups were activists from the start, and they
launched the environmental movement's attack on modern industrial
society and its assault on the use of chemicals and advanced technologies.
<P>
 Chapter Three is on international environmentalism, from the
concept of &quot;sustainable development&quot; to the push for
population control.  The growing presence of American environmental
groups in the international arena is explored.
<P>
 Chapter Four analyzes the role environmental groups play in developing
public policies and shaping public opinion on environmental issues.
 It includes a look at the environmental curriculum in the schools
and discusses how environmental lobbyists exert influence in the
Clinton Administration.
<P>
 Chapter Five surveys where environmental groups get financial
support--from individuals, foundations and corporations--and describes
how environmental groups are trying to diversify their funding
base through government grants and the sale of commercial products.
<P>
 Chapter Six discusses emerging movements within environmentalism:
from the deep ecology movement and the environmental justice movement
to free market environmentalism and the property rights and &quot;wise-use&quot;
environmental backlash.
<P>
 Finally, appendices analyze the largest and most influential
environmental organizations operating in America today, their
sources of income, officers, and most important activities.<BR>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<i>The Rise of the Nanny
State</i> examines the origins, goals, and activities of the modern
consumer movement--a movement that, in the words of Capital Research
Center Visiting Fellow Tom Holt, &quot;does not address the needs
of consumers.  
<P>
Instead, it serves the bureaucratic interests of
governing elites and the ideological and organizational interests
of the movement itself.&quot; Holt paints a decidedly unflattering
portrait of the consumer movement.  As the recent Alar scare showed,
consumer advocates capitalize on the public's ignorance of science
and the media's eagerness for calamity.  Under the guise of public
health and safety, they seek to justify regulations dictating
their idea of the public good to our households and workplaces.
<P>
 With few exceptions, they advocate bigger and more intrusive
government and are hostile to free markets and personal responsibility.
Holt shows that the consumer movement has imposed significant
costs on industry--costs ultimately passed on to consumers--and
has violated individual freedoms in a futile effort to protect
us from our own actions and judgment.  Based on his analysis,
he calls for: major tort reform; the abolition of CAFE standards
and the Delaney clause; a reduced federal role in health care;
a major overhaul of the Consumer Product Safety Commission; and
other reforms of regulatory agencies.

<h3> Recommendations for the Future of the Fulbright Program</h3>
<P>
<ul>
 Policymakers need to critically re-examine the future role of
the Federal Government in sponsoring the Fulbright program of
international educational exchanges.  They will want to recognize
the program's very real accomplishments over the past half century.
 But they should question the contribution the Fulbright program
can make in a post-Cold War world.  And they should ask whether
that contribution is a national interest requiring government
funding.  This report recommends a substantial reevaluation
of the nature of the program and cites various changes that would
both continue the most valuable elements of the existing program,
while at the same time share its costs more equitably with other
countries and the academic community.
<P>
<B> 1.  Freeze Spending.</B>  The new Congress initially should
freeze spending on the Fulbright program at the existing level
and plan for a gradual reduction in future funding.  International
educational exchange is no longer a new idea requiring nurture.
 Programs that make possible overseas travel by hundreds of thousands
of scholars and students are well established throughout the world.
 It is no longer necessary to organize these programs under government
auspices and sponsorship.  As in so many other areas, private
and nonprofit institutions in civil society are the most appropriate
providers of institutional and financial support.  
<P>
 However, the Fulbright program is a prestigious program that
has been established by mutual agreements with other countries,
including our major allies and trading partners.  Consequently,
the program should continue, but grant awards should be limited
and they should be sustained in most countries by mutual and equivalent
levels of financial support.  During the past 48 years the U.S.
has provided $1.67 billion in Fulbright funding.  The time has
come to redesign the Fulbright program.  A program intended to
establish mutual understanding that is mutually beneficial should
be mutually supported.
<P>
<B> 2.  Require Foreign Contribution Levels Equal to U.S. Government
Support.</B>  Fifty binational commissions administer most of
the major Fulbright exchanges and they have made overseas Fulbright
programs a genuine collaborative endeavor.  But the mutual role
of U.S. and foreign counterparts in administering the program
should be accompanied, in most instances, by equivalent binational
financing.  
<P>
 Currently only ten countries contribute as much financial support
to the program as the United States.  The Fulbright program should
welcome an emphasis on mutuality with Western Europe, Japan and
other nations able to support joint exchanges.  Many governments,
including those of the so-called newly industrialized countries
of Asia, spend enormous sums to sponsor their students in the
United States.  Indeed, foreign governments pay about 5 percent
of the costs of all foreign students in the U.S.  They should
be willing to transfer some of these resources to the Fulbright
program.  By raising their contributions, wealthy countries would
share with the U.S. the cost of the program. 
<P>
 If these countries are unwilling to provide support at levels
equivalent to U.S. support, then the United States should reduce
its contribution to parity.  In bilateral programs where cost-sharing
is equivalent or where the U.S. contribution is less than the
foreign counterpart, U.S. support levels should not be ratcheted
upward.  Some of the funds &quot;saved&quot; by cost-sharing adjustments
should be reallocated to programs targeting former Soviet bloc
states and other newly emerging nations in Africa, the Middle
East or South Asia that lack the resources to support international
educational exchanges.  U.S. government funding can be steadily
reduced as more countries contribute their share to the program.
<P>
<B> 3.  Tighten Oversight.</B>  The Board of Foreign Scholarships,
which has responsibility for the Fulbright program, should conduct
a comprehensive review of program operations.  In particular,
the Board should initiate discussions on the above-mentioned reallocation
of program resources and on developing ways to increase foreign
government and private sources of support.  The Board and USIA
should also consider ways to involve new segments of the American
academic community.  For instance, currently only seven percent
of scholar grants go to those teaching at liberal arts colleges
and two percent of grants go to community college teachers.  There
should also be more competition in selecting the contract agencies
that actually develop the mechanisms for the review and nomination
of Fulbright candidates.
<P>
<B> 4.  De-emphasize Western Europe.</B>  Western Europe should
be de-emphasized as a destination for American scholars and students.
 Instead, the regional emphasis should move east to the emerging
democracies of the former Warsaw Pact countires.  Resources currently
allocated to Western Europe should be shifted to Central and Eastern
Europe.  This is an area of vital interest to the United States
and one where governments lack the resources and historical connections
to develop educational exchanges with us.
<P>
<B> 5.  Give Priority to U.S. Students.</B>  In allocating financial
support the Fulbright program should give priority to American
graduate students pursuing overseas studies over American senior
scholars.  For every six foreign students in the United States
one American student goes overseas.  Very few American graduate
students pursue overseas educations in countries outside Europe.
 Here is an area where Fulbright grants can provide a real incentive.
 Such grants are far more likely to have an impact on young careers
than grants to senior scholars.  Senator Fulbright is reported
to have commented pointedly in 1987 at a Fulbright alumni conference
that he had initially conceived the program for graduate students,
not faculty with their &quot;whole damn families.&quot;    
<P>
<B> 6.  Encourage Fulbright Alumni Support.</B>  The prestige
of the Fulbright program depends on its history and its distinguished
alumni.  This constituency can continue to play an important role
in facilitating international exchanges in the future.  Prominent
former Fulbright award recipients can encourage foreign governments
and private sources to provide funding.  By anticipating reduced
U.S. government support, Fulbright alumni can help sustain a program
from which personally they have greatly benefitted.  Alumni groups
in foreign countries and in the U.S. should initiate funding for
national programs, as Japanese alumni did when they established
a scholarship endowment fund.
<P>
<B> 7.  Maintain USIA Information Services.</B>  Fulbright program
officials and related USIA offices overseas should continue to
play an important and impartial role providing information on
U.S. academic opportunities and on the many nongovernment programs
providing scholarship assistance to foreign students and scholars.
 USIA library resources of college catalogues and information
on application procedures are particularly valuable, especially
in Central and Eastern Europe. 
<P>
<B> 8.  Back to Core Values:  </B>The central value of the Fulbright
program from its inception has been the prestige it has given
to America by making possible high quality international scholar
and student exchanges.  The program should return to its historic
roots as a small and important program with a clear mission. 
The total number of grants may diminish, but the Fulbright program
can foster academic exchanges that would not otherwise occur,
especially in newly emerging democratic countries.  Just as the
Fulbright program contributed to the reconstruction of post-World
War II Europe fifty years ago, so can it assist today in the construction
of a post-Cold War world.

<B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B>
<P>
 
<P>
  How can those who wish to create a charitable foundation best
ensure that their wishes will be followed after their deaths?
<P>
 In this important and timely book, Martin Morse Wooster provides
a well-reasoned answer to this question, as well as a fascinating
overview of the individuals, ideas, and beliefs that inspired
the creation of some of America's largest foundations. In some
cases, the intentions of those who created great philanthropies
have been faithfully adhered to by trustees. Unfortunately, however,
in most cases those intentions have been either ignored or brazenly
violated. 
<P>
Drawing on an examination of foundations that have either followed
or rejected the beliefs and wishes of their founders, Wooster
outlines a set of principles that wealthy donors should bear in
mind when considering the creation of a foundation. Given that
the &quot;baby boom&quot; generation is expected to transfer an
estimated $8 to $10 trillion over the next few decades--and that
a good portion of this wealth may go to philanthropy--Wooster's
guidelines may serve to prevent donors from bequeathing wealth
in ways they would regret.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
 
<P>
 Two cultures of American anti-poverty philanthropy live upstairs
and downstairs from each other, sometimes meeting on the landings
but then moving off into different worlds and different world
views.
<P>
 We hear much about heavily funded, upstairs attempts to help
the poor through massive monetary intervention and political organization.
 Send dollars to anti-poverty organizations and provide housing
for the homeless, we are told, and all will be well.  Public relations
specialists guide the discontented and their genteel allies into
support of &quot;compassionate&quot; programs that provide healthy
salaries to those who direct them.
<P>
 We hear less about the downstairs culture that depends upon unpaid
or poorly-paid individuals spending hours of their weeks and years
of their lives in the truly compassionate activity of suffering
with those in need.  And what we hear is often overly-simplistic:
 the noble volunteer knight of the grassroots group slays the
dragon of poverty, and all live happily ever after.
<P>
 The reality is more complex.  Setting up new, downstairs programs
to combat poverty, or revitalizing stultified old ones, is hard.
 Cultural, economic and bureaucratic frustrations are often choking.
 The pioneers are sinner as well as saints, and they need to further
develop their own discipline as they seek to discipline others.
<P>
 Articles in <a href="/crc/pcs"><I>Philanthropy, Culture, and Society</I></a> over the
past three years have attempted to get at the reality.  From the
beginning, we de-emphasized theoretical essays and pressed for
descriptive reporting of both successes and failures.  Too often
those of us involved with foundations in one way or another tend
to sit at our computers and fund or write about good intentions,
without having paid our dues by pounding the pavements to find
out the reality.
<P>
 I became committed to the development of <I>Philanthropy, Culture,
and Society </I>three years ago when I attended an annual conference
of the Council on Foundations.  Two thousand foundation executives
and staff members met at the Chicago Hilton, historically -- according
to a hotel brochure -- &quot;the choice of visiting government
officials and royalty.&quot;
<P>
 Under sparkling chandeliers and surrounded by 22 karat gold leaf,
conference attendees heard about the need to help the homeless
by increasing funding for political efforts to change national
housing policy.  They contemplated such appeals while relaxing
in guest rooms &quot;richly appointed with traditional cherry
wood furnishings,&quot; according to a hotel brochure; attendees
washed their hands in bathrooms &quot;complete with gleaming brass
fixtures and lined with exquisite Italian marble.&quot;
<P>
 Attendees who really wanted to learn about homelessness, however,
could have learned far more by walking two blocks away, to the
Pacific Garden Mission.  Furnishings there were not ornate, but
the four-story mission did offer dormitories with &quot;sturdy
army-type beds&quot; for some 300 men and 40 women, with &quot;12
white porcelain showers for each floor,&quot; according to a mission
brochure.  The mission offered other amenities as well:  a guest
there placed &quot;his clothing on the hanger, which is hung for
the night in a delousing unit.&quot;
<P>
 Mirrored ballrooms at the conference were filled with rhetoric
about &quot;social change,&quot; &quot;justice,&quot; &quot;moving
toward a multicultural outlook,&quot; and &quot;accepting the
homeless as they are.&quot;  Plastic chairs on a linoleum floor
at the mission two blocks away were filled with 200 black, white
and Hispanic men and women who were in or had just come out of
the drug and alcohol culture, and their words were different:
 &quot;I praise God that He saved me from drugs,&quot; or &quot;I'm
living for drugs, I want to be free.&quot;
<P>
 The articles that follow avoid the mirrored ballrooms and concentrate
on the linoleum and the long twilight struggles that occur there.
 Some of the articles are generally positive, and others describe
the failure of attempts to merge the personal approach with government
dollars and a philanthropically correct vision of societal oppression.
 All are expressions of directed reporting:  each author appreciates
downstairs philanthropy and has pounded the pavements to describe
objective reality as accurately as he or she can.
<P>
 The articles, written by ten different authors, have several
common conclusions that I will summarize in an afterword.  But
the point of these varied articles is not simply to provide a
1-2-3 set of poverty-fighting techniques; for that, a textbook
would do as well.  Rather, these articles provide texture.  They
show the interplay of principles with hard practice.  They show
the importance of perseverance.
<P>
 Most western movies provide action but few memorable lines. 
My four sons and I the other day, however, were watching one of
the best, The Magnificent Seven (1961), which tells of how seven
Texas gunfighters come to the defense of a village that previously
had succumbed to a bandit gang.  We were struck by the words of
a gunfighter who is surrounded by a circle of admiring children.
 &quot;We are ashamed to live here,&quot; one boy says.  &quot;Our
fathers are cowards.&quot;
<P>
 The gunfighter replies, &quot;You think I am brave because I
carry a gun, but your fathers are much braver because they carry
responsibility for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your
mothers, and this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs
a ton.  It bends and twists them until finally it buries them
under the ground.  And there's nobody that says they have to do
this.  They do it because they love you and because they want
to.&quot;
<P>
 The gunfighter concludes, &quot;I have never had this kind of
courage, running a farm, working like a mule every day with no
guarantee what will ever come of it.  This is bravery.  It's why
I never even started anything like that.  It's why I never will.&quot;
 And the gunfighter is killed at the end of the film, but the
bandits are defeated and the village will be able to survive and
perhaps even thrive.
<P>
 Upstairs philanthropists think they will save our despondent
inner city villages of today by constructing some shining new
buildings and shiny new programs.  But downstairs philanthropists
seek out those people in the neighborhood who, faced with crime
and drugs and bad public schools, still try to be good citizens,
who raise their children properly.  If this responsibility were
removed, the residents would become mere drones, their lives full
of drudgery, without noble purpose.
<P>
 It is philanthropically correct to want massive government programs
that promise to transform society.  But downstairs philanthropy
says to the courageous, &quot;We honor your bravery.  We acknowledge
that though you are poor, you are doing vital work.  We will not
undermine your efforts by imposing our theories of social change.
 Instead, we will help you have safe streets and decent schools.
<P>
 &quot;We will help, not by depriving you of your purpose, but
by helping you bear the burden with dignity and a society's gratitude
-- and together, we will throw the bandits out.&quot;

          <H2>   <CENTER> Federal Court Finds Violence Against
                   Women Act Unconstitutional</CENTER></H2>

 <P>    In a case which has received national attention, Federal
Judge Jackson Kiser declared the Violence Against Women Act
(VAWA) unconstitutional.

<P>     VAWA, which passed as part of the omnibus crime bill of
1994, created a federal civil action for crimes motivated by
"discriminatory animus" against gender.  In passing VAWA,
Congress created a broad new federal tort for crimes which
traditionally have fallen under state jurisdiction.

<P>     In <EM>Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute</EM>, a
student at Virginia Tech filed suit under VAWA against two members of
the Virginia Tech football team--Antonio Morrison and James
Crawford--for
 an alleged rape.  A Virginia Federal Court found Friday that
Congress did not have constitutional authority to enact VAWA,
which if implemented would have the effect of "excessively
extending Congress's power and of inappropriately tipping the
balance [of power] away from the states."  Judge Kiser emphasized the
importance of the issues at stake in warning that "[Congress']
authority to act is limited by the Constitution, and the
constitutional limits must be respected if our federal system is to
survive."

<P>     The court's decision to strike down VAWA has the added
benefit of dismissing federal lawsuits against what by all
accounts are two innocent men.  Defendants Morrison and Crawford
were cleared of rape charges by both the Virginia Tech campus
disciplinary body and the state grand jury, yet still faced
federal VAWA charges for a complaint made over seven months after the
alleged rape, by an accuser who was unable to identify them
accurately.

 <P>    Michael E. Rosman, co-counsel for Antonio Morrison and
General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights, stated that "We
are delighted with the outcome of this case and believe that Judge
Kiser's opinion, by dint of its reasoning and careful analysis, will
influence many courts on this same issue."  Mr. Morrison is also
represented by W. David Paxton and M. Christina Floyd of the Roanoke
firm of Gentry, Locke, Rakes & Moore.  Mr. Crawford is represented by
Joseph Graham Painter, Jr., a solo practioner in Blackbury, Virginia.

<P>     To receive a copy of the decision, or for more information
about the case, call Robert Alt, Director of Public Relations and
Education for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext.
101.

                         COMPLAINT

               NATURE AND SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

1. This is a civil action for declaratory and injunctive relief
arising from defendants' violation of plaintiff's constitutional
and civil rights and liberties under the United States
Constitution and federal law. 

2.   Plaintiff COLUMBIA UNION COLLEGE, a private college
affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, seeks:
  
(a)  a declaration that the conduct of the defendants in
applying and administering the Father Sellinger Program for
the State of Maryland, which denies plaintiff the same benefits
(including, but not limited to, eligibility to receive financial
aid paid to Maryland schools of higher education) granted other
similarly situated colleges and universities, and which denies
plaintiff such funds solely and expressly because of the content
or viewpoint of plaintiff's speech and beliefs, violates
plaintiffs rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association,
free exercise of religion, and to equal protection under the law,
as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution; 

(b)  a permanent order enjoining defendants from continuing to
apply a policy of discriminating against plaintiff in the
appropriation of Father Sellinger Program financial aid or in any
other manner on the basis of: the content or viewpoint of
plaintiff's speech and belief or on the basis of the content or
viewpoint of the speech of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with
which plaintiff is affiliated; its expression; its exercise of
religion; or its association;

(c)  such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

                       JURISDICTION

3.   This action arises under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction
over the claims is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. Sections
1331 and 1343, by 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983, and by 42 U.S.C.
Section 2000bb-l(c). Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. Section 1983, and claims all available relief pursuant to
that statute, including attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. Section
1998.

                            VENUE

4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section
1391(b).

5. Plaintiff COLUMBIA UNION COLLEGE ("Columbia Union"), is a
private, four year college affiliated with the Seventh-day
Adventist Church located in Tacoma Park, Maryland in Montgomery
County.  Columbia Union was founded in 1904, and is and was at
all times relevant herein a four year college granting associate
and baccalaureate degrees in the liberal arts, sciences, and
certain professional fields.        

6.   Defendant the MARYLAND HIGHER EDUCATION COMMISSION (the

                      GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23.  As provided for in the Code of Maryland, Education, Title
17, the Commission is charged with the authority to implement and
administer the Father Sellinger Program.  One of its
responsibilities is to receive and review applications for aid
and determine whether the institutions applying for aid are
eligible to receive Father Sellinger Program funds under the
criteria set forth in Md. Code Ann, Edu. Section 17-103.

24.  Md. Code Ann. Edu. Section 17-103 sets forth the following
eligibility requirements: 

1)  the institution must have been established prior to July 1,
1970; 2) it must be accredited by the State Department of
Education; 3) it must maintain more than one associate of arts or
baccalaureate degree programs; 4) it must submit for approval any
new programs or major alteration of programs to the Commission;
and 5) it must refrain from utilizing any of the money payable
under the Father Sellinger Program for sectarian purposes.

25.  Currently, and at all times relevant herein, the
Commission has set forth the guidelines and procedures for the
distribution of Father Sellinger Program funds to eligible
institutions.

26.  During the period relevant to this lawsuit, the Commission,
subject to the review of the Maryland Board of Public Works and
the recommendation of the Maryland Attorney General, regularly
distributed Father Sellinger Program Funds to colleges and
universities within Maryland.  Upon information and belief, this
practice dates back at least to 1957. 

27.  Upon information and belief, colleges and universities 
receiving Father Sellinger Program funds in the past have
included institutions that are affiliated with religions.  For
example, Mount St. Mary's College, Loyola University, and Notre
Dame College of Maryland have received Father Sellinger Program
funds and are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.  These
institutions are dedicated to the Catholic point of view and have
engaged in and continue to engage in sectarian activities and
expression. 

28.  In January 1990, Columbia Union submitted an application
to receive Father Sellinger Program funds to the Commission. 

29.  The application of Columbia Union for Father Sellinger
Program funds conformed with all applicable, content-neutral
Commission requirements.  In particular, Columbia Union was
established before July 1, 197O; it was then and is now
accredited by the State Department of Education; it maintains
numerous degree programs other than seminarian or theological
degrees; it agreed to submit any new programs or major program
alteration to the Commission for approval; and it agreed to use
Father Sellinger Program funds for non-sectarian purposes only.
                                
30.  On April 14, 1992, the Commission found that the college is
"pervasively sectarian" and denied Columbia Union's application
for aid. 

31.  The Commission offered no reason other than the alleged
status of Columbia Union as "pervasively sectarian" as a
basis to deny funding.

32.  On December 27, 1995, Dr. Charles Scriven, President of
Columbia Union, sought reconsideration of the Commission's
refusal to provide Columbia Union with Father Sellinger Program
Funds in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court
in Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors at the University of
Virginia, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (1995).

33. On January 22, 1996, defendant William P. Howard, Assistant
Attorney General of Maryland, writing at the request of the
Commission, replied to Dr. Scriven's request, stating that
"unless the nature and practices of Columbia Union have changed
very substantially since 1992, I do not believe there would be
any point in pursuing a new application for private aid at this
time." 

34.  Defendants have denied, and, unless enjoined, will continue
to deny Father Sellinger Program funds to plaintiff solely and
expressly on the basis of plaintiff's viewpoint, content of its
expression, and the free exercise of religion by its faculty and
students. 

35.  Defendants cannot demonstrate a compelling interest
sufficient to justify the denial of Father Sellinger Program
funds to plaintiff, nor can defendants demonstrate that the
denial of funding is narrowly drawn to satisfy any such state
interest.

                     COUNT ONE: VIOLATION OF
                FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

36.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 35
am incorporated herein by this reference.

37.  Although defendants have provided Father Sellinger Program
funding to a wide variety of colleges and universities that
engage in religious and secular expression, defendants have
illegally and unconstitutionally denied plaintiff Father
Sellinger Program funds based solely an the content or viewpoint
of plaintiffs speech, communications, identity, activities, or
affiliation.
 
38.  Plaintiff has unjustifiably and unlawfully been denied
benefits to which it was and is entitled as an eligible
institution as set forth in Maryland Code, Education, Title 17. 
This loss was the result of state action. This state action
violated and continues to violate plaintiff's rights of free
speech and free association under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution. The denial of
Father Sellinger Program funds to plaintiff constitutes
impermissible viewpoint and content discrimination. There exists
no compelling state interest to justify the defendants' actions. 
Moreover, even if there is some compelling state interest,
defendants actions are not narrowly tailored to achieve that
interest.

39.  The Commission's guidelines and definitions for allocating
Father Sellinger Program funds to institutions are unlawfully
vague in that persons of common intelligence must necessarily
guess at their meaning and differ as to their application, and
are also overbroad in that they reach constitutionally protected
activity.

40.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of free speech, free association and free exercise
of religion, and to the furtherance of its lawful activities.

                 COUNT TWO: VIOLATION OF FREE
                     EXERCISE OE RELIGION

41.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 40
are incorporated herein by this reference.

42. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution prohibits government discrimination in
the allocation of benefits or imposition of burdens based upon an
individual's or group's religious beliefs, character, or
affiliation, or based upon the religious content of their
expression and is applicable to state action under the Fourteenth
Amendment. 

43.  Defendants impermissibly and unlawfully denied plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds generally available to other
Maryland colleges and universities. This denial was based upon
plaintiff's religious beliefs, character, affiliation, speech,
and association.

44.  Defendants have not shown and cannot show that denying
plaintiff Father Sellinger Program funds to which it is lawfully
entitled is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, nor
can defendants show that such a denial is a narrowly drawn
means of achieving that interest. 

45.  Defendants' conduct has deprived and continues to deprive
plaintiff of its right to free exercise of religion as guaranteed
under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution. 

46.  Defendants' conduct constitutes a failure to give reasonable
accommodation to plaintiff's religious beliefs.

47.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of the
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of religious freedom and to the furtherance of its
lawful activities.

                  COUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF EQUAL
                       PROTECTION OF THE LAWS

48.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 47 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

49.  By denying plaintiff the benefits to which other colleges
and universities are entitled, defendants unlawfully and
unconstitutionally have treated and continue to treat plaintiff
differently from other similarly situated colleges and
universities on the basis of the content or viewpoint of its
speech, association, beliefs, character, affiliation, identity,
and activity.

50.  By denying plaintiff the benefits that other colleges and
universities engaging in religious speech and activities receive
and have received, defendants unlawfully and unconstitutionally
treat plaintiff differently from other similarly situated
colleges and universities on the basis of its religious speech,
association, beliefs, character, affiliation, identity, and
activity. 

51.  Defendants' conduct under color of state law violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution in that it constitutes discrimination on a
suspect basis and violates fundamental constitutional rights. 
This violation is not justified by a compelling state interest
and is not accomplished by narrowly drawn means. Defendants have
singled out plaintiff and denied it Father Sellinger Program
funds based upon the content or viewpoint of its affiliation, its
speech, its expression, and its association.

52.  Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury to its
rights of equal protection under the law, and to the furtherance
of its lawful activities, by virtue of the unlawful policies
and conduct of the defendants.

                      COUNT IV: VIOLATION OF
                 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT

53.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 52 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

54.  Defendants impermissibly and unlawfully denied plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds generally available to other
Maryland colleges and universities.  This denial was based upon
plaintiff's religious beliefs, character, affiliation, speech,
and association.

55.  Defendants' denial of Father Sellinger Program funds to
plaintiff substantially burdens the free exercise of religion by
plaintiff and its students and faculty.

56.  Defendants have not shown and cannot show that denying
plaintiff Father Sellinger Program funds to which it is lawfully
entitled is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, nor
can defendants show that such a denial is a narrowly drawn means
of achieving that interest. 

57.  By virtue of the unlawful policies and conduct of the
defendants, plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury
to its rights of religious freedom and to the furtherance of its
lawful activities, in violation of Religious Freedom Restoration
Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 2000bb through 2000bb-4.

                     PETITION FOR RELIEF

58.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 57 are
incorporated herein by this reference.

59.  Plaintiff has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at
law.

60.  Plaintiff is suffering, and will continue to suffer, 
irreparable injury for the period of the continued violation
of its constitutional rights. 

61.  Absent an injunction, defendants will continue to
violate Columbia Union's constitutional and statutory rights.

WHEREFORE, having stated claims against the defendants under the
United States Constitution and federal law, plaintiff petitions
this Court for the following relief:          

A.   a declaratory judgment that the conduct of the defendants in
establishing and applying a policy for the State of Maryland
which refuses to allow the same benefits to plaintiff as to other
similar colleges and universities (benefits including the receipt
of Father Sellinger Program funds) and which denies plaintiff
Father Sellinger Program funds solely and expressly because of
the content or viewpoint of its speech (1) violates plaintiffs
rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, free
exercise of religion, and to equal protection under the law, as
guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United
States Constitution, and (2) that such actions of defendants are
in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sections 2000bb et seq.;

B.   a permanent order enjoining the defendants from maintaining
and applying a policy of discrimination against plaintiff in the
appropriation of Father Sellinger Program funds or in any other
manner on the basis of plaintiff's speech or on the basis of the
content or viewpoint of the speech or the religion with which
plaintiff is affiliated;

C.  an order awarding plaintiff reasonable costs and attorneys'
fees pursuant to Section 2 of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees
Award Act of 1976, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 (1988); and

D. Such other relief as the court deems just and proper.

                             <H2> In Administration of Tuition Assistance Program</H2><BR></CENTER>


        
<P>        Columbia Union College filed a lawsuit in Federal Court Wednesday claiming that Maryland's
Higher Education Commission unconstitutionally discriminated against the college's religious viewpoint in
its administration of the Father Sellinger Program.  The program, established in 1971, provides state
funding to Maryland's private colleges--both religious and non-religious--to reduce tuition costs.

<P>        Columbia Union, a Seventh-day Adventist college located in Tacoma Park, Maryland, complies
with all state eligibility requirements for Sellinger funding, including a provision requiring recipients to
refrain from using funds for sectarian purposes.  Nevertheless, CUC was denied funding based upon the
commission's claim that the school is "pervasively religious," making it ineligible for funding due to
perceived church-state separation requirements arising from the First Amendment's Establishment
Clause.  Maryland has continued to deny CUC funding since its initial request in 1991, despite funding
other religious schools, including Mount St. Mary's College, Loyola University, and College of Notre
Dame of Maryland.

 <P>       CUC is challenging Maryland's decision, claiming that denial of funds on the basis of religious
viewpoint constitutes a violation of Free Speech and Free Exercise rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  This claim is supported by the Supreme
Court's 1995 decision in Rosenberger v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in which
the Court found the University of Virginia's refusal to grant funding to a student publication solely on the
basis of religious viewpoint violated the Free Speech guarantee of the First Amendment.

 <P>       Columbia Union is represented by R. Hewitt Pate of Hunton & Williams, and by the Center for
Individual Rights, a non-profit public interest law firm which represented the successful plaintiffs in
Rosenberger.

  <P>      Michael Rosman, General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights declared:  "Maryland's
discrimination against Columbia Union violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act, and simply cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court's decision in
Rosenberger.  We are pleased to represent CUC in this case."

  <P>      To receive a copy of the complaint, or for more information, please call Robert Alt, Director of
Public Affairs for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext. 101.

<H3>THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE</H3>
</center>
<P>Publication of this extra-length <I>Docket Report</I> was delayed by the Fifth Circuit's momentous 
ruling in <I>Hopwood v. State of Texas</I>, our challenge to racial preferences in student admissions at the 
University of Texas Law School.  We won, and UT lost.  The defendants have asked for an emergency stay, 
arguing <I>inter alia</I> that the cessation of discrimination in student admissions would impose &quot;administrative 
burdens.&quot;  Details on the decision and its near-nuclear fallout on pages 2-5 of this <I>Report</I>.
<P>
<P>In addition to the <I>Hopwood</I> home run, we scored an anti-quota double.  In February, we settled 
a lawsuit against the National Science Foundation and Texas A &amp; M over selected-minorities-only 
summer study programs.  The defendants agreed to pay damages and fees and to desist from further race 
discrimination.  And in March, Ohio State University shelled out $368,000 to end our attack on OSU's 
minorities-only contracting program.  These matters having been settled, we teed up two additional 
race-exclusive programs with federal participation--one in Delaware, the other in Texas.
<P>
<P>In Ithaca, NY, Judge Rumsey of the New York Supreme Court (Tompkins County) heard oral 
arguments on Cornell University's motion to dismiss our lawsuit on behalf of Professor James B. Maas.  
While the motion is still pending, a Cornell faculty committee has concluded that the procedures under 
which Maas was sentenced were egregiously flawed, amply confirming our contention that Jim Maas got shafted.
<P>
<P>Speaking of which, we have agreed to represent two additional victims of the harassment craze.  
Cid Scallet was fired from his teaching job at the University of Virginia's Darden School of 
Management because the powers-that-be hated his politics.  Unable to find a legitimate reason for firing Scallet, 
Darden officials framed him for sexual harassment, the allegation being that Scallet modeled his socks 
provocatively in front of his class.  (No, we're not kidding). 
<P>
<P>More serious charges have been leveled against CIR client Antonio Morrison, a black student 
athlete at Virginia Polytechnic University:  a white female fellow-student has falsely accused Morrison 
of rape and has filed a lawsuit against against him, Virginia Tech, and other defendants.  The plaintiff 
has made a claim under the federal Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which penalizes crimes 
committed against women because of a discriminatory animus.  The &quot;proof&quot; of Morrison's mysogynist bias is 
his alleged failure to wear a condom during an assault he did not commit.
<P>
<P>The country has gone insane, but we're here to save it.  Evidence, as always, in these pages.

 <H2>            Consent Decree in <EM>Henry Painting v. OSU</EM> <BR>Enjoins The State of Ohio<BR>
 From Continuing 100% Racial Set-Aside<BR>
State To Pay Plaintiff $368,000 in Damages And Fees</H2>
  </STRONG><BR><BR>
 <H3> Federal Judge to Monitor State's Compliance for Next 5 Years</H3></CENTER>

   <P>  Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University, a widely watched
lawsuit challenging OSU's one-hundred percent minority set-aside, ended
today when the parties signed a binding judicial consent degree.  

<P>     In a stunning victory for the plaintiff, the State of Ohio
agreed to an injunction against "considering race, color, national
origin, gender, social or economic disadvantage, or any factor
other than standard State procurement policies and practices, in
awarding painting contracts at The Ohio State University."  

 <P>    OSU further agreed to pay the plaintiff, Mr. Jerry Henry,
$368,000 in damages and attorneys' fees in exchange for Mr. Henry's
agreement to drop his lawsuit.  Under the terms of the consent
decree, the federal court will retain jurisdiction over the case
for five years.  Should OSU violate the terms of the decree, the
court may impose "all sanctions and remedies authorized by law or
equity." 

 <P>    "I am delighted that we have won." said Mr. Henry.  "My case
has forced the University to end its decade-long practice of
setting aside 100% of painting contacts exclusively on the basis of
race."         

 <P>    Henry, who operates a small, family-run painting company in
Columbus, had filed the case in federal district court for the
Southern District of Ohio on March 30, 1994, after years of racial
discrimination by OSU.

 <P>    Until 1986, Mr. Henry had done hundreds of thousands of
dollars of business each year with OSU.   Beginning in 1986,
however, and continuing through the filing of the lawsuit, the
University refused to allow Mr. Henry to bid on painting contracts
solely because he is white.   

 <P>    OSU engaged in this blatant racial discrimination pursuant to
an Ohio State Minority Business Act, applicable to all state
agencies, which sets aside 15 percent of total state expenditures
each year for selected minority-owned businesses.  Because OSU was
unable to locate any minority bidders in certain lines of work, it
contrived to reach its 15 percent "goal" by reserving all of its
painting contracts exclusively for minorities.  OSU and State
officials rejected Henry's repeated requests to change the policy.

<P>      "The results of this lawsuit will have far-reaching
consequences," said Michael A. Carvin of Shaw, Pittman, Potts and
Trowbridge, who represented Mr. Henry jointly with attorneys at the
Center for Individual Rights.  "The case shows that the State of
Ohio is incapable of defending the constitutionality of its
Minority Business Enterprise Act.  In light of the substantial
damages in this case, it's only a matter of time before the State's
entire system of racial preferences comes tumbling down."

<P>     Michael P. McDonald, President of the Center for Individual
Rights and Carvin's co-counsel on the case, added:  "The Henry
decree is part of the larger trend that we are seeing of successful
lawsuits to end racial discrimination.  I would expect to see state
agencies in Ohio and elsewhere to take a very hard look at their
set-aside practices unless they, too, want to be sued."

<P>     The Center for Individual Rights is a non-profit public
interest law firm based in Washington, D.C.  CIR provides free
legal assistance to deserving clients in cases raising important
legal and constitutional issues.  Last week, CIR won an important
legal victory for its clients in <EM>Hopwood v. State of Texas</EM>, a case
in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ended
racial preferences in student admissions to the University of Texas
Law School.

Plaintiffs,						Case No. C2-94-0196

-v-							JUDGE SMITH

THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, ET AL.,

Defendants.
</PRE>
<CENTER><U>CONSENT DECREE</U></CENTER>
<P>This action was filed by Plaintiffs on March 10, 1994 seeking a
judgment declaring unconstitutional certain provisions of the
Ohio Minority Business Enterprise Act (Ohio Rev. Code SS 122.71,
123.141 and 125.081)("OMBEA").  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
have unconstitutionally discriminated against them on the basis
of race in the awarding of contracts for painting only to
minority businesses.  These allegations were denied by
Defendants.  The Court's jurisdiction is invoked pursuant to 28
U.S.C. SS 2201 and 2202.   Plaintiffs also seek a permanent
injunction preventing Defendants from applying or enforcing the
OMBEA, and monetary damages under 24 U.S.C. SS 2000d and 2000d-7.
Nothing contained in this Consent Decree, and no actions taken by
Defendants with respect to this Decree, shall be treated         
as an admission of liability by Defendants.

    <P>      The Plaintiffs and Defendants, in good faith, desire to
amicably compromise, settle, and resolve their dispute so as to
avoid the costs and inconvenience of further litigation. 
Accordingly, the parties have consented to the entry of this
Consent Decree subject to approval and entry by the Court.<BR><BR>

<P>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant, The Ohio State University
will notify and undertake an educational program as to its

this Decree shall be provided to all new members of the Board of
Trustees, and any new employee responsible for the awarding
and/or selection of painting contractors, or who assume these
responsibilities, within thirty (30) days of taking the office or
assuming such responsibilities.<BR><BR>

III. <U>MONETARY PAYMENT</U>

<P>IT IS ALSO ORDERED, that on or by April 30, 1996, Defendant The
Ohio State University shall deliver a certified check payable to
Henry Painting Company and Jerry Henry, jointly, in the amount of
Two Hundred and Forty Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($240,000.00). 
The payment of this sum is in full settlement of any claims that
Plaintiffs have or ever had against Defendants.


<P>IT IS ALSO ORDERED that on or by April 30, 1996, Defendant The
Ohio State University shall deliver a certified check payable to
the Center for Individual Rights in the amount of One Hundred
Twenty Eight Thousand Dollars and 00/100 ($128,000.00).  The

reasonable attorney fees in this case.


  <P>        Plaintiffs shall also execute, on or by April 30, 1996,
a release signifying that the amounts received pursuant to this
order represent full and complete compensation for all alleged

otherwise, to perform any obligation imposed by, or otherwise
comply with this Decree, they will be subject to all sanctions
and remedies authorized by law-or equity.  The Court shall retain
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this order.  After five
years from entry of this Order, Defendants may move for

<h2>FIFTH CIRCUIT PANEL INVALIDATES<BR>
                                  RACE PREFERENCES IN STUDENT ADMISSIONS</h2>

                                                                          March 19, 1996<BR>

</CENTER>
   <P>     In a widely-followed case, a unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held
that the University of Texas Law School's use of racial preferences in student admissions is
unconstitutional.

  <P>      In its March 18 decision, Hopwood v. State of Texas, the Fifth Circuit declared that
"diversity" is not a "compelling state interest" that would justify the use of racial preferences. 
The Court stated that "[w]ithin the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of
race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims
of equal protection.  Diversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race.  It treats
minorities as a group, rather than as individuals."  The Fifth Circuit held that Justice Powell's
opinion in Board of Regents v. Bakke, in which he advocated the consideration of race to achieve
"diversity," never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court.

<P>        The Fifth Circuit held further that the government may employ racial preferences only
as a means of redressing past discrimination by a particular government unit--in this case, UT
Law School.  Racial preferences may not be used to redress alleged discrimination by entire
educational systems. 

 <P>       Theodore B. Olson, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, expressed satisfaction with the ruling. 
"This is a strong opinion that clarifies the law in many important areas," Olson said.  "We
expect that the University of Texas will now comply with the Constitution."  Added his co-
counsel, Michael E. Rosman of the Center for Individual Rights:  "The opinion exposes the folly
of thinking that we can get beyond race by taking race into account.  The decision will be widely
discussed." 

<P>        The Fifth Circuit panel was composed of Judges Jerry E. Smith (who wrote the court's
opinion), Harold DeMoss, and Jacques Wiener. 
  
  <P>      The plaintiffs in the case, white applicants to the 1992 incoming class, were denied
admission on the basis of their race despite their superior qualifications.  Cheryl Hopwood and
Douglas Carvell are represented pro bono by Theodore B. Olson and Douglas Cox of Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher and by Michael E. Rosman, General Counsel of the Center for Individual
Rights.

<P>        For comments call Theodore B. Olson at (202) 955-8500.  Copies of the opinion and
further information may be obtained from CIR at (202) 833-8400, ext. 103 or 104.    <BR><BR>

</FONT></B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>
<B>By Harry V. Jaffa</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

In their convention acceptance speeches, both Bob Dole and Jack Kemp declared that the Republican Party is the party of Lincoln. But just what is the connection between the Republican Party of 1860 and that of 1996?

<p>

The essence of slavery, Lincoln said, was expressed in the proposition &quot;You work; I'll eat.&quot; Upon his election as president, he was besieged by office seekers who drove him to distraction. Lincoln was blunt in his judgment of the great majority of them: They wanted to eat without working. Lincoln saw the demand for the protection of slavery and the demand for government sinecures to be at bottom one and the same. The origin of all constitutional rights, according to Lincoln, was the right that a man had to own himself, and therefore to own the product of his own labor. Government exists to protect that right, and to regulate property only to make it more valuable to its possessors. 

<p>
Today, the pro-slavery impulse still governs the Democratic Party, the party of government sinecures. It is the party that wants to use political power to tax us not for any common good, but to eat while we work. Consider the Great Society and its legacy.

<p>
In the fall of 1964, I was on the speech-writing staff of the Goldwater campaign. In September and October I went on a number of forays to college campuses, where I debated spokesmen for our opponents. My argument always started from here: In 1964 the economy--thanks to the Kennedy tax cuts--was growing at the remarkable annual rate of four percent. But federal revenues were growing at 20 percent: five times as fast. 

<p>
The real issue in the election, I said, was what was to happen to that cornucopia of revenue. Barry Goldwater would use it to reduce the deficit and to further reduce taxes; Lyndon Johnson would use it to start vast new federal programs. At that point I could not say what programs, but I knew that the real purpose of them would be to create a new class of dependents upon the Democratic Party. The ink was hardly dry on the election returns before Johnson invented the war on poverty--and proved my prediction correct.

<p>
One did not need to be cynical to see that the poor were not a reason for the expansion of bureaucracy; the expansion of bureaucracy was a reason for the poor. Every failure to reduce poverty was always represented as another reason to increase expenditures on the poor. The ultimate beneficiary was the Democratic Party. Every federal bureaucrat became in effect a precinct captain, delivering the votes of his constituents. His job was to enlarge the pool of constituents. But every increase in that pool meant a diminution of our property and our freedom.

<p>
The recently passed law to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; came about because a lethargic public has been aroused at last, not by the failure of the welfare system but by its success. The public indignation, however, would have been of no effect had we not elected a Republican Congress. No Democratic Congress would ever have passed such a law.

<p>
Just as welfare reform may help end the poverty industry, the California Civil Rights Initiative on the November ballot may lead to the demise of another 1960s product, the racism and sexism industry. The 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed discrimination based upon race, sex, color, religion or ethnic origin. The act was based on the premise that the only race to which a person must belong is the human race. With respect to God-given natural rights, &quot;all men are created equal.&quot;

<p>
The civil rights establishment, led by the NAACP, fought the good fight that led to the <I>Brown v. Board of Education</I> decision in 1954 and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965. They fought that fight under the banner of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which reflected the equality proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.

<p>
The classic statement of this principle is to be found in Justice John Marshall Harlan's dissenting opinion in <I>Plessy v. Ferguson</I>, the infamous 1896 decision that enshrined "separate but equal" into constitutional law for more than half a century: &quot;In view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior dominant ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution is color blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.&quot;

<p>
Everyone knows that Hubert Humphrey, one of the chief authors and sponsors of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, had declared that under Title VII no discrimination on the basis of race or color was to be lawful. He explicitly said that this meant no discrimination of white against black, and no discrimination of black against white.

<p>
Suddenly, however, remedies for something called &quot;racism&quot; became the order of the day. (The word itself--like &quot;sexism&quot;--is of recent coinage and will not be found in any older dictionaries.) The civil rights movement, premised upon individual rights, suddenly became the black power movement, premised upon group rights. &quot;Affirmative action&quot; became a euphemism for the baldest kind of racial discrimination. That whites had long enjoyed preference over blacks was now taken to be a justification for blacks having preference over whites. What was lost sight of was that the evil of the past--whether of slavery or of Jim Crow--was evil not because it was done by whites to blacks, but because it was done by some human beings to other human beings. The purpose of the law was to end evil acts, not continue them in the guise of &quot;affirmative action.&quot;

<p>
Affirmative action, rightly understood, would justify a wide variety of outreach programs for those whose lives have been stultified by poverty, broken families, bad schools, and neighborhoods filled with drugs, crime and gangs. One can heartily commend a program for tutoring young blacks, or young whites, who had never had a genuine teacher in a real classroom. One cannot, however, commend a program of raising the grades of young blacks--but not young whites--without having raised their skills. And what possible justification can there be there for giving scholarship assistance to the child of a black middle-class family, while denying it to a poor white? Can one imagine a more crass disregard for the genuine meaning of the Equal Protection Clause?

<p>
The priests of this new religion of &quot;affirmative action&quot; are not without material interests. Hundreds of millions of corporate dollars are spent annually on &quot;sensitivity training.&quot; Within the universities, centers for black, brown and women's (i.e., feminist) studies are being established, with vast amount of patronage bestowed upon them. Traditional courses in Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Shakespeare and the Bible continue to appear in the catalogs, but they are increasingly taught by &quot;deconstructionists,&quot; who have no interest in the texts, but only in subjective reactions to the texts.

<p>
Abraham Lincoln was self-educated. His curriculum included Shakespeare, the Bible, Euclid and the Declaration of Independence--the monuments to the freedom of the human soul, the possession not of Western man, but of a humanity compounded of all colors and every condition. In Independence Hall on Feb. 22, 1861, Lincoln asked what it was, above all else, that went forth to the world on July 4, 1776. It was not, he said, the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland; but something in that Declaration giving hope to the world for all future time. The Declaration gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all would have an equal chance. These are the principles upon which the Republican Party must stand, in 1996 no less than in 1860.

</center>

<hr size=4 noshade>

<P>

The Claremont Institute finds the answers to our nation's problems in the principles 
on which America was founded.  It upholds the ideas of liberty and equality.  It 
believes there can be no freedom and justice without a limited and accountable 
government that respects private property, promotes stable family life and maintains 
secure borders and a strong defense.

<P>

The Claremont Institute believes that an informed public can and will make the 
right choices for America's future.  Through its books, policy briefings and articles, 
its lectures, debates and seminars, the Institute engages Americans in an outgoing 
discussion about how they are governed and how their government can be improved.

<P>

Based in California, the Claremont Institute is a major force on the political 
landscape in the nation's largest and most pivotal state.  Its work is also national 
in scope: Institute studies have led to public outrage at the practices of Congress, 
public awareness of an ongoing attack on the American family and to significant 
change in environmental and property rights law.

<P>

The Institute's work is only beginning.  Today, our state and federal governments 
spend vast and increasing sums of public money for less and less good.  The 
public sector grows at the expense of the private.  Regulations intrude into every 
corner of our economic and private lives.  Schools no longer perform.  Police and 
courts no longer protect.  Good businesses are being driven to extinction by 
excessive and discriminatory controls and as a result good jobs continue to 
disappear.  Dependence grows and opportunity wanes with each passing year.

<P>

But America's Founders endowed our Republic with sound principles that bear on 
these problems and a framework for governing that is unmatched in the history of mankind.

<P>

The great conservative victories of 1994 can only be made lasting if they are 
guided by a return to these principles.  The work of the Claremont Institute, 
"the scholarship of the politics of freedom," has as its core these great principles.  
These victories have given the Claremont Institute a unique opportunity to advance 
the application of these principles of the founding to an important audience of 
reform-minded legislators.

<P>

Along with our on-going programs we have launched a series of strategic projects 
that will capitalize on these victories and ensure that the conservative realignment 
is a lasting one:

<P>

In conjunction with William F. Buckley's <i>National Review</i> magazine, the Institute 
publishes <i>National Review West</i>, an insert that goes to 80,000 conservatives in 
the western United States.  <i>NR West</i> features articles by the west's top 
conservatives on issues of state and national import.

<P>

Under the guidance of Distinguished Fellow William Rusher we are 
conducting a series of conferences entitled Project '96.  These 
conferences aim at deepening the debate among American conservatives 
about how to solve the most critical problems facing our country.  
These conferences will address welfare reform, the environment, 
federalism, and the breakdown of the American family.  

<P>

The Claremont Institute believes America's resources are greater than her 
problems.  Its mission is to restore the great principles on which our great 
nation was founded and to recover the institutions that proceed from them.

   <h1>Our Programs</h1>

</center>

<hr size=4 noshade>

<P>

The Claremont Institute is composed of four centers, each with a unique 
mission and a distinct responsibility.

<h4>The Golden State Center for Policy Studies</h4>

Through the Golden State Center in Sacramento, Claremont Institute 
scholars produce publications that educate public policy makers, the 
media, and interested citizens on California policy issues such as the 
budget, education, environmental regulation, workers' compensation, 
health care, and welfare reform.  Golden State Center policy briefings 
have become an important resource for reform-minded state legislators.

<h4>The Salvatori Center for the American Constitution</h4>

The Salvatori Center conducts academic programs that educate high 
school teachers and journalists in the principles of American Democracy.  
The work of the Center is to combat the disastrous trend toward 
multi-culturalism and anti-Americanism and to instill in teachers a deep 
understanding of the American founding.  The Center's publications have 
received national media attention.

<h4>The Asian Studies Center</h4>

The Asian Studies Center holds conferences and publishes books and 
essays on Pacific Rim issues.  Its work has been instrumental in promoting 
a greater understanding of the economic and strategic importance of the 
Far East.  The center has published on a number of issues including trade 
relations, Chinese reunification, defense burden sharing and the future of the 
pro-democracy movement in Communist China. 

<h4>The Center for the Study of the Natural Law</h4>

The Center for the Study of the Natural Law publishes books and essays 
on the state of family life in America.  Its work is directed at national and 
state policy makers to draw attention to the disastrous decline in morality 
that follows from failed social policies.  Recent publications include: On the 
Front Lines of the Culture War: Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America 
and Moral Ideas for America.

<B>

   "Where do we look for innovative, free market solutions to the problems 
   that confront California and our nation?  We turn to organizations like 
   the Claremont Institute, where some of America's top conservative 
   thinkers do their work."

   "Right now there are very few groups that are effective against the liberal 
   policies and special interests that are corrupting our system.  Fortunately, 
   the Claremont Institute is an exception.  That's why I have chosen to become 
   a part of their efforts."

<H1><B>FREE's Mission Statement</B></H1>
<P>FREE is a research and educational foundation.  Its purpose is to advance conservation and environmental values consistent with individual freedom and responsibility.  We develop and advocate environmental policies whose goals are realized through private property rights, market incentives, and voluntary organizations.  </P>
<P>Free works with leaders in universities, businesses, environmental groups, government, the media, and think-tanks.  We conduct seminars and conferences, sponsor and write books and articles, and organize special issues of magazines.  </P>
<P>Our most valuable contributions to public policy and the economy come from our incentive-based, free-enterprise alternatives to the policies of the collective environmentalists.  FREE works with a substantial number of academics and writers who hold principled commitments to the ideals of America's Founding Fathers.  These individuals have earned the respect of the policy community for their intellectual integrity and independence.</P>
<P>Essentially, FREE provides an organized forum for developing and debating approaches to ecological issues consistent with the classical liberal values of free enterprise and individual responsibility.  FREE analyses proposals of environmentalists who reject markets and incentives in favor of a bureaucratic, command-and-control approach.  Many professional policy analysts agree that we have earned the intellectual high ground.</P>
<P>Now that all politicians claim to be environmentalists, and the &quot;green&quot; movement is picking up great momentum, their is huge potential for mischief.  Environmental quality can be harmonized with a society of free and responsible individuals.  FREE shows how these goals can go together.  At this time, support for FREE's work is an especially important investment in the public policy arena.</P>  <!--FOOT--><HR>

<H1>Democracies Don't Fight-- Except Over Fish</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The first lesson of international relations is that democracies don't go to war with on another.  In his 1994 State of the Union addresss, President Clinton said that no two democracies have ever warred with each other.  The conventional wisdom is that world peace can be achieved through universal democracy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this is not quite true.  There are important exceptions.  And exceptions probe, never prove, rules.  The exception that makes even established democracies take up arms against one another is fish.
</P>
<P>
Consider recent history:  Diplomatic relations between Canada and the U.S., uniquely amicable, are nowhere more antagonistic than over fisheries policy.  Canada has fired upon New Englanders allegedly poaching scallops.   At the end of 1992, twenty Scottish trawlers blockaded one of their own harbors to prevent French supertrawlers from using the port.  A few months later, German and Danish fishermen went on strike and Scottish fishermen spilled oil on Russian catches.  Meanwhile in France riotous fishermen confronted the British Royal Navy, French riot police, and blockaded ports.  Last year, Spain dispatched armed naval vessels to fisheries off Canada's coast as part of an ongoing dispute which included the seizure of Spanish vessels on the high seas by Canadian gunboats.  For decades Brits, Norweigans, and Icelanders have exchanged shots in naval skirmishes as part of their "cod wars".  More recently, violence between Spain and Portugal has escalated from knives and axes to naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
And it gets worse elsewhere:  A Falklands naval vessel chased Taiwanese fishermen all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Russia has sent warships to the high seas to "protect" them from foreigners, like the Japanese.  Earlier this year, the "pacific" island nation of Kiribati (population 79,000) arrested and detained a Puyallup man and his vessel at machine-gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Could the stakes be so high that fish bring violence and conflict to otherwise peaceful relations?  Hardly, if you consider that fishing accounts for less than 1% of the GDP in most of Europe and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This instability doesn't bode well for the post-Cold War peace.  If we can't manage the diplomacy of fish, how can we manage nukes, human rights, or terrorism?  Moreover, the problems keep mounting. The number of fishermen has doubled since 1970, while their catch has been falling steadily since 1989.  This means more over-capitalized fishermen fighting over the last scraps of dwindling fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Why do democracies fight over fish?  An incomplete legal system provides no clear way to settle conflicts.  Fisheries can fall under national jurisdiction, no jurisdiction, and sometimes both.  As fish and fishermen cross borders, laws change and cheating becomes an artform.  In the European Union, for example, illegal catches amount to half the legitimate total.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, fisheries heritage promotes tension, misbehaving, and conflict.  National politics coddle fishermen, giving them privileges akin to those of farmers.  Protections include cash subsidies, free access to public fisheries, and navies eager to punish foreigners for fishing improprieties.  Worldwide, governments spend an estimated $54 billion in subsidies to harvest just $70 billion in fish.  This means the net value of the world's fisheries is only $16 billion -- Phillip Morris had triple that in sales last year, the cosmetics industry ten times that.
</P>
<P>
With subsidies and open access, too many fishermen chase too few fish.  In that scramble for the last profitable fish, people cross others' lines and capture others' livelihoods.  Then mature democracies roughhouse.
</P>
<P>
Why the fighting?  Marine ecology makes everyone interdependent.  International fisheries are commons, subject to the predictable "tragic" outcomes when coordinated management and limitations are absent.  When countries share fisheries and any nation overfishes, the others suffer.  The international community has struggled to devise institutional arrangements capable of effectively managing their fisheries commons.  Bitter conflicts naturally result.
</P>
<P>
Within nations, special interests distort public policy.  Fishermen in these democracies mobilize support from a sympathetic public and politicians support the industry with a war of escalating subsidies.  The results are nations worse off for wealth transfers, a fishing industry tragically overinvested, and a depleting resource.
</P>
<P>
How could we stop the fighting?  Rules must recognize complexities of fisheries.  When fish cross political borders, ecology trumps sovereignty.  Management must give participants a secure stake in the future of their fishery.  Only then will their decisions integrate the biological and the economic factors into a conservation strategy.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the problems would come quicker if fishermen knew they must fend for themselves, no subsidies or bailouts.  The key problem is the temptation of politicians to champion the cause of the noble fisherman at the expense of taxpayers, healthy industries, and sustainable fisheries.  This exemplifies the special interest problem so pervasive in democracies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions probe the rule.  With fish, we see conflict because the international system of sovereign states is ill-suited to resolve commons problems, and national politicians have incentives to benefit their special interest fisherman.  These factors lead to violent conflict.  We explore these issues further in our forthcoming book from Indiana University Press, <I>Managing the Commons</I>.

<H2>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.
</P><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="/free/Images/Bandwagon.gif" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=270 ALT="Al Gore's Bandwagon">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Environmentalism Today</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle. 
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/Briefcase.gif" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=171>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>A New Shade of Green</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.
</P>
<FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><H2>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P><P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Utah Monument</B></FONT><BR><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="/free/Images/Owl.gif" WIDTH=357 HEIGHT=156 ALT="Spotted Owl">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Headwaters Forest</B></FONT><BR> 
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>New World Mine</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.  
</P><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="/free/Images/Scape.gif" WIDTH=328 HEIGHT=241 ALT="Landscape">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Green Decrees as Quick Fixes</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>An Alternative</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Politics Brings Gridlock, Conflict</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P></TABLE>

<H1>Democracies Don't Fight-- Except Over Fish</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The first lesson of international relations is that democracies don't go to war with on another.  In his 1994 State of the Union addresss, President Clinton said that no two democracies have ever warred with each other.  The conventional wisdom is that world peace can be achieved through universal democracy.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this is not quite true.  There are important exceptions.  And exceptions probe, never prove, rules.  The exception that makes even established democracies take up arms against one another is fish.
</P>
<P>
Consider recent history:  Diplomatic relations between Canada and the U.S., uniquely amicable, are nowhere more antagonistic than over fisheries policy.  Canada has fired upon New Englanders allegedly poaching scallops.   At the end of 1992, twenty Scottish trawlers blockaded one of their own harbors to prevent French supertrawlers from using the port.  A few months later, German and Danish fishermen went on strike and Scottish fishermen spilled oil on Russian catches.  Meanwhile in France riotous fishermen confronted the British Royal Navy, French riot police, and blockaded ports.  Last year, Spain dispatched armed naval vessels to fisheries off Canada's coast as part of an ongoing dispute which included the seizure of Spanish vessels on the high seas by Canadian gunboats.  For decades Brits, Norweigans, and Icelanders have exchanged shots in naval skirmishes as part of their "cod wars".  More recently, violence between Spain and Portugal has escalated from knives and axes to naval gunfire.
</P>
<P>
And it gets worse elsewhere:  A Falklands naval vessel chased Taiwanese fishermen all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Russia has sent warships to the high seas to "protect" them from foreigners, like the Japanese.  Earlier this year, the "pacific" island nation of Kiribati (population 79,000) arrested and detained a Puyallup man and his vessel at machine-gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Could the stakes be so high that fish bring violence and conflict to otherwise peaceful relations?  Hardly, if you consider that fishing accounts for less than 1% of the GDP in most of Europe and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
This instability doesn't bode well for the post-Cold War peace.  If we can't manage the diplomacy of fish, how can we manage nukes, human rights, or terrorism?  Moreover, the problems keep mounting. The number of fishermen has doubled since 1970, while their catch has been falling steadily since 1989.  This means more over-capitalized fishermen fighting over the last scraps of dwindling fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Why do democracies fight over fish?  An incomplete legal system provides no clear way to settle conflicts.  Fisheries can fall under national jurisdiction, no jurisdiction, and sometimes both.  As fish and fishermen cross borders, laws change and cheating becomes an artform.  In the European Union, for example, illegal catches amount to half the legitimate total.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, fisheries heritage promotes tension, misbehaving, and conflict.  National politics coddle fishermen, giving them privileges akin to those of farmers.  Protections include cash subsidies, free access to public fisheries, and navies eager to punish foreigners for fishing improprieties.  Worldwide, governments spend an estimated $54 billion in subsidies to harvest just $70 billion in fish.  This means the net value of the world's fisheries is only $16 billion -- Phillip Morris had triple that in sales last year, the cosmetics industry ten times that.
</P>
<P>
With subsidies and open access, too many fishermen chase too few fish.  In that scramble for the last profitable fish, people cross others' lines and capture others' livelihoods.  Then mature democracies roughhouse.
</P>
<P>
Why the fighting?  Marine ecology makes everyone interdependent.  International fisheries are commons, subject to the predictable "tragic" outcomes when coordinated management and limitations are absent.  When countries share fisheries and any nation overfishes, the others suffer.  The international community has struggled to devise institutional arrangements capable of effectively managing their fisheries commons.  Bitter conflicts naturally result.
</P>
<P>
Within nations, special interests distort public policy.  Fishermen in these democracies mobilize support from a sympathetic public and politicians support the industry with a war of escalating subsidies.  The results are nations worse off for wealth transfers, a fishing industry tragically overinvested, and a depleting resource.
</P>
<P>
How could we stop the fighting?  Rules must recognize complexities of fisheries.  When fish cross political borders, ecology trumps sovereignty.  Management must give participants a secure stake in the future of their fishery.  Only then will their decisions integrate the biological and the economic factors into a conservation strategy.
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the problems would come quicker if fishermen knew they must fend for themselves, no subsidies or bailouts.  The key problem is the temptation of politicians to champion the cause of the noble fisherman at the expense of taxpayers, healthy industries, and sustainable fisheries.  This exemplifies the special interest problem so pervasive in democracies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions probe the rule.  With fish, we see conflict because the international system of sovereign states is ill-suited to resolve commons problems, and national politicians have incentives to benefit their special interest fisherman.  These factors lead to violent conflict.  We explore these issues further in our forthcoming book from Indiana University Press, <I>Managing the Commons</I>.

<P>
<DD><B>Alexandria, VA</B> -- The television networks substantially increased the number of labels they
applied to Democrats during their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers to a barrage of questions from
the left. For Republicans gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the issue. For
Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the right on welfare reform became the media
focus. Adding up both questions and statements made by reporters to one another, abortion or
exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers
heard about welfare reform 43 times in Chicago.
<BR>
<DD>After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter during the August political
conventions, the Media Research Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN
(starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the joint NBC/PBS broadcast. Key findings:
<BR>
<h4>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged conservative.</h4><BR>
 Studies of the 1984,
1988 and 1992 conventions found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats. In
1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118 conservative labels during the GOP conclave,
but just 38 liberal labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans were tagged
59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled
119 times (44 moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).
<BR>
<DD>In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured about half as many liberal tags
with 16. In San Diego, the networks focused most of their labeling on conservative delegates and
speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged -- three moderate and two conservative labels. The
Republican platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform was never described as
liberal. See page 3 for a summary table and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left side of the political
spectrum.</h4><br> On 51 occasions in San Diego Republicans were hit with questions from the left,
especially about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six inquiries from the right. Two
weeks later instead of questioning Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the
left, the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President Clinton's decision to sign the
welfare reform bill, but just 11 questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same treatment, hearing 131 questions from
the left compared to 17 from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46 questions
from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.
<BR>
<h4>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite
some pretty vitriolic speeches.</h4>
<BR>In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans with terms
like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34
times. Democrats were hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their convention,
but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992,
the networks questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but never once raised the
subject against Democrats at their convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of
the contrast.
<BR>
<h4>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely acknowledged.</h4><br> The Clintons are under
active investigation by an independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references to
Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN,
only one. Topics never mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and the
special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy.
Controversies about Republicans, such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.

<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, ABC News: </I>
<DD>At both conventions his podium reports provided even-handed observations on what each speaker
hoped to accomplish. In San Diego he refrained from gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for
being too intolerant. In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson offered a
balance appraisal of the party delegates, noting that the Democratic delegates "are far to the
left of the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In the
midst of network hoopla over Clinton's acceptance speech, only Donaldson realized that while
Clinton gave a "great speech," the "record shows that the next day he may give a different
speech, change his mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>One of the few reporters to pose questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has generally opposed efforts to cut
off benefits to illegal immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why would
hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here illegally?" Then she asked her about
how people who saw her speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree
to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do you think you went too far?" On the first
night in Chicago Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats control the
party. Myers was the only broadcast network reporter to provide details in prime time from the
Star story on Dick Morris.
<BR>
<DD><I>Brian Ross, ABC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared early in prime time with stories on corporate
contributions and union influence, ABC's Ross must be highlighted despite the fact his pieces
did not air in prime time. In a series of World News Tonight stories, Ross went after, with
equal vigilance, the big money contributors to both parties. Ross raised issues never mentioned
anywhere else on the networks, such as "the giant media corporations," which are "very much in
the middle of the mix." In San Diego he noted that "Last night, the ABC hospitality was a
lobbyist's dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor, "His name is Arthur Coia, who despite
being President of a labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become
one of the Democrats' top money people."

<a name="worst">
<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>Worst reporters</B></FONT>
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Seemed baffled why a rape victim would have anything to do with Republicans and her interview
with Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more two like old friends sharing
tales of their suffering than a dispassionate interview. Just after rape victim Jan License
addressed Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why [speak] at a Republican
convention? So many people have said that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party,
is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?" Shriver's under the podium interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver
posed questions like "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the
way you've been treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go
away?" And, noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered "How did that affect you when you
heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff, CNN</I>
<BR>
<DD>In San Diego she repeatedly demanded that Republicans explain why there weren't more female
delegates, but in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on their pro-partial birth abortion
stand, she worried about welfare reform going too far and defended Hillary Clinton from
Republican attacks. She peppered Hillary Clinton with six welfare reform questions, all assuming
that it is going too far. By the end she was pleading with Mrs. Clinton to do something:
"Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again just now, said that much of the time
she kept her disagreements with the President to herself in private, but there were times that
she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, the what?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, NBC News</I>
<BR>
<DD>Found Republican speakers threaten to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald
Reagan, and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised the speaking power of
Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived
meanness on the part of the country. In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's speech which attacked
conservatives, he admired how his words grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least
mention Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald Reagan in San Diego he
took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have to learn how history will judge his time in office --
the deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told a rape victim "this is a
party that is dominated by men," so he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever thought
about what happens in America with rape?" 
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="networks">
<DD><FONT  SIZE=+1><B>In 1992, the networks questioned the convention's tone</B></FONT>
as too negative 70 times during the GOP convention, to zero at the Democratic convention. This
year, analysts again searched for questioning of negative tone (such as the use of words like
"attack" or "bash"), and found a similar tilt. In San Diego, prime-time network analysts
suggested Republican negativity on 34 occasions, to one NBC reference to Clinton "pummeling"
Dole in TV ads. In Chicago, the network suggested Republican negativity again on 23 occasions,
to only six occasions for the Democrats. In total, a negativity discrepancy of 57 to 7.

<B>Republican convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>On August 13, keynote speaker Rep. Susan Molinari said: "Americans know that Bill Clinton's
promises have the lifespan of a Big Mac on Air Force One." Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison remarked
earlier: "America -- it's time to wake up to President Clinton and his high-taxing,
free-spending, promise-breaking, Social Security-taxing, health care socializing, drug-coddling,
power-grabbing, business-busting, lawsuit-loving, UN-following, FBI-abusing, IRS-increasing,
200-dollar-haircutting, gas-taxing, over-regulating, bureaucracy-trusting, class-baiting,
privacy-violating, values-crushing, truth-dodging, Medicare-forsaking, property-rights-taking,
job-destroying friends."
<BR>
<DD><I>Network Reaction: </I>On NBC, Tim Russert warned: "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas
is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean." On
CBS, Dan Rather announced Hutchison was "expected to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with
everything short of a tire tube." CBS's Bob Schieffer called her "Attack Dog Hutchison." CNN's
Judy Woodruff announced: "A Clinton-bashing night." 
<BR>
<B>Democratic convention:</B>
<BR>
<DD>Jesse Jackson said: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense against the Newt
Gingrich Contract, America's right-wing assault on our elderly, our students, and our civil
rights." Mario Cuomo charged: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the real threat to
our women. They are the real threat to our children. They are the real threat to clean air,
clean water, and the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells hope and the
Republicans spell disaster."
<BR>
<DD>On August 29, Sen. Ted Kennedy used the same literary device that caused Hutchison to be bashed
for negativity, in this case describing the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish list of the
education-cutting, environmental-trashing, Medicare-slashing, choice-denying,
tolerance-repudiating, gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting...minimum wage-opposing Republican majority..."
<BR>
<DD><I>Network Reaction:</I> On Jackson, "The most stirring speech of the convention so far," cooed Dan
Rather. "The old lion has not lost its roar," oozed Tom Brokaw. "Convention rhetoric has not
been much better than it was tonight," exclaimed Ken Bode on CNN. On Cuomo, ABC's Jim Wooten
noted wistfully: "For a quick moment, deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a glimpse of conventions past, when
liberals were still the lions of the party, and rhetoric roared." CNN's Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo about his father: "You really are a fan of his speaking style.
It's amazing, isn't it?"
<BR>
<DD>On Kennedy,  Tom Brokaw came out of the speech on NBC/PBS: "Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in
full voice after all these years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the liberal
cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he does every four years." On CNN, Ken Bode
observed: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the other party. You get it at any
convention. Ted Kennedy does it as well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."

Christians who make up a very large part of this convention. What's the challenge there?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen, 8/12:</I> "Peter, there is no mistaking the passion and the conviction of the
Christian conservative movement to this convention. We told you before that about half of the
delegations are controlled by people who consider themselves to be pro-life and very
conservative...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Michel McQueen to a black delegate, 8/13:</I> "Contrary to the stereotype many people have of
African Americans who are active in politics, Mr. Fobbs is very conservative, he is pro-life, he
is not a life-long Republican, isn't that true?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Jim Wooten, 8/15:</I> "Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have to identify themselves tonight and they have to
choose whether they're going to be the ticket of the Ralph Reed, religious right, Christian
Coalition Republicans or whether they're going to be the ticket of the more inclusive party
we've seen from the podium this week."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lesley Stahl, 8/12:</I> "You know, TV programmers have an expression: target audience. The target
audience tonight is women, particularly those 30 to 60. The whole purpose of tonight's
convention, the whole program, is to diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's
what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the convention, the Republican
convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be
Colin Powell, he will appeal for civility. On the platform, women find that extreme, it's
turning them off."
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari, 8/12:</I> "I want to read you a quote, a party official here
said that the role of the prime time speakers, that would include you, is to confuse voters
about the real influence of your party's most conservative wing and the, quote, `Christian
right.' Are you part of that effort?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Pat Robertson, 8/13:</I> "True or untrue: that if elected, a President Dole would be
more to the right than candidate Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to two Missouri delegates, 8/13:</I> "We had talked earlier about the fact that polls
show that most of the delegates of this convention are more conservative than Republicans at
large. How do you get that message out to people who are not, perhaps, not as conservative as
you? How do you convince them to support the Republican ticket, the Republican platform?" Lesley
Stahl, 8/14: "We're hearing a lot of grousing about the re-packaging of the party. We've spoken
to delegates in Louisiana, Missouri, other delegations, who are saying, Where are our issues? In
gagging opponents of abortion, affirmative action, those kinds of issues, Bob Dole may be
turning off the very people he needs to leave the convention gung ho. They say putting three,
pro-choice women on last night was too much. But Bob Dole has a dilemma: In order to win, he
does have to change the perception of this party as too extreme. Dan."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to a Buchanan delegate, 8/14:</I> "There's been an effort to paint a moderate face to
this convention. How does this sit with you?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken to Gerald Ford, 8/12:</I>  "President Ford do you worry  the Republican Party in the last
couple of years became a more conservative, or at least was pictured as a more conservative
sometimes a party that seemed to be going away from the politics that you stood for?"
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/12:</I> "President Ford mentioned what he called a drift to the right in the
Republican party. He was always known as a moderate Republican from the center of the party. And
he says it's been reversed by this convention. Well, I'm sure he believes that, a lot of people
do. But they wrote a platform that is very much a right wing platform. It was written by a lot
of social conservatives."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to an Idaho delegate, 8/13:</I> "Do you feel that the line-up of speakers at this
convention reflects a platform which seems to be much more conservative than the speakers?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Gene Randall to Phyllis Schlafly, 8/13:</I> "With me is Phyllis Schafly, an ardent anti-abortion
rights advocate. Do you think the speakers do not reflect the conservatism of the platform?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bernard Shaw, 8/13:</I> "Bob Dole did not get the tolerance language he wanted in the abortion plank
which came out of this platform committee earlier in the week. He didn't get a few other things.
The conservatives have iron clad control over this convention."
<BR>
<DD><I>Bob Franken, 8/14:</I> "It's interesting they just had a moment ago a very brief tribute to the
Republican freshmen in the House of Representatives. Why brief? Because they are highly, highly
controversial. It's the freshman of the House of Representatives that really gave Bill Clinton
the extremist issue, fairly or unfairly."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/12:</I> "There is a sense of pride among these Republicans that he [Colin Powell]
will articulate why he is a Republican. Frankly, there is some trepidation on part of some of
the more conservative delegates. They do not see eye-to-eye with him on their views."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert, 8/13:</I> "Key word: mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid those labels. They
have thus far after two days and that's why you're not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time
tonight. I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she uses
words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Tim Russert after Dole's speech, 8/15:</I> "These are difficult speeches to give as you know, Tom.
He's appealing to a very conservative audience in the hall here but he's trying to reach
independent voters out in the country."

convention is designed to undo the damage done to the Republican image by you and the Republican
Congress, which fairly or unfairly the voters seem to see as extreme, you've heard all the
words. Do you think that's true and does it make you feel repudiated at all?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Charlayne Hunter-Gault to former Senator Howard Baker, 8/14:</I> "You heard Dole is] moderate to
conservative from Senator Lott, but tonight on the NewsHour, Pat Buchanan said most of his views
were consistent, most of Senator Dole's views, were consistent with his own, and he cited
specifically, affirmative action, and the platform position on illegal immigration. And as you
all know, Pat Buchanan is on the farthest extreme of the right wing of the party. How does that
set with you?"

<DD><I>Dan Rather to CBS analyst Kevin Phillips, 8/26:</I> "We said in San Diego, we pointed out, that a
large percentage of the actual delegates on the floor, not people who spoke from the podium,
were members of the quote `religious right.' A very large percentage of these delegates
represent organized labor, but we're not seeing that many union/labor people speak from the
podium itself." Dan Rather to Jesse Jackson, 8/26: "Bill Clinton's been running pretty hard to
the right, so far that some Democrats now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to AFL-CIO leader John Sweeney, 8/29:</I> "Who do you think Bill Clinton is: liberal,
moderate?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Dan Rather to Senator Ted Kennedy, 8/29:</I> "A liberal has been defined as a person too
broad-minded to take his own side in an argument. That's never been a problem for our guest in
the booth now, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. Thanks for being here. They say Bill
Clinton is the ultimate pragmatist; That he fakes left, runs right, but has really no immovable
core principles of his own. Has that been your experience?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rather:</I> "You know that Senator Dole, Jack Kemp, House Speaker Gingrich say, to the public, Bill
Clinton's posing as a centrist but as soon as he gets elected he's going to be right in there
with Ted Kennedy and they'll be working the same old liberal agenda. True?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I> "Well first of all they want to accomplish the same thing the Republicans
accomplished -- showing a unified party, even though we know from our survey that these
delegates are far to the left of the mainstream just as the Republican delegates were to the
right of the mainstream...."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/26:</I> "What's interesting to me, Peter, is the delegates who clearly are way to
the left even of rank and file Democrats, much less the country, have signed on to a moderate
centrist platform." 
<BR>
<DD><I>Cokie Roberts 8/26:</I> "What the delegates there [Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia delegations] and the
politicians there have been telling me tonight is this convention has got to look very moderate
for their Democrats to win in those states..."
<BR>
<DD><I>Sam Donaldson, 8/26:</I>  " Cuomo and Jackson were supportive of the President, but they preached the
liberal line."
<BR>
<DD><I>Peter Jennings, 8/27:</I> "Well, whether this is orchestrated or not, it's almost as if Democrats
here who share many of Mrs. Clinton's liberal views are saying to the Republicans we like you as
they liked Mrs. Dole."
<BR>
<DD><I>Jeff Greenfield, 8/27:</I> "That's right, which is why I have come to think of her speech as
liberalism lite. This was a speech in the first place aimed at Democrats who do believe in a
much more communal concept of family..."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "Well I think the word Kennedy or Kennedyism to Democrats means tough
liberals. It's a combination that's become very rare these days."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider on Mario Cuomo's speech, 8/27:	</I> "And he had a unique twist on Clinton's move to
the center. Very controversial among liberal Democrats when he said, the President actually
lifted the albatross from the party so that we could better sell our core Democratic
principles."
<BR>
<DD><I>William Schneider, 8/27:</I> "You know if this night, this day of the convention, the afternoon,
evening, remembered for anything I think it's two things really. One is Jesse Jackson and Mario
Cuomo early in the evening who were making the liberal case for the reelection for Bill
Clinton."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Broder after Cuomo and Jesse Jackson, 8/27:</I> "Well, they've [Democrats] let the country in
on a big secret, there are still liberals in the Democratic party. In fact this convention hall,
delegates, are filled with liberals. And the Congressional Democratic party is still a liberal
party. But most of the message so far has been, `We've changed, we're new, we're different.'
What you heard tonight was a very old fashioned partisan Democratic message."
<BR>
<DD><I>Judy Woodruff to Senator Bob Kerrey, 8/28:	</I> "The Republicans are now saying, `Just wait. If you
think Bill Clinton's been liberal up until now. Just wait. When he's reelected he's gonna feel
free to move to the left and do all those liberal things that he's really wanted to do all
along.' And you're aware of this debate that's going on about whether it's gonna be Bill Clinton
to the center or Bill Clinton to the left. What do you think?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to Vice President Al Gore, 8/26:</I> "Let me ask you about the state of the Democratic
Party and President Clinton's fortunes particularly. It seems to me that he's doing a lot better
now because the win by the Republicans in 1994 really forced your administration to move much
more swiftly to the center. Is that proposition wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Brokaw, 8/26:</I> "The Vice President was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the
Republicans, we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first place. But since 1994
they have slid across the political spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by
the name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to be more pragmatic."
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom, 8/27:</I> "Tom, I'm down here with Joe Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy, a liberal
legacy. When many Americans look to that podium tonight, they'll say that's a liberal First
Lady. What does she need to say, what ought she say tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to James Carville, 8/29:</I> "Lot of buzz out there about Dick Morris having to leave the
campaign. He was the man who moved him to the right. I know that you had some philosophical
differences with Dick Morris. Does this mean that the door has been opened again for those of
you who believe that the President probably ought to move a little more left of center?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/29:</I> "Clinton will have something tonight for the more liberal Democrats who are
here and not happy that he signed the welfare reform bill, which they believe is too radical.
He's going to talk about a proposed program to encourage job creation for welfare recipients and
businesses, especially in the inner city."

<BR>
<DD><I>Mark Shields, 8/26:</I> "Bill Clinton has another great advantage that Bob Dole didn't have. Bob
Dole had to deal with the most activist wing of his party, which in this case are the cultural
conservatives. He had to appease them, he had to mollify them, he had to best them at some
times. Bill Clinton, because of the fact as we've discussed in the past, is unchallenged and has
been unchallenged for renomination within his own party, that the party has accepted him as the
standard bearer, for the last 12 months has been able to run for the middle, so there is no
faction of the party that he has to spend any time, effort, or energy this week really
mollifying."
<BR>

<BR>

[Hillary] may not change the numbers for her husband, that she either helps or hurts in the
intensity of the feeling. That for instance, liberals like the delegates here feel more
enthusiastic about the President because they know she's really a committed liberal?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw, 8/27:</I> "There will be other speakers tonight as well, some stars from conventions
past; the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Mario Cuomo, two of the, of course, large liberal voices in
this party of diminishing liberal voices, so we have a full night ahead here, Jim."
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux (D-LA), 8/28:</I> "I'm here with one of the smoothest operators in
the United States Senate. A man who worked very hard to pull President Clinton to the center,
Senator John Breaux of Louisiana. Senator, you said today, that you thought the President went
left in the first two years, not because he is a liberal at heart, but because he wanted the
liberals to like him. Explain what you mean."
<BR>
<DD><I>Gwen Ifill, 8/28:</I> "Barney Frank certainly is an outspoken liberal, one of the last few standing.
And I'm interested in finding out whether pragmatism has replaced true liberalism at this
convention?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Margaret Warner to Clinton/Gore Deputy Manager Ann Lewis, 8/29:</I> "Alright, let's talk briefly
about campaign strategy. As we've heard a million times tonight, Dick Morris was the strategist
that helped Bill Clinton figure out how to move back to the center and so on and it was
controversial as Dee Dee Myers just said, even inside the White House. Do you think that that
course will be maintained, Ann Lewis, with Dick Morris gone?"

<DD><I>Ed Bradley to U.S. Rep. John Lewis, 8/27:</I> "Do you think it's going to be difficult [to mobilize
Democrats] given the positions he's taken, particularly on welfare, to get some people out?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Rita Braver to a Minnesota delegate, 8/28:</I> "Now that you've had some time to be here at the
convention, have your reservations gone away? How'd this speech cut through to you? You've been
worried about welfare."
<BR>
<DD><I>Ed Bradley to U.S. Rep. Ron Dellums, 8/29:</I> "Congressman Dellums was unhappy when the President
signed the welfare bill. I know you saw it not as welfare reform but more as a budget cut. What
does he have to do to fix it?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bradley to Dellums:</I> "When the President is expected to say tonight that he's going to propose a
$3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is that enough?" 
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to Hillary Clinton, 8/27:</I> "What goes through your mind when you hear some of these
bitter attacks against you?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Bernard Shaw to Senator Bob Kerrey, 8/25:</I> "How can you do that when the leader of your party has
vetoed a welfare bill that many people in this hall feel he should have signed? I mean signed
which he should have vetoed. But politically he had no recourse."
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to Mario Cuomo, 8/27:</I> "But on this issue of welfare reform which maybe, even if
Bill Clinton is reelected over eight years the most significant decision he makes. He signs this
welfare reform legislation into law. Could have this enormous, from your perspective, negative
impact on a million children could go into poverty. How do you rationalize that kind of decision
and now come forward and give this rousing endorsement for Bill Clinton to be reelected?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right: </B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Candy Crowley to a delegate, 8/28:</I> "Do you think that the teacher's unions have done enough to
change schools?  What I'm wondering is, the point from the Republicans is that the schools, most
everyone agreed, need help. Why not get some parent involvement in there through school
vouchers? Let people pick schools. Are you against that idea?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Wolf Blitzer to AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney, 8/28:</I> "Many of your members are Republicans. How do
you explain to them that you're using, in effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Tom Brokaw to former Texas Governor Ann Richards, 8/27:</I> "You paid the price to some degree. You
lost the governership of Texas because this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it,
about the role of women in American politics?" 
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Hillary Clinton after her speech, 8/27:</I> "You are credited with really
redefining the role of First Lady and for doing that you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wish you'd redefined it a little less?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "You talked a lot tonight about It Takes A Village, your book. And as you well know,
that was a lightning rod for criticism at the Republican convention. Kay Bailey Hutchison took
off on it, Bob Dole took off on it. How did that affect you when you heard about that?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the Right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>David Bloom to James Carville about Hillary Clinton's speech, 8/27:</I> "I was struck by the fact
that she talked about health care and the need for more health care insurance for the
unemployed. That's a topic that got her and Bill Clinton into a lot of trouble two years ago.
Why would she revisit that tonight?"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the left:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Elizabeth Farnsworth to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, 8/26:</I> "We're looking
tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are. Did the President turn his back on
fundamental Democratic principles when he signed the welfare bill?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Farnsworth to Ickes:</I> "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing the welfare bill is unraveling
the safety net that took so long to put together?" Tom Brokaw to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala,
8/26: "If you were a poor single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the right things, but there aren't
many jobs for people who have real skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the
next two years?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Maria Shriver to Georgia Governor Zell Miller, 8/27:</I> "We were just hearing Tim Russert talk
about the platform. A lot of the delegates here don't feel that the platform reflects the
Democratic Party that they joined five, ten years ago. Why are they wrong?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But how concerned are you about the divisions, that people would say tension, this
isn't reflective, the Democratic Party sold out, it's a, it's a Republican Party with a
different name?"
<BR>
<DD><I>Shriver:</I> "But when you get out and you walk this floor of this convention center, do people come
up to you and say, `I am really angry about welfare reform, this is not what the Democratic
Party is about.'"
<BR>
<DD><B>From the right:</B>
<BR>
<DD><I>Lisa Myers to Senator John Breaux, 8/28:</I> "Doesn't that [Clinton moving to center] reinforce
claims of the President's critics who say that he is a man without many deep convictions, who in
fact is guided by the need to be liked, and by a burning desire to get re-elected?"

<CENTER><h2>Media Research
Center History</h2>
</CENTER>
<P>
<dd>Founded by <a href="/mrc/about/bozelbio.html">L. Brent Bozell III</a> in 1987 with a mission
to bring political balance to the nation's news and entertainment
media, the Media Research Center has become the nation's largest
and most respected conservative media watchdog organization.<BR>

<P>
<dd>With the most sophisticated computerized tape archive
(over 115,000 hours of footage) and database of its kind in the
world, the MRC tracks and analyzes virtually everything in the
national media. Every day teams of MRC analysts input into a custom
designed computerized database everything the leftist press is
saying. And then confront liberals in the press directly with
evidence of their slanted reporting.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <A HREF="/mrc/news/"><B>News Division</B></A> publishes two newsletters,
<I><B><A HREF="/mrc/mediawatch/">MediaWatch</A></B></I> and <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/nq/">Notable Quotables</A></B></I>,
which document the leftist bias in the news media every month.
At a national press conference on June 5th in Washington, D.C.,
the MRC formally launched <B><A HREF="/mrc/reality/">&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot;</A></B>a $2.78
million campaign that represents the most ambitious, comprehensive,
and technologically advanced effort ever undertaken to neutralize
the left-wing news media. And the MRC's new book <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/bookstore/">Pattern of
Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</A></B></I>
is a result of four years of research and analysis.<BR>

<P>
<dd>The <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/">Entertainment Division</A></B> exposes the left-wing
agenda in the entertainment media.  In 1995, it opened
an office -- the <B><A HREF="/mrc/ptc/">Parents Television Council</A></B> (PTC) -- right
in the heart of Hollywood. Its two missions are to bring family
programming back to television and to identify, recruit, and mobilize
the emerging conservative movement in Hollywood. In early February,
the MRC held a bipartisan press conference featuring Senator Joseph
Lieberman (D-CT) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX). Seventy-four
lawmakers also signed a letter calling for a return to the <B><A HREF="/mrc/entertainment/famstuff.html">Family
Hour</A></B> which would enable parents and their children to
share in quality programming.<BR>

<P>
<dd><B><A HREF="/mrc/freemarket/">The Free Market Project (FMP)</A></B>
is another division of the MRC and works to educate the media
on what they know so little about -- the free market system. FMP
publishes a monthly newsletter, <I><B><A HREF="/mrc/medianomics/">MediaNomics</A></B></I>, as well as other books, monographs, and <A HREF="/mrc/news/sreport.html"><B> Special Reports </B></A>.
FMP also hosts <B>Quarterly Breakfast Forums</B> which bring together
conservative public policy makers and the media. The goal is to
teach the media to report more accurately conservative positions
on key economic and business issues.<BR>

<P>
<dd>MRC spokesmen challenge reporters with evidence of
liberal bias regularly on television programs like NBC's <I>Today</I>; CNN's <I>Crossfire</I> and <I>Reliable Sources</I>;
CNBC; and NET programs.  MRC research is used by every major national
(and local) conservative talk show host, like Rush Limbaugh, G.
Gordon Liddy, Ollie North, Paul Harvey, Mark Rosen, and dozens
of others.  The MRC produces a nationally-syndicated newspaper column
and articles for the top newspapers in America, including
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the
<I>Washington Times</I>, the <I>New York Post</I>, the <I>L.A.
Times</I> and many others.<BR>

<P>
<dd>In 1992, the MRC founded the <a href="/mrc/about/internad.html">
<B>Montgomery Internship
Program</B></a>, with the purpose of helping young conservatives in
their pursuit to bring balance to journalism.<BR>

<TITLE>The Real Clinton</TITLE>
<CENTER><img src="/nationalreview/images/real2.gif" ALT="The Real Clinton"></center>
<P>
<hr width=50%>
<P>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------->
The Real Clinton is more or less the opposite of the Real McCoy. What you see is very definitely not what you get, and indeed it may not be what you see a moment or two later. There is a chameleon quality about the 42nd President of the United States, a quicksilver opportunism, that enables him to don and doff identities like cloaks: the New Democrat who promises to end welfare as we know it, the paleo-liberal who takes on the Klan in defense of black churches, the economic statesman who steers by the bond market, the policy wonk avid to socialize one-seventh of the U.S. economy, the moralist who crusades against illegitimacy, the redneck roue with Astroturf in the back of his pick-up, the nostalgia-merchant who wants teenagers home by seven, the futurist with visions of an information superhighway, and at all times and on all occasions the bringer of empathy who feels the pain of that day's audience, whether millionaires or the poor, feminists or Good Ol' Boys, labor unions or blue-chip managements.
<P>
Underneath all the empathy, however, there is a set of policies and attitudes that gives a sort of consistency to his Administration, and even to his personality. In the following pages, we examine this Real Clinton from several angles. We look at Clintonism, that ambidexterity of campaigning right and governing left; at Clinton's steering of the economy by the stars of focus group and polling data; at the multicultural refashioning of the American identity in which he nervously colludes; at his stumblings down the multilateral by-ways of foreign policy, talking loudly and carrying a small stick; at his high-minded healing and sly exploitation of America's most entrenched problem -- race; at the manifold ways in which he, Hillary, and their confederates hidden in the last agencies of the alphabet, have abused federal power to extend their own personal power; and, finally, at that most extraordinary amphibian, Clinton the Bully Pulpiteer. Tales, in short, to / <I>``harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood</I> / <I>make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres</I> / <I>thy knotted and combined locks to part / and each particular hair to stand an end</I> / <I>like quills upon the fretful porpentine.''</I> Now read on.

Congress overseeing the courts!—This might be the most frightening thought I've ever had. The Constitution provides for Judicial Review whereby the Supreme Court determines the constitutionality of law. The courts were established to de-politicize the law. We are now considering turning this on its head? Would Dick Gephardt find that <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I> was a clear instance of the Court making law rather than interpreting it? Would Newt Gingrich find that 209 is unconstitutional (a point with which I disagree)? No . . . they are partisan. Congress was given the power to confirm or reject any nominee. Perhaps if they took that responsibility more seriously, most questions of the court's integrity would simply disappear.<br>

Yes, Congress should make laws that regulate the courts, but not in a way that compromises the separation of powers, and certainly not based on politics or public opinion. Rather, the law should mandate that the Bench include a significant number of non-attorneys. There is utterly no reason that lawyers should run all three branches of government, in addition to business, politics and especially legal education.<br>

Yes, congress should have the power to override a court decision. The Supreme Court is the most powerful branch in our government. Congress should exercise their rights using the elastic clause. Congress should be able to overturn ludicrous decisions that undermine the values of America. Decisions in cases such as Roe vs. Wade and those taking the Ten Commandments and prayer out of schools should be reviewed by Congress and if found necessary "veto" the Court's decision.<br>

Given the philosophy of your motley crew, I suggest you skip this step to curb the power of our courts, which have apparently functioned fairly well for over two hundred years, and just do away with them altogether.

Yes, Congress should make an attempt to control the courts. But long before that, journalism should do the job, by exposing these closet tyrants and all their works and pomps.

Victoria Carter, you got it right-on; there is no hope within the judicial labyrinth. However, your straight jacket idea just might be obtainable. Remember, this whole problem revolves around money. Remove the bucks, and you mitigate the problem. How about this? (1) Eliminate payroll-deduction of taxes; let the earners manage their own money. (2) Establish a uniform flat tax system, Dick Armey feels 17% will do. (3) Each month the wage earner would subtract one twelfth of his personal exemption from what he has made that month, then send a check for 17% of it. (4) Start teaching basic economics in the first grade. When the taxpayer sees his hard earned money being used as pork-barrel spending buy votes for politicians, it won't take long for both the courts and the government to change.<br>

When a student can finish law school without even reading the Constitution, we will be hard pressed to find judges who cherish and uphold the fundamental principles that have made America great. Should Congress put a reign on Congress? You are putting the cart ahead of the horse. First we must elect a Congress with the guts to stand up for what is just and right instead of what is politically correct or socially popular. We must do away with all the special group rights and return to the concept that the most important and inalienable rights are those of the individual, no matter what his color, creed, or religion.<br>

Yes. The Courts are taking unto themselves powers which are not theirs under the Constitution. Moreover, they are claiming the exclusive power to determine whether or not their actions are proper and constitutional. The answer is a constitutional amendment, which it is unlikely that the congress will find the will and the gumption to institute. An equally grave issue is that, with the proliferation of case law and the extension of the courts into every area of our once private lives, the practitioners of the law, the attorneys, no longer can predict with any confidence what will be the consequences of any given motion or action. We now have the legal system as glorified slot machine, in which one puts in one's money and pulls the lever. Finally, even the randomly dispensed justice which our system affords, is beyond the economic reach of the average party. Thus we have a legal system available only to the wealthy, to which class we must strive to attain in self-defense, to the protected classes, for whom the government checkbook is opened, and to those attorneys, who are allowed to pull the lever of the slot machine without putting in their nickel.<br>

I think it is clear that the judicial system has long ago ceased to serve free America. The judicial system of the United States exists today to benefit one group and one group only, and that is attorneys. We would be far better served by a non-antagonistic, interrogatory form of judiciary modeled perhaps on that of Germany. We have made the existing jury system a sacred cow, and as with most sacred cows, we're not sure precisely why we're not killing them instead of feeding them, but we're sure that our forefathers who told us to do so must have known. It is time to re-examine this system in the cold light of logic and reason, not sentiment. Changes must be made. As for as the interpretative function of the courts, it does serve as an ingenious form of checks and balances that probably should not be tampered with. An extremely pragmatic understanding of human nature and group dynamics led our forefathers to include this as a safeguard against "mobocracy." Their other safeguard, the appointing of senators as opposed to the election of same, has already been obviated. A nation full of people who will pay $7200 for a Tickle-Me Elmo doll that will be $32 on the shelves shortly is not rational enough to live without a strong Supreme Court.<br>

I find it terribly amusing that a liberal like Leslie would feel that "an activist judiciary is crucial to a functioning democracy"—no, little girl, an activist judiciary is only crucial to a government that does things the way YOU want them to without having to bother with other people's opinions, feelings, OR rights. Conservatives may cry out for the Judiciary to enforce the 2nd amendment, but only because it is ripe hypocrisy to have an activist court that ONLY legislates from the bench in favor of liberal causes. No, Leslie, let's face it, you don't want democracy, you want a dictator—so long as she does it your way, and so
you can distort every opinion which doesn't agree with yours as oppressive and evil (which is what liberals always do when they don't want to have to think too hard about their own opinions).<br>

Federal courts interfering with a state's internal matters is unconstitutional. Any ruling, such as in California's Prop. 209 is illegal and a smack in the face to all Americans in every state. Judicial activism is illegal—despite the threat of federal force. Americans have the moral and constitutional right to use whatever force necessary to repel and abolish the tyranny of judicial activism. But I sure hope Congress does something about it first.<br>

I think the courts have co-opted WAY too much power for themselves and are not answerable to the people. They legislate from the bench and that is a CLEAR violation of the constitution. The checks provided against them from the constitution are clear and so are their powers. THE COURTS HAVE SUPERSEDED THEM!! It is time for their power to be reigned in. Liberals allowed the powers of the court to expand to further the liberal agenda. Even though conservatism is taking over, we must not allow ourselves to fall into the judicial trap. We must go forward on legislative acts and ignore, as much as we can, the judicial corruption that has pervaded the judiciary (thanks to the liberals). Legislation IS the power of the people, not the judiciary, as the liberals believe. The judiciary has been used by the liberals to BYPASS the will of the people! Now everyone knows, the reason for the judiciary is to protect the people from the tyranny of the masses, but the people are much better educated today then 200 years ago. Also we have 200 years of experience behind us. WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING!!!! End judiciary enslavement now!!!!!<br>

This is rather a moot question. The question might well have been "Should the People Put a Rein on Congress"? Congress is responsible for the making of laws consistent with and/or within the restrictions of the US Constitution. States rights are "not to be" impugned unless matters exceeding the rights of the State are in question. Lawmakers invariably test these premises and submit to the electorate a concoction of "favorable or popular" jurisprudence. This, with the knowledge that it will end in court. Changing a few judges will not change the situation. If true tests are applied through appeals and our learned judicial deems a contest of interpretation with the Constitution is in order; then and only then should the Supreme judicial powers come into arbitration. This tends to make the opposition to any Supreme decision decry political infatuation. I've lived through the depression and several wars, good times, hard times are always going to be around. We have a healthy political system and a very precise Constitution that needs no tinkering with. The best for all to do is fill our legislative and congressional domains with the most fervent of learned folks. We will continue to have detestable laws, politicians, and decisions—and on the other hand, many acceptable laws, politicians, and decisions. We are a nation of laws. This is life and a pretty darn good one at that.<br>

What would happen if the Supreme Court ruled on a 5-4 majority that law-abiding adults under 21 were ineligible to vote in federal elections? What would we do if Clinton and Gore were removed from office for obstruction of justice in the V. Foster affair, and tax fraud (with regard to Buddhist Temple donations to the DNC) respectfully, and the AFL-CIO brought suit to block Speaker Gingrich from becoming President, and the Supreme Court sided with the union? What would we do? The only true check on government power, of any kind, is a well-educated, mature, populace. It also helps if that populace is well armed. Watch for Amendment II, like Amendment X, to be declared unconstitutional.<br>

Permit the Supreme Court to invalidate or otherwise declare unconstitutional a state law ONLY by a UNANIMOUS decision of the court. This act would seriously check the Court's trampling of states' Rights. If unanimous jury verdicts are required for criminal trials, then protecting the will of the people, as expressed by their duly elected legislatures, deserves no less rigorous a procedure.<br>

As conservatives, we support the "original intent" interpretation of the Supreme Court.

Congress and the Courts shouldn't be linked. They are to a certain extent, but this should be maintained as little as possible. The bigger question is whether the courts have a right to interfere with what has been passed down in an election. Example: the affirmative-action case in California. Does a federal judge have a right to block this action??? I always thought that the courts were there to see that laws were enforced . . . Could you help me??<br>

Randy and others, It should be clear to you since the election that leaving pure politics in the hands of the electorate is a lost cause. Instant gratification is the rule of the land in their minds. Americans in general have their wants, their needs, and their rights muddled together. They think that if they want something bad enough it becomes a need. And if they can't get it, it becomes their right to have it. It seems the judiciary feeds on this and therefore the legislature is so busy trying to "fix" what the courts decree that they are unable to make reasonable law.<br>

This is an easy one. The courts are NOT allowed to hear cases involving the internal affairs of any state. Article III, Section 2, not to mention Amendment X of the US Constitution, spell out the scope of Judicial power. The courts may not hear cases involving the laws of a particular state, unless it is appealed as to an issue arising under the US Constitution. Most of the cases heard by the Court do not fall under its legal scope, and are therefore null and void. California Prop 187, 209, <I>Roe</I> v <I>Wade</I>, etc. are internal state affairs and out of the reach of the federal courts. Judges and Justices who do not respect their very limited scope should be removed for behavior inconsistent with their service. The US Constitution is a very precise and clear document; there are no "vapors," "emanations", or "penumbras" incorporated into its substance. Justices who have a difficult time with this concept should be promptly retired.<br>

What Congress should do is actively review the decisions of courts such as the decision which occurred in California to block the popular implementation of Prop. 209 to end affirmative action. Congressional committees should be formed to look into controversial exercise of judicial power and decide if the federal judges making such decisions by their records merit impeachment. The indefinite terms of federal judges were meant to shield them from the influence of short-term political pressures, but liberal judges have regarded them as means to thwart the implementation of conservative legislation. Congress should simply exercise their powers to protect the rights of citizens in the practice of democracy.<br>

The Congress should put a rein on the courts, but it won't. As long as the Supreme Court keeps giving liberals the decisions they want, Democrats will block any efforts to restore power to the legislatures. Almost all the checks and balances on the courts require either two-thirds of Congress, or 60% of the Senate and presidential signature, neither of which Republicans are likely to have anytime soon. Senate Republicans could block Clinton's liberal appointments, but they are too gutless. Court reform is just not going to happen.<br>

If you think that control over the judicial system should be given to Congress, now that Congress is in conservative hands, remember what happened to Robert Bork when he sought confirmation. Remember what almost happened to Clarence Thomas. However, judges and the activist legislation they create must be brought under control, since they are now essentially unaccountable. There have been no checks on judges' activist liberalism, which is why we're in the trouble we're in today; the people themselves never voted for most of the liberal legislation that is destroying this country. However, the power to make judges accountable must not lie with Congress, since Congress itself was unaccountable for 40 years of nonstop liberal Democrat rule. There should be a safeguard within the system itself, a safeguard that is regulated by the Constitution. The only real safeguard would be a Constitutional amendment that Congress cannot touch, an amendment limiting the power of judges. This could take the form of term limits, recall, or legislation that requires strict construction of the Constitution in any judicial interpretation. Newt Gingrich often states that the Founding Fathers designed a system so inefficient that no dictator could force it to work. But unfortunately, it wasn't so inefficient that Congressional barons, imperial presidents, and judicial petty tyrants couldn't find loopholes. All of these branches, rather than acting as checks and balances on each other, have conspired to create dictatorial agencies that go unregulated, and legislation that is beyond the reach of the public. The key to getting this leviathan state under control is not to give any one branch special jurisdiction over another—such as Congressional control over the judiciary—but to put the entire system in a strait jacket. We must tie the entire system in so many knots that it will have to become responsive to the people that it is supposed to serve. This might take the form of limiting executive privilege and autonomy, enacting term limits on Congress, giving Congress control over Federal agencies, enacting a balanced budget amendment, and so on. The government should have unlimited authority to control itself while leaving us free. However, this may well be impossible, since the ability to tie the system in knots implies the existence of a degree of control that we no longer have, if we ever really had it at all. Ultimately, the ability to control the system lies with the people—and if the people remain ignorant, shallow, emotion-driven, dull-witted, and foolish in their condition of childlike dependence. We will all continue to live under the dictatorial control of the monster that we have created.<br>

Sir Winston Churchill stated, more than fifty years ago, "The women's suffrage movement is only the small edge of the wedge, if we allow women to vote it will mean the loss of social structure and the rise of every liberal cause under the sun." Now, some fifty years later, only Judge Robert Bork has had the courage to state, "Radical feminism is the most destructive and fanatical movement to come down to us from the Sixties. . . . Totalitarian in spirit, it is antagonistic to traditional Western culture and proposes the complete restructuring of society, morality, and human nature." And one of the major forces of that Radical Feminism, Catherine A. MacKinnon, has asserted that "feminism could supplant both Marxism and liberalism as a theory of politics." Should Congress put a rein on the courts? Indeed. But what is most needed is an emboldened male and female leadership that will have the courage of a Churchill and a Bork to tell the American public what it already knows, but quakes to acknowledge—End Feminism, restore America. The much derided, potatoe spelling champ Dan Quayle had a splendid moment when he challenged Murphy Brown, and that earned him years of scornful ridicule.

Constitutionally, the courts only exist to interpret the law. The purpose of the federal courts and Supreme Court of the United States is only to decide the constitutionality of laws passed by the legislative body. In far too many instances, we find the court "creating law" by its ruling in issues. Precedents are set, and are interpreted as law by the populace. Technically, if a law is found to be unconstitutional, then it is up to the legislature to formulate a law that is constitutional regarding the issue at hand. Our nation has gone too long in permitting courts to "write law" by their rulings. Congress should place reins on the courts by re-writing laws that the court rules to be unconstitutional, especially when this is true on technical bases only. In addition, constitutionally, the Executive Branch of our government should only be the enforcer of laws passed by the legislature. It is Congress that represents the people—not the Courts, nor the President.<br>

The primary purpose of the federal judiciary is to protect our individual freedoms, and the rights of the people and the states, against encroachment by an oppressive central government. Sadly, the judges don't seem to do a very good job of it, but this is not the fault of our constitutionally mandated tripartite system; it is because the executive branch appoints lemons.

Of course Congress should put a rein on the courts.

Our judges are as honest as other men and not more so.

The Courts absolutely must be given the message that they exist to carry out the laws of the land, in addition to throwing out those that violate the Constitutional rights of the people. The Courts DO NOT have the right to legislate through their judicial process. The role of Congress must be, collectively, individually, and through its Judiciary Committees, to ensure that all candidates for appointment are well grounded in the historical, Christian religious basis for their role. The basic foundations of right and wrong derive from our Founding Fathers' actions and words during the writing and adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution. Members of Congress must recognize this, affirm it, and demonstrate it during their formal proceedings such as in the Senate's advise and consent function, or be candidates for ousting at the next election. American citizens must recognize their moral responsibility in this process, and not be duped by the liberal establishment including the teachers' unions, if the decaying process of this Republic is to be stopped!! The new Congress must be bold, and LEADERS must step forward with personal conviction!<br>

The reason we don't like the Brady Bill is that it does absolutely zero to prevent crime, and is nothing more than something to make liberals feel good. To correct you, voters, liberal, conservative or whatever, may vote any way they choose. Judges are mandated by the Constitution not to have individual agendas; voters vote as such; liberal judges do not.

The American public is the only hope for reining in the federal court Frankenstein monster! Congress is basically useless in this day and age. The American people will, eventually, simply tell the courts to "go to hell" in the same manner as they did the "Dred-Scott" courts back in the 1800s. If the people do this via Congress, it will require a massive overthrow of both the Democrats and Republicans who have created the judicial beast through apathy and politics. We are currently being ruled by a 5–4 black-robed oligarchy that ignores traditional U.S. (not-multicultural) traditions and institutions.

The existence of an independent court, whether this was or was not intended by the Founding Fathers, is certainly a desirable check against the tyranny of the majority. The majority is not always right; Rousseau, not a favorite with conservatives (with good reason), nevertheless held correctly that the majority is right only when it is right! However, the federal court system has become an oligarchy run by liberals with the support of liberal law schools and bar associations. It is time not for the abolition of the autonomy of the court system but for its modification. We should give the Congress a greater role. Perhaps a 3/4 vote of both houses of Congress should override a court decision about the unconstitutionality of legislation in certain carefully controlled circumstances. Robert Bork, in his book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah</I>, has some good ideas about this.<br>

It is time that somebody or some entity do something about the courts. I am certain that when the Constitution was written, no one had any thought of the courts being stacked with socialist activists far more intent on furthering their own agenda than clearly interpreting the Constitution. In the recent California case concerning the CCRI, a U.S. District Judge, Thelton Henderson, literally extorted the case from the legally chosen judge, using as the reason an absolute and easily substituted lie. Judge Henderson and many other left-wing court appointees have track records of pure socialist-activist decisions where the Constitution is completely ignored. One begins to wonder if these decisions fall under the mandate of the Constitution which states, "The judges, both of supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior." It would seem that completely ignoring the Constitution, in favor of your own political beliefs, would qualify as bad behavior. If Congress is the place, where are they when these blatant violations are routinely dismissed as normal procedure?<br>

Leave well enough alone. If our elected representatives did their jobs instead of punting whenever a difficult issue arises, reigning in the judiciary would not be an issue.<br>

In the cases of 209, 187, welfare reform, yes, somehow we have to limit idiot judges in the Ninth District. Boy am I glad I moved from Taxifornia to South Dakota two years ago where unusual things are the Corn Palace and jackalopes at Wall Drug. I think I remember some folks leaving England for points west a while back over similar issues.<br>

The people can control the courts by controlling for whom they vote. When conservative thought controls legislative bodies, those nominated for appointed offices and judgeships tend to be of the same mindset. The liberals do the same. Wise and thinking citizens not only vote, but cast their ballots for right-thinking people of unquestioned morals, both professionally and personally. This is for any election, from President to dogcatcher.<br>

Yes Congress should rein in the Courts, although I am not sure how that would be accomplished. The Courts have too many times overturned the will of the people, and the will of the people reins supreme!<br>

The men who wrote the Constitution carefully designed a Federal Government with three separate and distinct parts, each part to act as a check against the other two. This implies an equal division of power among the three parts.<br>

Oh sure, reign in the courts now that they've passed a few decisions conservatives don't like. Last week, though, you were all just dying for an interventionist court to overturn the Brady Bill. Judges are committed to leaving their prejudices outside the courtroom, but nothing stops voters from carrying their bigotry into the voting booth. So Californians choose a strident repeal of the state's guarantee of civil rights, and Congress/puritanical legislatures forbid states from acknowledging the loving union of same-sex couples. The duty of the courts is to let democracy work, but keep it in check by screening out centuries-old hatreds (or sexist worldviews, such as those that deny women the right to control their own bodies). As such, an activist judiciary is crucial to a functioning democracy—unless, of course, you think women and minorities don't count.<br>

Recent events suggest that the power is out of balance, having shifted toward the Judicial. This works to the advantage of the Executive which has the power of appointment. The legislative is weakened and with it the voice of the electorate. Two initiatives passed by the voters of California have been, in effect, nullified by federal judges. A majority of California's voters, its Governor and its legislature have been over ruled by one person who seemingly has the power of a dictator. At the very least the Congress should require that a federal judge explain in concrete rather than abstract 'read between the lines' detail exactly why he believes the law he over turned is unconstitutional. Lacking a rational reason, the judge should be overruled This last case is a real farce. The judge evidently believes that outlawing discrimination is unconstitutional! Great care must be taken to stop this type of nonsense without altering the system set up by the Founders. Restoration, not alteration, is what's needed here. I believe that we should not let Congress put a reign on the courts. The reason is simple . . . balance of power. Congress has a chance during a justice's appointment to approve a justice. Our Republican Congress should really scrutinize Clinton's appointments. Not just let them in without a hitch. Now it's too late to do anything. Maybe we should let the Citizens of the US put a reign on the courts? What do you think???<br>

<blockquote>
Small business drives America's economy.  By 1996, 8 out of 10 jobs in America will be generated by small business.  Yet, too often the United States government ignores this reality and creates an environment hostile to small business creation.
                 <P>
Between 1989 and 1992, government regulations on small business increased over 34%.  By 1992, small businesses were burdened with nearly $130 billion more in costs in 1990.  Increased government regulations and higher taxes have added billions more in costs to small business operations.
     <P>
With great peril to the United States' competitiveness, legislators mandate costly, ineffectual, and punitive regulations that undermine individual freedom to control their own livelihood.  SBSC works to eliminate the burdensome and unnecessary tax and regulatory demands on small business.  Our goal is to amend current punitive policies to policies that preserve and enhance the entrepreneurial spirit.
        <P>
You can be certain that we always fight for principle; too much is at stake in America.

<p>
The Small Business Survival Foundation (SBS Foundation) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and education organization that studies the impact of government polices on the small business and entrepreneurial sector of the United States economy. From taxation to trade, SBS Foundation examines legislative and executive branch-led initiatives, to determine the affect on entrepreneurship, and potential for impeding economic growth.<p>
The SBS Foundation was formed in February of 1995. One of the major project areas undertaken by the foundation is the issue of tax system overhaul. During the course of the national debate on tax system overhaul, SBS Foundation will examine the leading plans (as well as other major proposals) to analyze their impact on small businesses and entrepreneurs. SBS Foundation's new booklet, <a href="grtax.html">The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense Of Competing Tax Plans</a>, looks at leading tax overhaul proposals based on the foundation's "basics of a sound tax system. " The booklet is written by Raymond J. Keating, SBS Foundation Chief Economist, with a foreword by Malcolm S. Forbes Jr.

<title>Hot Issues & Sample Letters to Congress</title>

<p>
<center><h2>Letters to Congress</h2><hr width="45%" size="4"><P><a href="i-issues.html">Issues</a><P><hr width="45%" size="4"></center>
<p>
<blockquote>
When small business owners, entrepreneurs and concerned taxpayers take part in the lobbying process, our efforts to reform America's fiscal policies are enhanced.  And yet, many people say that writing letters to Congress to express your concern is a waste of time -- this belief is dead wrong.
<P>
Members of Congress spend most of their time trying to gauge their constituents concerns.  For this reason, congressional offices record the number of constituent responses (letters, faxes, email, mail) to pending and current issues.  Furthermore, congressional staff read and respond to correspondence.  SBSC encourages you to take the time to contact Members of Congress.  
<P>
In order to expedite the process of voicing your concerns, we have posted letters to send to your Congressman and issue descriptions of a few "hot" small business issues.  (We will update the 'hot' issues regularly.)  We suggest that if you decide to send a letter, send it on business letterhead (letterhead grants the issue more attention).  If you have any questions pertaining to contacting members of Congress, or if you would like to see other types of letters posted, please contact SBSC's Christian Cali at 1-800-233-7526 or 202-785-0238.
<p>

Should you decide to send your Congressman or Senator a letter, 
the proper address for Members of Congress is as follows:
<P>
The Honorable -----------------
<br>United States House of Representatives
<br>Washington, DC  20515
<P>
OR
<P>
The Honorable ------------------
<br>United States Senate
<br>Washington, DC  20510
<P>
(Or call your Representative or Senator at 202-224-3121 to voice your opinion or to obtain the fax numbers of your elected officials.) 
<P>

<blockquote>
Over the past two years, the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC) has heard from scores of business organizations nationwide
that a more effective influence in Washington is needed to reverse
laws that hurt free enterprise.  Feeling isolated and disenfranchised
from Washington, state and local business organizations have long
known that inside-the-beltway antics will do little to stop the
growing intrusiveness of government.<BR>
<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Coalition utilizes the grassroots
strengths of state and local organizations to mobilize its business
membership and leaders. <BR>
<P>
 If hundreds of business organizations nationwide speak with one
voice when key legislation or policy is being proposed, debated
or considered, powerful special interest forces who support the
status quo of big government can be overcome.  If the status quo
is left unchallenged, common sense advocates will be drowned out.

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<br>
<p>
The current tax code -- with its high marginal tax rates and thousands of pages of rules, 
regulations, and red tape -- poses a formidable barrier to economic growth. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in our economy -- the small business owners 
and entrepreneurs who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
<p> 
<li>It discourages working Americans who are trying to save for the future to build a better life 
for themselves and their families.
 <p>
<li>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally billions of dollars in lost time and 
effort.
</ul>
<p>
Tax reform must move toward making the tax code more family friendly and create incentives 
for savings and investment.    
<p>
The congressional leadership has <a href="/taxcom/dole.html">asked</a> the National Commission on Economic Growth and 
Tax Reform to start with a blank piece of paper and design a system that is flatter, fairer, and 
simpler -- one that will encourage strong economic growth and greater opportunity for all.
<p>
The commission will gather the views of American citizens from all walks of life and will 
gather the best  available analysis and evidence from the experts who study and analyze tax 
policy.  The commission is expected to issue its recommendations and its report in December.  
<p>
The commission’s report should provide recommendations that will contribute to 
reinvigorating entrepreneurship, risk-taking, savings, investment, and work efforts.  Its goal is 
to produce a report that will make America more competitive and expand the nation’s 
worldwide leadership in the twenty-first century global economy.

It outlined a plan by the DNC and the Clinton administration to improve ties to the Asian community - while at the same time raising millions of dollars from its members.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Mrs. Matsui has indicated that she was not involved in the development of the campaign plan," Mr. Davis said. "More importantly, Mrs. Matsui has not engaged in any solicitation of contributions or any other improper fund-raising activities."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It is illegal for government employees to solicit political contributions.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The unprecedented goal of raising the $7 million in funds was laid out in a "National Asian Pacific American Campaign Plan," which was part of 3,000 pages of the DNC's records made public over the last two weeks.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The recently released records, mostly from the files of Mr. Huang, the DNC's chief fund-raiser among Asian-Americans, raise questions about whether White House officials illegally participated in fund-raising and campaign activities.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>In addition, the party's goal of raising the money may have helped create a high-pressure atmosphere that led to at least $1.2 million subsequently being returned to contributors as improper donations.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Under the plan's guidelines, invitations to the White House were extended to members of the Asian Pacific American Leadership Council, or to individuals giving at least $10,000 and companies at least $15,000 to the Democratic committee.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The strategy was to "reward APALC members by inviting them to special White House or other events" with the president and to "solicit input," the records show.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Davis said Mrs. Matsui, wife of Rep. Robert T. Matsui, California Democrat, headed the Asian Pacific American Working Group while Mr. Huang was involved with the Asian Pacific American Leadership Council, a group of DNC-related contributors.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mrs. Matsui does not recall having read the campaign plan. The official also said the document's author, DNC official William Kaneko, has told administration officials he is not certain whether the 33-page document was even forwarded to Mrs. Matsui's office.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No evidence suggests that donors won changes in policy, even though White House meetings often featured discussions of Mr. Clinton's policies toward Asian nations, especially China.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But in the past month, two connections between Clinton administration policy and the Lippo Group, an Asian company that paid Mr. Huang a $780,000 bonus just before he moved to the Commerce Department, have come under question.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Earlier last month, the president acknowledged that he received a letter in 1993 from Mochtar Riady - founder of the Indonesia-based conglomerate that donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clinton campaign - seeking normalization of trade relations with Vietnam at a time when the company was moving its $6.9 billion real estate and investment empire into that country.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton denied the letter influenced his decision to end a 30-year trade embargo on Vietnam, which he did in 1994.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last month, the Associated Press reported a connection between Lippo and Mr. Clinton's designation of 1.7 million acres of Utah wilderness - known as the Kaiparowits - as a national monument.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A U.S. mining company owned by a British family was ready to tap a huge reserve of environment-friendly coal there but was forced to reverse course with Mr. Clinton's announcement in September. Lippo has business interests related to coal: One of its subsidiaries was involved in a now dormant joint venture to run a clean-coal-fueled power plant in China.</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=9><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="mailto:wtadvt@wt.infi.net"><IMG SRC="../ads/house_ad.180.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TWT House Ad 1" border=0></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this article.</A></center></TD></TR>

It is the most sinister car going."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Portrayed in images ranging from German Albrecht Durer's 15th-century woodcuts to anti-nuclear art of the 1960s, the specter of a coming millennium has fascinated Western civilization.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last two decades have reflected a rising American anxiety about the future, depicted in films such as "Road Warrior," "Escape From New York," "Escape From L.A." and "Blade Runner." Their story lines, set in bleak 21st century cities turned into police states or terrorized by gangs, do not show a Second Coming as much as they show a hell on Earth.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modern art world has dipped its collective toe slowly into visions of the morass. In "New Visions of the Apocalyptic," a 1988 exhibition at the Rhode Island School of Design, 19 artists displayed works on the defoliant Agent Orange and scenes from literal hells with titles such as "Figures With Bleeding Eyes."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The one hopeful piece in the exhibit was artist Ruth Kligman's "Apocalyptic Art," an abstract rendering of color and light inspired by Revelation 22:5, which promises night will be vanquished forever and the redeemed "will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The other depictions were secular ruins: the atom bomb, the Nazi Holocaust and ecological decay, as the plant world dies first when the world's end is imminent. Other scenes came from a world in which morality has faded, replaced by random, escalating violence from a new urban predator class of youths.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Although Mr. Scott, 46, does not call himself a Christian -- "I've been too disappointed" -- he acknowledges that "the symbolic structure of the West is based on biblical imagery. The symbols in Christianity are powerful despite popular disinterest in it as a religion."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Equipped with a nail, Mr. Scott, a part-time instructor at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto, scratched all 22 chapters from Revelation into every inch of a Trans Am primed with black latex paint. Now displayed in an airy rotunda at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Trans Am has dice hanging from a rearview mirror and a license plate reading "Ex-Nihil 666."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The dice refer to Albert Einstein's insistence of order in the universe and that "God does not play dice." The number 666 is the biblical number of the satanic beast someday to rule the world. "Ex nihil" is close to the Latin "ex nihilo," meaning "out of nothing."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A video next to the car blasts rock music and shows rock musicians and riot scenes juxtaposed, with Mr. Scott laboriously carving verses, a Bible open before him.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The apocalypse is the perfect postmodern state," he says. "All history is present simultaneously." But apart from Georgia primitive artist Howard Finster, "people seem to be ignoring the date more than I thought they would. I can't think of anyone doing contemporary art because they are worrying about the world coming to an end."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Scott likens his work to Survival Research Laboratories, an avant-garde trio of nihilistic artists based in San Francisco. In the 1980s, SRL fused themes of heavy metal, stock car races, dead animals, warfare and male sexuality to create bombastic performances of what High Performance magazine termed "orgies of destruction." To the sound of explosions, shattering glass and gasoline motors, radio-controlled car-sized machines ripped into one other, spitting streams of liquid and spewing fumes.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Heavy-metal youth cultures are obsessed with death," Mr. Scott says. "The car symbolizes destructive masculine egos, environmental destruction, the follies of us all that lead to the end."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Not that all death imagery is bad. Gospel singer Pat Boone, shortly to release an album, "Pat Boone in a Metal Mood," claims heavy metal is filled with biblical images.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>In an interview in the November issue of Charisma magazine, he says the heavy metal group Megadeath reminds him of the ominous prophecies of Old Testament prophet Jeremiah and the Apostle John, writer of the Book of Revelation.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Many of the writers [of heavy metal] have come out of a religious background, who have seen the dark side of life, [and] now do have a tremendous sense of foreboding and of the ominous," he told the magazine.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Scott says, "The Book of Revelation, probably more than any other text, has informed Western consciousness. All heavy metal albums make reference to it, the beast, 666, all that stuff. A lot of heavy metal is anarchic, and there's a longing for an apocalypse where all order will be reversed."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The recent hit movie "Independence Day" is a subtle hint of the End, Mr. Scott says, as "those ships, like the hand of God, sweep across the screen and then time ends." But it doesn't really. American know-how rescues the world once again -- a shame, the artist says. "People wanted the end to happen."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The artist's confrontation with death gets personal, as Mr. Scott suffers from a degenerative bone disease that caused his body to shrink by 8 inches in one year.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"I'm in constant pain," he says, "because I'm always breaking things. The vertebrae in your spine collapse and the cartilage compresses. All your organs are squished. Where it gets problematic is breathing. I'm sort of like a hunchback."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"John's responding to the sense he will die and what he will do," says Joan Murray, director of the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, Ontario, which has displayed Mr. Scott's work. "This apocalyptic mood is current in the art field because of the problems the art community has with AIDS."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nevertheless, Mr. Scott's melancholy art, which ranges from drawings of bunnies to skeletons, shows a "complete lack of self-pity," according to a recent review in the Toronto Globe and Mail. The passer-by may miss the artist's inner struggles, the reviewer wrote, but will surely see the artist's "inner work of reconciliation with death."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Scott's Trans Am was a hit nearly two years ago during a 1995 reception at the National Gallery hosted by President Clinton for Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Bill Clinton loved it, an American product in the National Gallery of Canada." the artist said. "I'm just glad it wasn't a Toyota."</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=9><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="mailto:wtadvt@wt.infi.net"><IMG SRC="../ads/house_ad.180.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TWT House Ad 1" border=0></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this article.</A></center></TD></TR>

Because we are a law enforcement agency, off-duty conduct that demonstrates an inability to be fair, objective and unbiased in dealings with others will not be tolerated."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The statement does not include the word "religion," which is commonly protected in federal non-discrimination policies.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Hunter was unavailable for comment. No other member of his service was willing to discuss the code on the record.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A spokesman read this statement: "The policy will only affect any action that is a violation of the law. For example, if someone refused rental to a homosexual and that was in violation of a local law, then that would be dealt with if that came to the inspection service's attention. Public objections to a homosexual teaching one's child --that's free speech. We're not violating anybody's free speech."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Leonard Hirsch, president of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Employees of the Federal Government (GLOBE), said all Cabinet-level departments except the Pentagon now have rules barring discrimination based on sexual orientation.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Hirsch said none of those policies extends to an employee's off-duty hours, unlike the postal agency's code. But he said because the Postal Inspection Service involves law enforcement personnel, it is appropriate to regulate after-hours conduct.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"These policies are developed to protect people's liberties, not to take them away," he said. "As long as they do their job well, honestly and effectively without discrimination, there will be no problem."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Law enforcement is different because of the public trust that is mandated for employees of law enforcement agencies," Mr. Hirsch said. "It is not unheard of to have a higher standard of behavior."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>FBI Director Louis J. Freeh in November issued a new policy outlawing discrimination against employees based on sexual orientation. The FBI has refused to release the policy, calling it an "internal document."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But a source said the memo did not contain off-duty language similar to the Postal Inspection Service's code.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Homosexuality is not protected by federal civil rights laws.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Robert Maginnis, an analyst at the Family Research Council, said the Postal Service policy will mean new forms of intolerance.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"People who have deeply held moral beliefs, they need not apply for the federal jobs," Mr. Maginnis said. "You talk about discrimination. This is reverse discrimination of the worst kind."</TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=9><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top> <TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN="1" ROWSPAN="1"><IMG SRC="../images/vertical.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" border=0></TD></TR></TABLE> <TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=180><TR ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top><TD ALIGN=Left VALIGN=Top COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1><A HREF="mailto:wtadvt@wt.infi.net"><IMG SRC="../ads/house_ad.180.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=60 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="TWT House Ad 1" border=0></A></TD></TD></TABLE></TD></TD></TABLE><center><p><a href="#linkTOP">Go back to the top of this article.</A></center></TD></TR>

When it was a boomtown, building sites "popped up" all over town. The fellow we knew, "Cowboy," said he visited the building sites at night and, spotting materials he liked, took a door here, a window there, a box of tile, cement blocks, wall panels, and siding until he had enough to build his own house.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Cowboy" had a nice little house with a picket fence around it when a man stopped by, saying, "Hey! Those look just like the pickets I bought. They went missing, and I believe you took them."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Cowboy" replied: "Those may be  your pickets, sir. I can't recall just where I got them. But if you think they're your pickets, you can have them. I guess you know your own pickets."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>So went his little house, brick by brick, door and window, panel and tile, until his little lot was vacant. "Cowboy" told his story without apology.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That was several decades ago. But I must thank Bill Clinton for reminding me. "Cowboy" was a million laughs.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Mary D.

Mr. Bonior and his Democrat allies have been notably and predictably silent on this point.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>If we have begun a House-cleaning, though, let's do a good, thorough job of it.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Gingrich, at this juncture, is one point ahead by virtue of having confessed to his error. But if we are going to have a viable two-party system, we are going to have to see a goodly measure of integrity in both.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We are hearing much chatter about "campaign finance reform." That is evasion. What we really need is people reform at all levels of government.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>G.W.

Yet neither the president nor the Justice Department has taken any action to eliminate or modify these abusive programs.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Perhaps it will take an act of Congress to correct these abuses.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Maurice Horn<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Administrative Law Judge<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Social Security Administration<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Office of Hearings and Appeals<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Jamestown, North Carolina<FONT SIZE=6><BR><BR>The right Iowa cornfield</FONT><BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I appreciate letter-writer Bob Bearss' suggestion (Dec. 29 edition) to move the White House to an Iowa cornfield. His reasoning indicates his compassion and that, hopefully, Iowa ethics, honesty and morality would "rub off" on the current caretakers.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Iowans aren't accustomed to "city SLICKers," and on first reading of this suggestion, I wondered why we would want to take on this great task. After careful consideration, I can see that this is a win-win situation for everyone concerned and I would suggest that the move be made to my hometown.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Please consider the following:<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0><B>*</B> Costs are lower in Iowa, resulting in lower taxes.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0><B>*</B> My hometown has a hotel/motel tax. We would reduce our local tax burden by taxing the contributing patrons of the Clintons' motel business.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0><B>*</B> The state of Iowa is building a new prison in my hometown.

William Cohen, about these very issues during his upcoming confirmation hearing.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Specifically, LOGM has demanded that Mr. Cohen be asked pointedly for his views on the ongoing controversy between the executive branch and Congress over compliance with the Ballistic Missile Defense Act and the Defense Appropriations Act. For over a year, the administration has steadfastly refused to comply with the timetables and programmatic guidelines set forth in those statutes for development and deployment of two theater missile defense systems, the Army's THAAD and the Navy's Upper Tier system.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This violation of federal law led this past year to congressional hearings on the matter and the filing of a federal lawsuit against President Clinton and Defense Secretary William Perry by 41 members of Congress to force the president to discharge his duty under Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution to "take care that the laws of the United States be faithfully executed."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>As lawyers, we are outraged by the Clinton administration's cavalier disregard for federal laws mandating the development and deployment of theater missile defenses. As citizens we believe that the United States Senate and the American people deserve to hear from Mr. Cohen whether he intends to comply with those laws or whether he intends to perpetuate his predecessor's legacy of stonewalling and delay on this important issue.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Only after a full airing of Mr. Cohen's views on this disturbing situation (and what he would do to rectify it) can the Senate and the American people make a final decision on Mr. Cohen's fitness for the office of secretary of defense.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Anthony J.

The fact remains that the best results come from individuals being responsible for themselves and leaving the market to  be controlled by their preferences; 3) Ms. Claybrook simply does not trust American consumers to make judgments about their purchases. The lives of some buyers' children have relevance in her logic system only to the extent that they were "studied" and that government actions comported to the recommendations of such studies.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Her claim that she "had no control over auto manufacturers that chose to develop the cheapest, rather than the best, air bags" is outrageous. Would Ms. Claybrook be more smug and self-satisfied if the public complaint involved the high cost of "the best air bags" instead of kids' lives?<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The greatest danger to our republic (and the lives of all of our kids) is that the likes of Ms. Claybrook have been allowed to coercively impose their expertly informed judgments in the marketplace and that we mere consumers were denied the prerogative to "simply say no."<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Albert B.

But, one person, a federal judge, elected by no one, accountable to nobody, tenured for life, thwarts the expressed will of the people. In a single biased judicial activist stroke, he declares that the constitutional provision of equal protection of the law is probably unconstitutional.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Proposition 209 very clearly declares all forms of discrimination illegal. This is the indisputable preamble of true democracy.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No wonder there are already signs of rebellion in many parts of the country when the foundation of our nation is being undermined by judges and self-serving politicians.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It is time to rein in the federal judiciary by making its members stand for election and be made accountable to the people. Judge Robert Bork's fear of an "out-of-control, runaway judicial system" now appears to be a grim reality.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=0>Stephen J.

<title>President's Message</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">


<img alt="Picutre of Reagan and Robinson" src="r&r.gif" align = ><br><h2>President's Message</h2>

You would be very disappointed if you knew what was going on in our schools.<p>

America's public schools and colleges have relinquished their role of defending and transmitting our history, religious heritage, and culture.<p>

Schools are hotbeds of violence, disrespect and failure.<p>

School administrators pass out condoms and teach "tolerance" for deviant lifestyles, but insist they can't "impose" religious values or even ask students to say the Pledge of Allegiance.<p>

Students learn the latest environmental theories but they aren't taught to adequately read, write, or add. <p>

College admissions programs and faculty hirings are rigged. It's better to be designated a member of an "oppressed" class than to be an honor student or an effective teacher.<p>

Our heroes are demeaned. Long-standing American role models are replaced with obscure but "politically correct" characters in a new "multicultural" curriculum.<p>

Thomas Sowell notes that every one of Karl Marx's works is available in our schools' bookstores. But Sowell no longer finds The Federalist Papers.<p>

The Bible is taboo; it's replaced in our grade schools with Heather Has Two Mommies!<p>

The Radical Left decided that its most important goal was to gain control of our educational system.<p>

Radical teachers and administrators promote an agenda that attacks traditional values, causes racial strife, and is preoccupied with envy and class warfare.<p>

Radical feminists institutionalize an anti-family agenda through "Women's Studies" departments and programs.<p>

Militant homosexuals design freshmen orientation programs to force acceptance of their lifestyles and consequently demand a ban on religiously oriented free speech.<p>

Leftist control is so complete that students on many campuses are denied the right to attend ROTC or they are told they cannot form religious clubs.<p>

At the University of Maryland students weren't permitted to display the American flag during the Persian Gulf war!<p>

In 1992 Bill Clinton spoke at fifty campuses, appeared on youth-related television programs, and otherwise targeted the student audience.<p>

President Clinton frequently dispatches his Administration's officials to the college campus, especially Hillary Clinton, Joycelyn Elders, Al Gore, and Robert Reich.<p>


College administrators who have a sordid history of violating students' Constitutional rights, as Donna Shalala did at the University of Wisconsin and Sheldon Hackney at the University of Pennsylvania, are given choice governmental positions.<p>

Our educational system, in which we invest our fortunes and our children, are controlled by people who are hostile to the values we hold dear.<p>

Most of us know there is a problem but we are tempted to underestimate how bad or how damaging it is. <p>

Abraham Lincoln expressed it best, "The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next."<p>

If that holds true, we are in for some very, very hard times.<p>

Can it be more obvious?<p>

Conservatives need to be more active in the education of our nation's young people.<p>

We must demand that our schools be balanced and fair institutions.<p>

That is the mission of Young America's Foundation.<p>

Unfortunately, those who control our schools are not about to voluntarily share power.<p>

In fact, one lesson conservatives have learned is that the Left covets a monopoly over information and education in America.<p>

Young America's Foundation's twenty-five year record is a history of struggle to break the Left's monopoly in our schools.<p>

Leading scholars and policy makers who lecture for the Foundation have made a dramatic impact. Recent nationwide tours by William F. Buckley, Jr., Dinesh D'Souza, Bay Buchanan, Edwin Meese, Bill Bennett, Walter Williams, and Oliver North have been large enough and effective enough to change our campuses for good.<p>

Young America's Foundation has benefited by the involvement and help of Ronald Reagan, Milton Friedman, Phyllis Schlafly, Patrick Buchanan, Dana Rohrabacher, Caspar Weinberger, Robert Dornan, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jack Kemp, Phil Gramm, and Robert Novak.<p>
	
But it is the students, faculty members and financial supporters are the real heroes of Young America's Foundation's first twenty-five years.<p>

Students invest tremendous time and energy to put on our programs, publish independent papers and journals, and fight faculty and administration pressure to conform to a "politically correct" agenda. Often these young men and women make great personal sacrifices to participate in our activities.<p>

Conservative faculty members are a rare group indeed. Yet those who have dedicated their careers to truly educating their students merit our eternal gratitude. Many deserve mention but I am especially thankful for the help given by Burt Folsom, Forrest McDonald, Richard Ebeling, Walter Williams, Thomas DiLorenzo, Alan Sabrosky, Charles Kesler, Jeffrey Hart, the late Russell Kirk and M.E. Bradford.<p>

Financial supporters have made these programs possible. You have backed up these students and faculty members with the financial support their schools should have provided but didn't.  They have helped create a successful model to inform students of the greatness of our country, its free enterprise heritage, and our many blessings from God.<p>

Each of us must do more to achieve our goal of passing on a heritage of which we can be proud. But it is appropriate to take a short time to reflect on how far we have come. Thank you.<p><p>

<title>Job Prospects for College Graduates</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<p>

<i>	College students, don't despair!  Though the job market is tight, Young America's Foundation can give you a leg up on your competition.  Through our jobs program, Job Prospects for College Graduates, you will know what employers are looking for.  Bring a corporate leader to your school who will tell you what you need to do in college to get a good job when you graduate.  And he will tell you about the realities of the job market.  In addition, a free market economist will tell you about the benefits of the free market system. . . a perspective you won't find often on campuses!<p>
</i>
	College students are wise to be particularly concerned this year about finding a job after graduation.  Studies show that as of graduation day, only 40 percent of the class of 1995 had found a job appropriate for their degree.  That number goes up only to 50 percent by November.  To make matters worse, studies show that employers are losing faith in the ability of colleges to prepare students for the workforce.  They are looking more at the experience of a potential employee rather than their academic record.<p>

	What is the reason for these phenomena?  There are two explanations.  First, the quality of our colleges and universities are eroding.  Except at a few select schools which have maintained their commitment to academic instruction, multicultural and politically correct courses supplant classes with practical value for future employment.  And second, the Clinton Administration's regulatory policies are forcing businesses to forgo expansion.  When employers must hire, they opt for trained, experienced individuals, rather than taking a chance on a new graduate.  Government regulations make the expense and hassle of bringing on even an experienced worker prohibitive.  Why, then, would an employer opt to hire someone fresh out of college, with no experience, and very likely in need of remedial education, in addition to basic job training?<p>

	Do not despair!  Young America's Foundation has a program which will help students maximize their college degree so that employers will snatch them up, or at least give them a chance.  In addition, students will learn the real reasons why it is so tough to get a job for which befits their degree.<p>

<i>	Job Prospects for College Graduates</i> is a program designed to promote an accurate understanding of our free market system of economics.  We seek to dispel the widespread myth, promoted by leftist professors, that "big business" is responsible for the difficulty recent college graduates encounter when they attempt to enter the work force.  Specifically, we are examining the impact of burdensome federal regulations and of the federal government itself in constraining the job market.  In addition, we are focusing on the devaluation of today's college degree given the politicized curricula, and the consequent skepticism of employers of higher education's ability to prepare students for the workplace.<p>

	During the fall of 1995, Young America's Foundation will cosponsor a series of<i> Job Prospects for College Graduates</i> programs on campuses.  At each program, a free market economist and a corporate leader will speak to students giving them the insights they need to maximize their educational opportunities and avoid the pitfalls of a politically correct degree.  In addition, students will gain a unique understanding of their job opportunities and of the qualities employers are seeking in new recruits.<p>

<H3>CUTTING CRIME AND RESTORING ORDER:
WHAT AMERICA CAN LEARN FROM
NEW YORK'S FINEST</H3>
by William J. Bratton<br>
Delivered October 15, 1996
<P>
<DD>William J. Bratton served as Commissioner of Police for New York City from 1994 to 1996. He spoke at The Heritage Foundation on October 15, 1996, as part of a conference entitled "If New York Can Cut Crime by 36%, Why Can't D.C.?"
<P>
<DD><B>Edwin Meese III:</B> William J. Bratton is one of the most distinguished law enforcement leaders in the United States today. While serving as Commissioner of Police for New York City from 1994 to 1996, Bill Bratton successfully instituted major management initiatives and the strategic deployment of public safety resources. During this period, the city achieved a phenomenal 36 percent decrease in serious crime, including a 45 percent drop in murder. Commissioner Bratton previously had served as the chief executive of other large law enforcement agencies, including the Boston Police Department and the New York City Transit Police. Widely respected by his professional colleagues, he was elected president of the Police Executive Research Forum, a leading institute of modern police management. Bill Bratton continues his efforts in the private sector as a foremost authority on effective law enforcement and the improvement of public safety.
<P>
<DD><B>William J. Bratton:</B> I am an optimist when it comes to the issue of crime in this country.  I believe that over the last several years we have begun to find answers to a problem for which many felt there were no answers. We have begun to turn the corner, and American police forces are becoming better at what they do. I think society, in general, understands more significantly what causes crime, what can be done about it, and -- most important, from my perspective as a former police official -- what police departments can be expected to accomplish.
<P>
<DD>
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I had the privilege of working at Harvard University on an initiative with <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese</a>, in his former capacity as Attorney General of the United States, and with a group of very distinguished academics, mayors, press people, community activists, and federal officials regarding the issue of the development of the community policing philosophy. The federal government played a very significant role funding that initiative, which literally was the birthplace of what we have come to understand and appreciate as community policing, with all of its manifestations. I want to talk to you today about one of those manifestations: specifically, what has happened within the New York City Police Department and in the city of New York over the last several years regarding crime; what is continuing to happen in that city; and the impact that police strategies have had on the quality of life in the city, and the lessons to be learned from all of this. They are important not only for Washington and for the country, but for countries around the world as well.
<P>
<DD>To understand fully the impact of what has happened in New York in the last few years, we need to take a walk back through time -- to the late 1960s and early 1970s, to the time when I went into the police department in Boston as a young patrolman. To understand the impact of changes in New York City today, we need to have an appreciation of what policing and crime were like in the 1970s and the 1980s, and indeed what they <I>are</I> like as we move through the 1990s. But before I begin that walk back through time, you may be wondering: Where <I>is</I> New York City today with respect to crime? I will give you the end of the story before I tell you the beginning, so that you can appreciate how important the figures I am about to give you are, why so much attention is being paid to the New York City Police Department, and why its successes over the last few years have begun to generate such optimism in this country and around the world. Something <I>can</I> be done about crime.
<P>
<DD><B>"Miracle on 42nd Street."</B> By the end of 1996, recorded incidents in New York City of the seven top crimes measured by the Uniform Crime Reports will be down from their 1990 figures by almost 50 percent -- a 50 percent decline in America's largest city, over a six-year period of time, in the seven major crime categories of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, auto theft, larceny, and burglary. In the city's subway system, which I was privileged to lead from 1990 to 1992, crime has gone down dramatically as well. In 1992, this decline provided me with the opportunity to meet then-mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani, who asked me to explain to him why crime had gone down so dramatically in the subway system and if this could work in the city as a whole. That conversation ultimately led to my appointment, upon his election as Mayor, to the position of Police Commissioner of New York City. Subway crime has continued to decline, and by the end of this year will be down 80 percent from what it was in 1990.
<P>
<DD>These percentages sound great, but what do they mean in terms of the actual number of people who have not been victims of crime this year in New York City?
 <UL>
 <LI><B>Homicides:</B> In 1990, there were 2,246 homicides in New York City, a figure somewhat inflated because of 85 deaths in one fire. Even if you deduct those 85 deaths from the total, this was an historic all-time high for New York City -- 2,246 murders in one city, in one year. Yet by the end of 1996, New York City will report fewer than 1,000 homicides for the year -- a decline of almost 55 percent.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Shooting victims:</B> In 1990, there were 6,000 shooting victims in New York City. By the end of 1996, there will be about 3,000. Shooting victims are a category that police have tended not to track, but one that we track very closely in New York City because of the many things that are done now to save lives, like quicker police response and improved medical services. To understand changes in the incidence of crime, we need to look at the larger issue of crime -- not only at the number of homicide victims, but also at the number of people who may have been homicide victims and were not.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Auto thefts:</B> There were 143,000 auto thefts in New York City in 1990. In 1996, there will be about 65,000.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Robberies:</B> From approximately 85,000 robberies in 1990, it is estimated that the number will fall to the 50,000 range this year.
 <P>
<LI><B>Victims of crimes:</B> Finally, when 1996 comes to a close, there will be approximately 200,000 fewer victims of crime in New York City than there were in 1990.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
To understand the significance of these figures, we need to understand how New York got to the position it held in 1990, and then look at what began to happen in 1990 and accelerated in 1994 to allow New York to be able to claim now, without fear of contradiction, that it is definitely one of the safest cities in the United States with populations over 100,000 and, among the major cities of the world, one of the safest in the world.
<P>
<B>Rethinking the Methods of Conventional Policing</B>
<P>
<DD>
In 1970, when I joined the Boston Police Department, the country had just begun to emerge from the civil rights era -- an era of race riots and assassinations, if you will. The Kerner Report had come out on what to do about crime in the United States, and American police forces began to enter a new era -- one that has been described as the professional or reform era of policing. This was an era marked by what I describe as the three R's:
 <P>
 <UL>
<LI><B> Reactive policing:</B> In the 1970s, 1980s, and -- unfortunately for many departments in this country -- into the 1990s, policing consisted of something I have come to understand as reactive policing. In the 1970s the intention was to emphasize the ability of police to respond quickly to calls for assistance. The emergency number 911 came into being in the early 1970s and spread rapidly across the country, and police departments began to focus their attention on how quickly they responded to those calls.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Random patrols:</B> The principal means of policing city streets in the 1970s and 1980s became random, not targeted, patrol. When officers were not chasing 911 calls, they were expected to randomly patrol their assigned sector and, by the visibility and randomness of their patrol, deter criminals from committing other crimes.
<P>
<LI><B>Reactive investigation:</B> Lastly, there was a significant effort to improve the professionalism of our detectives to investigate -- but this was reactive investigation.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>What do all of these elements have in common? They are all actions taken after the fact. American police forces began to measure their impact, not on what crime they were preventing, but on how they were responding to crime -- which was a sea change in terms of how the police were policing American cities and why they were invented in the first place. Sir Robert Peel and the Metropolitan Police in London in the early 1800s had officers in uniform -- the British "bobbies" -- patrolling their beats and preventing crime by their presence, by their activity. Somehow, in the 1960s and in the increasingly permissive society of the 1970s, we began to excuse police from having any responsibility for the prevention of crime. We began to espouse that there were so many causes of crime that were beyond the control of police: How could we hold the police accountable for preventing crime when so many of the things that we believed caused crime were beyond their control?
<P>
<DD>Many of these causes have been reported on widely, and they still afflict the city and the country: the breakdown of family values, schools that no longer teach, and an increasingly permissive society that -- using Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's famous explanation in his essay in <I>The Public Interest</I> -- defined social deviancy down. Rather than trying to correct misbehavior or improve standards and norms of behavior, we found it increasingly easier just to excuse it away. We also had a number of societal issues that began having an impact in the 1970s and that now, 25 years later, are having a tremendous impact:
 <UL>
 <LI>The de-institutionalization of patients from mental institutions around the country was intended to put people back into the neighborhoods, and into home-care and local care facilities. But the reality was that the cracks in the floorboards of that plan were so immense that hundreds of thousands fell through them and eventually became the homeless populations in our cities in the 1970s and 1980s.
 <P>
 <LI>An increasing use of drugs during that period culminated in the mid-1980s with the explosion of crack cocaine. It has had a devastating effect.
<P>
<LI>An increasingly permissive society and our tendency to explain away aberrant behavior rather than to try to correct it has compounded the problem of policing our streets -- a problem that many police departments had great difficulty handling in the first place.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>In addition, during the 1970s and 1980s, many police departments in major cities began to shrink in size due to budgetary restraints. In the 1970s, the New York City Police Department laid off thousands of police as the city dealt with its budget crisis. In Boston, as Superintendent of the Boston Police in 1980, I had the unenviable responsibility for laying off 25 percent of the police force, closing half of their police facilities, and reducing the overall size of the department from the 2,800 officers when I joined in 1970 to 1,544 in the summer of 1982. Even as society was increasing the number of things that police were expected to deal with -- not to solve, not to prevent, but to <I>deal</I> with, to respond to -- we saw that we were falling farther and farther behind. By the 1980s, American police by and large were excused from controlling behavior in our streets or changing behavior that was aberrant, to the extent that they were also excused from doing anything about the prevention of crime.
<P>
<DD>I know for a fact, from my experience as a young police officer, as a young sergeant and lieutenant in the Boston Police who was involved in initiating neighborhood policing programs and "team" policing in the Boston area, and ultimately as the Superintendent of the Police, what I was measuring with systems that I designed using the new computers that were coming on board. I was measuring response time -- how quickly could we get cars out to the scene, how quickly could we clear calls? And our policing measures were very impersonal. We took police off the streets of America at just the time when the streets of America were beginning to flood with the worst results of the societal conditions -- conditions caused increasingly by the breakdown in the social values that have been so important in the past. As society was changing, the local police force, the very institution that had been so important in terms of controlling neighborhood streets, was shrinking and removing its officers from those streets.
<P>
<DD>The 1970s and 1980s also saw the popular culture celebrate a kind of "Adam-12" or Jack Webb "Badge 714" type of system. Jack Webb, who played the central role in the popular television series "Dragnet," was viewed as the model of American policing -- very efficient and very stern-faced. That bleeding victim or that very seriously injured rape victim was never offered a word of comfort, never an arm around the shoulder. Police wanted "just the facts, ma'am, just the facts." They had 28 minutes to solve the crime and had to get going. They did not have time to be concerned about prevention. Similarly, on the television series "Adam-12," the two handsome uniformed L.A. cops spent most of their time solving crime by chasing calls. In the 1970s and '80s, this is largely what policing looked like.
<P>
<DD>As a police executive in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I managed these organizations. I speak to you today, in 1996, having been on both sides of the equation: the way we policed in the 1970s and '80s, and the way we began to police in New York City in the 1990s. The policing of the 1990s -- which many would liken to the policing of the 1940s and '50s, with some significant modifications -- is a much better system than the one we used in the 1970s and '80s.
<P>
<DD><B>A City Falling Apart.</B> To appreciate the sea change that has occurred in New York City, we should revisit the New York City of 1990. Like many of you, I had been to New York as a tourist during the 1970s and 1980s, but not with any great frequency. My first visit as a 12-year-old in the 1950s was with my parents. I had a love affair with this great city for many, many years from a distance. In 1990, as Superintendent of Police with the Metropolitan Police in Boston, I was asked by David Gunn, then-president of the Transit Authority (who also ran the Metro system here in Washington, D.C., for a while), to come to New York and see about taking over the position of Transit Police Chief. The transit system was losing hundreds of thousands of riders a year. It is a system that carries 3.5 million riders every day on its subways, and another 1.5 million on its buses; 5 million people a day, 5 million trips a day. But in 1990 it was a system that was ridden with crime and disorder. The impact of societal breakdown was most evident in the city's subway system. I decided to come down to be interviewed.
<P>
<DD>I remember flying into New York City and the gantlet I had to run at LaGuardia Airport. There were all these cab drivers and livery drivers; it was sheer chaos, like in a Third World country, with all of them haranguing, "Take my cab, take my cab!" Finally I found a cab, got in, and off we went. I was now in the hands of somebody I did not know, who did not speak a great deal of English, in a cab that literally did not look like it was going to make it, and we were traveling down roads that were by all accounts incredible -- riddled with potholes, dirty, with graffiti everywhere, and with abandoned cars, litter, and rubber tires all along the highway from LaGuardia heading into Manhattan. "Welcome to New York."
<P>
<DD>And as we entered New York and the island of Manhattan through one of the over 15 ways to get onto the island, we encountered the notorious "squeegee pests," phalanxes of them with five, ten, and 15 at the intersection. One wondered if they were going to take the torch out of the Statute of Liberty's hand and replace it with a squeegee. This could be the official symbol of the city there; it had become that bad. This was everybody's first impression of New York: Whether you were a tourist, a visitor, a person on business, or anybody coming to the city strictly by car, people intimidated you into giving them money for what passed as washing the windshield. This was your "Welcome to New York."
<P>
<DD>I remember going down the "miracle mile," Fifth Avenue. Fifth Avenue is often described as one of the richest shopping areas in the world. Once again, I saw illegal peddlers, beggars, panhandlers, filth, graffiti, and no sign of police. The only police were riding by in police cars that looked as though they were in worse shape than the taxi I was riding in. There just did not seem to be any control, or any pride, or any sense of ownership in the streets of New York.
<P>
<DD>And then I toured the subway. If I thought the streets were bad, the subways were something else. There are 700 entranceways into the city's 450 or so subway stations. Every one of those entranceways seemed like a walk down into Dante's <I>Inferno</I>. They were dirty and grimy. The whole idea of walking below ground can be disheartening to the average person, but especially so when all the turnstiles are disabled. Vandals disabled the turnstiles so that they could stand at the entrance gates with their hands out like the squeegee pests. The only thing they offered you, though, was not to be spit upon or harangued. It was, simply, "Give me your money and I'll let you through this gate."
<P>
<DD>On every platform, there were encampments of homeless people in cardboard cities. In 1990 it was estimated that 5,000 homeless people were living in the subway system in New York City -- a system that killed about 178 of them that year as they fell onto the trains, or were hit by trains, or were murdered in the system. Subways are not for sleeping, and we had to initiate a major campaign to deal with that issue. Then we stepped onto the subway cars, which were remarkably free of graffiti. They were probably the only public entity in New York that was not marked with graffiti because there had been a major campaign in the 1980s to get rid of the graffiti on the cars. But on every car, it seemed, there were aggressive beggars or, once again, homeless people who had taken up residence there. It was not a very encouraging environment.
<P>
<DD>Because I like a challenge, I accepted the job and went to New York in 1990 as Chief of the Transit Police. Crime had been going up 25 percent a year in the three years previous to 1990, and ridership had been falling by the hundreds of thousands. Fare evasion was estimated to run about 200,000 to 250,000 occurrences a day. You could not walk in the station without seeing people leaping over or crawling under the few turnstiles that were still working.
<P>
<DD><B>A Legacy of the 1960s.</B> What you were seeing in the streets and in the subways was the result of 20 years in which cities, in particular, gave up their streets to the criminals and excused police from policing those streets -- phenomenal changes in this country. Disorder had overtaken the quality of life, as witnessed by the so-called signs of crime, as I describe them. These conditions, if left unchecked over time -- and we have conclusively shown this to be true in New York City -- will lead to more significant crime, more significant disorder, and more significant fear. This issue was eloquently addressed in an important article in the <I>Atlantic Monthly</I> in the 1980s, written by James Wilson and George Kelling, scholars who understood the importance of disorder's relationship to crime. In the article, they discussed the "broken windows" syndrome, a term which came out of an experiment conducted in Palo Alto in which the researchers put a car on the street. At first, it was in good shape. Nothing happened to that car. But whenever they broke a window or removed a tire, within a short period of time vandals swarmed around that vehicle and dismantled it.
<P>
<DD>These signs of social disorder include:
<P><UL>
 <LI><B>The first broken window.</B> You and I have seen the old factories where every window pane on their thousands of windows is broken. It started, however, with that first broken window. If you don't correct the problem, you cannot check it.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Graffiti.</B> A remarkable article published in the 1970s -- I saved it for future reference -- in <I>The New York Times</I> celebrated the arrival of graffiti in America as a new form of urban art in which the poor and the indigent could express themselves -- even though it was on everybody else's property and on city walls and parks. In the 1970s we began to celebrate graffiti, but we did not understand what this celebration would cost, projected over time. We were encouraging a form of disorder and a disrespect for other people's property, something that also engendered fear. When gigantic "murals" are covering every conceivable inch of bridge or conduit, people wonder, "What is going on here? Where are the police? Who's in control?" Graffiti lends itself to increasing a sense of social disorder. <P>
 <LI><B>Shocking headlines about crime.</B> Other elements came into play to make New York in 1990 look like a city totally out of control. Two very famous headlines appeared around the time David Dinkins had been elected as Mayor and I came down to New York. In one particular week, 14 or 15 homicides or shootings had occurred. Although they were mostly random in nature, and not against targeted victims, the victims were primarily people who were just walking down the street, even babies in carriages. People who were going about their daily business were shot, killed, and injured in the gunfire on New York City streets as drug dealers fought for turf. It was a continuation of the retreat of policing, of our streets being given up to the criminals; and it provided fertile ground for the crack epidemic of 1985 which quickly took over New York City's streets. In that one terrible week, when it seemed like everything was falling apart, <I>The New York Post</I> proclaimed, in a famous headline, "Do Something Dave!" A month later, <I>Time</I> magazine published a cover story on "New York City, The Rotten Apple" and talked about the same issues I have talked about here today.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>So, in 1990, America's largest city seemed to be falling apart. Crime had been going up, directly fueled by drugs, crack cocaine, and new types of 9mm weaponry in the hands of drug dealers and, unfortunately, increasingly in the hands of younger and younger individuals -- children who had no societal values because none were given to them either in the schools or the homes from which they came. We were losing our streets, and we were losing our homes and our schools as well -- the traditional entities that instruct and shape and guide our young people. By tolerating disorder in the streets, we effectively had given up societal control over our city. In some of our poorest neighborhoods, so much of what had helped to shape and guide and control behavior on the streets had fallen apart. New York City was probably the most vivid example of this breakdown in 1990. Fortunately, Mayor David Dinkins had just hired Lee Brown as his new Police Commissioner. Lee Brown had worked with Ed Meese and others in the development of the community policing philosophy and model. There was a developing recognition by American police chiefs, political leaders, government leaders, and academics that something was terribly wrong, and there were attempts to figure out what could be done -- more specifically, what the police could do -- to contribute to a turnaround. It was quite apparent that the professional reform model of policing was just not cutting it; crime was going up, and disorder in the streets was increasing. The genesis of community policing arose, then, from an idea of what the police should be expected to do. Out of this effort came community policing strategies as they are now practiced throughout the country. Community policing has been embraced by the President, and it has been embraced by America's police leaders as well.
<P>
<B>The Rise of Community Policing in the 1990s</B>
<P>
<DD>I have a simplistic definition of a community policing program: it must have three elements. We talked about the traditional three R's of  rapid response, random patrol, and reactive investigation. And we talked about what a failure policing by this model has been. Community policing from my perspective involves three P's, which should be merged with the three R's. These three elements are:
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> Partnership;
 <P>
 <LI> Problem solving; and
 <P>
<LI> Prevention.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
First, community policing involves something that American police lost sight of in the 1970s and 1980s -- partnership. The police are the most effective when they work in partnership with the community and when they are of the community, not apart from it. Police officers are the most effective when they are responding to citizens' needs and working with citizens on determining priorities, as well as when they are working as part of government. For instance, the police can coordinate their efforts with the Parks Department and the Transportation Department regarding the issues of graffiti and cleanup.
<P>
<DD>Partnership should exist as well among the local, state, and federal crime-fighting levels on the coordination of resources. No matter how much money government gave us in the 1970s under the L.E.A.A. [Law Enforcement Assistance Administration] program, no matter how many cops we hired, we were trying to do it on our own. We in law enforcement cannot do it on our own. There are just not enough cops in America for us to do it on our own. So the beauty and strength of community policing is the appreciation and understanding that, with partnership, we can immediately strengthen those 700,000 to 800,000 American police by adding 100 million citizens who are willing to work with the police.
<P>
<DD>And what are they going to work on? Problems. Not 911 calls, the individual incidents, but the problems that generate all those calls, and problems that generate those signs of disorder in our streets. At one point, Lee Brown had advanced an idea that we should look at crime in a medical sense. I responded to this idea when I heard it described this way: Think of malaria; for years and years the response to malaria was to swat at all those mosquitoes. But we are never going to kill all those mosquitoes. What was generating all of those mosquitoes? Swamps. Not until people went in and drained the swamps did they start dealing effectively with the problem. We have developed an inoculation to help, but draining the swamps is something that is still done to this day to control mosquitoes. Problem identification, and going after the problem, is the second P of community policing. Policing must be more focused on the problems that generate crime, whether it is actual crime or the signs of crime -- something we had not been doing well in the 1970s and '80s.
<P>
<DD>Partnership and problem solving are important, but for what purpose? Prevention -- to prevent crime in the first place, and to prevent all those victims. One of the things I feel good about is that during the two and a half years I was Police Commissioner in New York City, by  working within the administration and with those 38,000 cops, we saved over 2,500 lives. And we saved several hundreds of thousands of people from becoming victims of serious crimes. This became such a powerful motivation, such a powerful inspiration, because we saw that we could find ways to prevent crime from occurring in the first place.
<P>
<DD>While community policing has many manifestations, I would argue that any program that does not include these three elements -- partnership, problem solving, and a focus on prevention -- will not enable police to effect change in their communities effectively. Take a look at New York City in 1994. In 1990, David Dinkins hired Lee Brown. Lee Brown brought the concept of community policing to New York City and told David Dinkins that, to put community policing in and to deal with the crime problems that were already here and growing, the city needed to increase the size of its police forces. At that time there were three forces: transit police, housing police, and the city police. In the Transit Authority, I had about 3,600 cops. And there were about 2,600 in the housing police force, who were responsible for the 600,000 people living in the city's 1,000 housing developments.
<P>
<DD>
The city subsequently passed a very significant piece of legislation -- the Safe Street legislation -- as a tax initiative to raise money specifically for hiring 7,000 more police, but also to provide funds for programs that would help prevention, programs within the schools, and something that unfortunately oftentimes has been sloughed off as nonessential, "midnight basketball." In New York City we had beacon schools, and we utilized the school buildings after hours as places for kids to go rather than hanging out on street corners. The Safe Street legislation had quite a bit of money initially for these types of issues; the funds were not to be used exclusively by police, but rather to provide a way to look at the bigger picture -- the prevention picture, if you will.
<P>
<DD>By 1994, when the next mayoral election rolled around, the city had witnessed the addition of several thousand police out of the 7,000 promised (many were in the pipeline), and the community policing philosophy had become an integral part of the NYPD. The department was structured around community policing. But the crime situation did not appear to be getting better. Starting in 1990, crime began to go down, and by the end of 1993, crime had gone down over four years something like 9 percent or 11 percent. But it had been going down in only small, incremental ways. Of the police that were promised, only 2,000 to 3,000 had been hired because it takes time to add 7,000 police officers to a force of 38,000. Consequently, the street conditions had not improved significantly, and people were not feeling that anything had changed.
<P>
<DD><B>Understanding the Quality-of-Life Issues.</B> One of the flaws, if you will, of the community policing initiative of the early 1990s is that a lot of the quality-of-life issues that I believe were causing so much fear remained visibly unchanged, uninterrupted. Quality-of-life issues in New York City are many, since New York is a very large city -- with 8 million people concentrated in 350 square miles, and covered by 76 police precincts. I would argue that no two police precincts in the city have the same set of problems that are of concern to the people that live in them, at least in terms of crime and fear of crime.
<P>
<DD>I live in mid-town Manhattan on Central Park South. Central Park is one of the premier addresses in the world. My front yard is Central Park. In my neighborhood, the issues that generate fear and that are raised at police precinct community council meetings are not about rapes or murders; they are about delivery boys on bicycles riding down the elderly as they make deliveries to buildings. People raise issues about aggressive begging. They also raise the issue about something that is also one of my pet concerns -- and which I can witness from my front window -- and that is public urination in back of the beautiful statue that sits at the front entrance of Central Park, an area that is costing millions to renovate. This statue had become a public urinal. In one of the most beautiful parks in the world, the situation had deteriorated to the extent that nobody was correcting these conditions, conditions that were seen every day by the residents of that neighborhood. It is a neighborhood that has so few murders, so few rapes, and so few burglaries that people were not fearful of these types of crime to which police traditionally respond. Instead, they were fearful of quality-of-life types of transgressions.
<P>
<DD>Meanwhile, in east New York, the 75th precinct had 140 murders in 1990. People there were concerned about shootings, about randomly being shot down on the street, and about the drug dealing that had been allowed to continue uninterrupted, or seemingly uninterrupted, by the police for many years. The quality-of-life issues were different in each of the city's 76 precincts, yet the police were attempting to deal with them throughout the early 1990s as they had done in the 1970s and '80s, with a monolithic police structure.
<P>
<DD><B>The Centralized Bureaucracy.</B> As the New York City Police Commissioner, I was an all-powerful individual. In that organization, everything had to go to the top of the pile to get approval -- even the community policing program. The many thousands of extra police and the well-thought-out programs my predecessors attempted to put into place had created a centralized type of community policing in which the precincts were told exactly how many officers they would have in community policing. Within the precincts, the community police officers were separate from the rest of the precinct officers who were still chasing 911 calls and doing random patrols. The entities were not talking to each other. But each precinct was mandated to have 40 or 50 officers and was told how many officers they could have in plain clothes. It was a centralized bureaucracy that was not capable of responding to the many different needs around the city. It was also, from a management perspective, an entity that had become overspecialized -- and this is an important element in understanding why New York was not doing a good job in many respects at reducing crime. Although it was containing crime, and it was beginning to reduce it, it was not making the wholesale types of reductions that we saw in 1994 and 1995, and that we are seeing now in 1996.
<P>
<DD>The one thing we know about the criminal element is that they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Those are awful working conditions because they have to work all the time. But New York City's police department, by and large, worked from 9 to 5. Our response units were working 24 hours a day responding to the crimes that occurred, but the gun squad in New York worked Monday to Friday, 9 to 5; the auto theft squad in New York worked Monday to Friday, 10 to 6. In the community policing program, we had authorized thousands of young police officers to make their own hours in response to the neighborhoods' concerns. We gave them flex-time. Interestingly, most of them were still working Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. We were a department that was not where the problems were, so we were not making a great change in crime, and because we were not focused on the quality-of-life issues, we were making no change in what people were seeing everyday. They still saw police walk by all those conditions on the streets.
<P>
<DD><B>Crime and Corruption.</B> I should point out that the factor that drives most of the serious crime in New York City is the use and sale of illegal drugs, though we might argue whether it accounts for 40 percent or 70 percent of the serious crime, because you hear different figures. But New York's real drug problem, which began back in the 1970s, was a problem that most of America's police departments did not experience. It was a problem that compounded New York's difficulty in trying to deal with drugs, particularly when the crack cocaine epidemic exploded in the 1980s. What real problem was this? It was corruption in the police department. In the 1970s, the Knapp Commission reported on its investigations of corruption in the police department. As a result, one of my predecessors, former Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy, was saddled with trying to reduce, remove, or eliminate the systemic corruption that the commission had identified. This corruption reached from the bottom to the top, from the cop on the beat to the police chiefs. It was a systemic corruption that was largely, in today's jargon, somewhat benign in that cops were taking payoffs to look the other way about licensing and premise violations, prostitution, and gaming types of activities -- somewhat minor crimes, if you will, in the overall scheme of things. But this corruption had the same overall effect on the public: The police were not trusted. Police had crossed the line from being protectors to being abusers.
<P>
<DD>In any event, Pat Murphy did a wonderful job in a very short period of time in removing the systemic corruption in that department. But because of this fear of corruption, one way the police in the 1970s and '80s tried to remove the systemic corruption was not authorizing the uniformed police workforce to interact in the drug problems on the street. When the crack cocaine epidemic exploded in 1985, drug dealers were on every street, even on Wall Street; yet the uniformed police in New York City were discouraged from interacting with them. The uniformed cops reported their information to a very heavily supervised Organized Crime Control Bureau, with 2,000 detectives working in squads under sergeants. The problems were so big, however, that this specialized headquarters unit could not possibly solve the drug problem in New York City. Meanwhile, the other 30,000 New York cops were riding on by.
<P>
<DD>In the 1970s and in the 1980s, we were attempting to deal with crime the way we always had, but the nature of the corruption had changed. The corruption now was much worse, much more insidious -- with drug dealers paying off cops not only to look the other way, but at times to protect their shipments. In the 1990s, it had gotten so bad that, by the time of my appointment in 1994, a new anti-corruption commission -- the Mollen Commission -- had issued a report on the widespread corruption in the NYPD. This commission found pockets of corruption -- not systemic corruption throughout the organization, but pockets centered particularly with patrol officers in the city's most crime-ridden, most drug-ridden precincts: the 30th, the 44th, the 48th, the 75th. Wherever you had drugs, you had police corruption in the form of officers who were stealing the drugs and stealing the guns, reselling them, and protecting the drug dealers. Cops themselves had become the criminals. And the organizational structure at this time was such that the department was not policing the problems of the 1990s. They were still policing the problems of the 1970s, and these problems had generated a further pull-back of New York City's police officers from effectively controlling the streets.
<P>
<DD>In 1993, mayoral candidate Giuliani campaigned on three issues: crime, schools, and the economy. The economy lost 400,000 jobs in the previous four years. The schools had ceased to teach 1.1 million school children who, upon graduation, could not take even the most menial jobs in the private-sector economy because they were just not educated. Based on an increasing sense as well that, despite more cops being hired, the crime situation was not getting better, New Yorkers by a very slim margin took David Dinkins out of office and put Rudolph Giuliani in.
<P>
<DD>One of Giuliani's first appointments was to ask me to come back as Commissioner of Police. During the period between 1990 and 1992, while crime had gone down 1 percent to 3 percent in the city as a whole, in the subway system it had gone down 22 percent. We had begun to put in place within the transit system a set of strategies that I would later employ in 1994 as Police Commissioner in New York City. And these strategies were quite simple: They were not only focused on solving the causes of the subway crimes, but they also aggressively attacked those quality-of-life signs of crime. The duality of these two elements, the causes and the signs of crime, was generating fear in New York City, in the subways, and in the streets.
<P>
<DD><B>Making Subways Safer.</B> In the subway system, we began by aggressively arresting the fare evaders and ejecting disorderly people from the subway. I had more tools to work with than the city police, so we began strategically to go after what little crime there actually was in the subway system. For a system serving 5 million riders a day with bus and subway passengers, there were only about 60 to 70 reported crimes a day. The chances of being a victim of a crime in the subway system were statistically like the chances of winning the lottery. But what people saw every day -- the disorder, the fare evaders, and police who were not doing anything about it -- reinforced their fears and, rather than subjecting themselves to the cause of this fear, people were beginning to stay away.
<P>
<DD>We began to turn this around for the first time in years by having our officers enforce quality-of-life rules in the subway system. And what did we find? We found that one out of every seven people that we arrested for fare evasion was wanted on a warrant, and one out of every 21 was carrying some type of weapon. Crime in the subways was crime of opportunity, committed by people who were not paying the fares but who were carrying a weapon and were wanted on warrants. Chances were good that they were not coming into the subway just to commute back and forth to work: They were at work, and you and I were the people they were looking to work on. By arresting them as they came in, and by doing it on a large scale and putting police out in so many different ways, we began to change behaviors. We began to control behavior in the subway system.
<P>
<DD>We began to change the environment so much that, in 1996, the number of estimated fare evaders on any given day in New York City's subway system is between 30,000 and 40,000, which is down from the 200,000 to 250,000 occurrences in 1990. We changed that behavior. How do I know that we changed it? By looking at the statistics of fare evaders who were arrested this year: Only about one in 100 are wanted on a warrant, and one in many hundreds are actually carrying a weapon. People did not voluntarily start paying the fares and stop carrying their weapons into the system; they did these things because they knew the police were there and the police were going to act on any type of misbehavior.
<P>
<DD><B>Making the Streets Safer.</B> When Mayor Giuliani interviewed me for the position of Commissioner of Police, he asked: What could you do in the streets? Could you do the same thing you did in the subways? I told him I believed we could, but it was going to take several things. First, it would require his political will, as Mayor, to focus on the issues of primary concern -- the economy, crime, and the schools -- and second, to coordinate all the activities of the agencies of government. On the crime issue, this meant that the Parks Department and the Transportation Department would work with other city agencies on the quality-of-life issues that were generating fear. They would aggressively go after graffiti and littering; they would aggressively go after public drinking and all the other things that generated fear. While the police are enforcing these laws, the rest of city government would be involved in remedying and removing the visible signs. If graffiti was put up on a wall, it would be taken off very quickly. By implementing this partnership to address the signs of crime as well as the crime itself, we began to reduce the fear.
<P>
<DD><B>Decentralizing the Bureaucracy.</B> In the New York City Police Department, we did several things. First, I decentralized. I gave away many of my powers not -- as my predecessors wanted -- to the cop on the beat, but rather to the precinct commander. I did not want to give more power to the cops on the beat. They were, on the average, only 22 years of age. Most of them never held a job before becoming New York City police officers, and had only high school or GED qualification. These kids, after six months of training, were not prepared to solve the problems of New York City; sorry, but it just was not going to work that way. However, my precinct commanders typically had an average of 15 years of service, and they were some of the best and the brightest on the police force. All of them were college educated; all were very sophisticated; and they were at the appropriate level in the organization to which power should be decentralized.
<P>
<DD><B>Establishing Managerial Accountability.</B> My form of community policing, therefore, versus former Police Commissioners Lee Brown's and Ray Kelly's, put less emphasis on the cop on the beat and much more emphasis on the precinct commanders, the same precinct commanders who met with community councils and with neighborhood groups. They were empowered to decide how many plain clothes officers to assign, how many to put in community policing, on bicycle patrols, and in robbery squads. They were empowered to assign officers as they saw fit -- in uniform or in plain clothes -- to focus on the priorities of that neighborhood. If it was a 75th precinct, they would focus on the shootings and the drug dealings. If the problem was the bicycle messengers on the sidewalks of Manhattan, they would go after that. Whatever was generating the fear in their precinct, they were empowered to address it by prioritizing their responses. We decentralized the organization, and I eliminated a few levels in the organization of the force and in the hierarchy as well.
<P>
<DD>Second, we put into place a system called COMPSTAT (for computer statistics) to manage our 38,000 police officers and a 44,000-person organization. When I began running the NYPD in 1994, the crime statistics were gathered only twice a year for the sole purpose of submitting the statistics to the FBI for their semiannual and annual reports. The NYPD did not use crime statistics to manage the routine assignment of resources. At first, they told us we could not get crime stats on a daily or weekly basis -- there were just too many of them. Finally, with a lot of prodding, pushing, kicking, and replacement of personnel and the naysayers, we developed a system so that I could get crime statistics every day and, more important, every week to share with the rest of the department. It was timely, accurate intelligence. Imagine trying to run a business without timely, accurate information on where your customers are and where your markets are; it is not an efficient or profitable way to operate.
<P>
<DD><B>Using the Private-Sector Model.</B> We began to run the NYPD as a private profit-oriented business. What was the profit I wanted? Crime reduction. I wanted to beat my competitors -- the criminals -- who were out there working seven days a week, 24 hours a day. I wanted to serve my customers, the public, better; and the profit I wanted to deliver to them was reduced crime. All of my franchises -- my 76 precincts -- were measured, not on how many calls they responded to, but on how much crime was reduced. And every one of the 76 precincts in New York City saw a double-digit decline in crime, so the results were not just happening in the war-torn neighborhoods. Crime reductions were happening throughout the city by our empowering the precincts to act. We were running the police department as a business, and we developed the COMPSTAT process to facilitate it.
<P>
<DD>The city of New York is divided into eight geographical areas, or boroughs. We call them patrol boroughs, and each one has 8 to 10 precincts. Once a month from 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning, we would have a borough come down with its precinct commanders and detective squad commanders to meet with all the headquarters specialized units, all the super chiefs in the departments, myself as Police Commissioner, probation, parole, and District Attorney representatives, crime analysis representatives, and representatives from each of the other seven boroughs. For three hours we would work on the issue of crime in that borough: Why is it up? Why is it down? What's happening? We utilized computerized statistics. Using very large computerized pin maps to show where the crime is occurring, we would ask ourselves: What are we doing about it? Where are we making arrests? Where are the parolees living? Large amounts of information were reduced to the simplest form by such computer analysis.
<P>
<DD><B>Sharing Information.</B> Another major element of what we did in this new process at NYPD was inclusion, not exclusion. The NYPD had been run as an exclusive organization; it would exclude people from information. We approached it from the other direction -- inclusion: Give everybody as much information as they need and want. The sharing went on in that room from 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning; everybody was sharing information. If an issue was raised, such as why someone could not make an arrest, and the answer came out that it was because the District Attorney would not give them the complaints, I could confront the District Attorney's representatives who were right there. Instead of spending three or four days trying to track the D.A. down, I could get answers directly from someone right there in the room. And if that representative did not have the answer, then I would call the D.A.  Intimacy, the sharing of information in as wide a range as possible, inclusion, and COMPSTAT were important to this process.
<P>
<DD>It is my belief that the COMPSTAT process can be utilized effectively by any police department, in this country and abroad. The COMPSTAT process is made up of four very simple elements:

 <P>
 <UL>
<LI><B>Timely, accurate intelligence.</B> What good is crime statistics information for preventing crime when it is gathered only twice a year?
 <P>
 <LI><B>Rapid response.</B> Using the COMPSTAT process, we could identify a trend developing with only two or three incidences, instead of waiting for 40 or 50 over six months. Sharing this information so that everybody is aware of a problem and works together on providing resources very quickly to address that problem allows us to rapidly respond to where the crime is happening -- using plain clothes, uniforms, specialized units, or whatever is required.
 <P>
 <LI><B>Effective tactics.</B> We were able to ask ourselves: What works? The answer could be plain clothes, uniforms, or coordinated activity with the Feds or the D.A.
 <P>
<LI><B>Relentless follow-up.</B> People in that meeting knew they were coming back the next month, and that next month we were going to talk about the same issues that were raised this month. The issues don't go away. We weren't discussing something that happened one time and then could be put on the shelf. In the COMPSTAT process, everyone knew they were coming back to explain why crime is up or why it is down. Over the last two years, every precinct commander in the police department has been replaced. Many of them have been promoted up because they were doing such a good job, but many others were moved out because they were not doing a good job. They were not moved out because they were not reducing crime. They were moved out because they didn't understand the problems in their community and they were not responding to these problems effectively; after several tries, if they still were not responding, they were replaced.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
Timely, accurate intelligence is a very important element in this process. Let me give you an analogy. In World War II, Germany was getting ready to invade the British Isles. They had forced the British to flee Dunkirk. The British had only 450 Spitfires scattered around all of England to protect its cities. The Germans had thousands of bombers that they were flying over English cities every day. However, the British had one thing that the Germans didn't have: They had radar. As German bombers began coming out of bases in Europe and headed toward Britain, the radar allowed the British to vector where those bombers were heading while they were still over the English Channel. Using that information, the British were able to mobilize the 450 Spitfires and vector them right onto the German bombers. Timely, accurate information, rapid response, effective tactics. Despite very few resources, they knew where the enemy was. That's what won the Battle of Britain.
<P>
<DD>
<B>Getting Results.</B> Similarly, in New York City, we now know where the enemy is, up to the minute; we know where the problems are, and we go after them. That COMPSTAT meeting room is a high-pressure environment, with 200 to 250 police officials and others looking at crime. It is show time. In one of our meetings, Jack Maple, my principal crime strategist, asked the commander of one of the east New York precincts to put on the map all of the drug complaints in that precinct; and up they went. The whole map was covered with complaints, but there were clusters, the hot spots. Then he asked the commander to mark where his drug units were making arrests last month. Those went up right off the bat. Interestingly, the complaints were on one side of the map; the drug arrests were on the other side. You would think they would overlap each other. This process graphically showed what was going on under the old system, where police were rated "effective" by the number of arrests they were making, not by the problems they were solving. They were rated on the incidents they responded to, not on the problems they were solving.
<P>
<DD>When we asked the drug unit commander why his officers were making arrests on that side of the precinct and not over where the complaints were, he responded that the complaints were coming from the public housing developments. When asked why they were not making arrests there if the drug complaints came from there, he responded that it was hard to make arrests there. Can you imagine what it is like to live there if the police will not even go there to make arrests? That was the mentality running the NYPD, and I guarantee it is still running many major police departments. Cops are still being measured on their arrests, not on their solutions to problems.
<P>
<DD>In New York, the major turnaround came because we began to focus -- unlike professional reform policing of the 1970s and 1980s -- on the three P's of partnership, problem solving, and prevention. I would also argue that the principal reason (and there are many) that crime is down in New York City is that there is the political will to utilize the police in different ways. But it is also due to the strategies we are employing, with the focus on problem solving rather than incidence response. Specifically, we are getting better at understanding the importance of the quality of life, of changing behavior at the street level and controlling behavior, and thus preventing crime farther down the line.
<P>
<DD>We have seen time and time again that when those 38,000 cops interrupt somebody drinking on the street, or a gang of kids drinking on a corner, pat them down, and find a gun or a knife, they have prevented what would have happened two or three hours later when someone who was drunk pulled out the gun or knife. Usually this would have ended with another murder victim, but we prevented the crime before it happened. New York City police are now all about prevention, and we are doing it lawfully.
<P>
<DD>This is not to say that there have not been any circumstances -- and I will be very truthful about this -- causing complaints against police officers in New York City. But when I match the 9,000 or so complaints against the 38,000 cops who are making 300,000 arrests and issuing several million summonses, and against the millions upon millions of street encounters by police who are encouraged to get out there and take back the streets, I think that 9,000 complaints is a fair exchange -- if in fact the police are being supervised, if they are being trained, and if they are being encouraged to do all that they do with one underlying principle, the issue of respect. Police have to do their work in such a way that they do not lose the respect of their communities. In a very celebrated case recently in New York City, a police officer did not treat residents with respect. That one incident has reversed so much of the good hard work of the police in that neighborhood because, once again, the police are not being trusted, and it is all due to the action, the aberrant behavior, of a single officer. One incident like that can be used against any other police officer in New York City. All your good work can get washed away when you do not police communities with respect.
<P>
<DD>We have come a long way in New York City. We have come a long way in this country as well. Many communities are now embracing community policing. The Heritage Foundation has also come out with <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">21 recommendations</a>.<sup>1</sup> A lot of people are coming up with ideas, and the good news is that many of those ideas are good. In New York City, an old adage says that "If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere." This applies to community policing. What arguably was once America's most dangerous, most crime-ridden city is now being pointed to -- and rightfully so -- as one of America's safest cities. If we can make it happen in New York City, with many of the difficulties we faced in New York, then I would argue that hope and optimism should be out there for everybody else.
<P>
<DD>I believe that as a profession we found better ways of policing in New York City, and a lot of our success lies under the umbrella of community policing and the philosophy it espouses. You and I -- you as the public and I in my former capacity as a member of the police force -- can work together to deal with the problems that you and I identify. And we will work from the basic premise that it is much better to prevent a crime than to solve it after the fact.

<P>
<DD>As the United States prepares to enter the 21st century, its educational system is in crisis. Despite the more than $175 billion in program dollars that have been spent by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) over the past 16 years on elementary and secondary education, achievement scores continue to stagnate as increasing proportions of America's youth drop out of school.<sup>1</sup>  Most of America's students are not meeting proficient levels in reading, and, in 1994, 57 percent of high school seniors lacked even a basic knowledge of U.S. history.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, impoverished children in inner-city and rural areas often lack access to schools that adequately equip them to escape the cycle of poverty and dependency. In some of these school districts there are twice as many school-related crime incidents as there are graduating seniors.<sup>3</sup>  Such statistics strongly suggest the need for Congress to require a closer evaluation of where the ED's dollars go and whether they have any measured impact on educational achievement.
<P>
<DD>
In order to determine where the ED allocates elementary and secondary education dollars and their effects, ideally we would want to know how much of every elementary and secondary education program dollar reaches classrooms in local schools and what effect each program dollar has on achievement. In addition, to determine the full value of ED elementary and secondary education spending, we also would want to determine what states must spend of their own money to receive federal dollars and comply with its regulations and requirements. Comprehensive data such as these, however, do not currently exist.
<P>
<DD>
Based on data available at this time, we can calculate what portion of each tax dollar that funds ED elementary and secondary education programs reaches school districts. According to The Heritage Foundation Education Finance Model, which tracks the ED funds reaching local school districts using data from the ED and other federal agencies,<sup>4</sup> our initial examination of the ED's spending on elementary and secondary education found that 85 cents of each dollar the ED allocates for elementary and secondary programs is sent to school districts. To put it another way, based on 1993 data, of the more than $14 billion allocated to the ED elementary and secondary education programs included in our analysis, $2 billion was allocated to entities other than local school districts.<sup>5</sup>  This money was used to pay for administrative overhead, as well as state and national programs of unknown effectiveness. 
<P>
<DD>
At the national level, there has been considerable debate about the proper role of the federal government in education and, more specifically, the need for the ED itself. The continuing poor educational performance of America's schoolchildren suggests a need to reexamine the role of the U.S. Department of Education in funding elementary and secondary education. This paper is the first in a series that will look at the federal role in education: It examines where the ED's elementary and secondary education dollars go, and what steps Congress needs to take in order for each state to evaluate what it is getting from the funds received from the ED.
<P>

<B>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SPENDING ON ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION</B>
<P>
<DD>
The vast majority of all federal education funds does not go to schools or school districts. In 1995, 33 percent of the total $100 billion the federal government allocated for education was spent by the ED; less than half of all ED funds went to elementary and secondary education (see see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/fyi126c1.gif">Chart 1</a>); and less than 40 percent of ED funds went to local educational agencies, 13.1 percent of total federal education spending.<sup>6</sup>  Contrary to what many Americans believe, the ED actually funds very few elementary and secondary education programs in their local communities.
<P>
<DD>
In fact, ED spending amounts to only about 4.5 percent of all the money, including state and local revenues, spent for elementary and secondary education. Yet it has a significant influence on state and local education agencies and on schools all across the country.<sup>7</sup>  These programs fundamentally shape how states and local school districts allocate their resources to meet the unique educational needs of their student populations. In order to receive federal money, state and local educational agencies must spend their own state and local tax dollars to apply for funds and to comply with the regulations that often dictate not just how the federal money is spent, but also how state and local money must be spent.<sup>8</sup>  Therefore, it is all the more important to understand where ED elementary and secondary education dollars go and how they affect academic achievement.
<P>
<DD>
The majority of the funds appropriated for elementary and secondary education programs is dedicated to addressing the needs of disadvantaged and disabled students through Chapter 1/Title I and Education for Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) programs. In FY 1993 (the year for which this analysis was performed), about 70 percent of the ED's $14 billion in elementary and secondary appropriations funded such programs. 
<P>
<DD>
In addition to programs addressing the needs of special populations, Congress has appropriated funds for various programs in which there is a perceived need or federal role, such as Safe and Drug Free Schools and Bilingual Education. This paper's <a href="#app1">Appendix 1</a> lists the ED elementary and secondary programs that primarily send their money to local school districts, either directly or via state educational agencies. There is a wide range in the amounts of total program funding that reach local school districts. 
<P>
<DD>
What portion of all ED spending on elementary and secondary education actually goes to local school districts for their direct use?  Based on The Heritage Foundation's Education Finance Model using 1993 tax and budget data, about 15 cents of every tax dollar sent to Washington, D.C., for ED elementary and secondary education programs -- more than $2 billion -- is spent on state and national programs and administration.<sup>9</sup>  This spending breaks down as follows:

</center>
<P>
<DD>The ED, like all other federal Cabinet agencies, is funded with revenues appropriated by Congress and composed primarily of individual and corporate tax revenues. Based on the proportion of all individual taxes sent to the federal government from each state and what that state receives as a proportion of ED elementary and secondary education spending, we are able to calculate each state's net "return."  Because the majority of the funds local school districts receive from the ED is allocated to address the needs of students who are disadvantaged or have special needs, certain states receive a greater return per tax dollar than others. According to our analysis, school districts in Connecticut, for example, receive only 39 cents in return for every dollar sent to Washington for elementary and secondary education programs operated by the ED (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/fyi126t1.gif">Table 1</a>). School districts in Alaska, on the other hand, have relatively smaller school populations and receive additional funds from Impact Aid and Indian Education; consequently, they receive more than $3 for every tax dollar sent to Washington for ED's elementary and secondary education programs. 
<P>
<DD>
But, as the Heritage model shows, not all of the individual and corporate tax revenue that goes to Washington goes back to local school districts. More than $2 billion is spent on state and national programs and administration. How is that extra money being spent?
<P>

<B>Department of Education Elementary and Secondary Spending on Administration and National and Federally Funded State Programs</b>
<P>
<DD>
Slightly more than $2 billion -- 15 cents of every tax dollar appropriated by Congress to fund the ED's elementary and secondary education programs -- is being spent by the ED, state governments, universities, libraries, and private organizations on administration, national programs, and federally funded state programs.
<p>
<B>National Programs</B>
<P>
<DD>
The ED funds many national programs and activities that are administered directly by the ED and designed to effect change at the national or regional level rather than just at the local level.<sup>10</sup>  Many programs that send funds to the states to be distributed to local school districts have national components that are operated at the federal level. The Safe and Drug Free Schools program, for example, sends funds to the states in its State Grants program, but it also has a "National Programs" component that is operated at the federal level. The recipients of funds from these programs are primarily universities and private organizations. A few programs award competitive grants to individual schools and school districts<sup>11</sup> (see <a href="#app2">Appendix 2</a>).
<P>
<DD>
<B>Lack of Evaluation.</B> Most of these national programs have not been subject to the level of critical evaluation or oversight that one normally would expect, such as a review by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the financial investigative arm of Congress. Evaluating national programs often is difficult and subjective, and these evaluations frequently are not conducted because funds are not going directly toward increasing student achievement. In these cases, the sole remaining determination is whether the program is run efficiently; even these kinds of data, however, rarely are collected.
<P>
<DD>
Several of the evaluations that do exist indicate the funds are not being used effectively. Some examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> An audit of Women's Educational Equity (WEEA), a program designed to promote equity in education for women that specifically targets elementary and secondary students, was described by the GAO as a "program with no director, with a staff of one and one-quarter persons in two different offices of the Department... with too many resources [going] for direct services to small numbers of persons."<sup>12</sup>  Only 17 percent of WEEA awards go to state and local school districts, and the GAO found little evidence that the other recipients were working with state or local education agencies to address equity problems in public schools.<sup>13</sup>  According to the GAO, there is "little evidence of their effectiveness in eliminating sex bias in education."<sup>14</sup>
<P>
<LI> A study of the Ellender Fellowships program found that, although federal and private funding for the program had increased significantly, the number of fellowships had declined steadily. The study also found that more teachers and administrators had received funds than students.<sup>15</sup>
<P>
<LI> The Media and Captioning Services, funded under the Individuals with Disabilities Act, spends $19 million to close-caption television shows, targeting those that enrich the "general, educational and cultural experiences and advancement of individuals with hearing impairment."<sup>16</sup>  In the second half of the 104th Congress, the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee discovered that, according to the ED, such programs as "Baywatch," "Regis and Kathie Lee," and "The Young and the Restless" fit this category and are included in the close-captioning project.<sup>17</sup> 
</UL>
<P>
<B>State Programs</B>
<P>
<DD>
Under such programs as Eisenhower Math and Science and Title I, as well as others among those listed in the Appendix, states have the option of keeping funds for state programs and activities. In addition, the ED often allows -- and often requires -- state governments to allocate elementary and secondary appropriations to universities, libraries, and private organizations. More than 5 cents of every education tax dollar sent to the states is allocated by state governments to recipients other than local education agencies. The types of programs funded with these allocations range from university research in the area of elementary and secondary drug curriculum to awards for private organizations for the purpose of operating community activities.

<P>
<B>Administrative Costs</B>
<P>
<DD>
The ED uses approximately $130 million just for administering elementary and secondary education programs, which includes salaries, expenses, and departmental management. Because the ED currently does not track administrative expenditures by program, it is difficult to determine whether a program is being operated efficiently. Calculating an "overhead" percentage per program would enable Congress to determine whether a program is being operated in an efficient manner, or even if it is possible to administer certain types of programs at the federal level in a cost-effective manner.
<P>
<DD>
The ED also permits states to keep a certain percentage of their federal program dollars in order to administer and operate these programs.<sup>18</sup>  About 5 cents of every tax dollar spent by the ED on elementary and secondary education goes toward this purpose. For example, states are permitted to keep 1 percent of funds they receive for Chapter 1/Title I for administrative expenses. 
<P>
<DD>
According to the GAO, the states fund a significant portion of their state education agencies with federal funds.<sup>19</sup>  In FY 1993, for example, federal funds constituted about 41 percent of all state education operating funds, and 41 percent of the staff were federally funded.<sup>20</sup>  For all education programs, the states keep 5.8 percent of all federal funds they receive in order to administer and operate federal programs, about four times greater than the percentage of state funds retained for the same purpose. According to the GAO study, state officials found that federal education programs had more significant administrative and regulatory requirements than state programs, and that these requirements contributed to higher administrative costs, as evidenced by the higher proportion of funds retained for federal programs.<sup>21</sup>
<p>
<B>What Actually Makes It to the Schools and Classrooms?</B>
<P>
<DD>
The Heritage Foundation Education Finance Model tracks only what portion of ED elementary and secondary education dollars reaches school districts: districts, however, are still several layers of bureaucracy away from classrooms. School districts are not required at this time to track what portion of their ED dollars is sent directly to schools and classrooms. And few districts -- and virtually no parents and taxpayers -- have any accurate data with which to figure out how many cents on the dollar reach the classroom.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
<DD>
There are studies, however, that indicate just how little in general gets from school districts to the classroom. Audits around the country have found as little as 26 percent of school district funds is being spent on classroom expenditures.<sup>23</sup>  But Coopers & Lybrand, an accounting firm, has designed a new financial model to analyze what portion of school district education money actually reaches schools and classrooms. This model was released recently after it was field tested in 118 school districts and 17 states, and is now being implemented statewide in South Carolina and Rhode Island. The Coopers & Lybrand model is not designed to address the issue of specifically tracking ED funds, but results from the districts in which the model has been tested give an overall idea of the portion of each federal tax dollar that is returned to schools and classrooms. For example, New York City Public School System Chancellor Rudy Crew recently released an analysis that was built on a 1994 Coopers & Lybrand analysis of the city's public school system. The report found that only 43 percent of the district's total funds were spent on direct classroom expenditures.<sup>24</sup>  
<P>
<DD>
If the New York City Public School System provides any indication of what portion of federal dollars reaches the classroom nationwide, then there is an even more serious need to determine what schools are receiving in fact from ED elementary and secondary education funds, and how they are benefiting.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
<DD>
The U.S. Department of Education currently spends over $2 billion of individual and corporate tax dollars on programs and administrative costs that do not directly involve local school districts. Some states see a return on this investment; others do not, however, and, in some cases, the loss may be significant. Because of stagnant achievement results over the past 15 years, and the range and amount of funds states receive in return for their investment in the ED's programs, state and local communities and Congress have a right to know what they are getting for their money. 
<P>
<DD>
In order for Congress and state and local school districts to evaluate properly what they are receiving from the ED, Congress should:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B> Take steps to evaluate the effectiveness of national and state programs that do not allocate funds primarily to local school districts or schools.</B> Programs that do send funds primarily to schools should also undergo evaluation, of course. If such programs do not benefit students, money should be sent back to state and local communities to be used as they deem necessary to meet the unique needs of their student populations.
<P>
<LI><B>Require the ED to track their administrative costs by program,</B> so that policymakers can determine whether a program is being operated efficiently and can keep administrative costs to a minimum. 
<P>
<LI><B>Encourage states that receive ED funds to track expenditures of federal and state revenues for the administration of federal programs.</B> State education agencies have little or no specific information at this time on the proportion of federal and state revenues they expend to administer federal programs.
<P>
<LI><B>Encourage states and local school districts to employ the use of financial models</B> that would allow them to account for how scarce educational resources are being spent.
</UL>
<P>
<DD>
Before there can be any serious debate as to whether states and local communities benefit from the tax dollars they send to Washington for elementary and secondary education as funded by the Department of Education, more information is needed about how the money is being spent and whether the programs benefit the educational well-being of children.

</UL>
<P>
<B>Design of Model</B>
<P>
<DD>
In order to determine what portion of Department of Education elementary and secondary education dollars reaches local school districts, the following questions needed to be answered:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>How much money does each state receive for elementary and secondary education programs from the U.S. Department of Education (ED)?</B>
<P>
The amount of money received by the states is collected by the National Center for Education Statistics. We used their file, entitled "The Distribution of StateAdministered Federal Education Funds in FY 1993," as well as data from the Departments of Education and Commerce and the General Accounting Office (GAO).
<P>
<LI>
<B>How much does each state contribute in individual tax revenues to fund the ED? </B>
<P>

IRS statistics of income data for tax year 1993 provide data on what each state sent to Washington in individual taxes. By multiplying total individual tax revenue by the percentage of general revenues composed of ED elementary and secondary program dollars, we were able to calculate the portion of tax revenues funding those programs. 
<P>
<LI>
<B>What is the net return to each state for every individual tax dollar sent to the ED to fund elementary and secondary programs? </B>
<P>

This calculation is based on the proportion of general revenues used to fund ED elementary and secondary education programs, adjusting that percentage to include only revenues from individual tax dollars. We subtracted what each state received from the ED in elementary and secondary appropriations from their proportionate "share" of elementary and secondary funds based on their relative share of individual taxes.
</UL>
<P>
<B>
Data Adjustments and Assumptions</B>
<P>

<DD>Most of the education programs included in this analysis are "forward funded."  Thus, FY 1993 appropriations correspond roughly to the 19931994 school year. Although the 1993 tax year does not correspond exactly, we concluded that any difference would be negligible.
<P>

<DD>
Wherever possible, we included outlays, not obligations, in our calculations. 

<P>
<B>Tax Data</B>
<P>

<DD>We adjusted the state-by-state individual tax data downward in order to match aggregate data from the Office of Management and Budget on the portion of general revenue composed of individual taxes. This was necessary because the state breakdown of individual tax revenues is estimated by the Internal Revenue Service using a sample of the tax returns from each state.
<P>
<DD>
Because of the difficulties associated with breaking down corporate tax revenues by state, we examined only individual taxes to determine what portion of each tax dollar is received by local school districts. Seventy percent of the U.S. government's general revenues is composed of individual tax dollars. We adjusted the total amount of individual tax dollars spent at the department and state level accordingly, assuming a constant rate of loss per corporate tax dollar as well as for individual tax dollars in order to come up with the total $2 billion in taxes spent. Thus, the sum of what each state nets from the ED does not amount to $2 billion, because the state totals reflect only individual taxes.
<P>
<B>Education Data</B>
<P>
<DD>
In order to control most efficiently for differences in state reporting of funds received from the ED, for the purposes of this model we assumed that states disbursed 100 percent of the funds received from the ED during the fiscal year in question. Consequently, we distributed among the types of recipients the difference between the total allocations reported by each state and what each state actually was appropriated.
<P>
<DD>
When a state receives funding from the ED, it either retains it for use by state agencies or allocates it to five other types of recipients: state institutions, local education agencies, universities, libraries, or some other entity or organization. We distributed the difference between appropriated funds and reported funds among these categories based on reported allocations and data from the GAO on the percentage of federal funds retained by states in order to distribute them as accurately as possible.<sup>25</sup>
<P>
<DD>
For this analysis, we combined recipient categories in order to minimize allocation discrepancies. The categories we used for analysis were: state agencies, local school districts, and "other."
<P>
<DD>
We also adjusted budget data so that they reflected only the funds going to the 50 states, excluding the territories and Puerto Rico.

<P>
<B>Why 15 cents per tax dollar is a conservative estimate:</B>
<P>
<DD>
Most states do not allocate these funds within one year, and thus there is a certain amount of what is known as "carryover."  In reality, local school districts actually receive less than our calculation of 85 cents per tax dollar during a calendar year. According to ED calculations based on state-reported data (not appropriations), for every dollar sent to the states for local school districts, less than 85 cents makes it to school districts. Combined with the 5 cents spent at the federal level, this amounts to only about 80 cents returning to school districts. 
<P>
<B>Data Limitations </B>
<P>
<DD>
Education data used in this model are based on state-reported data, with some improvements and corrections made by the ED's National Center for Education Statistics. As previously mentioned, many states reported only low percentages of total funds appropriated; thus, the data required adjustment to be comparable. There also are inherent limitations on data of a "self-reported" nature.
<P>
<DD>
Data used in this analysis represent more than 94 percent ($13.2 billion) of the ED's $14 billion FY 1993 elementary and secondary education budget. Certain smaller programs were left out because of inadequate or non-existent state-level and sub-allocation data. In addition, although the ED collects data on the Foreign Language Assistance Centers program, it was excluded from this analysis because the percentage reported by the states of total funds appropriated was less than 70 percent, with some states reporting less than 5 percent. Our conclusion that 15 cents per tax dollar allocated to ED elementary and secondary programs amounts to $2 billion is reflective only of the budget included in our analysis. Consequently, it is possible that the figure understates the total amount by about 6 percent.
<P>
<DD>
Using budget and ED data, we are able to determine where most of the money was spent, but gaps remain to the extent that it is not possible to itemize each expenditure at the federal and state level that figures in to the 15 cents per tax dollar spent at the state and departmental level.

<LI>      The submission of such applications requires the use of state and local revenue, with no guarantee of what they will receive based on federal/state funding formulas or grant awards. Many federal forms for optional programs require special expertise to complete properly, discouraging smaller and poorer school districts from applying unless they can afford to hire a trained grant-writer. A study completed a few years ago by the state of Ohio found 170 forms totaling over 700 pages that could be attributed to participation in federal programs, with over 40 percent of them classified as "mandatory" or "virtually mandatory." Over one-half of the forms identified in their study of public-school reporting requirements were attributable to federal programs, although when the study was conducted Ohio was receiving only 5 percent of its education revenues from the federal government.

<H3>A Strange New Regime: 
The Naked Public Square and the Passing of the American Constitutional Order</H3>

By Richard John Neuhaus<br>
A Salvatori Lecture at The Heritage Foundation<br>
Delivered October 8, 1996
<P>
<DD>
The phrase "one nation under God" was only added to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954. Observers have frequently noted that it appeared at an unseemly time and for dubious reasons -- during the allegedly paranoid national hysteria called McCarthyism. There is an element of truth in that way of telling the story. But I expect there is a much greater significance to the phrase "one nation under God."  Politics is in largest part a function of culture, and at the heart of culture is morality, and at the heart of morality is religion. The word "culture," we need always to be reminded, is derived from <I>cultus</I>. Whether in Athens of 5th century B.C. or in Rome of 2nd century A.D. or in the United States of America at the end of the 20th century, culture is most importantly the reflection of what we most venerate; it is the expression of the commanding truths of the time, the truths by which we are obliged, the truths that hold us together -- as in "religion," from the Latin <I>religere</I>, which means to fasten or bind.
<P>
<DD>
That Congress thought it necessary in 1954 to formally declare that this is "one nation under God" reflected not simply a fear of communism, but a deeper anxiety about the culture, about who we are as a people. Supposedly, the 1950s of the Eisenhower era was a time of quiescence, even complacency, in American life. There was an enormous "religion boom," measured by almost every index of belief and behavior, that climaxed in 1959. Intellectuals of the time assured us that it was a period marked by the "end of ideology," when all the really big questions about how we ought to order our life together had been resolved. Yet I expect that such smooth and frequently smug assurances were attended by a deeper anxiety. I expect that many, if not most, who voted to declare that this is "one nation under God" did so because they sensed that it could no longer be taken for granted that this is one nation under God. The 1960s and what followed vindicated such anxiety in spades.
<P>
<DD>
For some, the phrase "one nation under God" means that America is somehow God's elect nation, a chosen people exempt from the corruptions and tragedies that mark the histories of other peoples. I take it to mean, first of all, that we understand ourselves to be a nation under judgment. That is the meaning consonant with the numerous statements of the Founders who explained what they meant by this <I>novus ordo seclorum</I> -- this new order of the ages -- as it is called on the Great Seal of the United States of America. Thus Jefferson, "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just."
<P>
<DD>
1954 was already far removed from the constituting truths of the founding era. And how far we have now come from 1954. I hold no brief for the idea of a "Christian amendment" to the Constitution, an idea that some have agitated for decades. Such an amendment is unnecessary and mischievously provocative. More important, no nation, and certainly not this nation, is worthy of calling itself Christian. But I do believe, with the Founders, that this experiment in a free and virtuous society cannot be sustained apart from the commanding truths of the culture that gave it birth. How far we have come from the founding, and even from 1954, is made evident in innumerable ways. Not least, it is evident in the fact that those who appeal to the founding vision are today widely condemned as religious fanatics, as aliens and sectarians who would "impose their values on a pluralistic society."
<P>
<DD>
I could easily take up several hours in citing the copious statements that reflect the founding vision of this republican experiment in democratic governance. But simply to jog our memories, permit me to allude to a few. John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court: "Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers."  John Adams, the first Vice President and second President: "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."  And as recently as 1952, Justice William O. Douglas (of all people!): "We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."
<P>
<DD>
In 1954, the year in which the Pledge of Allegiance was amended, Chief Justice Earl Warren had this to say: "I believe no one can read the history of our country without realizing that the Good Book and the spirit of the Savior have from the beginning been our guiding geniuses....  Whether we look to the first Charter of Virginia or to the Charter of New England or the Charter of Massachusetts Bay or to the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the same objective is present... a Christian land governed by Christian principles. I believe the entire Bill of Rights came into being because of the knowledge our forefathers had of the Bible and their belief in it: freedom of belief, of expression, of assembly, of petition, the dignity of the individual, the sanctity of the home, equal justice under law, and the reservation of powers to the people. I like to believe we are living today in the spirit of the Christian religion. I like also to believe that as long as we do so, no great harm can come to our country."
<P>
<DD>
That was 1954. This is now. You may recall that in April of this year, Justice Antonin Scalia spoke of his Christian faith at a law school in Mississippi. Unlike Warren, Scalia did not set forth religious and moral truths that he claimed are normative for the country. Rather, he gave a personal testimony and discussed the difficulties in being a Christian in thoroughly secularized sectors of our elite culture. This was news; this was scandal; and pundits weighed in with alarmed commentary on Scalia's alleged challenge to the separation of church and state. Not only is it no longer permissible to suggest that Christianity is socially normative, as Earl Warren did; it is now no longer permissible for a justice of the Supreme Court to declare in public his personal allegiance to the Christian faith. Scalia described Christians as "fools for Christ," and some commentators, magnificently ignorant of the origins of the phrase, opined that Scalia was admitting his mental incompetence to sit on the Court.
<P>
<DD>
I do not wish to make too much of this one incident. Not because it is unimportant, but because it is only one out of so many incidents reflecting a pattern that I analyzed 12 years ago as "The Naked Public Square" -- public life stripped of all reference to religion and religiously grounded morality. The forthcoming issue of <I>First Things</I> carries a symposium that is titled "The End of Democracy?"  With equal merit, it might have been entitled "The End of Politics?"  The best short definition of politics is given us by Aristotle. Politics, he said, is free people deliberating the question, How ought we to order our life together?  The "ought" in that definition indicates that politics is essentially a moral enterprise. Not, of course, that all politicians are moral, but the enterprise itself is moral in nature.
<P>
<DD>
It is frequently said that you cannot legislate morality. In fact, you cannot legislate anything but morality. Any question of political moment has to do with questions such as justice, equality, fairness, and the common good. All of these are inescapably moral categories. However confused may be their understanding of the connections between morality and religion, for the overwhelming majority of Americans, morality is derived from religion. To interpret the separation of church and state as the separation of religion from public life is, quite simply, a formula for the end of politics. This is why Tocqueville could call religion "the first political institution" of American democracy. His point was that it is from religion, and within the context of religious associations, that most Americans learn the virtues and habits that they bring to the deliberation of the question, How ought we to order our life together?
<P>
<DD>
This is called self-governance, which for the Founders was the key metaphor for understanding our form of government. The late Christopher Lasch wrote incisively in <I>The Revolt of the Elites</I> that in the last half-century, the meaning of "democracy" has changed from self-government to upward mobility. It is now commonly claimed, Lasch observed, that the proof that we are a democratic and open society is that people have the opportunity to move out of the governed masses into the governing elite. The end of politics is accompanied by the rule of judges, regulatory agencies, and other institutions that are least accountable to We the People. To complain about this is not simply a populist twitch. Rather, it is to point out -- soberly, cautiously, and in full awareness of the implications -- that we may no longer be living under the constitutional order that the Founders established, that all of us learned about in our civics textbooks, and that public officials are solemnly sworn to uphold.
<P>
<DD>
Many factors have contributed to the displacement of the former constitutional order and the establishment of the present regime. I realize that, except for the Straussians among us, there is resistance to the term "regime."  Regimes, Americans like to think, are what other countries have. By the term "regime," however, I mean simply the actual, existing system of government, as distinct from the system of government prescribed by the Constitution of the United States. No factor has contributed so powerfully to the new regime as the separation of culture -- meaning <I>cultus</I> -- from the making of law, especially from the making of law by the courts.
<P>
<DD>
Consider, for example, the recent <I>Romer</I> decision in which the Supreme Court overruled the people of Colorado in their democratically approved amendment against special protections for people who define themselves by their homosexual behavior. I ask you to set aside for the moment any views you may have about homosexuality or what laws, if any, there should be about homosexuality. Rather, I would direct your attention to the logic of the majority decision written by Justice Kennedy. According to the Court, the Colorado amendment served no legitimate public purpose and is "inexplicable" apart from an irrational "animus" against homosexuals. Consider what is being said here. The highest court of the land is declaring that five millennia of moral teaching about the right ordering of human sexuality for the personal and communal good has no place in our law. The teaching of Athens, Jerusalem, and 2,000 years of Christian tradition is cavalierly dismissed as irrational animus. The people of Colorado do not believe that; nor, I am confident, do the people of any other state of the Union. But the Supreme Court declares it to be the law of the land. Little wonder that the Court has in recent years worried out loud about the moral legitimacy of the law that it is making.
<P>
<DD>
We are incessantly told that it is impossible to return to the days of the Founders. The Constitution, it is said, is a "living document" responding to the ever-changing needs of a rapidly changing society, and so forth and so on. I believe it is not too much to say that those who talk about a "living Constitution" are in fact saying that the Constitution is dead. For them, it is an infinitely pliable text that, in the words of contemporary literary criticism, has no authorial voice, but only the voice that we attribute to it. We should not want to deny that there have been important changes since the founding period. Of course much has changed in America, and much has changed also for the better. One has only to mention slavery, the thought of which occasioned Jefferson's trembling before the justice of God.
<P>
<DD>
But the changes for the better have always been in obedience to, not in rebellion against, the constituting truths of the American experiment. The most dramatic example in our time is the civil rights movement as it was given magisterial expression by Martin Luther King, Jr. His justly celebrated "I Have a Dream" speech of August 28, 1963, resonates with the constituting and commanding truths, calling for the fulfillment of a promise long delayed. Those who today fear the assertion of moral truth in public argue that ours is an increasingly pluralistic society in which there is no moral truth, but only claims to moral truth in conflict. Such critics typically and greatly exaggerate the change in American society. The survey research of the last 70 years suggests that the American people are at least as committed -- possibly more committed -- to what is broadly construed as the Judeo-Christian moral tradition as they were when Tocqueville described religion as the first political institution of American democracy.

<P>
<DD>
Even were the social changes as dramatic as some suggest, that is all the more reason to reaffirm the constituting truths. Jefferson understood this. Jefferson asked in 1781, "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?"  His answer -- and, in similar and frequently identical words, the answer of the other Founders -- was emphatically in the negative. This is an argument that is not being made effectively today. It is precisely as a society becomes more pluralistic, as there are more claims to rights in conflict, that we must appeal to truth that transcends such conflicts.
<P>
<DD>
Why should the majority respect the liberties of troublesome or disagreeable minorities?  The only sustainable answer is that the majority believes that those in the minority possess, in the words of Jefferson, "liberties [that] are of the gift of God."  Remove that transcendent warrant, and all politics is reduced to Nietzsche's "will to power."  Minorities that many Americans find disagreeable are today, I believe, making a fatal mistake. Repudiating the transcendent and commanding truths of our cultural story line, they seek power and protection in a judiciary that has joined in the same act of repudiation. Thus do they stand behind the robes of judges, defying the people who are, in democratic theory and practice, the repository of political sovereignty.
<P>
<DD>
Such minorities seeking rights refuse to join in the democratic deliberation of the question, How ought we to order our life together?  Abandoning the great political task of persuasion, they resort to judicial fiat. What they cannot get from the people and their representatives they believe they can get from the courts. And who can deny that they have had astonishing success with that strategy?  But it is, I believe, a perilously shortsighted strategy. It can lead only to the definitive end of democracy or to a majoritarian reaction that may also be profoundly anti-democratic. In either case, they lose. This is why I have argued that the naked public square is a very dangerous place, especially for minorities. Where there is in the public square no transcendent aspiration to the good, there is no transcendent barrier against the inclination to evil. And so Jefferson's question: "Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?"  The answer, I am convinced, is "No."
<P>
<DD>
There is a new pluralism in American life, and it is a moral pluralism. It is not because the American people are less attached to what is called the Judeo-Christian moral tradition. It is, rather, a pluralism created by the rise of a new class -- call it the knowledge class, if you will -- that has entrenched itself in the institutions least accountable to the people, and especially in the judiciary. This is the phenomenon that gives form to what are called "the culture wars."  When I first began to write about the culture war many years ago, critics thought the term excessive, especially when I referred to the <I>Kulturkampf</I>, an analogy to Bismarck's campaign of the 1870s to eradicate the influence of religion in German public life. I believe the analogy is apt. What has happened in subsequent years has, in my judgment, only provided added confirmation of the culture war analysis.
<P>
<DD>
Let me say what I mean by culture war. We are two nations: one concentrated on rights and laws, the other on rights and wrongs; one radically individualistic and dedicated to the actualized self, the other communal and invoking the common good; one viewing law as the instrument of the will to power and license, the other affirming an objective moral order reflected in a Constitution to which we are obliged; one given to private satisfaction, the other to familial responsibility; one typically secular, the other typically religious; one elitist, the other populist.
<P>
<DD>
These strokes are admittedly broad, but the reality is evident enough to anyone who attends to the increasingly ugly rancor that dominates and debases our public life. And, of course, for many Americans, the conflicts in the culture wars run through their own hearts. The conflicts also run through our institutions, including the courts. But I believe it is accurate to say that, in a long series of decisions, the Supreme Court -- and therefore, in due course, the entire federal and state judiciary -- has tended to put the law on one side of the culture war.
<P>
<DD>
How I wish -- and perhaps you wish as well!  -- that we could continue this analysis without reference to abortion. Is there no end to this rancorous debate?  The answer is that there is no end in sight. The abortion debate is about ever so much more than abortion. It is about the nature of human life and community. It is about who belongs to the "we" in the question, How ought <I>we</I> to order our life together?  It is about whether rights are the product of human assertion or the gift of "Nature and Nature's God."  It is about doctor-assisted suicide, euthanasia, eugenic engineering, and the protection of the radically handicapped. But the abortion debate is most inescapably about abortion. It is most crucially in that debate that the Supreme Court has gambled its authority, and with it our constitutional order, by coming down on one side in the culture war.
<P>
<DD>
This is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992 decision <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>, which, of course, is in continuity with the turn taken by <I>Roe</I> and <I>Doe</I> in 1973. The logic, or illogic, is of a piece with <I>Romer</I>, and the Ninth and Second Circuits were justified this year when they appealed to the abortion decisions in claiming that doctor-assisted suicide is a constitutional right. In <I>Casey</I>, the Court most clearly declared its belligerency on one side of the culture war. The decision endorses the radically individualistic concept of the self-constituted self. In what some critics have called "the mystery passage," the Court waxes metaphysical in its assertion that the abortion liberty is necessary in order "to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."  "Beliefs about these matters," says the Court, "could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State."  Not only does authentic personhood require freedom from the state, but it also requires freedom from other potentially encumbering communities. It requires freedom from spouses, for example. The Court therefore struck down the requirement that fathers be notified before mothers get an abortion. That, it is said, would be an "undue burden."  If abortion is a constitutional right, one might ask, how can it be permissibly burdened at all?  But, of course, it was only declared a constitutional right on January 22, 1973. Before that, it was not only burdened; it was, for the most part, prohibited.
<P>
<DD>
Marriage, the Court declares, is only an "association" of individuals entered into for the fulfillment of personal needs. The notion of the unburdened, unencumbered, autonomous self drives the entirety of the Court's reasoning. In <I>Casey</I> and other decisions, liberty is not the "ordered liberty" of the Founders; nor is it liberty directed to the good and formed by communities of memory and obligation. Rather, liberty is, without remainder, the liberty of self-will, self-expression, and indeed self-constitution. For the Court, as for many Americans, that pitiably reduced concept of liberty "trumps" every other consideration. Which is why the slogans of "choice" serve the pro-abortionists so well.
<P>
<DD>
In the otherwise unfortunate decision, <I>Lee v. Weisman</I>, handed down only a few days before Casey, the Court wisely cautions against the establishment of a state-sponsored "civic religion."  The same justices seem to be blithely unaware, however, that in Casey and other rulings, they are in fact asserting and endorsing a philosophy of at least quasi-religious status. Addressing the "concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life" crosses into those ultimate concerns by which religion is ordinarily defined. As I have argued elsewhere, the naked public square cannot remain naked. Politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. Something is not simply eliminated; it is displaced by something else. Against alternative understandings of the self in relation to community, normative truth, and even revelation, the Court recognizes no other reality than the isolated individual defining his or her reality.
<P>
<DD>
Thus does the Court reinforce the Hobbesian idea that we are a society of strangers, perhaps of enemies, and it is the chief business of the state to prevent others from interfering with or obliging the Sovereign Self. The result is the atomistic and potentially totalitarian doctrine that society is composed of only two actors, the state and the solitary individual. This is a "civic" religion in the sense of being sponsored by the state, but it is hardly civic in character and consequence. It is in fact the undoing of the <I>civitas</I>, of the "civil society" of myriad persons, associations, and communities of moral tradition interacting within the bond of civility and mutual respect. The description of the self, of community, and of ultimate meaning that is espoused by the Court is incompatible with Christian and Jewish teaching and, I am confident, with the belief and experience of most Americans. It is, in effect although not in name, another religion. It is in fact the Supreme Court's definition of the "concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."  It is, according to the Court, the national creed established by the Constitution.
<P>
<DD>
I and others have been criticized for raising the question of the moral legitimacy of the existing regime and whether it can any longer command the obedience of conscientious citizens. We did not raise the question. The majority in <I>Casey</I> raised the question of the legitimacy of its authority. The justices of the Court say that they are putting the authority of law itself on the line, and call upon the American people to follow their lead. "Where in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in <I>Roe</I>... its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution."
<P>
<DD>
That is a truly astonishing assertion, as though We the People have no higher allegiance than our allegiance to the Supreme Court. The Court goes further. It says that citizens will be "tested by following" its decision. Suddenly, it is not the Court but the American people who have been put on trial. We as a people have been here before, and the precedent is not a happy one. Abraham Lincoln had the notorious <I>Dred Scott</I> decision in mind when he said in his First Inaugural Address: "The candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal."
<P>
<DD>
As Lincoln contended in his time, a decision of the Supreme Court is not, by virtue of being a decision of the Supreme Court, "the law of the land."  <I>Casey</I>, like <I>Dred Scott</I>, is not the law of the land. It is one wrong decision affirming earlier wrong decisions. So long as it and related decisions stand, they must guide the decisions of other courts, and those in government office must be mindful of that. But the Constitution is the law of the land; contrary to so-called judicial realists, the Constitution is not just whatever the Supreme Court says it is. In this land, in this constitutional order, the people, through their representatives, make the law of the land. Or so it was thought.
<P>
<DD>
Before and after he became President, Lincoln strove earnestly for the overturn of <I>Dred Scott</I>. He failed, and war came. It is almost impossible to imagine that there could be a civil war like the last one. But the destructive effects of anomie and anger are already evident as a result of law divorced from constitutional text, moral argument, and democratic accountability. The ever-fragile bonds of civility are unraveled as politics becomes, to paraphrase Clausewitz, war pursued by other means. Lawless law is an invitation to lawlessness. Four justices dissented in <I>Casey</I>. Justice Scalia wrote in dissent, "Against the Court are the twin facts that the American people love democracy and the American people are not fools."  We must hope he is right; that the people will not forever -- they will not for long -- be denied democracy and treated like fools.
<P>
<DD>
William Lloyd Garrison and his fellow abolitionists publicly burned the Constitution, calling it "a covenant with death and an agreement with hell."  The Court today worries about the angry disillusionment of millions of Americans who have been denied their right to make the case in the political arena for protective abortion law, and for so much else. The justices are right to worry about the moral delegitimation of the Court and the undermining of the rule of law. The course that the majority has chosen is the surest way to the result that they fear.
<P>
<DD>
We do not know what all Congress had in mind back then. No doubt, as is the way with politics, motives were mixed, and some representatives did not know themselves what, if anything, they had in mind. But I would like to think that they were guided, even providentially guided, when they added to the Pledge of Allegiance "one nation under God."  Perhaps they sensed that the implicit assumptions no longer held. It had to be said. Forty-two years later, it is too early to say that their effort, and the experiment they sought to protect, has failed. Or maybe not. Maybe Americans have become so supine, so accustomed to being denied democracy and treated like fools, that they no longer notice or no longer care that they are ruled by government without the consent of the governed. We are in honor bound to hope that is not the case.

<center><h2>MARIJUANA-FIGHTING TEAM LACKS<br>
PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In response to California and Arizona
drug legalization propositions, a Clinton Administration team
presented Monday its campaign against further drug legalization.
&quot;The only problem was that the team was missing its quarterback.
President Clinton needs to personally tackle this national crisis,&quot;
Family Research Council Senior Policy Analyst Lt. Col. Robert
Maginnis said.

<p>

The success of the referenda, which were funded in part by billionaire
legalization entrepreneur George Soros, gives new life to the
national movement towards drug legalization.

<p>

Even before the ballot initiatives passed, marijuana use had been
on the rise for five years.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse's
recent Monitoring the Future Survey shows one in five 10th graders
used marijuana within the past month.

<p>

&quot;Use is up because the pop culture is pro-marijuana,&quot;
Maginnis said, &quot;and using marijuana is lightly portrayed
or treated as inconsequential behavior.  The recent propositions
will further weaken adolescent risk perception.

<p>

&quot;The consequences of not treating this as a crisis are severe.
Medical costs will increase as adolescent use continues to skyrocket,
the number of marijuana-related automobile accidents will rise,
law enforcement problems will abound, and both business and foreign
policy concerns will be complicated.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said that pot legalization is more widespread than the
California and Arizona propositions, yet the Administration's
plan does not address other pro-marijuana laws.  At one time,
34 states had passed &quot;some endorsement of a medical use of
marijuana.&quot;  Some of these laws are still on the books and
have been re-energized by the recent referenda successes.  Virginia,
for example, has a criminal law that permits crude marijuana use
solely based on the recommendation of a physician from any state.

<p>

&quot;This is a national problem that requires the president's
personal attention,&quot; Maginnis said.  &quot;President Clinton
has already said: 'We cannot walk away from the fight against
drugs...we have to walk right into it.'  Mr. President, you must
now 'walk right into' this battle.  Don't send your subordinates
out to do what only you can do.  Pro-pot forces will stop at nothing
to advance their cause -- they already have a big foot in the
door.  Don't turn your back on our children.&quot;

<P>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
<dd>On July 1, 1997, Britain will cede sovereignty over the territory of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. This transfer of sovereignty is the result of negotiations between Britain and China during the 1980s, and is an outcome the United States cannot change. The United States, however, does have substantial interests at stake in Hong Kong -- interests that will endure long after the transfer of sovereignty next July. The foremost concern of the United States during the transition from British to Chinese sovereignty is the security of the more than 35,000 U.S. citizens and 1,000 U.S. firms that reside in Hong Kong. Beyond this most fundamental national interest, the United States has an interest in maintaining close cooperation with Hong Kong authorities in fighting such international security threats as drug trafficking, money laundering, illegal immigration, and the proliferation of weapons and sensitive technologies.
<p>
<dd>
The Hong Kong transition will have a tremendous impact on the long-held interests of the United States in regional peace and stability as well as market access. Because much of U.S. trade and investment in China flows through Hong Kong, a continued free, open, and safe business environment in Hong Kong is vitally important to U.S. access to China's markets. More important, the approach Beijing takes in dealing with free market democracy in Hong Kong will be a key indicator of how Beijing intends to deal with Taiwan and other free market democracies in Asia. Encroachment on the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong, or an assertive Chinese military presence there, will fuel cross-strait tensions with Taiwan and heighten already growing security concerns throughout Asia.
<p>
<dd>The legal basis for the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong is the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong signed on December 19, 1984.<sup>1</sup> The Joint Declaration is a bilateral treaty registered with the United Nations, and its principles were incorporated into Chinese law as the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China -- sometimes called Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. The Basic Law was passed by the National People's Congress on April 4, 1990.<sup>2</sup> China's collective promises to Hong Kong in the Joint Declaration and Basic Law can be summed up in one phrase: Hong Kong people will govern Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. Beijing will take on the responsibilities of defense and foreign affairs for Hong Kong, but all other legal, social, and economic issues will be left to the discretion of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.
<p>
<dd>The United States recognized the Joint Declaration as a legitimate international treaty in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. The Hong Kong Policy Act declares U.S. support for developing democracy in Hong Kong, protecting human rights, and maintaining Hong Kong's confidence and prosperity as it fulfills its role as an international financial center. The Act also requires the Secretary of State to transmit annual reports to Congress on developments related to the transfer of sovereignty as they relate to U.S. interests in Hong Kong. This annual report must address such topics as the openness and fairness of elections for the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive, the independence of the judiciary, and the status of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights. But because the United States is not a party to this treaty, the U.S. government does not offer any legal interpretation of British or Chinese obligations under this international agreement.
<p>
<dd>As July 1 draws nearer, key questions remain about Beijing's willingness or ability to keep its word with regard to Hong Kong's level of autonomy and the preservation of its economic, cultural, and social way of life. Questions also remain about what, if anything, the United States can do to ensure that the commitments made in the Joint Declaration are fulfilled. Beijing plans temporarily to replace Hong Kong's democratically elected Legislative Council with an appointed provisional legislature and has left unclear what role pro-democracy parties will play in Hong Kong's post-1997 government. Similarly, it remains unclear to what extent Beijing intends to micromanage Hong Kong, as opposed to simply handling its defense and foreign affairs.
<p>
<dd>To protect U.S. interests and to help preserve the freedom, stability, and prosperity of Hong Kong, the United States should:
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Beware of the impact U.S. policy toward China has on Hong Kong.</b> Politically generated trade friction between the United States and China, such as is created by threats to revoke China's most favored nation trading status, puts U.S. interests in Hong Kong in jeopardy and destabilizes Hong Kong.
 <p>
 <li><b>Articulate U.S. interests in Hong Kong to leaders in China.</b> A clear understanding of how the United States intends to protect the security of the 35,000 U.S. citizens and 1,000 U.S. firms in Hong Kong, as well as its multibillion-dollar investment and trade interests, will help China's leaders avoid miscalculation when responding to U.S. actions in Hong Kong.
 <p>
 <li><b>Maintain a strong U.S. presence in Hong Kong.</b> U.S. officials, businessmen, students, and tourists are a vital source of information, and their presence demonstrates to the people of Hong Kong that the United States is observing the transition process carefully.
 <p>
 <li><b>Strongly urge Beijing to allow the current democratically elected Legislative Council to serve out its term.</b> If Beijing insists on replacing the current legislature, the United States should urge Beijing to shorten the term of the provisional legislature by preparing now for elections to take place as soon after July 1 as possible.
 <p>
 <li><b>Support Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations.</b> As the world's freest economy, Hong Kong should play a key role in international organizations in leading the world toward a more free and open trading system.
 <p>
 <li><b>Urge Beijing to sign international human rights covenants.</b> Such a move by China would assuage the fears that led Hong Kong's residents to demand a Bill of Rights Ordinance in the first place.
 <p>
 <li><b>Closely cooperate with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, alien smuggling, and commercial piracy.</b> For this cooperation to work, it is important that the United States not allow differences with Beijing to alienate or put at risk the new SAR government.
</ul>
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COLONIAL HISTORY: FROM A BARREN ROCK TO THE PEARL OF THE ORIENT</b>
<p>
<dd>
In 1841, after learning that Hong Kong island would be ceded to Britain, Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston described Hong Kong as "a barren island with hardly a house upon it." After more than a century and a half of colonial management, Hong Kong touts a standard of living that surpasses Britain's and is described by many as the "Pearl of the Orient" or the "Crown Jewel" of the British empire. Britain established a system of common law to protect property and civil rights in Hong Kong. This sound legal system, its large deep-sea ports, and its proximity to Canton (Guangzhou), made Hong Kong an ideal gateway into the China market.
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong unexpectedly became a gateway for Chinese immigrants as well, despite its tough legal restrictions on immigration. Few thought that the Chinese would cross over and live under a foreign flag, but millions have thrived under liberal British rule. They traditionally asked little of the colonial government, other than to be left alone. Large flows of immigrants coincided with traumatic events on the mainland -- the collapse of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty early in this century, the Chinese civil war during the 1940s, and the Great Proletariat Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.
<p>
<dd>Hong Kong's legal system, port facilities, proximity, <I>laissez faire</I> government, and abundant supply of immigrant labor are the key ingredients in what has become one of the greatest economic miracles of the modern age. During the 1950s and 1960s, the United Nations embargo on trade with China forced Hong Kong to turn inward and develop a light industrial manufacturing base. After China began to reopen for trade in the 1970s and 1980s, Hong Kong resumed its role as entrepot for global trade with China. Because of their familiarity with the language, government, and business practices in both cultures, Hong Kong's people have been excellent go-betweens for China and the predominantly Western trading world. Hong Kong's <I>laissez faire</I> business environment of limited government, low taxes, and free capital flows is still tremendously successful at attracting foreign resources to match up with trade and investment opportunities in China. Indeed, Hong Kong has the freest economy in the world, according to the 1997 Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal <a href="/heritage/index"><i>Index of Economic Freedom</i></a>. In this way, a barren rock with virtually no natural resources transformed itself into one of the most advanced, prosperous, and free trading economies in the world.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<dd>For China, however, Hong Kong's colonial success has not necessarily been a source of pride. The Treaty of Nanjing, which ceded Hong Kong to Britain at the end of the first Sino-British war in 1842, was viewed by the Chinese as the first in a series of "unequal treaties" imposed on China by imperialist foreign powers and marked the beginning of what the Chinese call a "century of national humiliation."
<p>
<dd>
During this time of national weakness from the 1840s through the 1940s, Germany, France, Russia, Britain, and Japan carved out safe havens, or spheres of influence, in key cities along China's coastline. Internal rebellion and foreign encroachment led to the fall of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty, and China disintegrated into a period of regional warlordism during the 1920s. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the Nationalists and the Communists engaged in a long and costly struggle for legitimacy over a reunified China, interrupted temporarily by the Japanese occupation of much of China (including Hong Kong) during World War II.
<p>
<dd>Thus, when the Communists took control in 1949, China was a poor and backward nation ravaged by famine and war. The Communists succeeded in unifying all of China, save Taiwan and Hong Kong, under one central government. Because of this history, the Chinese assign symbolic importance to Hong Kong as the first national wound suffered during this long period of setbacks. From Beijing's point of view, the "Pearl of the Orient" should be returned to China to continue the process of national reunification.
<p>
<b>CHINA'S FORMULA FOR NATIONAL REUNIFICATION: "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"</b>
<p>
<dd>
A shift in Chinese policy from open hostility toward capitalism in the 1950s and 1960s to a more peaceful accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s was made possible by two significant developments: (1) Deng Xiaoping's modernization plan, and (2) Western diplomatic normalization. The normalization of diplomatic relations with the West, especially with the United States and Japan in the early 1970s, eased China's security concerns and opened the way for the development of foreign trade and investment. Deng saw the Western system of trade and investment as a means to modernize China and raise the living standards of the Chinese people. The Chinese territories of Taiwan and Hong Kong, because of their connections and success within the Western capitalist system, would make ideal intermediaries between socialist China and the capitalist West. Similarly, modernization and economic reform in China, according to Deng, would make peaceful rapprochement and eventual reunification with Taiwan and Hong Kong easier.
<p>
<dd>The concept of "one country, two systems" gradually evolved into a means for China's national reunification in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The concept, attributed to Deng, was that separate and autonomous socioeconomic systems could co-exist within a single, sovereign nation. In Deng's view, a socialist mainland and a capitalist Taiwan could co-exist peacefully within one China. At the time, Taiwan was the primary target of this peaceful reunification strategy. During the 1970s, the United States and other major world powers shifted diplomatic recognition away from the Republic of China on Taiwan to the People's Republic of China on the mainland.<sup>4</sup> Because of China's strategic importance, diplomatic clout, and economic potential, many analysts, especially on the mainland, considered reunification with Taiwan to be inevitable and near.
<p>
<dd>By 1982, however, the near-term prospects for reunification with Taiwan dimmed as China and the United States clashed over the issue of continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau began to arise in Chinese public commentary on the "one country, two systems" model. In February 1982, Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang said, "Besides the implementation of the open-door economic policy, we will, in the near future, adopt another method -- the method of allowing the existence of two kinds of <i>social</i> systems in one country -- to solve the problems of the reunification with Taiwan and the recovery of our sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<dd>
That same year, land owners and investors in Hong Kong became increasingly concerned that legal rights granted under agreements signed prior to the July 1, 1997, expiration of the New Territories lease would remain in force for their full term. Business interests in Hong Kong intensified pressure on the British government to secure written guarantees for property rights in the New Territories after 1997. Fifteen years is a typical term for a mortgage or lease of land. Thus, by 1982, both Britain and China felt compelled to resolve the post-1997 status of the New Territories and Hong Kong.
<p>
<dd>When negotiations with Britain over the future of Hong Kong began in late 1982, China already had formulated its strategy for returning Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty. The Sino-British Joint Declaration that emerged in 1984 represents a more concrete articulation of the policy with which the Chinese entered into the negotiations. It commits China to allow Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy, except in the areas of defense and foreign affairs. It also obliges China to allow Hong Kong's separate social and economic systems to remain unchanged for at least 50 years, and to preserve the current rights and freedoms of individuals. The tenets of the Joint Declaration were later incorporated into Chinese law in the 1990 Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. From this point forward, Hong Kong, instead of Taiwan, was destined to become the first test case for Deng's "one country, two systems" theory.
<p>
<dd><b>Tiananmen Disrupts the Transition.</b> Throughout the 1980s, Deng's reforms achieved remarkable results. The pace and direction of change in China was viewed very favorably in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. There was a reasonably high degree of confidence in the viability of the Joint Declaration and the prospects for a smooth transition in Hong Kong. There were also high hopes for improvement in cross-strait relations with Taiwan. Many outside observers believed that political reform naturally would follow such rapid and impressive economic liberalization.
<p>
<dd>The Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, however, destroyed that optimism and planted seeds of skepticism and distrust between Beijing and its counterparts in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. The student-led demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square during May and June 1989, and their brutal suppression on June 4, profoundly changed the way Hong Kong and Beijing viewed one another. During the demonstrations, supporters from Hong Kong sent food and supplies to the students on the square. Some Hong Kong democracy activists even traveled to Beijing to be with the students. The day after China's military crushed the student uprising, more than 1 million residents filled Hong Kong streets in protest of Beijing's excessive authoritarianism.
<p>
<dd>The governments in Beijing and Hong Kong each enacted legislation to address the fears provoked by the Tiananmen incident. For example, in 1990 Beijing amended the Basic Law to keep Hong Kong activists out of China's politics. Article 23 was intended to protect China's political system from any future interference by forces within Hong Kong or from the outside. The article states, "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies." Article 23 has raised serious concerns in Hong Kong about how Beijing would interpret the article and what impact it will have on civil rights in the soon-to-be Special Administrative Region.
<p>
<dd><b>Hong Kong's Bill of Rights Ordinance.</b> Hong Kong authorities had their own reaction to the massacre. Tiananmen Square provided the impetus to institutionalize Hong Kong's body of human rights law in a comprehensive statute that would establish unambiguously the primacy of basic human rights guarantees.<sup>6</sup> This statute became the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, enacted in June 1991. The Bill of Rights Ordinance codified the protections elaborated in the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights into Hong Kong law.<sup>7</sup> This ordinance appears to be consistent with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law and should not have drawn any objection from Beijing.
<p>
<dd>
Beijing objects to the Bill of Rights Ordinance. The Bill of Rights calls for the repeal of all laws that contravene it or are inconsistent with it. China, however, has declared that the Basic Law will be the supreme law of Hong Kong. Beijing therefore posits that the Bill of Rights Ordinance raises questions as to which law -- the Basic Law or the Bill of Right Ordinance -- has primacy. Moreover, Beijing also claims that the human rights protections contained in the Basic Law are adequate, so the Bill of Rights Ordinance is, therefore, unnecessary. On these two grounds, a Beijing-appointed group has proposed a selective repeal of portions of the Bill of Rights Ordinance.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<dd>Beijing also has rejected the report's obligations of the international covenants. The covenants require the sovereign of Hong Kong to submit reports to the United Nations on the implementation of the covenants in the territory. Although China has promised that the provisions of the international human rights covenants as currently applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force after 1997, it still has refused to submit reports on Hong Kong on the grounds that Beijing itself is not a signatory to the covenants.
<p>
<dd>Beijing's refusal to abide by the reporting obligations of the international covenants on human rights, together with the proposal of a selective repeal of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, have raised serious concerns in Hong Kong and abroad. Indeed the question arises as to why Beijing would choose to press this issue at all. Even if the Bill of Rights is superfluous in light of the promises made in the Basic Law, if it grants the residents of Hong Kong an added degree of confidence or peace of mind, why not leave it alone?
<p>
<dd><b>Legislative Council Elections in Hong Kong.</b> Accelerating the development of democracy was the second step Hong Kong took to protect its people from Tiananmen-style oppression. This was done by opening all seats on the Hong Kong Legislative Council to elections. Prior to 1991, all seats in the Legislative Council were appointed or elected indirectly. Unfortunately, democratic reform was late in coming to Hong Kong. Indirect election to the Legislative Council was partially introduced as late as 1985, and by the late 1980s, domestic demand for direct elections was on the rise. In the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre, Governor Chris Patten was sent to Hong Kong with a mandate, from London as well as from within Hong Kong, to accelerate Hong Kong's democratization process. Although recent elections have taken place at the district and municipal levels, attention has been focused most keenly on the Legislative Council.
<p>
<dd>
In 1992, Governor Patten proposed measures toward a more accountable and democratic political system. In June 1994, following 17 rounds of unsuccessful talks between Britain and China, and over Beijing's strong objections, the Legislative Council approved proposals to: (1) lower the voting age from 21 to 18; (2) open all District and Municipal Board seats to direct election; and (3) increase significantly the number of voters selecting Legislative Council seats through indirect elections. In addition, the Hong Kong government opened all Legislative Council seats to elections in 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<dd>
The September 1995 Legislative Council elections were fair and open, and resulted in the most representative and democratic legislative body in Hong Kong's history. Even pro-Beijing politicians disputed early charges in the local Beijing-controlled press that the elections had been unfair.<sup>10</sup> The strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in the 1995 legislative election in Hong Kong is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<dd>
China strongly opposed Hong Kong's electoral reforms and questioned the legitimacy of the 1995 elections on two grounds. First, Beijing claimed that the reforms violated the promise in the Joint Declaration that the "laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged."<sup>12</sup> Second, Beijing objected to Hong Kong's proceeding with its reform package without Beijing's prior approval. In retaliation, Beijing declared that the newly elected Legislative Council would not be permitted to serve out its four-year term (through 1999). Instead, Beijing plans to replace the Legislative Council with an appointed provisional legislature on July 1, 1997, which will serve until elections for a new Legislative Council can be held on Beijing's watch (sometime before June 30, 1998).<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Article 68 of the Basic Law stipulates that the
<p><blockquote>
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by election. The method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
It is difficult to understand how the elections in any way violated these principles, even if the process went beyond the parameters prescribed in an Annex of the Basic Law.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Both the Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Legislative Council elections were direct responses to Beijing's excessive authoritarianism at Tiananmen. In both cases, Beijing has failed to explain to the people of Hong Kong why it objects to these developments if it really intends to follow through on promises made in the Joint Declaration. There is a real concern in Hong Kong that a provisional legislature appointed by pro-Beijing operatives would place limits on the freedoms protected in the Bill of Rights Ordinance. There is also a real concern that Legislative Council elections held after July 1, 1997, may not be free and fair and may exclude groups or individuals who are critical of Beijing.
<p>
<b>U.S. CONCERN FOR HONG KONG</b>
<p>
<dd>

There are several reasons for the United States to be concerned about how the transition in Hong Kong unfolds. The United States first must be concerned about the high security and economic stakes at risk in the transition. Traditional U.S. interests in Asia are maintaining peace and stability, freedom of navigation, and access to markets, and keeping any one power from dominating the region to the exclusion of the United States. A failed transition in Hong Kong would threaten the U.S. interest in regional peace and stability. It would destabilize not only Hong Kong, but China's relations with its Asian neighbors and the United States as well. It also would increase the likelihood of armed conflict in the Taiwan Straits, the South China Sea, or the East China Sea.
<p>
<dd>As one of the most free and efficient ports in the world, Hong Kong is vital to U.S. interests in free navigation and access to markets, especially the China market. Hong Kong is an important entrepot for trade between United States and China. In 1995, 42 percent ($4.9 billion) of U.S. goods destined for China and 60 percent ($27.4 billion) of China's exports to the United States were routed through Hong Kong.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong is an important economic partner with the United States. Hong Kong is the 11th largest export market and 15th largest trading partner of the United States. Hong Kong itself imported $14.2 billion worth of goods from the United States in 1995, up 25 percent from 1994. Hong Kong was also home to $13.8 billion in direct foreign investment in 1995 alone. Most important, the United States has an interest in protecting the property of over 1,000 U.S. firms and the safety of more than 35,000 U.S. citizens that reside in Hong Kong.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<dd>
<b>Hong Kong's Dependence on Trade.</b> Hong Kong's dependence on foreign trade is a cause for concern because a loss of autonomy could diminish its global competitiveness and put at risk the jobs of millions of workers. In 1995, the total value of Hong Kong's trade amounted to $367 billion, or around 256 percent of gross domestic product. Hong Kong was the world's eighth largest trader in goods in 1995.<sup>17</sup> Such heavy reliance on trade makes Hong Kong vulnerable to government interference, either by undermining competitiveness through burdensome regulation or politicizing its economic institutions.
<p>
<dd><b>Limitations on Freedoms and Democracy.</b> Limitations on freedoms and democracy in Hong Kong are of concern to not only political activists, but businessmen as well. Imposed political limitations unintentionally may diminish economic growth and market efficiency. Beijing's intention to replace the Legislative Council and limit the application of two international covenants on human rights raises serious questions about its tolerance for freedom and democracy within its "one country, two systems" model. Similarly, China's harassment of Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang, together with the widespread fear of self-censorship in the Hong Kong press, has caused concern about the viability of freedom of the press after 1997. A free press is not only vital to democracy; the free and efficient flow of information is also vital to free markets.
<p>
<dd>
<b>Corruption and the Rule of Law.</b> With the establishment of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, many have feared that the corruption that has plagued business in China will find its way into Hong Kong. One of Hong Kong's main attractions has been the clean, modern business and legal environment it provides for foreigners to conduct business with China. Notwithstanding the real success of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in fighting corruption in Hong Kong since 1975, the import of Chinese-style corruption greatly would diminish the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a regional operations center for international business.
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong has a standard of living that exceeds that of Britain, Sweden, and most other West European countries. It is the fourth largest trading power in the world after the European Union, the United States, and Japan, and the fourth largest financial center after London, New York, and Tokyo. None of these benefits would be enjoyed if Hong Kong were not served by a mature, efficient, and incorrupt legal and judicial system.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<dd>
<b>The People's Liberation Army.</b> The role of the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong after 1997 is critical to the success or failure of the transition. An assertive military presence will undermine confidence in Hong Kong's future autonomy. China's military -- the People's Liberation Army (PLA) -- will replace the British Garrison currently stationed in Hong Kong as part of the transition process. The mission of the PLA in Hong Kong is to provide for the territory's defense, and interference in the local affairs of the Region is forbidden. But Article 14 of the Basic Law states that the SAR government can ask Beijing "for assistance from the [PLA] garrison in the maintenance of public order." With Tiananmen still fresh in their minds, some Hong Kong residents want protection from, not the protection of, the PLA. And if the Chief Executive of the SAR is appointed by Beijing, the people of Hong Kong will wonder how cautious he will be about requesting such "assistance."
<p>
<b>REASONS FOR OPTIMISM</b>
<p>
<dd>

Notwithstanding these concerns, there are also reasons for optimism. The stakes in Hong Kong are high not only for the Hong Kong and the United States, but for China as well. More than any other country, China needs an autonomous Hong Kong to bring in goods and capital, to keep Taiwan from declaring independence, and to prop up the legitimacy of Communist Party rule that has lost its ideological appeal. These substantial incentives for China to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy, on balance, cause the reasons for optimism to outweigh the causes for concern.
<p>
<dd><b>China's Economic Dependence on Hong Kong.</b> Hong Kong's high level of investment in China, not to mention China's high level of investment in Hong Kong, may be Hong Kong's best security guarantee. Hong Kong plays a vital role in facilitating trade and investment with China. Moreover China's economic development depends on foreign investment and trade. Because China's access to foreign trade and investment depends on the continued rule of law and free flow of capital, goods, and information in Hong Kong, Beijing may not be inclined to do anything to destabilize or undermine international confidence in Hong Kong. Doing otherwise could deal a fatal blow to its own economic development.
<p>
<dd>Hong Kong is the engine that drives China's economic reform process. It fuels China's economy with investment capital and facilitates merchandise trade. Hong Kong accounts for one-third of China's annual foreign exchange earnings and nearly 60 percent of all foreign direct investment contracted in China since 1979. It is China's largest export market, taking in 24 percent of China's total exports in 1995. Hong Kong also provides increased employment and skilled labor for China. It is estimated that around 122,000 residents of Hong Kong currently work in China, and Hong Kong firms employ more than 4 million Chinese workers in neighboring Guangdong province alone.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Hong Kong is the most important entrepot for China because about half of China's exports are handled by Hong Kong. Out of Hong Kong's total re-exports ($143.8 billion in 1995), 88 percent either originated from or are destined for China. Since 1978, re-exports of Chinese-origin goods through Hong Kong increased by 177 times, from $781 million in 1978 to $92 billion in 1995. Re-exports to China through Hong Kong rose dramatically by 1,794 times, from $46 million in 1978 to $49 billion in 1995.
<p>
<dd>China also has substantial investments in Hong Kong. Almost every province, region, and municipality in China now has resident representative offices, agents, or distributors in Hong Kong. At the end of 1995, there were 1,800 mainland Chinese enterprises registered in Hong Kong, with total assets valued at $50 billion. As of December 1994, 18 of the 185 licensed banks in Hong Kong were China-owned. The Bank of China and its 12 sister banks are now the second largest banking group in Hong Kong, after Hongkong Bank. Hong Kong's financial markets are a natural vehicle for the raising of capital by Chinese companies, and Hong Kong's banking system, the best in Asia, is a natural haven for Chinese savings.
<p>
<dd><b>Communist Party Legitimacy.</b> China's Communist Party's need for a successful transition in Hong Kong to bolster its own legitimacy is another reason for optimism about Hong Kong's future autonomy. The Communist Party has made reunification of the motherland a key pillar of its legitimacy. Increasing the living standards of the Chinese people is the second pillar. A turbulent assimilation of Hong Kong into Chinese sovereignty would threaten to destroy both pillars and thereby undermine the legitimacy of Communist Party rule in China. A destabilized Hong Kong would obstruct the vital flow of foreign investment and trade that supports Beijing's current economic reform and modernization. The failure to sustain economic growth and development along with the failure to fulfill the mission of national reunification thoroughly would undercut both pillars of Communist Party legitimacy.
<p>
<dd><b>The Taiwan Factor.</b> The dramatic effect an infringement on Hong Kong's promised autonomy would have on the independence movement in Taiwan is another reason for optimism. The importance of Taiwan in Beijing's Hong Kong calculations cannot be overstated. China's "one country, two systems" model was crafted with reunification with Taiwan in mind, and Hong Kong is the critical first test of this model. Although a successful transition in Hong Kong is no guarantee that the "one country, two systems" approach will work with Taiwan, a failed transition would eliminate virtually any possibility of peaceful reunification with Taiwan. Nothing would mobilize domestic and international support for Taiwan's independence -- an outcome Beijing wants desperately to avoid -- more than a botched transition in Hong Kong.
<p>
<dd><b>Familiarity with the Mainland.</b> Hong Kong's familiarity with mainland China is another reason to be optimistic about the success of the transition. Hong Kong's transfer to mainland sovereignty is no blind date. To residents of Hong Kong, China is a known quantity. In fact, Hong Kong's prosperity today is a testament to its knowledge of and ability to work within the Chinese system. The wealthy in Hong Kong achieved that status because of their connections inside China and in the West. They have profited from helping join foreign capital with opportunity in China. For this small but very influential group, the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty is a matter of politics catching up with economic reality.
<p>
<dd><b>Progress of the Joint Liaison Group.</b> Significant progress has been made to adapt Hong Kong's independent legal and judicial systems to post-1997 requirements. Since 1984, the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group has done a tremendous amount of work to pave the way toward a smooth transition. Major achievements of the Joint Liaison Group include the Sino-British agreement on the construction of the new airport, the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, Hong Kong's continued participation in 30 international organizations, and the continued application of some 200 multilateral treaties to Hong Kong after 1997.
<P>
<b>THE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES</b>
<p>
<dd>
Even though a successful transition that maintains Hong Kong's high level of autonomy clearly serves China's own best interests, the United States must remain vigilant in its efforts to protect U.S. interests at risk in the transition. The United States must protect the many U.S. citizens and businesses in Hong Kong as well as minimize the risk to market access and regional peace and stability generated by uncertainty over Hong Kong's future. U.S. interests will be served best by a realization of the level of autonomy promised Hong Kong in the Joint Declaration. To protect U.S. interests and help preserve the freedom, stability, and prosperity of Hong Kong, the United States should:
<p><ul>

 <li><b>Beware of the impact U.S. policy toward China has on Hong Kong.</b> Protection of U.S. interests in Hong Kong depends very much on the China policy of the U.S. government. Hong Kong's success is built upon bringing Western capital together with Asian opportunity. No relationship is more important to Hong Kong's continued success than that between the world's largest developed country, the United States, and the world's largest developing country, China. Politically generated trade friction between the United States and China, such as is created by threats to revoke China's most favored nation trading status, puts U.S. interests in Hong Kong in jeopardy and destabilizes Hong Kong.
 <p>
 <li><b>Articulate U.S. interests in Hong Kong to leaders in China.</b> A clear and unambiguous understanding of how the United States intends to protect the security of the 35,000 U.S. citizens and 1,000 U.S. firms in Hong Kong, as well as its multibillion-dollar investment and trade interests, will help China's leaders avoid miscalculation when responding to U.S. actions in Hong Kong. These interests are communicated best through frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels. These interests should be articulated in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the United States attaches to achieving U.S. interests through cooperation.
 <p>
 <li><b>Maintain a strong U.S. presence in Hong Kong.</b> U.S. officials, businessmen, students, journalists, and tourists are a vital source of information about the transition in Hong Kong. Their presence demonstrates to the people of Hong Kong that the United States has not abandoned them and is carefully observing the transition process.
 <p>
 <li><b>Strongly urge Beijing to allow the current democratically elected Legislative Council to serve out its term.</b> If Beijing insists on replacing the current legislature, the United States should urge it to shorten the term of the provisional legislature by preparing now for elections to take place as soon after July 1, 1997, as possible.
 <p>
 <li><b>Support Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations.</b> Considering Beijing's promises of autonomy, including Hong Kong's separate currency and tax system, Hong Kong deserves to represent the interests of its economy in international forums. As the world's freest economy, Hong Kong should play a key role in international organizations in leading the world toward a more free and open trading system.
 <p>
 <li><b>Urge Beijing to sign international human rights covenants.</b> Such a covenant would resolve the issue of whether Beijing will, as the British have, make annual reports to the United Nations on the status of human rights conditions in Hong Kong. This also would assuage the fears that prompted Hong Kong residents to demand a Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.
 <p>
 <li><b>Closely cooperate with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, alien smuggling, and commercial piracy.</b> This cooperation is of critical strategic importance to the United States. For this cooperation to work, it is important that the United States not allow differences with Beijing to alienate or put at risk the new SAR government.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p><dd>

The transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China is not simply a domestic Chinese issue. It is a historic event with global implications. Hong Kong will be the critical first test of China's "one country, two systems" model for national reunification, and it also will be a test of China's ability to deal with a democracy and free market in its midst. How China deals with Hong Kong's free market democracy will be a key indication of how it intends to deal with Taiwan and other free market democracies in Asia. In the balance will be global strategic and economic interests, as well as the fate of China's economic modernization. A successful and smooth transition in Hong Kong is vitally important to China and the world.
<p><dd>
The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration promises that Hong Kong's people will rule Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. The United States has recognized the Joint Declaration as an international treaty. It is, therefore, a matter of international law that both parties to this treaty abide by the solemn obligations undertaken in the Joint Declaration. The United States must be strong in urging Beijing to grant Hong Kong the level of autonomy promised in the Joint Declaration.
<p><dd>
China must come to terms with the impact on Hong Kong of its aggression at Tiananmen Square. Many of the challenges China faces in this transition process are direct responses to Tiananmen and are, therefore, of China's own making. The reassurances that the people of Hong Kong seek -- a local Bill of Rights and a democratically elected legislature -- are not too much to ask. The promises made in the Joint Declaration are sufficient to protect the future freedom, stability, and prosperity of Hong Kong.
<p><dd>
At present, the reasons for optimism about Hong Kong's future autonomy outweigh the causes for concern, but the several U.S. economic and security interests at stake in Hong Kong will be secure only if promises made in the Joint Declaration are kept.

<h3>CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND THE CULTURE OF SPENDING </h3>
<b>A Government Reform Project Study</b>

<dd>
Over half the witnesses testifying before committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives during the budget-slashing 104th Congress were funded directly by the federal taxpayer. In 1995, 35 percent of witnesses were federal employees; of the remaining "public" witnesses, one of every three was a government grant recipient. Grant recipients testified during the 104th Congress roughly 6,000 times: 3,000 times a year, or an average of a dozen times every working day.
<p>
<dd>
The preponderance of government-funded and government-employed witnesses is one reason that even committed budget-cutters had a difficult time reducing federal spending: They hear mostly one side of the story. Moreover, a review of their testimony reveals that almost none of these witnesses disclosed the amount and source of their government funding, whether grants or contracts. Simple disclosure would be the first step toward a more balanced congressional hearing process. Committee members appear to be unaware of the high percentage of government-subsidized witnesses appearing before them. More important, because it is so rarely recognized, the potentially self-serving nature of grant-recipients' testimony is almost never addressed.
<p>
<dd>
While it may be important for Congress to listen to federal grant recipients 3,000 times per year, it is at least equally important that Members of Congress -- to say nothing of the public -- know exactly who is trying to persuade them. Congress should adopt a "Truth in Testimony" rule requiring grant recipients to disclose the amount and source of their grants in written congressional testimony. A Truth in Testimony rule has been introduced in the House by Representative John Doolittle (R-CA) and is being considered for inclusion in the rules change package for the opening of the 105th Congress.
<p>
<b>BACKGROUND: THE CULTURE OF SPENDING</b>
<p>
<dd>
Although the impact of such testimony can be enormous, few have studied the general tenor of testimony to see what impact it might have on the legislative process. In his 1991 book <i>The Culture of Spending</i>, economist James L. Payne calculated that approximately 96 percent of witnesses before selected congressional committees testified in support of government programs or spending.<sup>1</sup>  Payne concluded that Congressmen find themselves almost cocooned in a pro-spending environment. Every Member of Congress is subject to the influence of pro-spending arguments while attending dozens of hearings each year and listening to calls for federal action that meet with little opposition. Bureaucrats boast about the success of their agencies and ask for more funding to continue their work; interest groups point out how many of their members depend on federal programs. Moreover, such pleas for federal initiatives are often reiterated by lobbyists, grassroots campaigns, or informal contacts.
<p>
<b>AN AVALANCHE OF SELF-SERVING TESTIMONY</b>
<p>
<dd>The Heritage Foundation conducted a Congress-wide study of the prevalence of testimony by witnesses with a direct financial interest in federal spending. The results indicate undeniably that congressional hearings are dominated by persons who depend on the federal treasury: Well over half of all congressional witnesses rely on the federal government for grants, contracts, or salaries. A review of 3,400 witnesses testifying before the 15 House and Senate committees for which complete 1995 witness lists were available reveals that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>More than one in five of all witnesses before Congress (22 percent) represents an organization that receives grants directly from the federal government. This amounts to one of every three witnesses who are not federal employees. Examples include representatives of Native American Indian tribes, nonprofit groups like the Urban Institute or the Environmental Defense Fund, and state or local agencies like the Texas Water Commission or the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Given the enormous breadth of these federal discretionary grants -- over 40,000 groups receive an estimated $39 billion in grants from dozens of executive branch agencies each year -- Members of Congress may not know that witnesses are directly dependent on the very programs they are promoting.
<p>
<li>Federal officials, including employees of federal agencies, Cabinet secretaries, and Members of Congress, constitute 35 percent of the witnesses before congressional committees. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the operations of the executive branch and therefore must hear testimony from relevant officials. Unfortunately, however, officials testifying on behalf of federal programs rarely offer a balanced assessment of their efforts. Prior to the 104th Congress, such oversight hearings, in Payne's words, were "almost always cheering sessions for the program involved."<sup>2</sup>  To its credit, the 104th Congress sought to correct this imbalance by inviting witnesses who opposed increased federal spending. Yet such testimony often faced sharp, coordinated opposition from the long-standing network of officials from federal agencies working in tandem with committee members who favored federal programs.
<p>
<li>With respect to the remaining 43 percent of witnesses, their exact financial relationship to the federal government is uncertain. Some are federal contractors, while many represent trade associations, businesses, or interest groups with significant economic interests in the outcome of pending congressional legislation. Others may not receive any federal funding. Even among this 43 percent, however, at least half testified in favor of more government spending or increased government power.
</ul>
<p>
<b>A QUESTION OF BALANCE</b>
<p>
<dd>
Witnesses favoring more expensive government outnumbered their opponents by a ratio of 4:1. This high percentage of government-dependent witnesses was recorded during the first session of the 104th Congress, a Congress which sought to cut taxes and rein in federal spending. This imbalance represents a pro-spending bias in the congressional hearing system. Congress should begin to address this bias by clarifying which witnesses receive federal funding and then by assembling more balanced panels of witnesses.
<p>
<dd>
Committee hearings can serve to educate the public by allowing a range of views to be presented and questioned. Indeed, congressional hearings often are the focus of national media reports. When these sessions are stacked in favor of continuing or expanding government programs, they give media access and prestige to those who believe that for every problem, there is a federal solution. Further, when the witnesses -- and Congress itself -- fail to reveal the self-interested nature of a spending advocate's testimony, they convey a misleading picture to the public.
<p>
<dd>
Consider, for example, the fight over funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Almost all of the witnesses at a February 29, 1996, House Commerce Committee hearing were financially dependent on federal tax dollars, and each predictably called for greater federal spending for public broadcasting: the presidents of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and National Public Radio and representatives from the Association of America's Public Television Stations, the National Federation of Community Broadcasters, the National Asian American Telecommunications Association, and the Children's Television Service.<sup>3</sup>  In 1995, as part of its campaign to preserve federal subsidies, PBS even sent Shari Lewis, puppeteer of Lamb Chop, to the National Press Club to protest possible budget cuts.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<dd>Another of many such examples is a hearing on welfare reform held by the House Ways and Means Committee on February 2, 1995.<sup>5</sup>  Of the 65 witnesses who testified, 18 were from organizations that received federal grants, including five state and local officials who acknowledged that their agencies depend on federal funds. Apparently, none of the other 13 witnesses -- from groups such as the National Council of La Raza, the National Senior Citizens Law Center, the Service Employees International Union, the National Center for Family Literacy, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Public Voice for Food and Health Policy -- thought that it relevant to mention their grants from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Education, or the fact that their funding might have been in jeopardy. This scenario is repeated all too often, from Superfund reform to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, welfare reform, job training programs, and a host of other taxpayer-funded efforts.
<p>
<b>REFORMING THE CULTURE OF SPENDING</b>
<p>
<dd>
When seeking information about government programs or pending legislation, Members of Congress consult a variety of sources, including constituents, staff members, lobbyists, the news media, and the congressional leadership. But committee and subcommittee hearings provide Congressmen of both parties with what may be their clearest and most focused opportunity to gauge an issue by listening to often compelling testimony from private citizens, knowledgeable scholars, and program administrators. Hearings that are properly run can expose wasteful government activities or foster a national consensus on key issues. To fulfill these goals, however, Washington's culture of spending must be transformed. Congress could seek to control spending through small, targeted reforms. Foremost on any list of changes should be changes in the way congressional hearings are conducted to allow committee members to apprehend more readily the motivations of those who lobby in support of federal programs.
<p>
<dd>
The easiest reform to implement, requiring only a change in the House rules, is Truth in Testimony as introduced by Representative Doolittle. Truth in Testimony would require witnesses to disclose in their written statements any federal grants or contracts, including the amounts and sources of taxpayer funding, that they or their organization receive. If a witness declined to provide this information, his testimony would not appear in the official committee transcript. Because Congress does not currently require witnesses to reveal federal funding, most taxpayers (and perhaps many Members of Congress) are unaware that tax dollars subsidize lobbying activities. The legislative process would be significantly more open if the public knew whether a person testifying before Congress had a vested interest in the result.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
<dd>
Despite efforts by the 104th Congress to control spending and reform congressional procedures, this study demonstrates that the committee hearing process is still dominated by organizations and individuals that depend on federal funding, and thus have a direct interest in asking Congress for more money for the programs from which they receive grants. One of every three ostensibly "public" witnesses is a government grant recipient. As part of its oversight duty, Congress needs to hear from federal grantees, but 3,000 times each year may be too often. Congress needs to pay increased attention to the voice of the taxpayer, who often is not given the opportunity to counteract the claims and requests of federally funded groups. The truth in testimony proposal would do a great deal to ensure that hearings serve as an opportunity for Congress to gather objective information and not as a press conference on behalf of executive branch agencies, grant recipients, and professional lobbyists. Such a rule would allow Members of Congress to understand the background of witnesses' testimony. As part of the rules package for the 105th Congress, Congress therefore should adopt a Truth in Testimony rule.

<p>
<b>APPENDIX</b>
<p>
<dd>
The Heritage Foundation's Government Reform Project examined every hearing held during 1995 by 15 House and Senate committees and their subcommittees, encompassing 3,423 witnesses. Included in the survey were the House Science, Small Business, Banking, Veterans Affairs, Budget, and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees and the Senate Judiciary, Budget, Small Business, Indian Affairs, Energy and Natural Resources, Rules and Administration, Labor and Human Resources, Environment and Public Works, and Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committees. These committees were selected because complete witness lists were available via committee publications, committee web sites, and the <i>Congressional Record</i>. Because the Appropriations Committees were not included, it is probable that the results of this study slightly understate the actual percentage of witnesses who are depend directly on federal funding. This sample comprises approximately one-fourth of the approximately 13,000 witnesses that appear before Congress in a typical year. Only individuals who physically appeared at the hearing, as opposed to those who merely submitted statements, were included in the totals. Of the 3,423 witnesses catalogued, 1,189 worked for the federal government, 766 represented organizations that received federal grants, and 1,468 were from other organizations. Witnesses were identified as grant recipients by the Federal Assistance Awards Data System (FAADS) database covering the 1994 fiscal year.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Here's a strange way to celebrate Christmas week.  A federal
judge in New York has ruled that military stores must again start
selling <I>Penthouse</I> and other skin magazines.  The order
is temporary, but I'm afraid the arrogance of our federal judges
is permanent.

<p>

Earlier this year, the Congress, after endless pleas from
service women and military families, finally banned porn sales
at PX's worldwide.  Over the years, the Pentagon had resisted
the ban.  Not only will boys be boys, the Defense Department said,
but they must be boys on the government's dime at government stores.
It's an absurd argument, which is one reason why Congress easily
passed the ban and President Clinton signed it into law.

<p>

But the Clinton administration is reverting to old ways.
It now says that even though the judge's order is technically
local, it will apply it to military stores worldwide.  So, Christmas
week will come with the porn magazines in stock, right between
the holly and the ivy.  It's just one more lump of coal from our
radical federal courts.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
<dd>Congress passed the income tax deduction for charitable contributions in 1917, only four years after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, which established the federal income tax. The purpose of the deduction then, as today, was to promote private donations to nonprofit institutions. Through the ups and downs of federal income tax rates, the deduction for charitable contributions has remained constant and unquestioned -- until now.
<p>
<dd>
With talk of overhauling the federal income tax in favor of a simple, consumption-based flat tax also has come talk of eliminating the charitable contribution deduction. This has raised considerable controversy. Many proponents of a flat income tax call for retaining the charitable deduction, but there are substantial reasons to eliminate the charitable deduction as part of any flat tax proposal. Contrary to popular opinion, the data suggest that giving to charities probably would increase with passage of a flat tax with no charitable deduction. The reason: The flat tax increases economic growth, personal income, savings, and net wealth, all of which lead to higher levels of giving. Specifically,
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Despite large variations in federal tax rates over the past two decades, donations as a percentage of personal income have remained constant.</b> Although the top marginal income tax rate has ranged from 28 to 91 percent over the past two decades, the amount that individuals donate to nonprofit organizations has remained relatively constant: around 1.83 percent of personal income. 
<p>
<li><b>The flat tax would increase personal income, leading in turn to increased donations.</b> Because the percentage of income donated to charities historically has been so constant, the surest way to increase charitable donations is to increase personal income. Put another way, even if the number of slices of the income pie donated to charity remains the same, a larger pie means larger slices.
<p>
<li><b>Several factors other than tax treatment determine how much individuals donate to charitable organizations.</b> Various surveys indicate that marital status, religious participation, and age all significantly affect the percentage of income an individual donates to charity. But these factors lie largely outside the income tax structure and therefore have little to do with whether the federal income tax is flat or not.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>
Retaining the charitable deduction as part of a flat tax carries with it several negative consequences, all of which hinder the underlying goal of a flat tax: to make the federal income tax system fairer and less intrusive by taxing all income only once and at its source, presumably at a low rate. Any proposed change should be measured against this standard. In particular, retaining the charitable deduction would have the following detrimental effects:
<p><ul>
<li><b> A higher tax rate.</b> Retaining the charitable contribution necessitates a higher tax rate that would be faced by all taxpayers, including those in lower income brackets.
<p>
<li><b>The possibility of other deductions.</b> The best excuse for any deduction is the previous one -- and the next one might well not be as admirable as the charitable deduction.
<p>
<li><b>Federal government social engineering.</b> The overriding problem with the current tax code is that it arbitrarily encourages certain behaviors and discourages others. Retaining any deductions under a flat tax regime, including the charitable contribution deduction, will continue this practice. Individuals should be free to chose how they spend their own hard-earned money.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>
Estimates by Heritage Foundation analysts indicate that aggregate contributions would increase slightly with passage of a flat tax even without a charitable contribution deduction. Certainly, some nonprofit organizations would benefit more than others; but, it can be presumed that religious congregations and human service charities would benefit most from a flat tax.
<p>
<dd>
In order to estimate the probable impact of a flat tax on charitable giving, it is necessary to examine three areas:
<p><ul>
<li><b>What</b> sorts of organizations make up the nonprofit sector,
<p>
<li><b>Who</b> makes up the donor population, and
<p>
<li><b>How</b> the nonprofit sector finances its activities.
</ul>
<p>
<b>DEFINING THE NONPROFIT SECTOR</b>
<p>
<dd>
Modern American society generally has organized its activities into two categories, the public and private sectors. The private sector, or market, includes businesses, corporations, and other entities motivated to earn a profit by selling a good or service. The public sector, or government, is meant to provide those services that are not produced by the market. Lester Salamon and Helmut Anheier describe this dual system in the following terms:
<p><blockquote >
	Despite the immense diversity of organizations that comprise modern society, we have come to accept the existence of two grand complexes of institutions -- two broad sectors -- into which it has become conventional to divide social life. We refer to these typically as the <i>market</i> and the <i>state</i>, or the <i>private</i> and the <i>public</i> sectors.<sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
This definition, however, overlooks a broad category of important organizations generically known as nonprofits. These organizations constitute what Salamon and Anheier term the "emerging sector."  The emerging or nonprofit sector employs more than 7 million people (or 5.7 percent of all employed workers) and constitutes roughly 6 percent of total annual output (roughly $350 billion). For comparison, the entire construction industry employs only about 5 million workers and represents 4 percent of total annual output.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Generally, nonprofit organizations are private entities whose purpose is to provide a service or good without profit as a primary motivation. While this definition may seem circular, it is the most basic description that applies to all nonprofit organizations. Nonprofits cannot really be classified as part of the market because, unlike private businesses, they do not have profit as their primary goal. Nor are they really a part of government because they cannot levy taxes to sponsor their activities. Within this general classification exists a great variety of organizations, from soup kitchens and homeless shelters, to art galleries and symphony orchestras, to political parties and campaigns. 
<p>
<dd>
Clearly, using this general definition, nonprofits have existed throughout American history. However, it was not until 1917 and passage of the charitable contribution deduction that the nonprofit sector obtained a second definition, this time a legal definition. Since the deduction was instituted, it has been necessary for the government to decide what organizations should be considered legally nonprofits, and therefore worthy of special treatment through the tax code, and which organizations and activities should not receive special treatment. What has emerged is a hodgepodge of organizations that may classify as a nonprofit in the general definition but be ineligible for favorable tax treatment because the federal government has determined that their activities are not of special value. For example, donations made to political campaigns (clearly nonprofit) are not tax-deductible, while donations to hospitals are (despite the multi-million-dollar salaries of some doctors). Unfortunately, most data collected on the nonprofit sector are organized according to the legal definition rather than the general one. Therefore, although this paper is concerned with charitable activity in general, it is limited in some senses to the legal definition of a nonprofit.
<p>
<dd>
The pattern of giving is such that religious organizations receive the highest percentage of donations: about 44 percent of total contributions in 1995. Education groups, primarily private colleges and universities, are the second-largest category, with 12.5 percent of total contributions in 1995.<sup>4</sup>  Other categories include health organizations, international support groups, environmental activist organizations, and the arts.
<p>
<dd>
Even within these broad categories, there is wide diversity. For example, the College Democrats, the University of Notre Dame, and Sidwell Friends Middle School are all categorized as "educational organizations."  Similarly, the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institution are both classified as educational organizations and yet are very different in outlook, structure, focus, and membership. To speak of "the nonprofits" as if they somehow constituted a single entity is therefore misleading. 
<p>
<dd>
Despite this diversity, most Americans continue to think of nonprofit groups exclusively as charitable organizations whose aim is to help the disadvantaged even though "human service/welfare" nonprofits -- those which do fit this widely held definition -- received only 8.1 percent of all charitable contributions in 1995. The diversity of the nonprofit sector also is overlooked by many analysts who argue that as the federal welfare system is dismantled, nonprofits will have to "pick up the slack" in helping cure social ills. The question asked by Rev. Fred Kammer, president of Catholic Charities, USA, is typical: "Where will the money come from to save those people from starvation, illness, or death?"<sup>5</sup>  These are valid concerns, but they are overstated with regard to elimination of the charitable contribution deduction, which affects giving to all nonprofits, not just human service organization.
<p>
<b>The Importance of Religious Organizations</b>
<p>
<dd>
Another factor often overlooked by analysts is the role that religious organizations play in providing basic charity to disadvantaged groups. Most surveys determine how much money is donated to religious organizations but not how this money is used. Because donations to religious organizations represent about 44 percent of all donations, this is a very important consideration.
<p>
<dd>
A full 91.7 percent of religious congregations in America sponsor human service/welfare programs through the donations they receive. These activities range from youth groups (72.6 percent of religious congregations engage in this activity) and food kitchens (50.1 percent participation) to family and marriage counseling (62 percent participation).<sup>6</sup>  In 1991, religious congregations donated a total of $28 billion to other charitable activities, including $11 billion in volunteer time. The $17 billion in direct expenditures represented 31 percent of the total donated to religious congregations in that year. In other words, nearly one-third of the money donated to religious congregations is spent on charitable activities other than religious functions.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<dd>
As will be demonstrated below, donations made to religious congregations will likely increase with passage of a flat tax. The activities which these congregations sponsor, therefore, will see a corresponding increase in funding. It is important to consider the activities of religious congregations when researching human service nonprofits. 
<p>
<b>DEFINING THE CONTRIBUTORS</b>
<p>
<dd>
Nonprofit organizations receive operating income from a variety of sources. In fact, only 10.1 percent of revenues for all nonprofits come from contributions. The other 89.9 percent is received from program service revenues (71.7 percent), government grants (7.9 percent), and other sources (10.3 percent).<sup>8</sup>  The nature of an individual nonprofit largely determines its primary source of income. For example, hospitals and nursing homes, although they are nonprofits, have services they can price and sell. These groups rely heavily on entrance fees and ticket sales. Homeless and poverty shelters, on the other hand, do not have a good market because their "customers" are unable to purchase their services. These organizations therefore must rely more heavily on charitable donations.
<p>
<dd>
Concentrating on private donations alone demonstrates another layer of diversity. There are four major donor categories: individuals, foundations, corporations, and bequests. Each has unique characteristics that determine, in general, which charities are supported and at what level. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1093c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows, individuals contribute the vast majority of dollars (a full 81 percent in 1994), with corporate, foundation, and bequest giving making up the remaining 19 percent (approximately 4.7, 7.6, and 6.7 percent, respectively, in 1994). 
<p>
<blockquote>
<dd>
<b>Individuals.</b> Individual donations accounted for $116.23 billion worth of private contributions in 1995.<sup>9</sup>  By far the largest category, it also is the most diverse. Individual donors range from the poor who give change to their churches to the rich who donate millions each year to universities or art museums. In order to understand how the flat tax without a charitable donation deduction will effect individuals, it is necessary to identify which groups donate to what charities, why they contribute, and what characteristics determine the amounts individuals donate to nonprofits.
<p>
<dd>
The American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel (AAFRC) Trust for Philanthropy reports that total individual donations have remained relatively constant since 1974, averaging 1.83 percent of total personal income. The lowest level was in 1985 (1.71 percent of total personal income); the highest, in 1989 (1.95 percent).<sup>10</sup>  Despite the relative consistency of aggregate individual donations over time, many factors, including the tax code, influence how much an individual donates, the sorts of nonprofits that receive support, and the types of donations that are made.
<p>
<dd>
<b >Foundations.</b> Foundations accounted for $10.44 billion in donations during 1995.<sup>11</sup>  There are more than 38,000 charitable foundations in the United States, most of them small foundations established by individuals. But it is the 775 largest foundations that control 65 percent of total foundation assets and award nearly half of the country's foundation grants.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Foundations exist for many reasons. One of the primary reasons is to avoid paying taxes. For example, many foundations are established upon an individual's death to avoid paying the estate tax, which can be as high as 55 percent of the transfer amount. Another example is the provision passed in 1984 which allows tax-free donations of equities (at present market value) to charitable foundations. With this in mind, wealthy individuals can establish and donate stock holdings to the foundation. They may then claim a tax deduction and retain control over the ultimate destination of the donation.
<p>
<dd>
But there are other reasons foundations exist. They may be a convenient way for many individual donors to pool their gifts and fund projects that would not be possible at the individual level -- as is the case with community foundations. Or individuals may establish foundations with specific instructions as to which causes the money will be donated upon their death. Thus the individual creates a legacy of support for causes that are of importance to him. Quite simply, an individual may create a foundation to separate himself from the day-to-day decisions of making donations, entrusting those responsibilities to a board of trustees instructed by general guidelines on how the money is to be distributed. These considerations may be made in addition to tax considerations, but are largely independent of such financial concerns and would likely remain important even after significant tax reform.
<p>
<dd>
<b>Corporations.</b> Corporations accounted for some $7.4 billion in contributions in 1995.<sup>13</sup>  There are many reasons why corporations donate to charitable causes. General goodwill among the corporate executives and tax considerations are two. However, public image and profitability, the main responsibilities of private firms, also are important. Surveys have shown that consumers consider a company's public image in deciding whether to purchase its goods or services. Firms realize this and often take an active role in their local community to promote themselves as good corporate citizens. Many companies also have found charitable causes to be a good source of advertisement or marketing. For example, computer companies will donate products to universities knowing that students, being familiar with the product, likely will purchase that same brand once they have left school. Finally, many companies promote volunteer activities among their employees because such service is believed to improve employee morale and attract more productive workers.
<p>
<dd><b>Bequests.</b> Donations made by bequest accounted for $9.77 billion in charitable giving in 1995.<sup>14</sup>  Bequest, or willed, giving is becoming an increasingly important source of donations for nonprofits because the workers of the 1950s and 1960s, who benefited from a rapidly growing economy and were able to accumulate significant wealth, are beginning to reach old age. This generation will be followed by the baby boomer generation. The wealth of the former and large volume of the latter ensure that willed giving will remain a growing source of support.

</blockquote><p>

<b>Factors Affecting Individual Gifts</b><sup>15</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Several factors influence the percentage of income an individual donates to charity. The level of income itself is important insofar as the dollar amount donated is concerned. However, there is no constant relationship between income and donations as a percentage of income. For example, donors earning less than $20,000 give more to nonprofits as a percentage of income than those earning between $50,000 and $100,000.<sup>16</sup>  The average donor earning less than $10,000 in 1994 gave just over $200 to charitable organizations, or 2.7 percent of income; donors earning between $40,000 and $50,000 gave approximately $575, or only 1.3 percent of income.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Income level also directly influences the type of organization to which an individual donates. Upper-income individuals are more likely to give to the arts and humanities, environmental causes, and educational institutions. Lower-income individuals tend to give to religious congregations and human service groups. In 1993, the average income for donors to the arts and humanities was $56,535; the average for donors to environmental causes was $50,922; and the average for donors to educational institutions was $50,527. On the other end of the spectrum, the average income of donors to religious organizations was $40,923, and the average for donors to human service organizations was $47,099.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Put another way, an individual donor earning over $60,000 per year is seven times more likely to contribute to the arts and humanities than a donor earning less than $20,000 per year; donations to educational institutions are 4.3 times more likely to come from wealthier individuals; and wealthier individuals are 3.7 times more likely to donate to environmental causes. On the other hand, wealthy donors (again, those earning more than $60,000 per year) are only 1.5 times more likely to donate to religious organizations and only 2.9 times more likely to donate to human service organizations.
<p>
<dd>
These differences are significant when considering changes in the tax code. Independent Sector, a national coalition of voluntary organizations, foundations, and corporate giving programs which encourages philanthropy and nonprofit initiatives, estimates that 65.3 percent of donors to the arts and humanities plan to itemize. Only 44.4 percent of donors to human services are itemizers, and only 38.1 percent of those who donate to religious organizations find it advantageous to itemize on their federal income tax returns.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Several demographic factors influence the amount of income an individual donates to charity, regardless of income level. The most important are age, marital status, and church participation. In general, older individuals who have been married and who attend church regularly tend to donate a larger percentage of their income to charitable organizations than do young, single, non-church attending individuals. Specifically, retirees (individuals over the age of 65) give about 3.4 percent of their income to nonprofits. Those below the age of 45 give an average of about 1.6 percent of their income to charity. Likewise, those who are married or who have been married in the past donate about twice as much on average (as a percentage of income) as do single individuals.<sup>20</sup> 
<p>
<dd>
Perhaps the single most important indicator in determining an individual's level of charitable giving (to all charitable causes, not just religious congregations) is church attendance. In 1994, donors who attended church gave an average of 2.2 percent of their income to charity; those who did not attend church averaged only 1.4 percent. With specific reference to the frequency of church attendance, again in 1994, donors who attended church services weekly donated an average of 3.3 percent of their income to nonprofits; those who attended monthly averaged 1.4 percent; and those who attended only once or twice a year averaged only 1 percent.<sup>21</sup>
<p>
<dd>
There are two major conclusions to be drawn from any study of the donor community. First, individuals constitute by far the largest source of donations, contributing nearly 81 percent of all donations. Second, upper-income individuals (those most likely to itemize and therefore to be directly affected by elimination of the charitable contribution deduction) give primarily to the arts, hospitals, and universities. The majority of non-itemizers give to churches and human service organizations. These individuals, by and large, would not be affected negatively by the elimination of the charitable contribution deduction.
<p>
<b>EFFECT OF ELIMINATING THE CHARITABLE DEDUCTION WITH A FLAT TAX</b>
<p>
<dd>
The nonprofit sector is a heterogeneous collection of organizations with various revenue sources (from product sales to contributions) and a wide range of donors (from multibillion-dollar corporations to relatively unaffluent individuals) providing various services (from opera to soup kitchens). Therefore, it is impossible to determine how each and every nonprofit would fare under a flat tax without a charitable contribution deduction. Several important economic patterns and incentives must be considered in trying to anticipate the aggregate impact a flat tax would have on the nonprofit sector.
<p>
<dd>
It is important to consider all of the facts when determining the effect a flat tax will have on charitable donations. All too often, analysts and other interested parties focus on one or two aspects of the current tax code or donating public but ignore the fundamental changes a flat tax will have on taxpayers. These analysts are working "within the box" of the current system. But the flat tax represents such a fundamental shift in American life that it is necessary to step away from the box and take a new approach that evaluates all the important considerations.
<p>
<dd>
Heritage scholars have taken such a complete, "outside-the-box" approach and determined that aggregate charitable donations actually will increase under a flat tax. Before describing these results, however, it is important to understand some of the misunderstandings that cause some analysts to conclude that eliminating the charitable deduction must lead to a fall in donations.
<p><blockquote>
<b>1)  The price of giving is not the only factor.</b> Many analysts believe that elimination of the charitable tax deduction would decrease significantly the amount of money donated to nonprofits. However, this is based on the mistaken assumption that the primary driving force behind charitable donations is the income tax deduction. In other words, these analysts believe that individuals donate a certain amount of money almost solely because there is a benefit to be had through the federal tax code. If an individual faces a tax rate of 28 percent, giving a dollar to charity actually costs him only 72 cents because he will save 28 cents in taxes; and as this benefit decreases in value (as happened in 1980 and 1986 with the lowering of tax rates), the "price" of giving goes up and, it is argued, donations can be expected to decrease.
<p>
<dd>
This argument describes the price effect of the charitable deduction. But focusing on this price effect to the exclusion of all other factors is like saying that the only reason people purchase a house is to take advantage of the home mortgage income tax deduction. While tax incentives are part of the giving equation, the price-effect position ignores the fact that making charitable donations or buying a home still has a real cost. Making a contribution to charity is foregone income or wealth, whether it costs the donor 72 cents, a dollar, or any amount in between.
<p>
<dd>
Several other factors are more important than deductibility in determining the level of charitable giving. As mentioned above, church attendance, marital status, and age all make more of a difference in the decision to give and the amount given to charity than the presence of an income tax deduction. If the deduction were the most important determinant, one would expect that individuals with a certain income who itemize, regardless of church attendance, marital status, or location, would contribute about as much as non-itemizers with the same income. However, this is not the case. In fact, many non-itemizers who are weekly church attendees donate more than those with similar incomes who itemize and do not attend church services on a regular basis.
<p>
<dd>
But even limiting ourselves to tax code variables that affect charitable donations, the price effect ignores two important points: 
<p>
<dd>
<b>First, there is the income effect:</b> the economic effect that as an individual's income increases, he is able to afford more of a specific good without changing the relative amount of income donated. In the case of charitable donations, this principle means that an individual is able to make more donations in absolute terms without increasing the percentage of income being donated. The size of the pie has increased, and although the number of slices remains the same, each slice is larger.
<p>
<dd>
Second, some 46 million American households give to charities but do not claim an income tax deduction. Non-itemizers account for roughly 64 percent of all donors.<sup>22</sup>  Because these donors do not itemize, they do not face the price effect; it costs them as much to give an additional dollar as it does to use the money in some other way. They do face the income effect, however. Therefore, any plan which simultaneously increases income and reduces or eliminates the price incentive can be expected to increase aggregate giving only if the income effect is larger than the price effect, keeping in mind that more donors are influenced by the income effect than by the price.
<p>
<dd>
Taking these two points into consideration, Heritage analysts estimate that the amount of money donated to charities each year under the flat tax would be about 3.8 percent more than would have been donated under the current system.<sup>23</sup>  This figure assumes both the elimination of the charitable contribution deduction, which increases the "cost" of donating (but only for itemizers), and the increased income that is projected to flow to all individuals, regardless of itemizer status, because of more rapid economic growth projected under the flat tax. In other words, the income effect overwhelms the price change.
<p>
<b>2)  Giving has remained remarkably stable over time despite changes in the tax code.</b> Although the tax code has changed dramatically over the past 70 years, the level of charitable giving as a percentage of income and economic output has remained relatively constant. Giving as a percentage of personal income has hovered around 1.8 percent. Moreover, charitable giving from all sources has averaged 1.94 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year over the past 30 years, during which the rate has neither dropped below 1.72 percent of GDP (in 1978) nor risen above 2.14 percent of GDP (in 1969).<sup>24</sup>  This narrow range has persisted despite a top marginal tax rate fluctuating between 28 and 91 percent.
<p>
<dd>
Moreover, despite changes in the tax code which have shifted the tax burden from the corporate sector to individuals and back again, and despite the creation and elimination of various tax loopholes and incentives, the levels of charitable donations from each of the four main sources also have remained relatively constant over time.
<p>
<dd><b>Example No. 1: The 1981 rate cuts.</b> On several occasions, analysts have predicted particularly dire consequences for charitable giving because of major changes in the tax code. In 1981, for example, Ronald Reagan's first economic plan became law, dramatically reducing marginal tax rates. The plan included an across-the-board reduction of 25 percent in marginal tax rates for individuals and a reduction in the highest individual rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. Many analysts and most directors of nonprofit organizations feared a significant decrease in charitable donations.
<p>
<dd>
These fears were never realized. By 1986, when President Reagan's economic plan was fully in effect, total charitable giving was 16 percent higher (accounting for inflation) than in 1980. The economic growth that resulted from reducing marginal tax rates actually boosted the amount of charitable donations. Moreover, total giving accounted for 1.9 percent of GDP in 1986 compared with only 1.7 percent in 1980.<sup>25</sup>  Between 1980 and 1986, the amounts contributed by donors in every category (individuals, corporations, foundations, and bequests) increased, as did the levels of contributions received by nonprofits in every category (from the arts to human service organizations). And these increases occurred despite the harsh recession of 1981-1982.
<p>
<dd>
<b>Example No. 2: The 1986 tax reform.</b> Another case study of the effect the tax code has on charitable deductions is the 1986 tax bill. That bill eliminated numerous deductions in the federal income tax code and lowered the top individual marginal tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent. The bill also eliminated the "above-the-line" tax deductibility of charitable contributions by which, prior to 1986, all taxpayers, whether they itemized or not, could deduct charitable contributions from taxable income.
<p>
<dd>
As in the early 1980s, many analysts predicted a dramatic reduction in the amount of money donated to charitable organizations because of the lower marginal rates and the elimination of the above-the-line deduction. For example, <i>Philanthropy Monthly</i> published an article citing an Independent Sector report that charitable giving would decline by $8 billion because of the 1986 tax bill.<sup>26</sup>  However, charitable donations for 1987 totaled $90.3 billion, a 7.6 percent increase over 1986, and total giving in 1986 amounted to $83.9 billion, a 15 percent increase over 1985. In fact, total charitable donations increased (in inflation-adjusted terms) every year between 1983 and 1989.<sup>27</sup>  Far from the bleak outcome predicted by analysts, charitable contributions actually increased after enactment of the 1986 tax bill -- again, as a result of strong economic growth.
<p>
<b>3)  Not all charitable organizations would be affected equally.</b> While the aggregate level of giving is projected to increase under the flat tax, the change would affect different nonprofits in different ways. The degree to which a particular nonprofit shares in the benefits of the flat tax would depend on what service it provides and who its donors are.
<p>
<dd>
Human service/welfare organizations and religious congregations generally could expect to benefit the most from passage of the flat tax, primarily for two reasons. One is that individuals tend to see such donations as a basic obligation rather than as discretionary. The other reason is that the majority of donors to these activities are nonitemizers who would not be affected or dissuaded by the elimination of the charitable deduction but would be induced to give more thanks to increased after-tax income.
<p>
<dd>
Of all nonprofits, religious congregations have experienced the most constant support over time. They also enjoy the broadest base of support across all income brackets. Therefore, it can be expected that instead of being hurt by elimination of the charitable deduction, religious congregations will be helped significantly from increased income following from faster economic growth. In addition, 92 percent of religious congregations across the nation are engaged in social activities; in 1991, $2.4 billion was spent by religious congregations on human service projects. This form of social welfare thus would likely enjoy a significant increase in funding as a result of the flat tax.
<p>
<dd>
The effect on other nonprofits, such as universities, art and theater companies, and environmental groups, which are most dependent on donations from the wealthy, is unclear. On the one hand, it is primarily the wealthy who take advantage of the charitable deduction. Donations may decrease for this reason. On the other hand, elimination of the capital gains and estate taxes would allow wealthy individuals to donate more money during their working years rather than setting the money aside in a bequest or foundation. Donations might increase for this reason. In the long run, increased income as a result of lower taxes and increased economic growth will likely mean more donations for all non-profits, the arts, environment, and universities included.
<p>
<dd>
However, because after-tax personal income for all taxpayers would increase with a flat tax, those individuals who continue to donate would have more money to give. Moreover, the loss of charitable donations means only that nonprofits will be forced to innovate and raise money through new channels. This may include increasing entrance fees, designing new products (such as symphony recordings) for sale to the public, or refocusing fundraising activities. Again, one of the primary benefits of the flat tax is that it removes special treatments from the tax code. Thus, nonprofits will have to innovate for funds just as private firms are expected to react to changes in the economic environment.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</b>
<p>
<dd>
Although aggregate giving would increase with passage of a flat tax, many questions surrounding elimination of the charitable deduction remain, both because the nonprofit sector is so diverse and because the deduction has become so ingrained in the federal income tax code and in the minds and emotions of so many donors. For example, what about giving from non-individuals such as companies and foundations?  Why endure the political pain to maintain just this one deduction?  Why elimination and not some alternative?
<p><blockquote>
<b>Why not keep just the deduction for charitable contributions? </b>
<p>
<dd>
One of the most important features of the flat tax is that it does not favor one activity over another. No one action is treated "better" under a flat tax than any other. Including the charitable deduction would violate this important feature. "As long as people make gifts, even to worthy causes, primarily because they are tax deductible and not because that cause is passionately important to them," writes <i>World Magazine</i> publisher Joel Belz, "both the tax code and the government behind it are way too important. Yes, we may lose a few gifts to our charitable organizations -- but in the end, both we and they will breathe so much more deeply of the great air of freedom that it will be a good trade."<sup>28</sup>  Including any deductions, even the deduction for charitable contributions, in a flat tax plan breaches the equality principle and opens the door for increased government activism. The federal tax code should be used to raise money, not influence behavior.
<p>
<dd>
Also, the best excuse for the next income tax deduction is the last one. Once the door is open for some special interest, as important as that interest may be, other interest groups will be knocking at the door for their own income tax deduction.
<p>
<dd>
Finally, retaining the deduction for charitable contributions, as with any other deduction, would necessitate a higher flat tax rate to raise the same amount of revenue as a pure flat tax. Assuming a revenue neutral flat tax is passed, including the charitable deduction would require a rate that is 0.8 percentage points higher than otherwise would be necessary without the deduction. This would hurt disproportionately those people who do not find it advantageous to claim the charitable contribution deduction, forcing them to pay higher taxes to subsidize those who are able to take the deduction. Lower-income individuals, in other words, would wind up subsidizing the activities of wealthier individuals.
<p>
<b>What about charitable bequests and elimination of the estate tax? </b>
<p>
<dd>
Many analysts believe that individuals no longer would have an incentive to leave money to charities if such donations were no longer tax-deductible. Instead, the argument goes, people would leave all of their money to their children or other non-charitable causes, and nonprofits will lose a valuable source of revenue.
<p>
<dd>
This view overlooks several important points. One is that only a small fraction of charitable contributions (6.7 percent) results from bequests. Even a drastic reduction of 30 percent in bequest giving would reduce overall giving by only 2 percent. The increased economic growth likely under a flat tax would more than make up for this shortfall.
<p>
<dd>
Economic theory traditionally has suggested two ways of looking at how households decide what to do with lifetime savings and bequests. The life cycle hypothesis, first advanced by MIT Nobel Laureate Franco Modigliani, maintains that households act to accumulate savings which they plan to exhaust in their own lifetimes. At the end of their lives, a "residual" sum may be left which can be willed to either children, charities, or others depending on the cost of leaving money to these various individuals or groups. The current tax on bequests to persons and institutions other than nonprofits acts to encourage giving to charities and to discourage bequests to relatives, according to this theory. Thus, eliminating the estate tax would decrease the amount bequeathed to charities.
<p>
<dd>
The other major approach to analyzing household behavior is the permanent income or overlapping generations theory, commonly credited to University of Chicago Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman. This theory maintains that households do not plan to consume all of their personal savings during their own lifetimes; instead, they expect to pass some savings on to their children so they may enjoy an adequate level of income, and only what is left over after this paternal bequest can be considered a "residual" and used to support charities. Under this theory, the current tax on bequests to family members serves to reduce contributions to charitable organizations. Thus, eliminating the estate tax will increase the residual available for charitable bequests.
<p>
<dd>
In the last 15 years, professional economic research has tended overwhelmingly to verify that the permanent income/overlapping generations motive has dominated household saving and bequest behavior in the United States.<sup>29</sup>  Therefore, any public policy that increases the amount of savings available to households will increase the "residual" left to charitable organizations as well. The flat tax, accompanied by elimination of the charitable contribution deduction and estate tax, would do just that.
<p>
<b>What about grants from charitable foundations?</b>
<p>
<dd>
As mentioned above, foundations exist for many reasons. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the effect a flat tax will have on any individual foundation or on the decision of a particular individual to create a foundation. It is possible, however, to make some generalizations.
<p>
<dd>
First, many foundations are created for reasons wholly outside the tax code. They may be a more convenient way for many individual donors to pool their gifts and fund projects, as is the case with community foundations. Or individuals may establish a foundation to remove themselves from the day-to-day operation of charitable activities. Whatever these non-tax reasons may be -- and they are as unique as foundations themselves -- a change in the federal income tax code would have little impact on their existence and activities.
<p>
<dd>
The second reason for the existence of foundations is to gain a tax advantage. For example, the Tax Reform Act of 1984 made equities donated to foundations tax deductible at their present market value. Thus individuals can create a foundation, donate equities, and receive a tax benefit while retaining control over the ultimate destination of the donations. Other tax incentives include avoiding the estate tax or significant capital gains taxes. It is quite accurate to believe that the flat tax would have a significant impact on the structure of foundations from this tax perspective. However, the exact and total effect is not clear. For example, removal of the estate tax likely would increase donations while elimination of the 1984 law likely would work in the opposite direction. Furthermore, even if a flat tax were to remove one reason for the creation of a foundation by an individual, it does not follow that the total contributions by the individual would decline. With fewer tax considerations to take into account, the individual might simply make larger contributions directly to organizations during his or her working life.
<p>
<dd>
To the extent that existing foundations might be affected by a flat tax, the primary concern would be whether the legislation contained "fine print" to ensure fair treatment. For example, the excise tax that foundations currently pay on investment income should be reclassified for what it really is: a capital gains tax. This tax would be eliminated with the passage of a flat tax. 
<p>
<b>What would happen to corporate giving? </b>
<p>
<dd>
There is no reason to believe that corporate giving would decrease with passage of a flat tax. While there are many reasons why corporations make donations, the overriding reason is to assist the company in making money for their employees and stockholders. The primary reason that corporations donate to charity and support charitable causes, therefore, is to increase their image within the community. Alternatively, corporations engage in quasi-charitable activities that offer a "community-friendly" venue for advertisements: sponsoring a community parade, for example, or donating goods and services to local schools or active community groups. Finally, corporations may make donations because it is an opportunity to increase the image of their products. That companies offer computers to universities is a good example of this last point. These incentives to engage in charitable activity will not disappear with passage of the flat tax.
<p>
<dd>
In fact, it is likely that charitable contributions from corporations would increase as corporate profits increase under the flat tax. Noted Harvard economist Dale Jorgensen has estimated that general economic activity would increase by 9 percent with passage of the flat tax.<sup>30</sup>  As the general economy grows and corporate profits increase, companies will have larger budgets; thus, even the same percentage of giving would yield increased amounts of charitable contributions.
<p>
<b>Are there any alternatives to the charitable contribution deduction that would be compatible with a flat tax?</b>
<p>
<dd>
There are several alternatives to outright elimination of the charitable contribution deduction. Each one is better than maintaining the full deduction with a flat tax, but each one also has significant drawbacks.
<p>
<dd>
Senator Dan Coats (R-IN) and other lawmakers have put forth the idea of a dollar-per-dollar tax credit for charitable donations of up to $500 for individual taxpayers ($1,000 for married persons filing jointly). The credit would be limited to contributions to human service charities. Taxpayers would have to forego the $500 but could either donate the money to a private charity and take the tax credit or simply pay the taxes, in which case the money would be spent by the federal government. In effect, taxpayers could "vote" on whether private social welfare organizations or the federal government should spend $500 of the money they currently pay in taxes.
<p>
<dd>
Senator Coats has proposed this approach within the context of the current tax code. The credit would supersede the present deduction, which would be available only for contributions made above and beyond the $500 ceiling ($1,000 for married persons filing jointly). However, the $500 charitable credit could be joined with the flat tax in place of the deduction. This would be superior to maintaining the deduction but would still have several drawbacks. For example, the credit would infringe on the integrity of a pure flat tax. Any deduction, credit, or other loophole would open the door for future deductions, credits, or loopholes.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Also, unless the $500 credit was offset by equal reductions in federal welfare spending, a higher tax rate would be necessary. Such a spending reduction mechanism is not included in Senator Coats's proposal.
<p>
<dd>
Another idea is to limit the income tax deduction to contributions made to human service organizations. This proposal, which is included in the Coats legislation, would have the advantage of focusing donations where they are most needed: on the sorts of private "welfare-oriented" efforts that many expect will "pick up the slack" as federal welfare programs are streamlined. At the same time, a targeted tax deduction would eliminate the subsidy by all taxpayers of activities, such as the arts and private universities, that are enjoyed primarily by the wealthy.
<p>
<dd>
There are, however, several drawbacks to a targeted deduction. It would require a higher tax rate, although not as high as would be required if the full deduction were retained. All taxpayers would face a higher tax burden, with only a portion of taxpayers receiving a reduction in return. Maintaining any charitable deduction may also lead to other exemptions and loopholes. Once again, including any deduction, even the deduction for charitable contributions, conflicts with the flat tax principle of fairness and opens the door for increased government activism, perhaps not in such a desirable direction. Finally, there would have to another layer of complex regulations to differentiate between "human service" organizations and other charitable activities.
</blockquote><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
<dd>
Any public policy must have a clearly defined goal. The task then becomes one of reaching that goal most efficiently and completely. In the case of the charitable contribution deduction, the goal is to encourage private giving to private organizations engaged in socially beneficial activities. It is unclear, however, that the current tax structure with a charitable contribution deduction is the most efficient way to reach that goal. Far more effective would be a flat income tax with a single low rate and no deductions. Historical evidence and statistical analysis demonstrate that giving to nonprofit organizations will not decline with passage of the flat tax. In fact, donations likely will increase slightly because of higher economic growth.
<p>
<dd>
The flat tax, by increasing economic growth and removing 24 million Americans from the federal income tax rolls, itself serves as a charitable program. All Americans, especially those at lower income levels, will realize more economic opportunities and lower taxes. The flat tax will give individuals the freedom to make their own decisions on how to spend their own money without fear of being penalized through the federal income tax structure. These benefits will do more for individual Americans than any nonprofit organization -- and certainly more than any federal government program -- ever can.
<p>
<b>TECHNICAL APPENDIX</b>
<p>
<dd>
Heritage analysts estimate that the amount of money donated to charities each year under the flat tax would be about 3.8 percent more than would have been donated under the current system. This figure assumes the following:
<p><ul>
<li>A final flat income tax rate of 17 percent.
<p>
<li>
An immediate and lasting increase in after-tax personal income of 2.3 percent. This is a static estimate based on the Internal Revenue Service public use tape from tax year 1992 (the latest year for which data were available) and does not include any increased income that may arise as the result of higher economic growth under the flat tax.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>
An additional increase in economic output of 9 percent annually after a two-year transition period. This is taken from testimony delivered by Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, who estimated the effect of moving from the current income tax system to a consumption-based system.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<li>
A price elasticity of -0.44 and an income elasticity of +1.00. The price elasticity is an average of the price elasticities found in time series and panel data studies cited in the work of Richard Steinberg, Associate Professor of Economics at Indiana University. The 11 studies cited by Steinberg generated an average fall in contributions of 0.44 percent for every 1 percent increase in the "tax price" of giving faced by individuals.<sup>34</sup>  The income elasticity was derived from historic data across the income spectrum indicating that as income increases by 1 percent, charitable donations also increase by 1 percent.<sup>35</sup>
</ul>
<p>
<dd>
An important feature of this estimate is that, unlike other work, it takes into account the use of the charitable contribution deduction for purposes of fraudulent tax evasion. For example, economist Joel Slemrod, Professor of Business Economics and Public Policy at the University of Michigan Business School, has reported that approximately 7.2 percent of reported donations in one large sample were found to be false following intensive auditing by the Internal Revenue Service.<sup>36</sup>  The IRS data on itemized contributions are modified to reflect this finding.
<p>
<dd>
Econometric studies based on a single time period were excluded from this analysis. There is a growing professional consensus that such cross-sectional studies (which examine differences in giving between individuals in a single time period) are characterized by a number of fundamental methodological flaws.
<p>
<dd>
First, the suitability of these studies, which rely on evidence from a static snapshot of the economy at a single point in time, for examining the dynamic effect of changes in taxes and income on charitable contributions over a number of time periods is dubious. Time series and panel data studies examine the effect of taxes and income on giving over a number of successive time periods and hence appear more suitable in this respect.
<p>
<dd>
Second, cross-sectional econometric studies fall victim to the problem of multi-colinearity. Econometric regressions can separate out the individual effects of changes in tax rates and income on giving only when there are independent variations in these two variables. In a single year, the tax price (income tax rate) of giving faced by an individual is determined solely by his or her income and hence does not vary independently.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
<dd>
Given these problems, the emerging consensus of a decade ago that changes in tax policies have significant effects on giving has been shattered. This consensus was based almost wholly on static cross-sectional (and therefore flawed) studies. Much of the new dynamic econometric evidence suggests that the link between the level of giving and tax incentives is highly questionable at best.

<li>    Many fundraisers and analysts are concerned with the effect a flat tax will have on donations from the "super rich" because these donations tend to provide the "marginal" income for some nonprofits.

As important as these marginal donations are, they are not the main subject of this paper; this paper addresses charitable giving in general.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

You know and I know that Americans will file lawsuits over
almost everything.  Some of the lawsuits involving our schools
prove that point beyond all doubt.  In a case that went all the
way to the Supreme Court, a New York school system failed in its
attempt to require that a high school Bible club -- now get this
-- include non-Christians among its officers.  The Club members
are overjoyed.  Now they can pursue their mission, which is to
bring together young people who believe that the Bible is the
inspired word of God.

<p>

The school system thought that any such requirement was bound
to be unconstitutional.  They were joined by the usual suspects,
including the left-wing group, People for the American Way.  They
suggested that allowing Christians to meet on their own terms
somehow violates the separation of church and state.  It seems
to me that the opposite is what's obviously true.  A school that
will not allow a student Bible club to define its by-laws is clearly
interfering with those students' fundamental religious freedom.

<p>

Our Supreme Court has now sided with the students.  For once,
the High Court has done the right thing.

<p>

1) CBS reporter Rita Braver doesn't want anyone to think
Republicans aren't just as guilty as Democrats when it come to
fundraising. On Sunday's Face the Nation (December 15), Braver
filled in for Bob Schieffer.
<BR>
<DD>
    Braver asked Gloria Borger of U.S. News & World Report: "We
counted this week, there are eleven different congressional
committees looking at Democratic fundraising, that's not to say
the Republicans don't have some problems, but that sounds like
it's going to be a pretty serious, time consuming issue."
<BR>
<DD>
    Borger responded by noting that "Today, on the front page of
The Washington Post, is a story about how the White House, as one
person said, has essentially become a Motel 6, renting out the
Lincoln Bedroom, giving it to people who are big contributors to
the party. This doesn't look good."
<BR>
<DD>
    Braver countered: "Is this any different than what happened,
because it seemed to me that I would over the years in Washington
run into some big, when Republicans were President, contributor
who'd say 'oh yeah, we spent the last night in the Lincoln
Bedroom.'"
<BR>
<DD>
    Borger disagreed with Braver's "everybody does it" line: "I
think it's more frequent though, I really do."
<P>
<a name="2">
2) Speaking of Sunday's Washington Post story, it didn't
exactly generate a lot of television news. The front page Post
story detailed how major contributors to the Democratic National
Committee are thanked with an overnight stay in the White House:
"The White House refuses to release guest lists, but three weeks
of logs turned over to Congress suggest the guest quarters were
in regular use." The Post story asserted: "So many big-money
donors have slept at the White House in recent years that one
Clinton fundraiser likens the executive mansion to a Motel 6."
<BR>
<DD>
Football killed NBC Nightly News in Washington, but neither
ABC's World News Sunday nor the CBS Evening News mentioned a word
December 15. Rita Braver filed a piece on the Chinese finding a
downed American plane from WWII. And CBS found time for a long
story from Jacqueline Adams on the discovery of a gene in the
fruit fly that controls sex and when altered causes male flies to
become bi-sexual.
<P>
<a name="3">
3) ABC, CBS and CNN fought to land top Clinton aide George
Stephanopoulos, but ABC News won the battle. The just-departed
Senior Adviser to the President will have a far greater role at
ABC than Bill Kristol, the former chief of staff for Vice
President Dan Quayle. While the Clintonite will spar with
conservative Kristol in discussions on This Week and Good Morning
America, The New York Times noted he also "is expected to do some
reporting as a correspondent." He'll produce longer pieces for GMA. 
<BR>
<DD>
How far were the other networks willing to go? As with ABC,
well beyond any position offered to former Reagan or Bush
administration political operatives. "A CNN source said
yesterday," The Washington Post's John Carmody reported December
12, "the cable network had been prepared to offer Stephanopoulos
his own weekend half-hour program and some other 'innovative
programming ideas.'" CBS News proposed a slot on Face the Nation
and a role in its upcoming Eye on People cable channel.
Carmody noted that ABC hopes "that if things go well,
Stephanopoulos's role can be expanded to include doing some
full-length programming for ABC-owned cable channels like Arts &
Entertainment and, particularly, the History Channel, where, said
Senior News Vice President Joanna Bistany yesterday, 'he can
explore the issues.'" If that's not enough, he'll "be available
in 1998 for political coverage."

4) On ABC's World News Tonight on December 11 anchor Peter
Jennings introduced a story, as transcribed by MRC intern Joe
Alfonsi: "Now to children and poverty. There is a study today by
a private research group called the National Center for Children
in Poverty which believes that the government's official poverty
level is too low. And they find a disturbing trend about how and
where children are hurting."
<BR>
<DD>
Reporter Rebecca Chase began: "During the last fifteen years
this study found the number of children under the age of six
living in poverty grew from 3.5 million to 6.1 million. That's
one in every four children. And when families living on the edge
of poverty are included, using a cutoff of $28,000 a year for a
family of four, nearly half of all young children are living in
or near poverty. This means the United States has the highest
child poverty rate among industrialized nations."
<BR>
<DD>
Larry Aber of the National Center for Children in Poverty
then charged: "At the period of time when human beings are in
their most formative stages, we have the highest child poverty 
rates. We have the highest poverty rates. And we also make the
least public investments at that stage in life."
<BR>
<DD>
Of course the higher the income you define as poverty the
greater the number of children you can claim live in poverty. I
bet $28,000 -- about twice the official poverty level income for
a family of four -- goes a long way in many parts of the country.
And no word on whether the liberal group counted non-cash
benefits, such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing.
<P>

5) In his new book titled "The Empty Church: The Suicide of
Liberal Christianity," Thomas Reeves argues that mainline
churches are becoming irrelevant as they cave into liberal
interest groups. Reviewing the book for the November 28 Boston
Globe, reporter Diego Ribadeneira was none too pleased with this
contention. He concluded: "For all their faults, mainline
denominations still lend an important moral voice to a nation
that seems to have become more mean-spirited toward the poor,
minorities, immigrants and gays. This moral dimension of liberal
Christianity is one Reeves fails to address."

6) With the assistance of 57 judges across the country who
completed ballots in which they chose the first, second and third
best quotes in 18 categories, the MRC has just published THE BEST

<P>
Here are a few of the winners:
<ul>
<li><B>Good Morning Morons Award</B>
<BR>
"You write that you prayed more during your four years in office
than basically at any time in your life and yet I think it's fair
to say, and I hope this doesn't sound too harsh, I think it's
fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the more
ineffective Presidents of modern times....What do you think, if
anything, that says about the power of prayer?" <I>-- Bryant Gumbel
interviewing Jimmy Carter about his new book, Living Faith,
November 18 Today. [85 points]</I>
<li><B>Fear of the Competition Award (for Impugning Talk Radio)</B>
<BR>
<I>NBC's Bryant Gumbel:</I> "You mention talk radio. They [relatives of
Oklahoma bombing victims] have some very hard feelings about talk
radio and the hate being spewed by some of those on the far end
of the spectrum."
<br>
<dd>
<I>Bill Moyers:</I> "If anything, talk radio in that part of the world
is more anti-government today than ever. The airwaves are
saturated with hostility, it's just an unremitting vilification
of government. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, the
government makes mistakes and there are justifiable grievances
against government. But this is, this goes beyond that, it's
excessive. And these people take it like salt in the wound. They
drive around, they turn on their radio, they hear some vicious
attack on government, and they think, `You know, if you strike
the government, you kill my daughter.'" <I>-- Bill Moyers on the
April 12 Today promoting that night's Dateline on the families of
and victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. [105 points]</I>
<li><B>Damn Those Conservatives Award</B>
<BR>
"By being so nice to Pat Buchanan and treating him as a good guy
with bad policies, are we not all guilty of legitimizing his
views and putting a smiling face on a hateful voice?"<I> -- Today's
Bryant Gumbel on what he asked the show's political roundtable
off-air, quoted by Peter Johnson, Feb. 22 USA Today. [57]</I>
<li><B>If the Bias Fits, We Won't Admit Award (for Bias Denial)</B>
<BR>
"When you're talking about pure journalists, I mean reporters,
when you're talking about reporters, not columnists, I don't
think there's any liberal bias. I don't think there really ever
has been." <B>-- Los Angeles Times Senior Washington correspondent
Jack Nelson on CNBC's Politics '96, March 9. [71 points]</B>
<li><B>Quote of the Year</B>
<BR>
"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were `guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven
to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error."  --
<B>Chicago Tribune correction, September 5. [88 points]</B>
</ul>
<a name="7">
7) The 1996-97 Family Guide to Prime Time Television is now
available from the Parents Television Council (PTC), a special
project of the Media Research Center. The 40-page booklet
provides a comprehensive study of this year's network prime time
fare -- from a family values perspective. The booklet evaluates
over 90 network shows, giving a green, yellow or red light to
each show based upon the appropriateness for children. If you
watched Face the Nation on Sunday you saw Dick Wolf, the
Executive Producer of NBC's Law & Order, attack the PTC's effort
to alert parents to TV content.

8) Last weekend liberal columnist Carl Rowan, who in his
new book tagged as "haters" everyone from Howard Stern to Rush
Limbaugh to Newt Gingrich to liberal columnist Richard Cohen,
made his last appearance on Inside Washington. Seen on PBS
stations around the country, the show is produced at Gannett-owned 
WUSA-TV in Washington, D.C. While panelists on shows like
the McLaughlin Group are paid a few hundred dollars per
appearance, Rowan had a bit of a better deal. 
<BR>
<DD>
Rowan is leaving because negotiations broke down over a new
contract. The December 13 Washington Post reported that Gannett
"insisted he take a 65 percent pay cut in his annual salary of
$123,00 and that he work without a contract."
<BR>
<DD>
$2,500 a week for a half hour show. Not a bad gig while it
lasted.

<title>Daily Commentary - December 18, 1996</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
December 18, 1996</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Our oldest daughter Elyse is home for the holidays.  She attends
William and Mary College and, from what I can tell, is getting
an excellent education.  At least her mother and I hope so.

<p>

But each passing day brings more signs that all's not well
in higher education.  For one thing, college after college is
expelling a man named William Shakespeare.  Old Bill has no peer
among English poets and playwrights, but it seems our campuses
are still bent on tossing him overboard.  A new report says that
only 23 of the nation's 70 leading universities require English
majors to read Shakespeare.  Even more worrisome is what's replacing
him.  At one college, it's gangster movies.  At others it is courses
on AIDS activism, carnivals, CD-ROMs, homophobia, Madonna, the
socialist struggle and, believe it or not, theme parks.

<p>

Let me say the obvious.  Parents scrimp and save to send
their children to college, so they can lift themselves higher
on the ladder of knowledge.  Instead, many colleges are offering
courses no high school would have dared offer 20 years ago.  That,
as William Shakespeare would put it, is a tragedy.

<p>

For the Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with
today's Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call

<title>An Antidote To Global Poverty -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>AN ANTIDOTE TO GLOBAL POVERTY</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 15, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The economic success of the so-called Four Tigers of Asia -- Hong Kong, 
Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan -- is almost legendary. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Hong Kong, for example, the per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) has increased from $2,279 in 1965 to $22,527 in 1995 -- a tenfold jump. In the Republic of China on Taiwan the increase was equally dramatic: from $1,133 to $13,235. This is extraordinary progress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, such economic success is by no means universal. During the same 30-year period many other less-developed countries have stagnated or declined economically. In our own backyard, Haiti's per-capita GDP was $360 in 1965; by 1994 it was down to $225. Peru's per-capita GDP fell from $1,137 to $1,103. And Niger's was down from $617 to $272, a staggering 60 percent decline. (All numbers are expressed in constant 1987 dollars.) 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This raises an obvious question: Why do some economies blossom and flower, while others whither on the economic vine?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer, while obvious in one sense, is not what typically comes to mind. Contrary to pupular belief, a country's economic success does not depend on its possession of, or access to, inexpensive natural resources, such as oil, on how productive its farmland is, or on the rate at which new technology is introduced into its economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While these can be important, they are not the key. Hong Kong, for example, must import all the raw materials and energy it uses, has no arable land to speak of, and was no more advanced technologically than any other developing country 30 years ago. Yet its economy has boomed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By contrast, 10 percent of the land in the West African nation of Gabon is arable and the country is a major source of diamonds. But its economy is a basket case. Indeed, at $2,770, Gabon's per-capita GDP was larger than Hong Kong's in 1965. Today, however, it is about one-sixth the size of Hong Kong's. What accounts for this?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is economic freedom. All of the countries that have graduated from the under-developed world to the developed world in the past 20 years -- Chile, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan -- have free economies. Gabon, Haiti, Niger and Peru have unfree economies, as do most other countries around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The correlation between economic freedom and prosperity is clearly demonstrated by the <a href="/heritage/index">"The Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal Index of Economic Freedom."</a> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To conduct this study, we rated each of 150 countries on 10 economic factors that -- depending on the policies the countries pursue -- can either encourage or serve as an impediment to economic growth and wealth creation. Specifically, we looked at their banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and price policies; the size of their government sectors; property rights; regulatory restrictions; and black market activity, a "negative indicator" showing that something is amiss elsewhere in the economy. 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Each country was given a rating of one to five in each category, one being the best, five the worst. The individual scores were then added up and averaged. Each country's average score on the "Index of Economic Freedom" was then overlayed on a grid showing the country's per-capita GDP. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What we found was more than a coincidence. In short: Virtually all of the countries with the highest per-capita income levels, or the most rapidly growing economies, were those with the best (i.e. lowest) scores on the "Index." Conversely, the poorest countries -- places like Angola, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Mozambique, North Korea and Sudan -- have the worst scores on the "Index." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What does this mean in terms of global poverty? We asked economist <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, the former chief economist of Sprint Corp., to answer this question.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beach chose as his example the People's Republic of Bangladesh, a South Asian country of 128 million residents whose per-capita GDP last year was just $1,290 -- less than half of what Gabon's was 30 years ago.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the Bangladesh economy -- which ranks in the bottom quarter on the "Index" -- continues to "grow" at its current rate, Beach found, Bengali living standards won't reach the level currently enjoyed by the western nations for another 102 years. If, on the other hand, Bangladesh frees its economy and it can achieve a rate of growth equal to the "Four Tigers" of Asia, the Bengali people could be living as well as Americans do today in just 40 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Poverty is not a natural state for any country. It is largely a condition imposed on people by ill-conceived and repressive economic policies. Free up the latent economic energies of poor nations, and prosperity will follow.

<title>Foreign Aid Fallacies -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>FOREIGN AID FALLACIES</h3>
by <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 15, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bureaucrats and consultants who profit from America's $12 billion-per-year foreign-aid program argue that U.S. assistance is vital to the economic well-being of the world's less-fortunate. This argument is both self-serving and ignorant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Self-serving because approximately 70 cents out of every foreign-aid dollar never makes it overseas: It funds the very bureaucracy so piously arguing for preserving foreign aid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ignorant because many poor countries around the world have been on the American dole for decades; yet, a substantial number of them are poorer today than when it all began. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why? Because global poverty is largely a condition imposed on people by their governments. While climate, culture, education, infrastructure, land arability, natural resources, technological innovation, and other factors all may contribute to a country's economic success, no country can succeed in the long run unless it has a free economy -- even if it receives buckets of U.S. aid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider this: Of the 77 countries with the most repressed economies in the world, 34 have been receiving U.S. foreign aid for periods ranging from 35 years to 52 years. Of these 34 countries, 13 are poorer today than they were in 1965 and 10 others are just as poor as they were three decades ago. If foreign assistance was an effective development tool, every one of the 34 countries should have shown some improvement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Look at Somalia. The Clinton administration has argued that cutting foreign aid to less-developed countries would produce "more Somalias." If this is meant to imply that Somalia is an economic basket case because it hasn't received enough U.S. aid, that's nonsense. Somalia has received nearly $1 billion in U.S. foreign aid over the last 41 years. Because the country has one of the world's least-free economies, however, the $1 billion has done little for Somalia, except, perhaps, line the pockets of Somali bureaucrats and overlords. Somalia's gross domestic product (GDP), meanwhile, was $123 per capita in 1965; in 1993 -- after some 40 years on the U.S. dole -- it was down to $111 per capita.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Closer to home, Haiti has been receiving U.S. foreign aid for 52 years. During its half-a-century on the dole, Haiti has received more than $1 billion from the United States, not including the money we spent on our 1994 military operation to "restore democracy" in Haiti and the additional money we're now spending to protect the current regime. How has Haiti benefitted? In 1965, Haiti's per capita GDP was $360; in 1994 it was $225. (All numbers are taken from the 1996 World Bank report, "World Data 1995 on CD ROM," and are expressed in constant 1987 dollars.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Peru is another case in point. Peru has received nearly $2 billion in U.S. aid over the last 52 years. It's per-capita GDP has fallen from $1,137 in 1965 to $1,103 in 1994.
A similar story can be seen in Niger, which has pocketed more than $500 million in U.S. assistance, only to see its per-capita wealth decline more than 60 percent, from $617 in 1965 to $272 in 1994.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These are, admittedly, extreme (though not rare) cases. Some aid recipients have increased their wealth -- but it's despite the foreign aid, not because of it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	My colleague <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, the former chief economist of Sprint Corp., Kansas City, uses sophisticated computer-modeling techniques to illustrate the point. In his chapter in the recently published <a href="/heritage/index">1997 edition</a> of the "Heritage Foundation/Wall Street Journal Index of Economic Freedom," Beach looked at the South Asian country of Bangladesh -- and what its economic future would look like under various scenarios.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While the country's economy is not the most repressed in the world -- that honor is shared by Cuba, Laos and North Korea -- it currently ranks in the bottom third on the Index of Economic Freedom, 118th out of the 150 countries rated. The result of Bangladesh's high tax rates, closed trade policy, and highly regulated economy was a meager 2.1 percent average annual growth rate during the period 1980-1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many other countries -- all of them with freer economies than Bangladesh's -- did much better. For example, Botswana's economy is one of the freest in sub-Saharan Africa, earning it a ranking of 59th on the list of 150 countries I studied. Botswana's economy grew at an average rate of 6.2 percent from 1980 to 1993. South Korea's economy (27th on the list) grew at an average annual rate of 8.2 percent. And Thailand's (23rd) grew at 6.4 percent per year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beach posed the following question: "What would happen if Bangladesh implemented [free-market] policies that enabled it to grow at the same long-term rates experienced" by Botswana, S. Korea and Thailand? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If Bangladesh simply stays the course, and continues to grow at just over 2 percent per year, Beach's calculations show that it would take Bangladesh 50 years to raise its living standards to that of contemporary Brazil (which ranks 94th on the Index) -- and 102 years to reach America's current standard of living. However, Beach found, if Bangladesh reforms its economy and can achieve long-term growth rates equal to Botswana's and Thailand's, in just 25 years it could raise its living standards "roughly" to the levels currently enjoyed by such European nations as Spain and Portugal, and in 40 years could be where America is today.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While short-term economic assistance can help newly independent countries develop commercial codes and achieve other concrete goals, the foreign assistance program that has been a staple of U.S. foreign policy for the past 50 years has achieved few lasting successes, and frequently does more harm than good by delaying needed economic reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The next time Congress reviews U.S. foreign aid, it should face up to the fact that U.S. assistance rarely helps the poor. Only economic freedom can truly end the wrenching poverty that continues to plague the world.

<title>Daily Commentary - December 16, 1996</title>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Bill Clinton gave a speech the other day, and it reminded
me of one of the first principles of modern politics.  The President
used some of the same rhetoric that he employed so successfully
during the campaign.  He declared himself &quot;for&quot; a long
list of mainstream values:  stronger families, leaner government,
crackdowns on criminals, welfare reform, and a balanced budget.
Who can argue with that?  With politicians of every stripe embracing
these ideas, why is it our society seems to slip ever further
away from them?

<p>

The answer is simple.  In politics, watch what our leaders
do, not what they say.  Let me repeat that -- watch what they
do, not only what they say.  If it's the president, watch his
appointments to the federal bench and to the Cabinet.  If it's
the Congress, watch the people they regularly confirm for the
courts.

<p>

Today, when nearly everyone styles himself as &quot;pro-family,&quot; 
it's even more essential than ever to keep ours eyes fixed
on the bottom line.  Let's make 1997 the year of pro-family deeds,
not just words.

<p>

Watch out, the Politically Correct battalions are riding high
again.  They're back at the Smithsonian Institution.  This time,
they say they merely want to <I>update</I> some outmoded military
displays at the Museum of American History.

<p>

This is the same line we heard when they turned the fiftieth
anniversary of Hiroshima into an anti-American exhibit.  Last
year, the liberals' plans provoked a firestorm of protest from
veterans and their families.  In our schools, the Goals 2000 history
standards would have kids know about Madonna and the Simpsons,
but dropped Paul Revere, Albert Einstein and the U.S. landing
on the Moon.

<p>

The Smithsonian is a very popular tourist attraction in Washington.
That's because Americans know they can come here and see such
wonders as the flag that inspired <I>The Star-Spangled Banner</I>.
But the Smithsonian's politically correct staffers are often
ashamed of their nation's heritage.  They're unwilling to defend
it.  So we must honor our country's past.  And let's give thanks
to veterans and their patriotic supporters. They are keeping Paul
Revere's heritage alive.

<h2>The Market's Medical Miracles</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The critics of corporate America would have us believe that it has poorly served the health-care needs of the American people. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, for one, claims that corporations have a moral duty to provide "health-care protections" to their employees. Perhaps that is because the debate in recent years has focused almost exclusively on gaps in our employment-based system of health insurance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most of us, it is true, have at least part of our medical bills paid by health plans provided by our employers. While the debate about employee health insurance is an important one, it doesn't account for the greatest contributions of free enterprise to U.S. medical care. When corporations create wealth and address human needs through innovation and productivity, they contribute to the health of Americans in ways at least as important as providing health insurance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Within the health-care industry, profit-seeking companies have generated tremendous innovations in recent years in such areas as cancer treatment, disease prevention, and computer-assisted diagnostic tools. In cases such as heart surgery, knee surgery, and the removal of gall bladders and hernias, devices and techniques pioneered by American firms and researchers have  reduced or eliminated hospital stays and reduced invasiveness, pain, and recovery time. From 1985 to 1989 alone, the percentage of surgeries performed outside hospitals increased from 37 percent to more than 50 percent.<p>

</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	America's competitive impulse generates medical innovation not only for American consumers but for the entire world. About half the world's output of medical devices occurs in the United States, and private research and development spending by U.S. pharmaceutical and device manufacturers dwarfs that of other nations. And despite the fact that other countries with less market-oriented economies benefit from U.S. medical innovations, Americans still enjoy more access to quality health care than virtually any other nation, according to studies by the journal <i>Health Affairs</i> and others.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Medical research in the United States, whether in private laboratories or universities, is predominantly funded by corporations with an interest in developing products and studying diseases. Nine of every 10 useful new drugs come from private pharmaceutical firms, not the government. In the area of biotechnology alone, private investors have spent more than $10 billion in the past decade bankrolling hundreds of new companies. "No other nation on Earth could have generated so much capital to launch biotechnology companies," James Vincent, the chairman and CEO of Biogen, has said. "It's because no other nation has the free-market system of risk and reward that America does."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's one typical example: Genentech, one of the nation's leading biotechnology companies, is currently seeking government approval for a drug that treats acute stroke by dissolving blood clots. This single drug, called TPA, will help reduce the debilitating effects of a condition that affects 400,000 Americans each year and is the leading cause of adult disability, often leading to paralysis and loss of vision or speech. No other treatment exists. TPA is already administered to some 135,000 heart patients because of its benefits for that condition. Yes, Genentech makes a lot of money from TPA -- $300 million in 1995. Marketing the drug to treat strokes will probably add another $100 million in annual sales. But many who suffer from heart disease and stroke no doubt view the drug's $2,200 yearly cost to be worth it.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More importantly, Genentech's success exemplifies the payoff for addressing a critical human health need. Its example makes it all the more likely that other profit-seeking individuals or firms will ameliorate or cure other major medical conditions in the future. It's the profit motive, not native intelligence or the existence of government programs, that has made the United States the world leader in inventions, patents, and discoveries.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most persuasive case for deploying free enterprise to meet America's health-care needs can be found in routine eye care, which is typically not covered by insurance. Eyeglasses, contact lenses, and eye examinations cost less today in real terms than ever before, particularly when the increased quality of eye care is factored into the equation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a 50-year career in optometry, entrepreneur Bob Morrison has contributed significantly to this development. In 1963, while working in a basement lab, Morrison helped fashion the first soft contact lenses, then patented them with two other scientists. At one time, Morrison's firm was making every soft lens sold in the U.S. His rights to the technology were later sold to Bausch & Lomb, but Morrison went on to develop and make other lenses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1991, Morrison's trip to the Middle East inspired yet another venture. At a bazaar, reports <i>Business Week</i>, Morrison saw a rugmaker arguing with his children. The kids wanted their father to retire, Morrison's interpreter explained, because he was making so many mistakes on the rugs. Morrison realized that the man, only 42, was gaffe-prone because he could hardly see. He needed glasses but couldn't afford them.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To meet the universal need for low-cost optical care, Morrison and his son created Instant Eyeglasses -- prescription glasses that can be assembled in minutes and sold for about $20 a pair, compared to the average retail cost of $135. Instead of custom-made lenses for each set of frames, Morrison uses prefabricated lenses that fit into frames that can be snapped together and adjusted to fit any face. With only 152 lenses, rotated to various positions within the standard frames, Instant Eyeglasses can fill 26,000 prescriptions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But contributions to health don't come only from the health-care industry. Oil companies, for example, have vastly improved the health status of people around the world. Innovation in plastics and other petrochemicals have made possible mass inoculations (with hypodermic needles), surgical devices, life-support systems, artificial limbs and organs, and treatments of various diseases. Thanks to innovations in a range of industries, healthful fruits and vegetables are cheap and plentiful, and workplaces, homes, and transportation are safer. All of these pleasant developments have improved our health and longevity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Free enterprise in America's medical marketplace promises more of these tremendous medical benefits, particularly in the information and telecommunications industries. Electronic mail, or e-mail, has already become commonplace in doctor's offices. The automation of medical records leads many analysts to speculate that we are not far away from personal "health ID cards." These will provide doctors with an up-to-date record of previous medical conditions and procedures, making diagnoses more accurate and treatment safer and more effective.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, commercial on-line services such as CompuServe and America Online offer health reference databases and the opportunity to discuss health issues with fellow patients or health professionals. Jeff Newman, a commodities trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, used a CompuServe forum to request information after he developed recurring polyps in his throat. His doctor said that the only treatment was to keep having them removed by surgery. But Newman, whose job requires him to shout, wanted an alternative. A CompuServe user in Seattle suggested that a compound in cabbage juice might slow the growth of polyps. It worked. "If it were not for e-mail and CompuServe, I believe my life would have regressed along with my hope," Newman told <i>USA Today</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Information services and e-mail will play an increasingly important role in health care, according to Jerome Kassirer, the editor of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. "On-line computer-assisted communication between patients and medical databases -- and between patients and physicians," he wrote in the <i>Journal</i>, "promises to replace a substantial amount of the care now delivered in person." That will not only save money but also, he argued, improve the quality of care. "The interaction with an on-line computer system can be quite comfortable," he said. "Studies show that many patients feel even less discomfort 'talking' to a computer about personal matters than to a physician."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even more futuristic technologies may one day dramatically reduce the cost and improve the quality of medical services. A hospital in Asheboro, North Carolina, recently brought a new worker on board that can deliver medications and other items much more cheaply than the hospital could previously manage. The worker costs only $6 an hour, carries as much as 200 pounds at a time, and will work 365 days a year. It is the HelpMate, a robot that navigates the hospital using a computer and sophisticated sensors.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Health economists predict that devices and techniques for self-diagnosis and treatment will play an increasingly important role in providing good care while controlling costs. Indeed, self-medication with over-the-counter products such as aspirin and ibuprofen already helps control health-care expenditures. The National Center for Policy Analysis estimates that if only 2 percent of nonprescription drug customers sought professional care instead of self-medicating, the number of primary-care physicians would have to rise 50 percent to meet the increased demand. The extent of self-medication owes much to private-sector innovations in pharmaceuticals, packaging, marketing, and transportation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Software companies like Microsoft, computer makers like IBM and Dell, even manufacturers of robotics, plastics, and fiber optics are investing billions of dollars in the development of computer and information technologies. Do these firms consciously set out to improve health care? Probably not. But their profit-seeking actions have demonstrably done so.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Private enterprise contributes to our health in an even more basic way than advancing drug research or promoting technological change. Because the U.S. economy provides basic goods and services at relatively low cost, families can afford to spend more to improve their lives. From 1960 to 1992, real spending on food as a share of GDP fell by nearly a third, as technological innovations helped farmers increase their productivity and reduce spoilage. Spending on clothes stayed constant during the same period. These trends freed up household income for services such as discretionary medical care and recreation. By generating unprecedented economic production, our economy has given families the financial wherewithal to purchase medical services and otherwise improve their health in a way that our grandparents and great-grandparents would find truly mind-boggling.

<b>It Takes a Village To Have an Abortion</b><br>
It crops up all the time in discussions of abortion, this notion that the choice is best left to "a woman, her doctor, her conscience, and her God." That last was Colin Powell's formulation, but other variants are common. In Garry Wills's New York Post column today, for instance, he writes that most Americans "want the decision to be made by the women involved, with the help, ideally, of family and doctors and religious pastors." It never seems to occur to people who talk this way-and who are always accusing pro-lifers of being unrealistic-that this description is otherworldly. People don't generally go to their family doctors for abortions; they go to abortionists with whom they have no prior relationship and who have a direct financial interest in the abortion taking place. (By the way, if consultation is such a great idea, why do "pro-choicers" oppose waiting periods and counseling and informed-consent laws, no matter how mild?)
<P>
For a measure of Wills's intellectual integrity in this matter, consider that he refers to "late-term abortions in emergency cases-the procedure shrewdly but misleadingly labeled 'partial-birth abortion' by its opponents." He's also prone to making highly suspect empirical claims with no evidentiary support. "Even those who disapprove of abortion in general do not consider it murder," he writes. "And those who oppose late-term abortions do not consider them infanticide." How does Wills know this? (Polls actually suggest the reverse of his first claim: more people consider abortion murder than want to prohibit it.) He also writes that 'more people of genuine belief and piety do not consider abortion, no matter how wrong, to be murder." Perhaps Wills is using a circular definition of 'people genuine belief and piety" to mean those people who agree with him on the wisdom of liberal abortion laws. But on any plausible reading of the phrase, the claim is almost certainly untrue.
<P>
<b>As the Book World Turns</b><br>
In yesterday's <I>Washington Post</I> Book World, Charles Murray's new book was reviewed by a liberal (historian Michael Kazin), and former Planned Parenthood head Faye Wattleton's new autobiography was reviewed. . . that's right, by a liberal (whose name we won't mention because the review was so embarrassingly admiring, and besides we forget it).

<P><blockquote>
In late October 1995, John Sweeney won the presidency of the AFL&#173;CIO.
 Over this period, Sweeney has gained considerable attention in
an attempt to revitalize the old big labor movement as a political
force.<BR>

<P>
Sweeney has launched a massive campaign against Republican members
of Congress.  His long&#173;term strategy is to transform labor
unions from mere representatives of employees in the business
environment to a social movement.  <BR>

<P>
The question is: Will Sweeney's strategy reverse or accelerate
the long decline of big labor?<BR>

<P>
<a name="one">
<center><i> The State of Big Labor</i></center><BR>

<P>
Union membership has been in decline for some time now, as noted
in the chart below.  In 1995, 14.9 percent of the total workforce
was unionized, just a little more than half of 1975's 28.9 percent.
 In the private sector, just 10.4 percent were union members in
1995, down from 16.8 percent in 1983, for example.  In the public
sector, 37.8 percent of government workers were union, up a bit
from the 36.7 percent level in 1983, but actually down from 38.7
percent in 1994.  <BR>

<P>
In gross numbers, union membership has declined from 22.2 million
in 1975 to 16.4 million in 1995.  This 1995 number is a decline
of 300,000 over 1994 levels.  Private&#173;sector union membership
registered 9.4 million in 1995, versus 9.6 million in 1994 and
12 million in 1983.  Public&#173;sector union membership equaled
6.9 million in 1995, down from 7.1 million in 1994, but up from
5.7 million in 1983.<BR>

<P>
To summarize, union membership as a share of the total workforce
is steadily falling.  Among private&#173;sector workers, union
membership is in outright free fall, while among government employees
it has stagnated for some time.  These trends, of course, point
to a strong shift in the composition of union members from the
private sector to government.  <BR>

<P>
Between 1960 and 1995, government employees as a share of union
membership have increased by 600 percent, from a mere 6 percent
to 42 percent.  As noted in the chart of the previous page, if
the average annual rates of change in private and public&#173;sector
union memberships for the first part of 1990s hold for the foreseeable
future, then in about ten years, government employees will account
for a majority of union members.<BR>

<P>
Union officials understand these trends far too well.  They know
that in competitive, private&#173;sector markets &#173;&#173;
where the link between productivity and compensation only grows
stronger &#173;&#173; union membership is on an inevitable decline.
 They also understand that most private&#173;sector employees,
who see opportunities to advance their careers and make better
lives for themselves and their families, view unions as more a
hindrance than a help.  In addition, employees who ultimately
wish to become employers themselves see few, if any, benefits
emanating from union membership.  America's entrepreneurial spirit
works against big labor.<BR>

<P>
Indeed, overall public confidence in organized labor runs very
low.  A 1994 survey of adults revealed that only the media, international
and foreign relief and exchange organizations, political parties,
and government fare worse than labor unions in terms of public
confidence.  In addition, the 22.7 percent of adults expressing
&quot;very little&quot; confidence in major corporations &#173;&#173;
regularly demonized by labor leaders &#173;&#173; rates better
than the 29.1 percent who possess &quot;very little&quot; confidence
in labor organizations.  Social activist groups (e.g., civil rights,
social justice, and community improvement organizations) score
slightly worse than labor in the &quot;great deal&quot; of public
confidence category, while scoring slightly better in the &quot;very
little&quot; confidence category.  Small business and religious
organizations ranked most favorable in the survey.<BR>

<P>
<a name="two">
<center><i>Where is Sweeney Taking Labor?</center></i><BR>

<P>
While Mr. Sweeney and his colleagues fully understand the dismal
position of labor unions, their strategy for big labor's redemption
is destined to failure.<BR>

<P>
Under Sweeney, the AFL&#173;CIO levied a &quot;Sweeney tax&quot;
of 15 cents per capita per month on the AFL&#173;CIO's 78 member
unions in order to raise $35 million for an attack campaign on
Republican members of Congress during the 1996 election year.
 This money is being spent on media ads and organizing activities
in targeted congressional districts to defeat vulnerable &#173;&#173;
mostly freshman &#173;&#173; members.  When you consider that
the AFL&#173;CIO is targeting about 70 Republicans with this effort,
the dollars average out to roughly $500,000 per race.  Of course,
it is well documented that the unions spend much more.  Estimates
for the 1996 elections place their political expenditures at over
$500 million.  This is an astounding amount of money to spend,
particularly compared to what the candidates themselves spend.
 In an October 1996 Reader's Digest article &quot;Big Labor's
Big Bucks&quot;), Rowland Evans and Robert Novak report that &quot;labor
and its allies spent $850 million&quot; against Gordon Smith in
his January 1996 Oregon U.S. Senate contest versus Democrat Ron
Wyden.<BR>

<P>
The $35 million Sweeney tax is in addition to the roughly $40
million in voluntary contributions that union members give to
political action committees, according to The New York Times (April
3, 1996).  As mentioned above, Rutgers University economist Leo
Troy estimates that added in&#173;kind contributions from labor
could hit $500 million this year.<BR>

<P>
The ads attack candidates for seeking to slow the growth in or
reduce the size of government.  This makes some sense when you
look at union membership numbers.  Big labor's only chance for
survival rests with government employees.  Naturally, Sweeney
has been overtly hostile to all substantive tax and regulatory
reduction efforts.  The union push to expand the size of government
is not the result of some good natured but misguided view of government,
but instead is a pure Machiavellian effort to keep and possibly
gain power.  <BR>

<P>
Another Sweeney tactic is to transform labor unions from organizations
representing workers in the business environment into vehicles
for social activism.  These efforts include Sweeney's &quot;Union
Summer&quot; and labor &quot;teach&#173;ins,&quot; both designed
to indoctrinate college kids into the class&#173;warfare, exploitation
thesis of life that the AFL&#173;CIO is pushing anew.  <BR>

<P>
Union Summer provided $210&#173;a&#173;week stipends and free
housing for about 1,200 college students to protest at and disrupt
workplaces across the nation.  Students also were taught the fine
art of harassing business executives during personal functions,
like weddings and Sunday church outings.  The Sweeney recommended
reading list included &quot;Rules for Radicals.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Both Union Summer and the teach&#173;ins tap into hard&#173;core
left&#173;wing academics, mending a long&#173;time split with
labor unions.  Since the early 1950s, the AFL&#173;CIO took a
strong anti&#173;communist stand.  This aggravated liberal academia
and left the unions very leery of professors with Marxist tendencies.
 <BR>

<P>
Such concerns apparently do not bother Mr. Sweeney.  After all,
The Weekly Standard (October 21, 1996) recently reported that
Sweeney is a member of Democratic Socialists of America, that
communists were allowed to distribute literature at Sweeney's
nominating convention, and according to the People's Weekly World,
&quot;for the first time in 40 years, Communist trade unionists
were elected delegates and spoke.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Sweeney is pushing these academics to create crisis thinking,
with unions being offered as a main conduit for much&#173;needed
social activism.  The Chicago Tribune (October 6, 1996) quotes
Sweeney at one of these teach&#173;ins: &quot;We need your help
in exposing the flaws of our society.  While it takes a village
to raise a child, it takes a union to get a raise.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Sweeney also shows little regard for the law and common civility.
 His tactics include abusive corporate campaigns, and he refuses
to rule out the use of violence. Corporate campaigns include picketing
and public attacks not only on targeted companies but on their
lenders, suppliers, and customers, not to mention board members
at their homes and churches; abuse of federal and state regulatory
bodies with baseless and frivolous complaints in order to raise
the costs of doing business; disrupting shareholder meetings;
and salting (where union organizers apply for jobs in non&#173;union
businesses with the intention of either bringing a lawsuit if
not hired, or causing work disruptions if hired).  Corporate campaigns
are a favorite of Sweeney.  &quot;We will use old&#173;fashioned
mass demonstrations, as well as sophisticated corporate campaigns,
to make worker rights the civil rights issue of the 1990s,&quot;
declared Sweeney in his AFL&#173;CIO acceptance speech.  <BR>

<P>
Sweeney especially basks in employing so&#173;called civil disobedience.
 In 1995, his Service Employees International Union (SEIU) blocked
the 14th Street Bridge in Washington, D.C. at rush hour as part
of their &quot;Justice for Janitors&quot; campaign.  &quot;Justice
for Janitors&quot; has used guerrilla&#173;style blockades of
sidewalks and traffic in several cities.  Investor's Business
Daily (November 14, 1995) reported that Sweeney threatened the
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors with &quot;a massive campaign
of resistance and retribution&quot; in July 1995 if workers were
laid off.  Outside the building 3,000 SEIU members gathered with
20 arrested for blocking roads.  As the American Spectator reported,
Sweeney has declared: &quot;I believe in blocking bridges.&quot;
 <BR>

<P>
When asked by Nation's Business (February 1996) if there was anything
in a corporate campaign that's below the belt, Sweeney responded
coyly: &quot;I would hope that we would be reaching out attempting
to build bridges between labor and management, but I think that
when workers are not getting the attention they are entitled to,
that other tactics have to be considered.  I would hope that we
would have the good sense to use all of the peaceful opportunities
to avoid a possible strike or confrontation.&quot;  Quite a chilling
response, isn't it?<BR>

<P>
  
<P>
<a name="three">
<center><i>Sweeney's Impact</center></i><BR>

<P>
Sweeney essentially is linking up the AFL&#173;CIO with groups
and philosophies that have witnessed their power and influence
waning in recent years, such as social activists of the 1960s
variety, left&#173;wing academics, socialists, communists, etc.
 In addition, he has removed any vestiges of non&#173;partisanship
with his vitriolic attacks on Republicans.  Under Sweeney, no
one can seriously doubt that the AFL&#173;CIO is now just another
arm of the Democratic Party.<BR>

<P>
In addition, the &quot;Sweeney tax&quot; and the political attack
campaign may only accelerate union's loss of membership.  According
to a recent poll by Frank Luntz, 62 percent of the union's members
were opposed to the deployment of their dues against Republican
candidates, and 44 percent identified themselves as conservatives.
 <BR>

<P>
Even for those who support these attacks, they are bound to be
aggravated by the lack of results from such a massive spending
effort.  In his September 27 Wall Street Journal column, Paul
Gigot declared that &quot;labor's early spending assault on Republicans
might yet be the political investment of the century.&quot;  While
Mr. Gigot is normally right on with his analysis, in this case,
he could not be more wrong.  Both the House of Representatives
and the Senate will likely stay in Republican hands on November
5.  Indeed, Republicans will probably pick up some seats, in which
case, Sweeney's tax&#173;and&#173;spend effort will go down in
history as one of the most wasteful and unsuccessful political
expenditures of the twentieth century.<BR>

<P>
In the end, Sweeney's actions are analogous to the band that supposedly
kept playing while the Titanic sank.  All the major forces in
the economy, politics, and society are moving against Sweeney's
plans for big labor.  On the economics front, technological advancements
in the areas of computers and telecommunications are pushing forward
with economic decentralization.  Increasing levels of entrepreneurship
are turning employees into employers.  Home&#173;based businesses
are skyrocketing.  National and global competition is increasing.
 Big labor's preferences for high taxes, excessive regulation,
protectionism, and class warfare never made economic sense, and
this only becomes clearer today.<BR>

<P>
On the political front, taxpayers are increasingly unwilling to
give more and more of their money away to wasteful government
ventures.  At the very least, people are demanding restraint from
their government, and calls for smaller government are only growing
louder.<BR>

<P>
Finally, society in general seems to at least be awakening to
many of the ills that so&#173;called &quot;social activism&quot;
has wrought.  Tolerance for bankrupt claims of victimhood on the
part of groups and individuals, and for the increasing callous
use of violence, are diminishing every day.  Labor victimhood
as portrayed by Sweeney and his promotion of civil disobedience
will not be accepted by most Americans.  <BR>

<P>
Finding any relevancy for big labor in an increasingly entrepreneurial
economy is a daunting task.  Indeed, big labor's decline is inevitable.
 However, Sweeney could have perhaps slowed this decline by trying
to reformulate the AFL&#173;CIO into an employee organization
much more cognizant of the economic changes currently under way.
 Unfortunately, Sweeney's formula of a highly regulated and taxed
economy,  big government, and &quot;social activism&quot; will
only serve to divide the nation and push the labor movement further
out on the fringe.  <BR>

<P>
Sweeney may have proved that he can spend big dollars on a massive
campaign of distortion, but little else.  In addition to emptying
the unions treasury, one of his main goals was to build its membership
&#173;&#173; a goal of 500,000 new members in two years time.
 Little evidence exists, however, that he is actually reversing
the long decline in union membership.  Rather than investing millions
into recruitment by changing the dark image of the labor movement,
Sweeney has worsened the cause of unions.  One thing is painfully
clear since Sweeney took over the helm of the AFL&#173;CIO &#173;&#173;
union rank&#173;and&#173;file are receiving a poor return on their
investment both from Sweeney as a leader and his divisive and
failing tactics.<BR>

<P>
Sweeney has managed to link the labor movement with the only other
societal entities that suffer similar or even more poorly in terms
of public confidence than labor unions do themselves &#173;&#173;
government, a particular political party, and social activists.
 Additionally, the media, which also rates poorly, usually treats
labor unions quite favorably.  Indeed, misery loves company.<BR>

<P>
Under Sweeney's leadership, it seems clear that big labor will
be a big loser.

<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>What social workers believe about the poor will hamper welfare reform</strong>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this season of welfare reform, it's worth taking a close look at the professionals in the middle of it, the trained social workers. Just about everyone outside the welfare system is hoping for an end to dependency-causing giveaways, and for their replacement by programs that expect something of recipients in return for their benefits. But will the social workers who administer and implement the new policies deliver?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They are in a position to undermine welfare reform in a number ways. For one thing, they can fail to be inspiring mentors to those welfare recipients who need to be motivated and guided. Instead of urging them to take responsibility for their lives and get to work, they can encourage whining and blaming others. Instead of chiding them for bad habits and urging constructive change, they can excuse their dysfunctional lifestyles.
<p>

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>Says one textbook: "The person's worth is validated equally by his or her decision to achieve potential or to permit it to lie unused, by a decision to achieve or merely vegetate."</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another way social workers can undermine reform is by overusing exemptions to new requirements. The welfare-reform legislation is laden with "escape clauses" that permit case workers to exempt clients from one or another requirement on the grounds of hardship, family needs, and so on. By applying these exemptions generously, case workers can defeat the aim of the legislation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, social workers can spearhead political campaigns to overturn welfare requirements. Journalists generally rely on social workers and program administrators to arrange interviews with clients and to provide information on how the program is working. If social workers oppose reform, they can focus attention on hardship cases, forcing politicians to repeal or amend it to avoid looking "heartless." For all these reasons, the future of welfare reform depends not just on what the legislation says, but on what social workers believe. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There are some 600,000 social workers in this country, filling a wide variety of social-service roles, from eligibility clerk in government programs to career counselors in high schools. At the center of this profession are the schools of social work whose faculty prepare students for work in government social-service agencies. They award 11,000 baccalaureate and 13,000 master's degrees in social work yearly.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This policy-oriented core of the profession includes a number of influential lobbying organizations. The main groups are the American Public Welfare Association (APWA), which affiliates over 800 state and local welfare agencies, including all the state departments of human services, and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), with a membership of 155,000 social workers. As a measure of their political activism, one poll of NASW members found that 64 percent contributed money to political campaigns in 1984, and 33 percent reported lobbying for legislation. Prominent policymakers with a social-work background (an M.S.W. degree) include Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Congressmen Ron Dellums of California and Edolphus Towns of New York, all Democrats.<p><b>Mocking Their Past</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It comes as no surprise that members of this occupational sector lean strongly to the left. The NASW regularly backs Democratic candidates; in 1996, its delegate assembly endorsed Clinton-Gore over the GOP ticket by a vote of 168 to 6. Even more significant than their political bias, however, is their professional bias. Today's social workers hold views about poverty -- what causes it and what they should do about it -- that refute the spirit of welfare reform. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The social-work profession grew out of the assistance activities of 19th-century charitable organizations. As Marvin Olasky, David Green, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and others have pointed out, private, voluntary groups proliferated during that time, successfully ministering to the needs of the poor. Leading these organizations were dozens of reformers who articulated an empirically based approach to assisting the poor. These "charity theorists" included Mary Richmond, Josephine Shaw Lowell, S. Humphreys Gurteen, Annie Fields, and Edward Devine in the United States, and Octavia Hill, Helen Bosanquet, Thomas Mackay, and Arthur Paterson in Great Britain. From their extensive personal experience with the poor, these early social workers reached a clear consensus on the principles of helping the poor. <p>

<br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The beliefs of modern social workers are practically the opposite of the principles of social assistance developed by the founders of the profession. Instead of building on its past, modern social work mocks it. <p><b>To Give or Not To Give</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 19th-century charity theorists advocated a highly personalized approach to working with the needy. They emphasized the capacity of poor individuals to respond to life's demands, and believed in pushing them to achieve independence and a better life. The social worker was first and foremost a mentor and advisor, one who guided individuals to improve themselves and make better choices. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One point on which they all agreed was that giveaways of material assistance -- cash, food, housing, clothing -- are generally harmful to the poor. Of course they saw that the poor had need of these things, but they also saw that it was vital that the poor fill these needs for themselves. Well-meaning reformers who stepped in with some form of dole undermined their self-esteem and impaired their capacity to thrive independently. "My friends," said Octavia Hill in an 1876 speech, "I have lived face to face with the poor for now some years, and I have not learned to think gifts of necessaries, such as a man usually provides for his own family, helpful to them. I have abstained from such, and expect those who love the poor and know them individually will do so more and more in the time to come."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With the rise of massive government welfare programs, social workers abandoned this view. One of the first principles to be jettisoned was the idea that neediness could play a positive, motivating role. For the modern social worker, any kind of suffering or being in need is wrong. "Human suffering is undesirable and should be prevented, or at least alleviated, whenever possible," declares Herbert Bisno in <i>The Philosophy of Social Work</i> (Public Affairs Press, 1952). This declaration misses the complexity of human motivation. Extreme forms of suffering are indeed incapacitating and therefore harmful. But intermediate levels of deprivation -- or the anticipation of such -- motivate constructive choices, from getting up in the morning to go to work, to avoiding bad habits like gambling, alcohol abuse, and overeating. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Armed with the idea that neediness is always wrong, social work then derived the notion that filling someone else's needs is always right. Although social work still aims to enable people to cope with the world, uplift has taken second place to the idea of filling material needs. The NASW's "Definition of Social Work" (approvingly repeated in the introductory text <i>Social Work</i>, published by Allyn and Bacon in 1995), asserts that the first "end" of social-work practice is "helping people obtain tangible services"; it puts "counseling and psychotherapy" second. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another introductory text announces the giveaway mission in its title: <i>Social Welfare: A Response to Human Need</i> (Allyn and Bacon, 1994). Like so many of the textbooks, it downplays the idea that the poor should be expected to work for a living. Indeed, "work" is never mentioned as a solution to poverty. The book labels the belief "that each person should be responsible for meeting his or her own needs" as "rugged individualism" and dismisses it: "This situation is neither possible in contemporary society nor desirable in terms of optimal human growth and development."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In contrast to 19th-century writings, modern social-work texts never point to a situation when the social worker should not give material aid to a needy person. In the indexes to these volumes, there are no entries under "dependency" or "incentives" or "motivation." In <i>The Encyclopedia of Social Work</i>, published by the NASW, the entry for "Income Maintenance System" considers the idea that "income maintenance assistance robs recipients of their incentive to work" an unfounded "suspicion." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Privately, social workers will mention cases where welfare encourages idleness and other dysfunctional behavior like having babies one cannot support. But in official pronouncements, social-work leaders avoid or dismiss the notion that benefit programs might be drawing vulnerable individuals into dependency and even ruin.<p>
<b>No Judge of Lifestyles</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	The 19th-century charity workers expressed strong convictions about what behavior would help people rise from poverty. They had clear opinions on the obvious vices -- drunkenness, gambling, extramarital sex, idleness, and so forth -- as well as on many ordinary choices. For example, Octavia Hill believed it was unhealthy for families to live all in one room -- as most of them wished to do in order to save the cost of renting a second room. As a volunteer housing manager, she used her powers of gentle persuasion to get tenants to pay extra and take two rooms. (After the move was made, she reported, tenants themselves would typically admit it was a wise use of their money.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This emphasis on values has all but disappeared from modern social work. The orientation today is on not swaying welfare recipients in their choices. One value of social work, says John Brown's <i>Handbook of Social Work Practice</i> (Charles C. Thomas, 1992), is a "nonjudgmental attitude," which means that "social workers should not judge clients' behavior by imposing a moral value on it." The introductory text <i>The Practice of Social Work</i> (Dorsey Press, 1985) criticizes "the layperson's views that a social worker seeks to 'remold' clients into a pattern chosen by the worker." The professional view is that clients "should be permitted to determine their own lifestyles as far as possible."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Social work assumes the inherent worth and importance of the individual," says the <i>Introduction to Social Work</i> (Prentice Hall, 1991). From this seemingly unobjectionable premise, the authors reach a startlingly indulgent conclusion: "The person's worth is validated equally by his or her decision to achieve potential or to permit it to lie unused, by a decision to achieve or merely vegetate."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The notion that social workers must be neutral paralyzes them as advisors or mentors. Of course, in any advising situation a dogmatic style is generally counterproductive, and no one piece of advice fits everyone. The 19th-century workers, with their personal, individualized approach, knew this well. They stressed the importance of tact and patience in projecting healthy values. But they were in no doubt about the need to project these values. Today's social workers have genuinely internalized a value-free approach. This leads them to be complacent about programs that validate and reinforce destructive lifestyles, such as income support for unwed mothers or for alcoholics and drug addicts.<p><b>Never Their Fault </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 19th-century charity theorists knew that there were many environmental causes of poverty. They were fully aware of the unhealthy living conditions of the poor, and the dreadful lack of opportunities they faced. To remedy such environmental problems, they advocated public policies that addressed them, such as sanitary improvements and the development of parks and gardens. But they also knew that many poor people were held back by their own shortcomings: by vices, by family breakup, by unhealthy habits and shortsighted choices. In their policies of individual social assistance, therefore, they endeavored to improve character. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1875, after a decade of serving as a befriending manager of low-income housing units, Octavia Hill pointed to the importance of personal behavior. "The people's homes are bad, partly because they are badly built and arranged; they are tenfold worse because the tenants' habits and lives are what they are. Transplant them to-morrow to healthy and commodious homes, and they would pollute and destroy them. There needs, and will need for some time, a reformatory work which will demand that loving zeal of individuals which cannot be had for money, and cannot be legislated for by Parliament."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most modern social workers have abandoned this balanced, logical view. The textbooks smugly criticize 19th-century charity workers for their "judgmental attitudes toward the poor." They find it lamentable that social workers in those benighted days "held to the notion that individual failure was the reason for poverty." The modern view is that the needy cannot be held responsible for their problems. Indeed, anyone who suggests otherwise is engaging in the cardinal no-no of "blaming the victim."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An environmental explanation of poverty underlies social workers' policy recommendations. Whatever the problem, it's not up to the needy person to reform or strive; "society" has to give more. In a 1990 editorial on homelessness in <i>Social Work</i>, the magazine of the NASW, editor-in-chief Ann Hartman criticized programs that aimed to treat drug addiction and alcoholism because "they define homelessness in terms of private troubles" -- an unacceptable approach. "Homelessness is a result of the steady disappearance and unavailability of low-cost housing," she declared. "We must be clear that homelessness cannot be reduced appreciably by treating individual troubles."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In expounding such positions, social-work professionals often exhibit a weak grasp of economics. In <i>Social Welfare: A Response to Human Need</i>, we find this tautological explanation: "The distribution of income, the way that income is distributed, is what causes poverty." Social-work professor Mark Robert Rank of Washington University likens the economy to a game of musical chairs with a fixed number of opportunities: "This musical chairs analogy can be applied to what has been taking place in this country economically and socially. Some people will lose in the game, given that there is unemployment and a lack of jobs." This static, zero-sum conception of economic life ignores the fact that people continually create new jobs for themselves and for others -- if we don't undermine their motivation to do so. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The determinism of modern social work is also devastating to the poor. If you want someone to improve, to make an effort to overcome a problem, he has to feel that he is capable of influencing his fate. In the game of life, just as in sports, it is not useful to dwell on the past and to blame others. What would we think of a coach who told his team that the reason they lost was the rainy weather and the bad calls of the referee? Even if this were mainly the truth, it would be unhealthy to dwell upon it. A coach who followed this approach would find that his team loses even when the weather is fine and the referees are fair. <p><b>Welfare Reform: Bigger Is Better</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Social workers today may occasionally pay lip service to welfare reform, but only if it leads to greater spending. In its 1994 policy recommendations, the NASW declared that block grants to the states must never mean cutting benefits: "States should be allowed to diverge from the national base only if they scale benefits upward from it." It fought experiments that demand something from recipients, such as a compulsory work requirement for the recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In its 1990 recommendations for "Improving the Food Stamp Program," the APWA urged 15 substantive program changes, every one of which had the effect of increasing benefits or the number of beneficiaries. In the latest round of proposed welfare reforms, it has fought virtually all efforts to restrict welfare. It opposes family caps and lifetime limits on benefits; it opposes any effort to end benefits to single individuals, noncitizens, unwed teen mothers, and drug and alcohol abusers. It even opposes denying benefits when these benefits are already duplicated by other welfare programs. <p>

<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a potentially promising shift, the APWA has accepted the idea that some kind of work obligation is appropriate for certain welfare recipients. But in practice, this principle is undermined by the profession's more deeply held conviction that welfare recipients are fragile and incapable, and must be shielded from any possible suffering. Even if a client refuses to participate in an employment plan without good cause, the APWA recommends cutting benefits by only 25 percent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, when the APWA agrees that welfare recipients should be expected to work, it does not mean that they should go to work tomorrow. The APWA approves of a work requirement only if government programs first supply a vast array of additional services to help recipients find and hold a job. For the APWA, welfare reform means a larger, not smaller, government welfare industry. "We know," said a 1987 APWA report urging "real reform," "the investments we propose will cost more money -- more money than the federal and state governments currently invest in low-income families with children."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A spokeswoman for Delaware's "First Step" program gives an idea of the support that welfare administrators feel is necessary to implement the welfare-to-work concept. In this program -- which enrolls less than 5 percent of Delaware's AFDC recipients -- the agency offers a broad smorgasbord of additional benefits to cajole recipients into taking care of themselves: "basic academic and life skills development," "career counseling," "child care," "transportation," "remedial medical such as eyeglasses or eye exams, physical exams, dental work," even "clothing." "If we don't have these supportive services," says the Delaware official, "then the participant cannot succeed." "Cannot" is a strong word when you consider that tens of millions of working poor get and hold jobs without any of these services. <p><b>A Psychology of Coddling</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The welfare industry's premise that recipients must be coddled makes observers skeptical about the latest round of welfare-to-work programs. Remember, these programs were first introduced in 1962, and renewed in legislation passed in 1967, 1971, 1981, and 1988. After 35 years, they're still not successful. A 1994 GAO study of the JOBS program -- the current incarnation of welfare-to-work proposals -- found that only 11 percent of AFDC recipients were even signed up for the program, and the overwhelming majority of these were not in actual on-the-job training, but cycling through support programs such as counseling, job-search preparation, higher education, eye exams, and so on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some officials in the welfare industry dispute this critical view. One who argues that social workers have now adopted "a surprisingly different approach" is Sid Johnson, the executive director of the American Public Welfare Association. "The dramatic change in 1988" with the Family Assistance Act, he says, "was that a system that for 50 years had been, by public policy, aimed at providing income maintenance made a major shift toward the promotion of self-sufficiency." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But can 50 years of training and ideology be overcome so readily? In most parts of the country, social workers are still wedded to a philosophy of nonjudgmental giveaways. In Michigan, social workers have largely undermined the state's policy of requiring unwed teen mothers to live with responsible adults simply by exempting the teens in question. In Ingham County, 74 of the 85 indigent mothers under age 18 were allowed to keep their welfare checks and their independent lifestyle because social workers decided that adult supervision would jeopardize their "emotional and physical well-being."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In those few places where welfare reform has succeeded, social workers are noticeably absent. In California, all 58 counties are supposed to be pushing welfare recipients into work under the GAIN program begun in 1988, but only one, Riverside, has a well-documented record of success. I asked John Rodgers, assistant to the program's director, what proportion of Riverside's caseworkers are trained social workers. "That's basically a nonexistent classification, in GAIN," he replied. "There are some counties in California that . . . took social workers in their existing organization and moved them over into GAIN. We did not do that at all. We had an open recruitment, and in fact strongly encouraged people from the community who had never worked in a social-services agency to apply for the jobs. We were looking for people that had a variety of skills, but specifically people that had experience in the employment sector, of helping people go to work."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another sign that social workers aren't behind meaningful welfare reform is the lobbying of the NASW. The organization strenuously opposes the welfare reform passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton last August. The NASW has vowed to undertake a "state-by-state monitoring of the welfare reform bill's impact on poor women and children." This is another way of saying that social workers are preparing to provide the media a diet of hardship cases attributable to the reform. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Modern social workers may mean well, but they have absorbed a deficient approach to social assistance policy. They will need a big push from citizens and policymakers to recapture the 19th-century focus on personal improvement and self-sufficiency.<p>

<center><h3>BANISHING THE BARD, AND OTHER ENGLISH TRAGEDIES</h3></center>

<p>

William Shakespeare and other great authors
of English literature are no longer required reading at most of
the nation's top colleges and universities, according to a study
released last week by the National Alumni Forum.  &quot;The Shakespeare
File:  What English Majors Are Really Studying&quot; surveys English
major requirements at 70 leading institutions of higher learning.

<p>

The National Alumni Forum (NAF), a non-profit
organization &quot;dedicated to academic freedom and excellence&quot;
and chaired by Lynne Cheney, launched its study when Georgetown
University announced in early 1996 the elimination of its great
authors requirement for English majors.  Georgetown had been among
the many colleges which, until recently, required majors to study
the work of at least one (in Georgetown's case, two) of the three
writers hailed as &quot;the pre-eminent representatives of English
language and literature -- Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare,
and John Milton.&quot;

<p>

Of the 70 schools surveyed, only 23 now require
English majors to take a Shakespeare course, which NAF loosely
defined as any course in which students read two of the three
great English authors.  &quot;The National Alumni Forum conducted
this study to see if the decline in standards at Georgetown was
an isolated incident or part of a national trend,&quot; NAF president
Jerry L. Martin explained.  &quot;The survey confirmed our worst
fears.  Dropping Shakespeare is not just a trend; it is the norm.&quot;

<p>

Shakespeare gets the boot for courses in pop
culture and sex.  The NAF study reports a litany of new fads (in
terms taken directly from course descriptions):  advertising imagery,
AIDS activism, attitudes to marriage, capture of the state, electronic
frontier, feminism, futurism, global factory, homophobia, living
arrangements, Madonna, music videos, oppression and marginalization,
politics of representation, rock and rap music, socialist struggle,
transnationalism, work and play habits, world wide web, etc.

<p>

&quot;Individuals will be exposed to popular
culture their whole lives; college is the time for studying something
deeper and more enduring,&quot; the NAF report aptly remarks.
C.S. Lewis also warned of &quot;the dangers of an exclusive contemporary
diet.  A new book is still on its trial and the amateur is not
in a position to judge it&quot;  (&quot;On the Reading of Old
Books&quot;; <I>God in the Dock</I>).  How will students be able
to critique any of these topics in modern culture without a mooring
in the literature of the past?

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Universities without Shakespeare?
Unthinkable. Language without Shakespeare?  Unspeakable.  I'm
heartened by the National Alumni Forum's effort to stop the erosion
of the greatest artist in the history of the world....  Thank
God he's already translated, and constantly performed, in just
about every language on earth.  Keep him there.&quot;</i>

<center><h3>HIGHER ON DRUGS</h3></center>

<p>

One in five 10th graders used marijuana within
the past month, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse's
&quot;Monitoring the Future Survey&quot; released December 19.
The survey found a <I><B>190 percent</B></I> <I><B>increase</B></I>
over the past five years in adolescent use of illicit drugs.

<p>

The survey also indicates a move from dabbling
to dependence.  Among high school seniors who use marijuana, one
in nine smoke it daily.  The perception of risk associated with
marijuana has declined -- by 25 percent since 1991 -- a trend
that won't be reversed without a strong, certain message from
national leaders.

<p>

&quot;President Clinton has been outspoken
about snuffing-out Joe Camel and Mr. Kool but has been virtually
silent on illicit drugs.  School-age children know the president's
MTV 'I didn't inhale' confession and use it to trivialize drug
use,&quot; notes FRC Senior Policy Analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis.
&quot;It's about time the president, who has forced states to
increase their level of enforcement on tobacco, put a similar
emphasis on fighting the drug scourge -- especially the legalization
campaign that has already overwhelmed California and Arizona and
threatens to engulf the rest of the country.&quot;

<p>

In response to California and Arizona drug
legalization propositions which passed in November, a Clinton
Administration team presented last Monday its campaign against
further drug legalization.  &quot;The only problem was that the
team was missing its quarterback.  President Clinton needs to
personally tackle this national crisis,&quot;  Col. Maginnis said.

<p>

The Goals 2000 legislation ostensibly aims
for drug-free schools by the Year 2000.  Two and a half years
after its passage, the problem continues to get worse, in part
because the president who gave us Goals 2000 hasn't given us a
clear message on drugs.

<p>

<b>ACTION:</b>  Talk to your kids about the dangers of drugs.  Watch 
for resources from Family Research Council in the weeks to come.

Most people would agree that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees citizens the right to keep and bear arms. Yet not even its most zealous defenders would construe this right to mean that the government should supply everyone with a carbine. Not so, it seems, with education. Most people agree that children have a right to an education, but we have come to accept that the government itself should do the educating, compel all children to attend, and require all citizens to pay for it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This error in logic has had calamitous consequences. The takeover of education by the states in the mid-19th century and the resulting abdication of authority by the family set in motion a crippling concatenation of usurpation and surrender that continues to this day. Now education is an entitlement claimed by most, yet a right exercised by few.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There was a time when Americans knew the difference between rights and entitlements. A right used to be understood as a claim in justice, our concept of which flowed from tradition and natural law. As Alexander Hamilton put it, "The sacred rights of mankind are written, as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by the divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power." Our constitutional republican tradition informs us that God, not the state, is the source of rights. The state's role, then, is not to bestow rights, but to protect them by enacting laws consistent with a common tradition of justice and by enforcing those laws impartially.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a totalitarian regime, by contrast, the source of rights is the all-powerful state, which permits citizens to exercise them only in its interest. The state may decide, for instance, that an armed populace threatens its power, and so suppress the right to keep arms. Similarly, it might decide that a populace able to feed itself independent of the state is not in its interest and suppress the right to own lands. But since starving people cannot labor for the state and are apt to grow restive, the state takes pains to feed them, while declaring solemnly their "right" to eat. Not surprisingly, the accumulation of power by the state gets a little easier with each new intrusion, each new surrender. As Thomas Jefferson famously put it, "The natural progress of things is for government to gain ground and for liberty to yield." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, the state may decide that a highly literate, self-reliant, and pious people is not in its interest, and gradually usurp the right of parents to educate their own children. How? By declaring it a "right" -- an entitlement, actually -- and making it free.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The state funding of education, then, is not an act of benign concern for the cultivation of citizenship, but a hostile assumption of ownership. Before the state began to fund schooling, education was free to the public as a whole; individual families and communities bore the cost while exercising the rights of their children to be educated.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In his book <i>Wealth and Poverty</i>, George Gilder recognized the social value of parents' retaining ownership of their children's education: "Nowhere is the vitality of families today more dramatically expressed than in the inspiring willingness of millions of American parents to save up to ensure a safe and rigorous education for their children. Moreover, this willingness is the highest sign of social responsibility. In their efforts to educate their offspring as best they can, whatever the cost, these families are making a major investment in the future of the country, and in the human capital on which coming generations will depend."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Right now, the parents of 6 million American children (about 12 percent of the total) do not ask government to educate them. These parents own their children's education, either by teaching them at home, or "contracting out" to a private school. This number grows every year, and if conservatives could rally around a single goal, it should be to push that number ever higher. Perhaps one day we will speak of  the 12 percent who still depend on government for schooling and worry about what can be done to help those poor folks.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of us would say that education is the most serious, intimate, and sacred of all duties that parents owe their children. All parents must ensure that our children eat well, wear clean clothes, and sleep in a warm and secure home. Yet these duties are rather mundane compared to the awesome task of imparting knowledge and skills for self-reliance, instilling habits of virtue, and (many of us believe) preparing their souls for eternity. If we do not expect parents to pay for their own children's education, what credible argument can we then make that they should pay for their food, clothing, shelter, or medicine?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is not hard to see that once the government had usurped the solemn right of families to educate their children, it was only a matter of time and effort before it could have all the rest. And really, once the government took charge of controlling the minds of our children, the rest is mere table scraps. To tame a stallion you must first break its spirit; only then can it be made faithful and useful to its owner. Government schooling has broken the spirit of the American family. It perpetually affronts parents and denies that God's grace to parents is sufficient to nurture and rear the children He has placed in their loving custody. Government schooling reduces parents to the role of assistants who ensure the completion of homework, help with occasional projects, and get the kids to soccer practice on time. Government schooling is the very linchpin of the welfare state, the foundational tyranny that led to more than a century of servile laws to follow. <p><b>A Setback for Reform</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So where does education reform stand today? In poor shape. In every other area of welfare reform, from health care to food stamps to housing to social security, the essential question is finally being asked: Is this the proper role of government? Not so with education. Until we acknowledge that government schooling is welfare, real education reform is impossible.

<br>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For several decades now, the cutting edge reform in education has been vouchers, which is a way of expanding the existing education entitlement by making it more portable and flexible. The main problem with vouchers as a vehicle for reform is that it misdiagnoses the problem as overly rigid government dependency. If the clients of school welfare feel they get no respect, putting them on a longer leash and adding variety to their diet may make them more content for a time, but it does nothing to address the deeper problem of government dependency. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is well documented that every government that has subsidized private and religious schools, from Australia to France to Canada, has diminished their autonomy and blurred their distinction from state schooling. Vouchers offer private schools in America the same fate, even before the government slaps new regulations on participating schools. This is because the private schools that accept vouchers will no longer be owned by parents, but by the state. During a court challenge to a pilot voucher program in Cleveland, Ohio, a lawyer for the American Federation of Teachers recently provided a sneak peek of how parents and the schools they choose will be regarded under a voucher plan. In oral arguments, he characterized voucher-bearing parents as "inconsequential conduits" of state funds.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 To carry out your duty as a parent, you must own the means to produce the education for your children, by either contracting out or doing it yourself. "School choice" may make you a chooser but it won't make you an owner, any more than housing vouchers make you a homeowner. No government voucher frees you from dependence upon government. To rephrase Abe Lincoln, I'd prefer my welfare straight up, without the base alloy of self-delusion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let us not, after all, mistake the appearance of a free market with reality. Voucher proponents contend that the creation of market conditions in education, such as parents' freedom to choose among schools, will bring about an actual market. Here is where some voucher proponents begin to resemble utopian socialists, who similarly promise that once the state owns everything and everyone has equal choices, the state will just melt away. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We may fairly ask when we can expect the melting to begin. Milton Friedman hopes that vouchers will lead to the repeal of compulsory attendance laws and the elimination of all government funding for education. He has never explained how we go from our current 88 percent rate of dependency on government up to 100 percent, then down to zero. Proposals to require parents to match the government's contribution to their voucher forget that subsidy stimulates dependency. Vouchers in any form will create an insatiable constituency for bigger and bigger subsidies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I like to say that if I were advising the National Education Association on how to preserve and expand the government schooling monopoly (and didn't have a conscience), I would urge the following plan: Continue the pretense of opposition to vouchers (which fuels much of its support among conservatives), while embracing them strategically by softening genuine resistance. Wherever they pass, complain bitterly, then move in to regulate. Playwright, polemicist, and Fabian socialist George Bernard Shaw would have approved. In 1903, he wrote that "since more than half the children in [England] were in voluntary [privately funded] schools and could not be got out of them," they "should be fully financed by the State, and brought under its control."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Whereas the Fabians aimed to emasculate religious schools, voucher proponents will do it inadvertently, then feel bad about it. Some, I fear, would even consider it an acceptable loss. Witness the recent push in Congress for a federally funded voucher plan for families in the District of Columbia. After Senator Jim Jeffords, a liberal Republican from Vermont, blocked passage of a voucher bill that had already passed the House, negotiators sat down to work out a compromise. Bowing to the teachers unions, the Senate eventually voted to kill the voucher plan. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nevertheless, the Senate did the right thing, albeit for the wrong reasons. Among other warts, the plan included a provision that required participating religious schools to provide written assurance that "funds received" under the subtitle "will not be used to pay the costs related to a religion class or a religious ceremony." Voucher proponents offered little apology for this egregious capitulation, and even less toleration of dissent from fellow conservatives. Critics of the D.C. voucher plan were scolded for being "purist" and failing to appreciate that politics "requires compromise."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course that's just the point: politics requires compromise. No matter how well a voucher is crafted, it will be modified and undermined before its passage. Even if a pristine voucher plan could pass with so-called regulatory firewalls for participating private schools, it will inevitably be amended later. But the more troubling lesson of the D.C. voucher debacle is that it may not be possible to concoct a voucher too heinous to win approval from its perennial boosters. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Marvin Olasky reminds us of the worthy charitable traditions in America that have withered as government assumed their functions. Olasky shows that there was indeed help for the widow, orphan, and outsider before government welfare, that it worked and even uplifted, and that we can have it again. Education likewise flourished in America before government monopoly schooling. This history will help us imagine what education might look like in the 21st century without government at the helm.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Compulsory government schooling did not begin on a large scale in this country until the 1850s and 1860s. Yet early America was among the most literate nations in recorded history, according to Pierre DuPont DeNemours (1812), Alexis de Tocqueville (1835), and Michael Chevalier (1838). In 1776, Tom Paine's pamphlet "Common Sense" sold more than 500,000 copies in a nation of 2 million, many of whom were slaves or indentured servants! In 1818, Noah Webster estimated that more than 5 million copies of his Spelling Book had been sold to a population of less than 20 million.<p>

<b>A Better Way</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Proponents of vouchers say government help is needed to educate the poor. But there is a better way: privately funded vouchers, or precollege scholarships. Since the first program was started in 1991 by J. Patrick Rooney, the former chairman of Golden Rule Insurance Co., the precollege scholarship movement has ballooned to 27 programs serving more than 10,000 low-income children--all private dollars, all private schools. And the families of every one of these children, with an average income of $15,000 a year, pay a large portion of the cost of tuition. Precollege scholarships do two wonderful things at once: they bring hope to inner cities, and provide living, breathing examples of poor families breaking free from government subservience. Every child who leaves a government school for an independent school with help from an individual or business in his community represents another brick pulled out from the base of the Berlin Wall of government monopoly schooling.

<br>


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Precollege scholarships completely fulfill in miniature the goal of fostering independence from government. Citizens help the needy in the community to attend the school of their choice. Such scholarships liberate families without coercion. They are flexible, replicable, efficient, and empowering. They enjoy broad bipartisan support, and, if marketed effectively, could develop the same tradition of giving enjoyed by the United Negro College Fund, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But wait, you say. Couldn't a government voucher be designed to work something like a precollege scholarship, including matching payments from families, few conditions, little or no oversight, and no regulatory encroachments? Well, as they say in <i>Wayne's World</i>: "It could happen!" But if it did, vouchers would represent the first nonintrusive, flexible, lean, voluntary, locally supported government program ever! More importantly, even if government could replicate the charitable and volunteer sector, why in heaven's name would we want it to? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Voucher proponents answer that precollege scholarships are nice, but we need to reach millions of children! Ah, yes, the reach argument. Hillary Clinton's health-care plan had reach. Stalin had reach. Mother Teresa settles for depth. And conservatives should likewise steadfastly reject the standard that measures the goodness of a thing by its capacity and reach. We must not be dime store planners, competing with liberals at the numbers game. Rather, let's insist that all virtue is personal, that the fruits of virtue aren't transferable or subject to collectivization, that the term "education system" is as much an oxymoron as "love policy."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No doubt restoring the enterprise of learning to families and communities will take more than private scholarships. Two important developments are already directing us into the next millennium. The first is the rise of entrepreneurs and investors who see a vast emerging market about to be liberated from the clutches of 50 state school monopolies. This will move beyond mere contracting for buses and books, and into the main course of the market: the provision of education services. Education Alternatives, Inc., which contracts with government schools, has fallen on hard times, but Nobel Education Dynamics, an operator of for-profit K-12 schools, saw its stock value increase 277 percent in 1995.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beyond bricks and mortar, there will be an increase in computer-aided and on-line learning. Multimedia learning will come into its own as the "telecosm" becomes a reality in the next decade. Tutoring services like Sylvan Learning could blossom into for-profit schools. Gifted mavericks like Marva Collins and the hundreds of teachers who have joined the breakaway American Association of Educators in Private Practice are blazing a trail for thousands more to follow. In February 1996, the respected investment house Lehman Brothers held its first annual Education Industry Conference, tempting attendees with the promise of ground-floor opportunities in a $600-billion industry. Just one educational equivalent of FedEx, which challenged the postal monopoly, will change everything.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A second key development will be a mass exodus of middle-class social conservatives from government schools. Christians must stop playing king-of-the-hill with liberals for control of Caesar's schools. Instead of lobbying the government for the right of children to keep Bibles tucked in their desks, we might consider building schools where teachers keep them on theirs. A hundred years ago, the Protestants used government schooling to gang up on the Catholics; for the past 30 years, the secularists have wrested control from the Protestants, and are lording it over them. Let's retire the bludgeon. Imagine the impact if Pat Robertson and James Dobson announced a goal of starting enough new schools to serve 5 million new children by the year 2000! Home schooling is already exploding, but one can only imagine how many more families would take back control if they had a choice they could afford and be comfortable with.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, there are some highly desirable and viable political actions worth pursuing, including the following abbreviated list:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Tax relief.</b> Taxes are to government schooling as blood is to a vampire. Funding for education must move from a hemorrhage to a trickle to a drop. Three-quarters of Americans do not have children in school. An increasing percentage of these will be older people, including many pensioners who own homes and pay school taxes. These good folks are being taxed down to cat food for a system they don't use, doesn't work, shouldn't exist, and churns out nasty kids with foul mouths and bad attitudes. At the other end, there are the 20- and 30-somethings, just starting to have families, and with fewer illusions about government deliverance than their Roosevelt-era grandparents and Johnson-era parents. These young families can't afford to buy a house or amass any savings and they know that their children don't have a prayer of thriving in the 21st-century job market with a government-school education. As we move forward, more and more people will demand to keep more of their own money.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scrap compulsory school-attendance laws.</b> The great engine of talent and money now powering vouchers across the country should switch tracks and pull an easier load for a change. Nobody likes getting clobbered over and over again, and repealing compulsory-attendance laws is a less-threatening and highly appealing initiative. Why force children who don't want to be in school to disrupt those who do? Since attendance laws had a negligible effect in increasing attendance in most states where they were initially passed (90 percent of people already went), we have no reason to expect a significant decline in the rolls upon their repeal. But it will deal a heavy blow to the power and prestige of the school monopolies (always a good thing), and begin to build political momentum for things like the repeal of property taxes to pay for schools. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Put the Feds to bed.</b> Lately there's been much talk from former federal education secretaries about abolishing the U.S. Department of Education. This is a fine thing, but it must be part of a larger mission to end the federal role in education. Let's not merely shovel its programs back to other federal departments whence they came. Let the U.S. government be as silent in the area of education as is the U.S. Constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What I have sketched out will not be accomplished with sweeping measures but by the slow, gritty, and unseen work of millions. We must strive for a shining ideal, an arrangement for learning based not on force, but on love.<p><i><b>Douglas D.

<center><h2>A Chance To Pursue My Dreams:<br>
A Harvard student extols private school choice</h2></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

By the end of my freshman year at a public high school in Santa Barbara, California, I had had enough. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Enough of the lewd comments and harassment I encountered daily. Enough of watching students come to class stoned or drunk. And enough of the racial tension that culminated for me when I was physically threatened by a gang of Hispanic girls because I had white friends.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To make matters worse, no one at the school seemed to care about any of this. Administrators didn't protect students from harassment in the hallways. Teachers didn't reprimand the students who disrupted class. Few showed concern if a student flunked all of his courses. I went for weeks without attending class, but no teacher ever said a word and my parents never found out.I came very close to dropping out, which would not have surprised my teachers. I am the youngest of seven children, born to immigrant parents from rural Mexico. My father has a third-grade education, and my mother never attended school. They never learned to speak English. My older brothers did not attend college; my older sisters became pregnant at an early age and dropped out of high school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; If I had stayed in my public school, I would surely have lost all interest in education. But I was lucky to have parents who scrimped and saved to send me, beginning in my sophomore year, to a private school that emphasized competence and character. It was a turning point: I rediscovered my ardor for learning. I graduated with honors and I was admitted this fall as a transfer student to Harvard University.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What was it about Brighton Academy, a small private school in Grants Pass, Oregon, that helped turn me around? In a word: leadership. The faculty and administration were interested in producing not only good students, but good people. I was once again free to focus on academics because I was no longer wasting my energy living in fear of school.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At my private school, adults weren't afraid to exercise authority in a sensitive yet firm manner, and for this they earned the students' respect. Teachers wouldn't tolerate tardiness, inappropriate dress, or disruption. When a student was caught with drugs, not only was he punished and his parents informed, but the administration addressed the entire student body about it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our teachers emphasized discipline and character. They taught us not to capitulate to peer pressure, reminding us that it takes strength and individuality to stand for what one believes. School officials regularly rewarded good conduct, through public praise and student-of-the-month awards. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our instructors were exceptional not only because they got to know us outside of school -- in our neighborhoods and churches,  and even at family picnics -- but because they were obviously committed to us as students. Brighton cannot afford to pay its teachers competitive salaries, and many teachers take, without complaint, outside jobs during the school year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Contrary to many assumptions about private education, the student body at Brighton came from working-class and middle-class families. Parents held monthly rummage sales. Students took after-school jobs to help pay their tuition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sadly, the most powerful lessons of my public school -- listen to peers, not parents; disrespect authority; learn not to care about learning -- directly undermined those I was taught at home. But my private school emphasized that parents are a child's primary moral teachers, and they did everything to support parents in this role. Parents were integrated into the school community via planning committees, monthly all-school meetings, student-teacher conferences, and invitations to all school functions.   <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I thank my teachers at this wonderful school who cared that I learned. Although they made less money than my public-school teachers, they awakened my love of learning, and they taught the principles -- integrity, honesty, courage -- that have enabled me to pursue my dreams.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Clinton will travel to the Philippines to attend the Leaders' Meeting of the forum for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on November 24-25, 1996. There, he and other heads of government will chart the future of trans-Pacific trade and investment liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton's vacillating trade policy, however, has undermined American leadership in promoting open markets around the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. At the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994, President Clinton and the other heads of government agreed to create a "free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific."  They also pledged to implement this plan by no later than 2010 in APEC's developed members, such as the United States and Japan, and by 2020 in APEC's developing members, such as Chile, China, and Indonesia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since then, the Clinton Administration had made little progress toward that goal. In fact, the President's actions and trade policies over the past two years have dismayed America's trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region and dimmed the prospects for APEC trade and investment liberalization. These actions and policies include: (1) blocking Congress from reauthorizing fast track negotiating authority, (2) skipping the 1995 APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, (3) failing to produce a credible U.S. action plan for APEC trade and investment liberalization, (4) pushing for managed trade with Japan, (5) dishonoring the American commitment to conclude World Trade Organization agreements to liberalize trade in certain services, (6) delaying the accession of Chile, an APEC member, to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and (7) failing to work with Congress to reform U.S. agricultural programs that harm other APEC members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 18 economies that APEC encompasses are important to America's future.<sup>1</sup>  Together, APEC members have a gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding $13 trillion, or about one-half of the world's total output. APEC members account for 46 percent of the world's total merchandise trade. Indeed, the volume of U.S. trade with other APEC economies is staggering. In 1995, total U.S. two-way merchandise trade with APEC members was $872.4 billion or 65.7 percent of America's total two-way merchandise trade. Goods exports to APEC members provide paychecks to approximately 7.3 million American workers. Moreover, citizens of the U.S. and other APEC members are large investors in each other's economies. In 1995, U.S. direct investment in other APEC members was $225.4 billion or 31.7 percent of U.S. direct investment worldwide while direct investment by other APEC members in the U.S. was $172.5 billion or 30.7 percent of total foreign direct investment in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton's dithering between liberalization and protectionism has been particularly damaging in Asia. Because America's commitment to free trade and investment with Asia appears to be waning, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad may be tempted to revive his dormant idea of an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States. Until now, APEC's existence has prevented such a bloc from emerging. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Reaffirming America's commitment to free trade and investment and restoring consistency to U.S. trade policy toward Asia is an important priority for the next four years. In particular, the United States must leave no doubt among Asians about its commitment to APEC and its resolve to achieve a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific. Therefore, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress for fast track authority to negotiate trade and investment agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> Fast track is needed to present a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC, to participate in any future round of WTO negotiations, and to bring Chile into NAFTA.
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> Under concerted unilateralism, each APEC member prepares its own plan to liberalize trade and investment, with each plan then subject to peer review to help assure compliance in achieving the ultimate goal. At present, there are still too many differences among APEC members for formal trade negotiations to succeed. Concerted unilateralism allows APEC members to take small but concrete steps each year and to gain confidence in each other.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within the Asia-Pacific region.</b>  These agreements are NAFTA, the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER), and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). This action would enhance the prospects for broader trade and investment liberalization within APEC.
<p>
<li><b>Work with other APEC members in the WTO to complete the unfinished items from the Uruguay Round negotiations.</b> These include sector agreements to liberalize financial and basic telecommunications, and new negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade.
<p>
<li><b>Bring Chile into NAFTA by the end of 1997.</b> Since Chile belongs to APEC, other members see Chile's accession as a test of whether the United States is willing to make a free trade and investment agreement with a developing country that is not on America's border. Although Mexico joined NAFTA in 1994, Asians feel that this is a special case because of Mexico's proximity to the U.S. Chile's prompt accession to NAFTA would help Washington to regain the trade and investment liberalization initiative in the Asia-Pacific region. 
<p>
<li><b>Invite other Latin American countries, starting with Argentina and Peru, to join APEC.</b> The U.S. should press APEC to lift its moratorium on new members. Chile and Mexico are already APEC members. Adding other Latin American countries such as Argentina and Peru, which have demonstrated their willingness to open to APEC, would swing the balance of power within APEC away from the Asian "go slow" group of China, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia and accelerate trade and investment liberalization.
<p>
<li><b>Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs</b> that cost American consumers and taxpayers more than $10 billion every year and undermine U.S. credibility on trade liberalization with many APEC members.
</ul>

<b>THE FORUM FOR ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION (APEC)</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The forum for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is the institutional link between the economies of the Americas and Asia. Fearing a breakdown in the global trading system into competing regional trading blocs, former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke in November 1989 invited trade ministers from countries in East and Southeast Asia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States to meet in Canberra. There they established APEC as a regional forum for consultation about international economic issues. Since then, APEC has evolved rapidly and acquired a broad mandate for liberalizing trade and investment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
APEC's transformation began at the Ministers' Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, in September 1992. There, APEC established a small secretariat, which opened in Singapore in February 1993. It also created the Eminent Persons Group, an advisory body composed of senior economists and other experts, to chart APEC's future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The next major step occurred in 1993 when President Clinton added a Leaders' Meeting to the annual Ministers' Meeting. At this first Leaders' Meeting held on November 20, 1993, on Blake Island near Seattle, Washington, President Clinton and the other heads of government adopted an Economic Vision Statement setting as APEC's goal "the progressive development of a community of Asia-Pacific economies with free and open trade and investment."<sup>2</sup>  The leaders charged the Eminent Persons Group "to present further more specific proposals on how the recommended long-term vision might be realized."<sup>3</sup>  In response, the Eminent Persons Group, chaired by C. Fred Bergsten, a former U.S. Treasury official and Director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, issued a report on August 30, 1994, calling for an APEC-wide free trade and investment area.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Accepting the Eminent Persons Group's challenge, President Suharto of Indonesia, who was then APEC's chairman, forged a historic agreement at the next APEC Leaders' Meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994. In the Bogor Declaration of Common Resolve, President Clinton and the other heads of government agreed to create a "free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific."  They also decided to implement this plan by no later than 2010 for developed economies such as the United States or Japan and no later than 2020 for developing economies such as Chile, China, or Indonesia.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the Leaders' Meetings in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, APEC adopted a process known as "concerted unilateralism" as the means of erecting a free trade and investment area. Under this process, instead of negotiating a formal trade agreement such as NAFTA, each member must propose its own individual action plan for realizing the common goal of free trade and investment. Each plan is subject to peer review and pressure to prevent any shirking from the ultimate goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the Osaka Action Agenda communiqu‚, the leaders directed their trade ministers to prepare concrete and substantive individual actions plans that would be vetted in a series of APEC meetings in 1996. The leaders directed APEC's Chairman, President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines, to assemble these plans and meld them into a comprehensive Manila Action Plan for APEC. This plan could then be approved at the APEC Ministers' Meeting on November 22-23, 1996, in Manila and the Leaders' Meeting on November 24-25, at Subic Bay. The leaders also set January 1, 1997, as the target date to begin implementing the Manila Action Plan for APEC. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite these agreements, there remain divisions within APEC. An Asian group, composed of China, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia, advocates a "go slow" approach to trade and investment liberalization. This group wants APEC to focus on small, but practical measures to facilitate trade, such as developing a common visa for businessmen traveling in the region or harmonizing product standards and professional licensing during the next few years. This group and some countries from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) oppose expanding APEC membership to India and other countries in Latin America. They lobbied other APEC members and won a three-year moratorium on new members that began in 1994.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another group, composed of Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore, wants to emphasize rapid trade and investment liberalization among APEC members. This group is more willing to expand APEC's membership.

<p>
<b>WHY APEC IS GOOD FOR AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Achieving APEC's goal of a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific would benefit the American people enormously. In February 1996, the Australian Industry Commission published the most comprehensive study to date on the economic effects of APEC trade liberalization. The Commission found that comprehensive free trade (both goods and services) and investment within APEC would increase real GDP by 0.7 percent or $70 billion by 2010 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico above and beyond any gains from Uruguay Round liberalization. Likewise, total exports from North America would rise by an additional 18.4 percent above any increase due to the Uruguay Round. Moreover, if APEC trade and investment liberalization were combined with trade facilitation measures, real GDP in North America would rise faster -- 1.5 percent or $140 billion by 2010.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Moreover, APEC not only promotes trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific but also serves other American interests. For example, APEC:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Promotes trade and investment liberalization not only across the Pacific but in the rest of the world as well.</b> APEC is committed to the concept of "open regionalism."  This means that APEC seeks not only to eliminate trade and investment barriers within APEC, but also to lower trade barriers progressively between APEC and the rest of world. APEC liberalization is not an alternative to multilateral liberalization through the World Trade Organization. Indeed, APEC fully supports the WTO and all of the Uruguay Round Agreements, and favors a new round of WTO negotiations to progress as rapidly as possible toward global free trade and investment. However, APEC acknowledges that regional groups of like-minded countries may move far faster toward free trade and investment than can the WTO with its diverse global membership. Thus, regional groups may provide both a model and an inspiration for trade and investment liberalization to the rest of the world. In this sense, parallel regional and multilateral trade liberalization initiatives are mutually reinforcing. Indeed, the emergence of APEC as a regional trade organization in 1993 is widely credited with bringing the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion.
<p>
Once again in 1996, APEC is expected to use its influence to promote multilateral liberalization by endorsing the proposed Information Technology Agreement. Suggested by Japan and the United States, this agreement would eliminate all tariffs on computers, semiconductors, software, and telecommunications equipment by 2000. It will be presented for approval to WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore on December 9-12, 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Prevents the emergence of an Asia-only trading bloc.</b> Some Asian leaders, especially Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, have advocated forming an Asia-only trading bloc that would focus primarily on liberalizing trade within Asia rather than across the Pacific Ocean. In 1990, Mahathir proposed that China, Japan, South Korea, and the ASEAN countries form an East Asia Economic Group (EAEG). Although Beijing was supportive, both Tokyo and Seoul feared that an EAEG would exacerbate trade tensions and undermine security cooperation with the United States, and they joined the Bush Administration in opposing it. Failing to garner Japanese or South Korean support, Mahathir scaled back his proposal to establishing a less formal East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC). Eventually, the Clinton Administration and other APEC governments agreed to establish an EAEC as a discussion group within APEC in 1993. Since the Bogor Declaration in 1994, APEC has been the main focus for trade and investment liberalization efforts in Asia. Talk about an Asia-only trading bloc has died off. However, if APEC trade and investment liberalization should falter, nationalists in Asia could press once again to convert the EAEC into an Asia-only trading bloc.
<p>
An Asia-only trading bloc with Asia would be very detrimental to American interests. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with Asia exceeded $403 billion in 1995. Goods exports to Asia supported more than 3.8 million jobs in the U.S. An inward-looking Asia-only trading bloc could reduce American exports to Asia and threaten the paychecks of many American workers. Moreover, an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States likely would reduce the willingness of Congress and the American people to support an active political role and a visible military presence in the region. An American withdrawal could threaten peace and prosperity in Asia. 
<p>
<li><b>Helps foster greater trust and cooperation between China and Taiwan.</b> APEC admits economies, not countries as members. By skirting the question of political sovereignty, this technical distinction allowed China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (as "Chinese Taipei") to join APEC in 1991 as separate members. Thus, APEC is the only major international organization to which both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan belong.<sup>6</sup>  Given the current tensions, APEC provides an important bridge for peaceful cooperation between China and Taiwan.
</ul>
<p>
<b>WHY AMERICAN INFLUENCE IN APEC IS WANING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton's vacillating trade policy has diminished American influence over the direction of trade and investment in APEC. America's trading partners in the Americas and Asia welcomed many of the Clinton Administration's trade and investment initiatives during its first two years in office. Asians cheered President Clinton's decision to hold the first APEC Leaders' Meeting and to support the creation of an APEC free trade and investment area. Moreover, Asians also applauded when President Clinton:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Won congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</b> President Clinton signed implementing legislation into law on December 8, 1993, that let APEC member Mexico join the existing Free Trade Agreement between Canada, another APEC member, and the U.S.
<p>
<li><b>Won congressional approval for the Uruguay Round Agreements.</b> President Clinton signed implementing legislation into law on December 8, 1994. APEC strongly supported these agreements and the establishment of the WTO.
<p>
<li><b>Hosted the Summit of the Americas</b> in Miami, Florida, on December 8-11, 1994. There, President Clinton and the heads of government of all the countries in the Americas except Cuba signed a Declaration of Principles. This declaration committed the United States and the 33 other countries to creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. 
<p>
<li><b>Invited Chile, an APEC member, to begin negotiations to join NAFTA.</b> Following the Summit of the Americas, President Clinton, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, and Mexican President Carlos Salinas met with Chilean President Eduardo Frei. There, they committed to help Chile join NAFTA by 1997.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In contrast to praiseworthy initiatives such as APEC, FTAA, NAFTA, and the Uruguay Round during his first two years in office, President Clinton began responding to protectionist voices within his own political coalition in early 1995. Since then, the Clinton Administration has veered away from trade and investment liberalization. In a trade policy "U-turn," President Clinton has: 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Blocked Congress from reauthorizing fast track negotiating authority by demanding that controversial environmental and labor standards be added to all future trade and investment agreements.</b> President Clinton let fast track authority for negotiating new trade and investment agreements expire in 1994. Under fast track authority, trade and investment agreement negotiated by the President are submitted to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote; Congress may not amend any portion of proposed agreement before voting on it. For the last two years, the Clinton Administration has insisted that any bill reauthorizing fast track must allow the President to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues.
<p>
This position has caused fast track to stall in Congress. Republican leaders fear that environmental and labor rules in trade agreements could be misused to protect certain industries. They offered to pass a "clean" fast track bill without the authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues, but the Administration rejected this approach. Without fast track authority, no country will enter into serious trade and investment liberalization negotiations with the United States.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Skipped the APEC Leaders' Meeting in 1995.</b> President Clinton did not attend the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, because of the budget stalemate with Congress. Although Vice President Al Gore did go in Clinton's place, this decision raised questions among the other leaders about the Clinton Administration's commitment to APEC.
<p>
<li><b>Failed to produce a credible APEC action plan.</b> The lack of fast track authority has slowed the progress toward creating an APEC free trade and investment area. Without fast track authority, the Clinton Administration was unable to propose any new trade and investment liberalization initiatives in America's APEC action plan. The Administration's action plan is merely a restatement of trade liberalization commitments made in the Uruguay Round Agreements. Because of the inability of the United States to make any new commitments, other APEC members were reluctant to make substantive commitments in their own action plans. Thus, when the action plans were presented for review at a meeting in Christchurch, New Zealand, on July 15, 1996, APEC trade ministers were so embarrassed by how few trade and investment liberalization commitments were offered that they sheepishly agreed to rework and resubmit their action plans. However, it is unclear what additional liberalization commitments other APEC members are willing to make if the United States still has nothing to offer. 
<p>
<li><b>Pushed for managed trade with Japan.</b>  The Clinton Administration attempted to impose managed trade policies on Japan in the auto and automotive parts dispute of 1995. The Clinton Administration also wanted to renew an agreement with Japan establishing import targets for semiconductors in 1996. This strategy alarmed free trade advocates in Canberra, Ottawa, Santiago, Singapore, and Wellington. Although Tokyo and Washington ultimately reached an auto and automotive parts agreement, which avoided mandatory quotas, in 1995 and agreed to drop import targets from the semiconductor agreement in 1996, Clinton's approach to the conflict alienated other APEC members. Consequently, American influence over the direction of trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region has been effectively diminished.
<p>
<li><b>Dishonored the American commitment to liberalize trade in services through the WTO.</b> APEC members are concerned that the Clinton Administration's withdrawal from WTO negotiations to liberalize trade in financial services and basic telecommunications may foreshadow unilateral actions to open financial services and telecommunications markets in Asia. One of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services or GATS, establishes a general framework for liberalizing trade in services and mandates a timetable for reaching sector agreements covering financial services and basic telecommunications.<sup>8</sup>  During the last two years, the Clinton Administration walked out of WTO negotiations for both sectors literally hours before agreements were scheduled to be concluded because some American firms were dissatisfied with the market liberalization offers from certain Asian countries. For financial services, the Administration rejected the offers of India, Japan, South Korea, and certain ASEAN countries and suspended negotiations on June 29, 1995.<sup>9</sup>  For basic telecommunications, India and the ASEAN countries once again failed to produce acceptable offers so the Clinton Administration left WTO negotiations on April 30, 1996. Consequently, the WTO pushed back the deadlines for achieving permanent financial services and basic telecommunications agreements to December 31, 1997, and February 15, 1997, respectively.
<p>
<li><b>Delayed Chile's accession to NAFTA.</b> Asians are closely monitoring Chile's accession to NAFTA as test of U.S. resolve. Asians reason that if President Clinton cannot bring a small developing country, whose gross domestic product is 0.9 percent of the size of the U.S. economy, into NAFTA, the United States will not be able to fulfill its APEC free trade and investment commitments with much larger developing economies of the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, or Thailand.
<p>
Chile will not begin negotiations to join NAFTA until President Clinton secures fast track authority from Congress. The Administration's stubborn refusal to compromise with Congress on environmental and labor standards issues has effectively kept Chile out of NAFTA. However, Chile is not waiting on the sidelines for President Clinton and Congress to act. Instead, Santiago is exploring other options for trade and investment liberalization. Chile already has a bilateral free trade agreement with one APEC member, Mexico, and is discussing possible free trade and investment agreements with two other APEC members, Canada and New Zealand.
<p>
<li><b>Failed to eliminate trade-distorting American agricultural policies.</b> Agriculture is a major issue for a number of APEC members, especially Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand.<sup>10</sup>  On balance, these APEC members were pleased with the passage of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR) in 1996. This act gives U.S. wheat, feed grain, rice, and cotton farmers fixed, but declining subsidies through seven-year transition contracts and terminates production controls on wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton. However, the FAIR Act was disappointing because it modified dairy and sugar programs only slightly and left export subsidy programs intact. The dairy and sugar programs cost American consumers $9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively each year in higher prices, and the dairy program will add $1.6 billion to federal expenditures over the next five years. Moreover, these agricultural programs depress world commodity prices by blocking farm imports into the United States or subsidizing farm exports to other markets. Lower world prices hurt farmers in APEC agricultural exporting countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand.
<p>
The United States shares a common interest with many APEC members in achieving free trade in agricultural products in APEC. Large potential markets for American farm production are only partially open in Japan and Taiwan and remain closed in China and South Korea. Indeed, the Australia Industrial Commission found that nearly one-third of the gains of APEC trade liberalization above and beyond any gains from the Uruguay Round are due to liberalizing the agricultural sector. Excluding agriculture, the gains to the United States and the rest of North America would fall by about $23 billion or 0.3 percent of gross domestic product by 2010.11   When the potential gains to the U.S. from free trade in agricultural commodities are so large, the agricultural exporting countries in APEC cannot understand why the Clinton Administration did not press Congress to eliminate the dairy, export subsidy, and sugar program when it considered the FAIR bill. They are concerned that President Clinton will not fight for free trade in agricultural products.
</ul><p>
<b>RESTORING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN APEC</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's zigzagging between trade liberalization and protectionism has undermined confidence in American economic leadership and threatened the progress toward open markets in the Asia-Pacific region. This loss of American prestige and influence has been especially evident in APEC. President Clinton organized APEC's first Leaders' Meeting in 1993 and then worked for adoption of the Bogor Declaration in 1994. Since then, the Clinton Administration has placed little emphasis on APEC, and as a result the momentum toward APEC trade and investment liberalization has slowed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An Asia-Pacific free trade and investment area remains in America's interest. But this objective may not be achieved unless the United States can exert more leadership in APEC. To do this, President Clinton should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress for fast track authority to negotiate trade and investment agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> The Administration needs fast track authority to offer a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization at APEC, to bring Chile into NAFTA, to harmonize NAFTA with other regional free trade agreements, and to commence a new WTO negotiating round. The President should drop his insistence that authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues must be included in the fast track legislation. Environmental and labor standards issues may have an international dimension, but they should be addressed in separate negotiations on their own merits. 
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> It is important to strengthen the APEC process through a building block approach. Concerted unilateralism allows members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. More traditional negotiations eventually will be necessary to achieve APEC's goal of a free trade and investment area. However, there are too many differences among APEC members right now for the negotiations to succeed. Only after APEC members gain confidence in each other over the next few years will a more formal negotiating process be likely to succeed.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within the Asia-Pacific region.</b> At upcoming APEC meetings, Canberra will urge members to harmonize existing free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement between Australia and New Zealand (CER), and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). The President should support this Australian initiative. It is a practical step toward trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific, and will make the goal of an APEC free trade and investment agreement much easier to achieve.
<p>
<li><b>Work with other APEC members in the World Trade Organization to complete the unfinished items from the Uruguay Round negotiations.</b> APEC is strongly committed to implementing fully the Uruguay Round Agreements and strengthening the WTO. At the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore in December 9-12, 1996, the Clinton Administration should press other WTO members to complete the unfinished items from the Uruguay Round. Washington must work with other APEC members to reach agreements on liberalizing trade in financial services and basic telecommunications services by 1997. Moreover, Washington and other agricultural exporters in APEC must work together to prepare for the new negotiations on liberalizing agricultural trade that are scheduled to begin in 1999. 
<p>
<li><b>Bring Chile into NAFTA by the end of 1997.</b> Since Chile belongs to APEC, other members -- especially the ASEAN countries -- are looking at Chile's accession as a test of whether the United States is willing to make a free trade and investment agreement with a developing country. Chile's prompt accession to NAFTA would demonstrate American resolve to achieve an APEC free trade and investment area.
<p>
<li><b>Invite other Latin American countries, starting with Argentina and Peru, to join APEC.</b> The Clinton Administration has mistakenly opposed adding new members to APEC. Instead, the U.S. should be pressing APEC to lift its moratorium on new members. Adding Latin American countries, which have demonstrated their willingness to open their markets and implement a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), would swing the balance of power within APEC away from the Asian "go slow" group of China, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. Argentina and Peru have expressed an interest in APEC membership and would push APEC toward more rapid liberalization. 
<p>
The six ASEAN countries that currently belong to APEC will sponsor their new member, Vietnam, for APEC membership after the moratorium expires in 1997. This creates an opportunity for the U.S. to help Argentina and Peru join also. President Clinton should offer to trade U.S. support for Vietnam's APEC membership in exchange for Asian support for Argentina's and Peru's candidacy.
<p>
<li><b>Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs.</b> With the passage of the FAIR Act, the U.S. began winding down many economically irrational programs. However, the dairy, export subsidy, and sugar programs survived largely intact. These programs simultaneously raise U.S. consumer prices, cost American taxpayers billions of dollars annually, and decrease world prices for agricultural commodities. Eliminating these programs will improve American relations with a number of APEC members. The President can use this good will as negotiating leverage with the ASEAN countries to pressure them to open their services markets to American providers.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Expanding trade and investment with the fast growing economies of Asia and Latin America is a vital American interest. APEC, which is committed to creating a "free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific" by no later than 2020, is the institutional means through which the U.S. can realize this objective. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Clinton had a number of major accomplishments in trade and investment liberalization during his first two years in office. Since then, however, the President has blocked Congress from reauthorizing fast track negotiating authority, failed to pursue promising trade initiatives, flirted with protectionism, and dishonored U.S. trade commitments. This vacillating trade policy has dismayed America's trading partners, undermined American leadership, and endangered the prospects for APEC trade and investment liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton must regain the initiative and restore American leadership for international trade and investment liberalization. He must take concrete actions to reassure trading partners in the Asia-Pacific that U.S. remains committed to APEC. These steps include securing fast track authority and offering a credible U.S. action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC. Presidential deeds, not rhetorical phrases, are needed to keep APEC on track toward its free trade and investment goal.

<h2>Choosing the Right Tax Advisor</h2>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<font size="+2">A</font>fter surviving the horror of yet another tax season, many people — daunted by 
the prospects of repeating the same performance next April 15 — resolve finally to put 
their personal finances in order.  But some drag their feet, because they don’t realize how 
much help experts like accounts and tax attorneys can provide.  Other people don’t know 
where to turn for professional guidance.

	<p>One woman, the president of a New York City-based management consulting 
firm, stated the problem succinctly: "I didn't think I was taking advantage of all the tax 
breaks I was entitled to.  And I wanted someone to show me how to make money on my 
money, instead of just paying over half to the government.”"

	<p>Like many people, she eventually found her accountant through referrals from 
friends and business associates.  She interviewed about five CPA's before making a final 
selection, and chose her current accountant because "he works with a lot of people at 
about my income level who own small businesses.”" In addition, she felt "the chemistry 
was right.”"

	<p>This woman's organized selection process can serve as a model for people in the 
market for accountants and tax lawyers.

	<p>CPA's provide a variety of services, from tax return preparation to financial 
planning to bookkeeping.  So before you begin shopping around for a practitioner, ask 
yourself this question:  What do I want an accountant to do for me?

	<p>If you need help organizing your personal finances, an accountant should be able 
to advise you on whether to rent or purchase a home, how much life and property 
insurance you need, and how to structure your investment portfolio, in addition to telling 
you how to pay a minimum amount of income tax.

	<p>As a generalist, a CPA can help you select specialists in narrower fields.  For 
example, he will work with attorneys, to help draft wills and trust agreements, and to put 
an estate plan into effect.  He will also work with stockbrokers, to help design a portfolio 
that makes the most of taxwise investments like tax-exempt mutual funds.

	<p>Do you need an accountant to prepare your tax return?  While some people can't 
justify the fee and prefer to follow the IRS instructions themselves, others take a different 
view.  A good accountant sees planning opportunities in the data gathered for a return.  
Looking over Schedule D, which lists securities transactions, an accountant might 
recommend donating highly appreciated securities as a way to maximize charitable 
deductions.

	<p>Look for someone who has sound business judgment as well as technical 
expertise.  And seek out a professional who offers tax planning advice throughout the 
year, not just at tax time.

	<p>Doctors, lawyers, small business owners and others with specialized needs are 
well advised to seek out accountants with experience and technical expertise in their 
particular areas.  Problems tend to repeat themselves, and accountants who specialize 
tend to keep current with the latest developments in their fields.

	<p>Expect to pay from $150 to $1,000 or more when an accountant prepares your tax 
return.  For consultation and planning, CPA's generally charge hourly rates.  Tax 
preparation fees may be deductible.  Consultation fees may also be deductible, depending 
on the service.

	<p>Tax lawyers are more expensive -- they generally charge higher hourly fees.  But 
they can save money for taxpayers with unusually complicated tax situations, for 
example, someone who has overlap between his complex business and personal tax 
matters.

	<p>Some people hire tax lawyers for advice in connection with a particular situation:  
to handle a divorce, to prepare an estate plan or to represent them in an IRS dispute.  
Select a tax attorney on the same basis as you choose an accountant -- by reputation and 
recommendation, with an eye to particular specialities.

	<p>Advisors who are both CPA's and attorneys can offer one-stop shopping.  They 
can work out an estate plan, for instance, and then draft the will and the trust agreements 
needed to carry out the plan.

	<h3>How to Conduct the Interview.</h3>
<p>
	Like most professionals, accountants and tax lawyers are best found through 
recommendations.  As you gather names, ask your friends and business associates exactly 
what they like—and don’n't like—about their advisors.  Find out whether they are easily 
accessible and whether they return telephone calls quickly.  Most advisors don't charge 
for an initial interview.  When you go in for the interview, ask these questions:
<p>
<ul>
•	<li>How do you determine fees?
	(When the advisor charges an hourly rate, ask for a time estimate for the 
	job.)

•	<p><li>What exactly will you do for the money?

•	<p><li>How much time will you spend with me, doing planning and 
consultation?

•	<p><li>Are you available only during tax season, or will you work with me 
	throughout the year?

•	<p><li>Who will actually handle the work, you or your assistant?  (If an 
associate will be responsible for your account, make sure to find out 
his qualifications and his fee schedule.  Will you feel comfortable 
working with him?)

•	<p><li>What are your areas of expertise?

•	<p><li>How will you keep me up to date on the latest tax developments?

•	<p><li>Does your office have microcomputer capabilities?  (Some advisors can 
do time-consuming “what if” planning with computer programs that 
instantly give them the results of a large number of hypothetical tax 
scenarios.)
</ul>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recent growth of the Internet has spurred demand to make information on Congress readily available electronically. At the same time, newly elected House and Senate leaders have pledged to continue the significant reforms that made the 104th Congress more open and responsive to the public than its predecessors. The 105th Congress should marry internal reform and external electronic information efforts by establishing rules and procedures through a Congressional Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to guarantee that basic legislative information is available electronically. By taking the initiative in placing all disclosable information on the Internet, Congress could avoid the contentious process of specific requests for materials as well as the necessarily more complex freedom of information procedures established for the executive branch. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress already has acted to place information on line with enormous success. In 1995, Congress established <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">THOMAS</a>, the Library of Congress's on-line legislative information service, which has been accessed more than 35 million times in just 22 months of operation. Another agency of the federal government, the Government Printing Office, manages the GPO Access system, which features 58 information databases produced by the federal government. Since December 1995, GPO Access has distributed an average of 2 million documents electronically each month.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Individual offices have also taken steps to make information available electronically. Ninety-four <a href="http://www.senate.gov">Senators</a> have World Wide Web home pages, which feature text and graphics, as do 213 of the <a href="http://www.house.gov">House's</a> 435 members. Electronic mail has facilitated communication with congressional offices; 38 percent of all House members and 82 percent of Senators now have e-mail addresses. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U. S. House of Representatives Task Force on Committee Review has recommended that Congress's open door policy be extended to include increasing public access to committee documents over the Internet. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Key materials that the House Task Force recommended be placed on the Internet include: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Amendments to bills
<li>Committee and subcommittee prints
<li>Committee and subcommittee reports
<li>Oversight plans and activities.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In mid-July, Representative Rick White (R-WA) introduced H. Res. 478, which would incorporate the Task Force recommendations into the Rules for the House of Representatives. Likewise, through its "Operation Daylight," the U.S. Senate has sought to use information technology to publicize its activities more extensively. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both H. Res. 478 and Operation Daylight would do much to bring the day-to-day workings of Congress to the on-line public. Congress should broaden these procedural reforms by creating a Congressional FOIA, encompassing all of the information which Congress already makes available to the public. In addition to the committee documents detailed by the House task force for inclusion on the Internet, Congress should add issue briefs, spending reports, and financial and lobbying disclosure documents. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Through key institutional and procedural reforms, the 104th Congress sought to unmask and dismantle the network of liberal special interests that ran Capitol Hill for decades. A Congressional Freedom of Information Act would complete and confirm the move toward open access to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Providing citizens outside of Washington with the means to closely examine and actively monitor the work of their elected representatives would do more to foster openness and prevent back room politics than any other single reform. The 30 million American families with personal computers would be able to use the Internet to observe more closely the activities of Congress and their particular representatives; other citizens may take advantage of the numerous possibilities for Internet access at work and at public and university libraries to find timely information on current legislation that may affect their lives. Overall, these changes would make our democratic system stronger and more responsive to the average citizen.
<p>
<b>CONGRESSIONAL REFORM IN THE 104th CONGRESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Heeding the public cry to "clean up Congress" in the aftermath of the House bank, bookkeeping, and post office scandals, Members of the 104th Congress took office in January 1994 determined to reform the institution. The House and Senate cut their budgets, reduced committee staff, eliminated perks, banned most gifts to Members, applied laws imposed on the private sector to itself, required lobbyists to register and disclose their activities, and imposed term limits on committee chairmen. The House also overhauled its committee system, once a haven for pork-barrel politics and back room deals. Congress's move to bring itself on line in the age of the information superhighway was an important, albeit unheralded, part of these changes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress transformed itself into a more open and responsive body in part by affording Americans new and quicker channels of access to, as well as new sources of information from, their elected representatives. The increased use of electronic mail affords the public a new opportunity to comment on legislation currently under consideration; 38 percent of all House members and 82 percent of Senators now have e-mail addresses. As of early November 1996, 94 Senators and 213 House members have World Wide Web home pages. Likewise, congressional committees have posted information on line as part of their open door efforts. Eighteen House committees have home pages, with the remaining two scheduled to go on line within the year. Eight of the Senate's seventeen committees have home pages.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most significantly, House and Senate leaders have made much federal legislative information freely accessible to constituents through the Internet. In January 1994, congressional leadership brought the Library of Congress THOMAS system on line. As a result, some bill texts, the <i>Congressional Record Index</i>, bill summaries, and legislative status updates are readily available, free of charge, to the Internet-using public. THOMAS has been an enormous success: It was consulted nearly 14 million times in its first year of operation and more than 21 million times in the first ten months of 1996 alone. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the GPO Access system went on line in December 1995 to provide access to 58 federal government databases, including the <i>Congressional Record</i>. On average, users download two million documents a month from the service free of charge. Among the most useful Web sites on GPO Access is the home page for the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm. The GAO home page offers full-text searchable files of reports on major rules by federal agencies, GAO reports, testimony, policy and guidelines, comptroller general decisions, and bid protest regulations. In addition, the home page includes a direct link to GAO FraudNet, allowing Internet users to report evidence of fraud and abuse. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1995 Congressional Accountability Act required Congress to comply with legislation covering private workplaces. It excluded the Freedom of Information Act from its list of covered laws, however, as the FOIA does not apply to the private sector. Enacted in 1966 and amended several times since, the FOIA requires executive branch agencies to make many kinds of documents available to citizens, scholars, journalists, and others interested in government activity and statistical information. Unfortunately, compliance with this law has been characterized by excessive delays, and, in some cases, outright neglect. One major problem is that the FOIA has impact only after individuals request information from a government agency. The FOIA process begins with an often controversial decision about whether the requested information is eligible to be released to the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress recently passed an amendment called the Electronic Freedom of Information Act, requiring the executive branch to make greater use of the Internet in responding to requests for information. A huge advantage of electronic disclosure is that an agency can take the initiative to determine what information should be disclosed and make it available rather than waiting for citizens to ask. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should establish similar open information procedures for itself. By starting with electronic disclosure through the Internet, Congress can avoid much of the contention and controversy that has characterized the executive branch experience with the FOIA.
<p>
<b>HOUSE TASK FORCE ON COMMITTEE REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress already is considering additional steps to increase on-line access to information about the congressional process. The House Task Force on Committee Review, chaired by Representative David Dreier (R-CA), has called for significant House rule changes for the 105th Congress to assure greater public access to key committee documents. These recommendations were largely incorporated in H. Res. 478, introduced by Representative Rick White. In particular, H. Res. 478 would require House committees to place important legislative documents on line, including committee and subcommittee prints of bills, amendments, meeting transcripts, reports on legislation, and oversight plans and activity reports. At low marginal cost and with great efficiency of dissemination, these measures would improve public access to documents and information that previously had been the domain of congressional staffers and influence peddlers. Increased public access would help level the playing field between ordinary citizens and high-powered lobbyists, whose ability to obtain inside information often enables them to influence legislation. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee is considering similar steps as part of Operation Daylight.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H. Res. 478 would require that the following information be made available on the Internet:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Committee and subcommittee prints of bills and marks (when introduced or given to Members for markups).</b> Currently, citizens can read copies of bills that have been introduced in the House or the Senate via THOMAS or GPO Access. But bills almost always are transformed during committee or subcommittee scrutiny. Versions of bills to be considered by committees, termed "chairman's marks," often are not available to the public until after committees have acted on them. 
<p>
<li><b>Committee amendments to bills (as soon as technically feasible).</b> Amendments can fundamentally alter a bill. While average citizens may be able to review and comment upon the on original version of legislation, they usually will be unaware of how profoundly it can be changed by amendments. Until amendments to bills are made widely available, Washington lobbyists will continue to have the opportunity to review amendments and to urge changes before the broader public has a similar opportunity. 
<p>
<li><b>Committee and subcommittee reports (when filed with the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate). </b> Even though bills may be available via Internet, they are likely to be incomprehensible to the non-lawyer. Committee and subcommittee reports help to translate technical language into comprehensible English. Such reports also offer a summary of congressional hearings on legislation and an examination of the rationale behind a bill, as well as the primary arguments for and against it. Currently, these documents are made available though THOMAS but only after they have been published by GPO. Making committee reports available as soon as possible would assure that those who are interested in a piece of legislation can receive the most current and comprehensive information about it. Waiting for printing before making information available on the Internet misses the huge advantage of electronic dissemination. The current policy resembles the early days of the automobile, when laws required that horse-drawn buggies with lanterns light the way for their speedier replacements.
<p>
<li><b> Hearing and mark-up transcripts (within five days).</b> Currently, most citizens have to wait until official committee publication to obtain transcripts of congressional hearings. Publication of such transcripts often takes months or even more than a year, frequently occurring when an issue once considered crucial has faded from center stage. Although the public is denied quick and free access to such transcripts, lobbyists can purchase them from private transcribing agencies. By making hearing and mark-up transcripts available, the proposed House Rule change would help to give every citizen the information easily available to special interests. The 104th Congress changed its rules to allow C-SPAN and citizens to attend more committee and subcommittee hearings and mark-ups; thus it is only fitting for citizens unable to attend a hearing personally or view it on television to be able to read what transpired. Now that the Internet is an option, there is no good reason why transcripts should be delayed because of printing schedules. 
<p>
<li><b>Prepared statements (when submitted).</b> When individuals testify before Congress, they are asked to provide written copies of their testimony for distribution to members of the committee. In addition to requiring hard copies, House and Senate committees should ask witnesses to submit their testimony on diskette. Prepared statements could then be made available immediately on the relevant committee Web site. 
<p>
<li><b>Schedules and notices (when distributed).</b> Posting committee and subcommittee notices, hearings, and mark-up meeting times would allow the public to better keep track of committee activities. Currently, advance information on committee meetings is most easily accessible through specialized publications that are targeted specifically at congressional staffers and lobbyists. Placing such information on the Internet would afford constituents the opportunity to contact their representatives to voice their concerns and suggest possible questions for witnesses.
<p>
<li><b>Committee rules (when approved or amended).</b> Committee rules include important technical procedures, whose nuances vary from committee to committee. Making these rules available to the public would help to demystify internal committee workings. 
<p>
<li><b>Oversight plans and activity reports.</b> Congress has broad constitutional authority to engage in oversight and investigation. Through its oversight of the executive branch, Congress often seeks to publicize or prevent abuses of federal authority, to identify wasteful federal programs, and to save federal tax dollars. House and Senate committees would more easily invite the participation of whistleblowers or others knowledgeable about a subject by making oversight plans more available. 
<p>
<li><b>Member and staff directories.</b> Members of Congress serve at the public's will. Their staffers, though unelected, are given the public's trust, and can wield enormous influence. Their office addresses and telephone numbers should be available to the public. Staff listings can be found in various Capitol Hill directories, but these books are expensive to purchase and not widely available outside the Washington, D.C., area. Making such information more easily available would be a boon to ordinary citizens. 
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By placing this vast array of information at the fingertips of the on-line public, the House Task Force recommendations would effectively open up the doors of congressional committees, thereby enhancing efforts at full, effective disclosure of congressional activity. 
<p>
<b>BROADENING DISCLOSURE POLICIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the impressive recommendations of the House Task Force, Congress should release additional information on line. In particular, Congress should place on line information in the public domain that has not been readily available electronically, including:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Conference Reports.</b> For a bill to become law, both chambers of Congress must approve identical versions of the same bill (the conference report). These reports can contain significant changes in legislation already voted on in the House and Senate, as conference compromises or additions may not have appeared in either congressional version of the legislation. As conference committees serve temporarily, they would not have a regular mechanism for publishing their reports, so the House and Senate standing committees with lead responsibility for a particular conference should place the compromise legislation and report on their own home pages.
<p>
<li><b>Voting records and (co)sponsorships for Members of the House and Senate.</b> Members of the House and Senate should be held accountable to constituents for their voting records. Numerous Web sites already publish select information on votes in the House and the Senate. If comprehensive voting records were readily accessible, constituents could more easily examine complete records of the performance of their representatives. Congress might even establish issue area databases that would group, for instance, all defense or transportation infrastructure votes. 
<p>
<li><b>Press releases and issue statements.</b> Press releases and issue statements are routinely sent to the national media and the regional press. By placing such documents on line, Members could better inform their constituents of their positions on various issues. 
<p>
<li><b>Franked mass mailings.</b> Congressmen are permitted to send mass mailing to their constituents for free, as long as the purpose of the mailing is to update citizens on their representative's official business. By placing the content of these publications on line, it would be much easier for journalists, watchdog groups, and political opponents to insure that this privilege is not used for electioneering.
<p>
<li><b>Congressional Research Service (CRS) Reports.</b> The CRS home page allows congressional staff access to a library of CRS Reports and Issue Briefs written at the request of Members of Congress. These reports summarize key research findings and the state of public opinion on a given public policy issue, and clearly explain the impact of proposed legislation. They often are a major source of information for congressional staffers and Members of the House and Senate in shaping prospective legislation. There is no reason to keep this information from the public, especially since the costly research services are funded by their tax dollars. To make such reports available, however, long-standing language in the House legislative branch appropriations requiring the CRS to focus solely on serving Congress would have to be amended. 
<p>
<li><b>House and Senate Records, including the Statement of Disbursements of the House, Secretary of the Senate Reports, and House and Senate Financial Disclosure Reports.</b> In the aftermath of the banking and post office scandals, the 104th Congress undertook significant measures to overhaul the documents that show how House members spend the funds available to run their offices (the Representational Allowances). Making this information more widely available would allow constituents to compare the franking and office expenditures of their elected representatives to those of other Senators and Congressmen and help to restore public confidence in Congress.
<p>
<li><b>Federal Election Commission reports.</b> In nearly every election, there is a clamor for campaign finance reform. One reason is the belief that special interests have been able to purchase access to Members of Congress. By allowing quick, free, and easy on-line access to Federal Election Commission reports, Congress could help to disperse some of the clouds of suspicion and misinformation surrounding campaign financing. 
<p>
<li><b>Lobbyist Disclosure Reports.</b> The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 closed numerous loopholes in lobby registration requirements. Currently, these forms are retrievable only by lobbyist, not by bill, committee, issue, or dollar amount. Placing these Disclosure Reports on line would make it much simpler for constituents to research the lobbying activity surrounding a particular issue or committee.
<p>
<li><b>Whistleblower Page.</b> By establishing a whistleblower page, Congress would encourage citizens -- some of whom may be reluctant or ignorant of how to file such reports -- to document cases of waste, fraud, and abuse, thereby potentially saving millions of tax dollars annually. A system operator working for the whistleblower page could forward appropriate information to the relevant committee, subcommittee, or federal agency inspector general. Strict precautions would need to be taken to maintain confidentiality for whistleblowers. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>WHAT A CONGRESSIONAL FOIA WOULD NOT DO</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By pledging to place information on the Internet, Congress would define its FOIA commitment. Increased access to official and committee documents will keep citizens better informed; however, the congressional FOIA should not be so broad as to allow unlimited access to all areas of congressional activity. Congress should not duplicate the FOIA that applies to executive branch agencies, whose members are not held accountable to the voters via the electoral process. Through its execution of the laws, executive branch agencies tend to affect individuals directly, whereas legislation is far more general in scope. Because of their particular powers and lack of direct accountability to the voters, executive branch agencies should be held to a different FOIA standard than the legislative branch. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legislative process is one of give-and-take, and individual Members often will shift position on given legislation as that legislation itself changes. Congressional staffers and Members have a right to operate with a degree of confidentiality, so that they do not fear that every word they write could one day become part of the public record. The Privacy Act of 1974 and the Computer Security Act of 1987 contain provisions that require federal offices to protect individuals from the unauthorized release of personal information and to protect the public from receiving documents that may not be accurate. Sensitive information in the computer systems of individual congressional offices should be protected from dissemination. Internal office memoranda and preliminary documents such as discussion drafts of bills, for example, should not be distributed on line, as such documents represent neither official actions nor even the considered viewpoint of a legislator.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By adding information recommended by the Task Force on Committee Reform to information that Congress already makes public, and by establishing an umbrella disclosure system through the Internet, Congress could devise a freedom of information system which is simultaneously comprehensive for the public but less invasive for the institution than is the executive branch process. Because the Congressional FOIA would be an internal congressional rule, complaints would be resolved within Congress, rather than by the courts. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The changes heralded by placing member offices and committee information on line should not be exaggerated. Increasing the amount of information on line should not, for instance, be seen as opening the gates for what has been termed electronic democracy. The congressional FOIA proposal falls far short of creating electronic plebiscites. Congressional Web sites should not become the locus of instantaneous and unscientific polling. In the eyes of America's Founding Fathers, Congress, particularly the Senate, was to be a deliberative body, not an immediate mirror of the public's unfettered passions and prejudices. Increasing public access to congressional documents can serve an important didactic role that dovetails well with the Founding Fathers' vision. 
<p>
<b>HOW TO IMPLEMENT A CONGRESSIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Several steps must be taken to implement a Congressional FOIA. On the first day of the 105th Congress, the House and Senate should adopt rules mandating that committees electronically disclose the information recommended in the Task Force on Committee Review report. At the same time, the House and Senate should provide for the establishment of "freedom of information" home pages. These pages would include links to sources of already disclosable information on Congress, including Federal Election Commission data, lobbying and financial disclosure reports, Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate reports, franking commission data, and Congressional Research Service reports. Some of this material, currently unavailable electronically, would need to be adapted to the new format.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To assure effective implementation of the Congressional FOIA, the House Oversight Committee and Senate Rules Committees should appoint advisory groups consisting of computer industry experts, journalists, and political scientists. These advisors would review the information Congress discloses and offer suggestions to improve the presentation, format, or types of information available. The boards would offer informed outside advice on congressional disclosure policy and also represent a congressional outreach to the Internet community and other information consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As a second step, the Senate Rules and House Oversight committees should be assigned the task of defining what categories of information individual Members' offices should be required to disclose via the Internet. These committees should also determine whether responsibility for posting such information -- such as franking costs, franked mass mailing, and financial disclosure forms -- should lie with each individual office or should be maintained through a central service. The House Oversight and Senate Rules committees should coordinate to assure that the information disseminated by House and Senate offices is as similar as possible, while respecting the divergent characters of the two congressional chambers. The Senate Rules and House Oversight reports, which should include an implementation schedule, should be completed no later than December 1997.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public input is essential to an effective Congress. The 104th Congress opened its procedures to the public more than ever before. The 105th Congress should build on this success by mandating widespread disclosure of congressional documents and information on the Internet by passing a Congressional Freedom of Information Act. Making House and Senate documents and information available on the Internet will allow citizens to better judge the effectiveness of their elected officials. Making committee documents available to the public at large will promote input on pending legislation from knowledgeable sources beyond the Beltway. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Furthermore, using the Internet as the freedom of information mechanism will allow Congress to determine and manage information disclosure without the disputes and confrontations that have characterized the executive branch freedom of information process. The enormous success of THOMAS -- 35 million computerized inquiries in just 22 months -- is proof of a clear constituency for the type of electronic information that a congressional FOIA would make available. Electronic access to such documents, moreover, is relatively inexpensive, especially when compared to old fashioned distribution by the Government Printing Office or the U.S. Postal Service. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Congressional FOIA would provide the public easy and prompt access to a variety of documents produced by the legislative branch. Much of the material that would be covered under a Congressional FOIA is already in the public domain, including press releases, voting records, legislative co-sponsorships, Federal Election Commission reports, conference reports, amendments to bills, and committee oversight plans. A Congressional FOIA would assure that such information is posted on the Internet in a standardized, user-friendly format. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to facilitating access to documents that Congress readily distributes, a Congressional FOIA would afford timely public access to committee and conference materials that previously had been released only in final format, including committee and subcommittee prints of bills and marks and preliminary transcripts of hearings and mark-ups. Afforded access to such materials in a timely fashion, citizens whose lives might be affected by amendments or new laws would be able to communicate with their representatives as legislation is being considered. Congress would be able to receive more feedback on legislative proposals than is possible in the typical half-day hearing with a limited number of witnesses. Policy specialists at universities, businesses, and in state and local governments also could offer perspectives that Congress would not otherwise hear.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet the main reason to enact a congressional FOIA is not to make Congress more effective, but because it is the right thing to do. In their offices and at committee meetings, Members of Congress are conducting the public's business. The public has a right to know what occurs in a detailed and timely fashion. Moreover, a congressional FOIA would allow citizens to comment on pending proposals. Without information on committee business in particular, only Washington insiders and high-powered lobbyists would have the ability to do anything to affect deals or amendments. Opening the congressional committee system to the 30 million households with personal computers can only enhance our democracy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both the House and the Senate would have to institute rules changes to implement a Congressional FOIA. Such rules changes would stipulate both the extent and the format of the information to be made available electronically. To assure effective execution of a Congressional FOIA, the relevant House and Senate committees should review implementation plans with the assistance of a group of scholars and information industry leaders.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By instituting a Congressional Freedom of Information Act, Congress would increase public access to committee documents over the Internet in an organized, comprehensive, and user-friendly manner. As Congress continues its efforts of the past two years to devolve power and authority away from Washington to citizens and the institutions they control directly, citizens will need increased access to the sources of information that will guide them. By empowering ordinary citizens at the expense of well-connected Washington insiders, a Congressional FOIA would be a critical step in reforming government.

<center><h2>This Week's Message (December 6)</h2></center>

<p>

Welcome to the FRC information line.  Please note FRC's new address!
Our phone and fax numbers remain the same.  This message will
continue to be updated periodically until the 105th Congress reconvenes
in January.

<p>

As President Clinton announces some of his <a href="#cabinet">Cabinet 
appointments</a>, an Hawaii court hands down a decision on 
<a href="#homosexual">homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;</a>
and the House and Senate organize for the <a href="#105">105th 
Congress</a>.

<p><a name="homosexual">

<h3>Issue One: Hawaii's Judicial Decision on Homosexual 
&quot;Marriage.&quot;</h3>

<p>

In a major setback for traditional marriage in Hawaii, Judge
Kevin Chang ruled on December 3 that the state constitution requires
the recognition of same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; or homosexual
&quot;marriage.&quot;  The judge based his decision on the argument
that the couples' <I>gender</I> was the cause for being refused
a marriage license.  Of course, the homosexual movement sees this
as a breakthrough in gaining equal status and gaining benefits
previously only given to traditional married couples, such as
tax and health insurance benefits.  Robert Knight, FRC's Director
of Cultural Studies denounced the court decision saying, &quot;In
striking down Hawaii's state law that preserves marriage as the
union of one man and one woman, Judge Kevin Chang has ignored
the wisdom of the ages, the will of the Hawaiian people, and ample
evidence of the state's compelling interest in preserving this
vital institution.  This decision underscores Congress' wisdom
in enacting the Defense of Marriage Act, which protects other
states from the Hawaiian courts' reckless activism.&quot;  Knight
calls on &quot;Americans to examine and to exercise ways to nullify
the actions of judges who flout the law.  This is no small legal
matter but an assault on morality and the rule of law itself.
Hawaiians can assist the entire nation by ending the judicial
arrogance that has precipitated this national threat to marriage.&quot;
The case will be appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme Court, and
in the meantime, no state &quot;marriage&quot; licenses for homosexual
couples will be issued.  Many legal analysts expect the State
Supreme Court to decide this case in the spring of 1997 and most
observers expect the Court to uphold Judge Chang's decision.
Homosexual couples &quot;married&quot; in Hawaii are then expected
to seek recognition of these unions by other states, if Judge
Chang's decision is upheld.  Homosexual activists are also expected
to file legal challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act, which
was enacted during the recently completed session of Congress.

<p><a name="105">

<h3>Issue Two: House and Senate Leadership and Committees for the 105th 
Congress.</h3>

<p>

In the House and Senate, both Democrats and Republicans have
largely re-elected their current leadership and made committee
assignments for the new 105th Congress, which convenes January
7, 1997.  In the House, Newt Gingrich was renominated Speaker
of the House;  Dick Armey for Majority Leader; and Tom DeLay for
Majority Whip.  Senate Republicans renominated Trent Lott of Mississippi
as the Majority Leader; Don Nickles (Okla.) Majority Whip; Connie
Mack (Fla.) as Conference Chairman; and Paul Coverdell (Ga.) as
Conference Secretary. FRC takes note that several new and current
pro-family Senators were assigned to key Senate Committees.  Senators
Lauch Faircloth (Ga.) and Larry Craig (Idaho) were assigned to
the powerful Appropriations Committee.  Pro-life Senator John
Ashcroft (Mo.) and Sen.-elect Jeff Sessions (Ala.) were assigned
to the Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for reviewing
federal judicial nominees.  In the House, pro-life Rep. Bob Livingston
remains chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, and
two pro-life Representatives-elect were added:  Anne Northup (Ky.)
and Robert Aderholt (Ala.).  However, abortion rights leaders
Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) will also
join the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, respectively.
Pro-life champion Henry Hyde (Ill.) remains chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee and four newly elected pro-life members were
added:  William Jenkins (Tenn.), Asa Hutchinson (Ark.), Ed Pease
(Ind.) and Chris Cannon of Utah.  Pro-life Rep. Charles Canady
will remain the chairman of the Constitution subcommittee, which
has jurisdiction over the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, religious
freedom, parental rights and other key family issues.

<p><a name="cabinet">

<h3>Issue Three: New Liberal Clinton Cabinet Nominees.</h3>

<p>

On Thursday December 5th, President Clinton announced some of his top 
Cabinet nominees that would lead our national defense policy team.  Among 
his selections for these top positions are Madeline Albright, former US 
Ambassador to the UN, and retiring Senator Bill Cohen (R-ME).  Although both
of these individuals are aptly qualified, well-liked and respected
for their foreign policy knowledge and experience, both nominees
are considered to be cultural liberals.  Senator Cohen's appointment
as Secretary of Defense appears to be a gesture towards the moderate
and liberal Republicans in Congress at a time when the power between
the two parties is almost evenly divided.  Senator Cohen has
served a distinguished career in the U.S. Senate, however, he
has a record of consistently supporting federal funding of abortion
and even voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  He
tends to support the homosexual rights agenda -- Sen. Cohen is
a supporter of legally recognized &quot;domestic partnerships&quot;
and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would
elevate 'sexual orientation' to a specially protected status in
the area of employment.

<p>

Madeline Albright, President Clinton's recommended Secretary of
State, is a distinguished leader in foreign policy as demonstrated
during her tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.  Yet,
in the midst of her broad background in foreign policy, her record
on cultural issues tends to be quite liberal.  As the leader of
the U.S. delegation to the Beijing Women's Conference, Albright
promised &quot;to see that American views and values are well
represented,&quot; however, the &quot;views and values&quot; which
she represented at the Conference were very much in line with
those advocated by western feminists -- an emphasis on &quot;reproductive
rights&quot; (i.e., abortion and unlimited contraceptive availability),
&quot;gender equality&quot; and the mainstreaming of a &quot;gender
perspective.&quot;  Although Ambassador Albright has expressed
opposition to forced abortions in China and religious persecution,
she has not backed any economic sanctions that would pressure
China to reform their human rights policies.

<p>

Thank you for calling the FRC Legislative Hotline.

						Clinton’s Phony War on Drugs
					</h1> 
        </center>
<p>
<center>by Malcolm Wallop</center>
<p>
Admidst much fanfare, President Clinton and Vice President Gore on March 7, 1996 
hosted a one-day summit titled “Youth Drug and Violence in America” to call attention 
to and issue recommendations about the related problems of teen violence and the 
skyrocketing use of illegal drugs by our nation’s youth.
<P>
It needs to be asked why it has taken an election year for President Clinton to discover 
that America’s drug problem has reached crisis levels.  The evidence that drug use among 
teenagers has been  rising during President Clinton’s term in office is overwhelming and 
has been obvious for some time.  Indeed the statistics are staggering:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI> The rate of monthly illicit drug use by children aged 12-17 increased 56 percent from 
1992 to 1994, according to the Clinton administration’s own estimates.
 <LI> The Justice Department reported in September 1995 that one of every three juvenile 
detainees was under the influence of drugs at the time of the offense.
<LI>  A December 1995 survey found that cocaine use by those in grades nine through 
twelve had increased 36 percent since 1992, and the use of hallucinogens had 
increased by 75 percent.
 <LI> Between 1992 and 1994, the rate of marijuana use among children 12-17 nearly 
doubled, according to the National Survey on Drug Use.
</UL>
<P>
Until now, President Clinton has paid little attention to what most Americans have 
recognized all along to be a national crisis.  Despite the tough talk and finger pointing at 
the drug summit, the Clinton administration’s response to America’s drug problem has 
been abysmal.  A quick look at the facts:
<UL>
 <LI> In his first year in office, Clinton cut his drug policy staff by 85 percent.
 <LI> Last year, the Clinton administration proposed cutting more than 100 drug 
prosecutors from US attorney’s offices and cutting funding for interdiction and drug 
intelligence programs.
 <LI> The Drug Enforcement Agency trained no special agents in 1993, and none were 
budgeted to be trained in 1994 or 1995.
 <LI> Attorney General Janet Reno announced soon after taking office that she wanted to 
reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related crimes.  Not 
surprisingly, the number of federal drug prosecutions has been dropping.
<LI>  And who can forget Clinton’s own Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who advocated 
legalizing drugs in order to reduce the crime rate.
<P>
</UL>
In announcing his drug summit last November, President Clinton stated that it is 
important to counter messages that tell children it is “cool, sexy, attractive to drink or get 
high.”  He will surely want to explain why, then, when asked on MTV in 1992 if he 
would inhale marijuana if he had to do it all over again, he responded to laughter: “Sure if 
I could.  I tried before.”
<P>
President Clinton’s total lack of leadership in the war on drugs over the past three years 
should cause all Americans to view skeptically his embrace of the issue in an election 
year.  The tragedy is that prior to his election in 1992, America was winning the war on 
drugs.  Even NBC News reported that “Just Say No” was an effective message in the 
1980s.
<P>
Then, presidential leadership was highly visible, though tough and effective.  And, as a 
consequence, drug use plummeted.  Between 1985 and 1992, overall drug use was cut in 
half.  The number of cocaine users dropped from 5.8 million to 1.8 million.  The number 
of marijuana users fell from 22 million to 8.5 million.  The percentage of high school 
seniors who used drugs was reduced from a high of 54.2 percent in 1979 to 27.1 percent 
in 1992.
<P>
The reason?  Children were continually bombarded with the message that drugs were 
wrong.  Dealers were put on notice that peddling drugs to kids would not be tolerated.  
And both the Bush and Reagan administrations pursued tough drug enforcement and 
interdiction policies.
<P>
Sadly, these trends have been reversed in just three years.  Any progress that we as a 
nation were making in curtailing drug use has been destroyed because the Clinton 
administration fled the field of battle and has been missing ever since.
President Clinton’s drug summit was an indication that his pollsters can recognize a 
campaign issue.  But we must demand more than campaign events and photo 
opportunities from our president.  The lives of millions of young people are at stake.

<title> Welfare Reform: Can the States Fly Solo? - Policy Review - November-December 1996</title>

<center><h2>Welfare Reform: Can the States Fly Solo?</h2> <b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i><br>
<a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/toc.html">November-December 1996, Number 80</a></b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote>
<p>

<h3><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship asked four state welfare officials -- Eloise Anderson of California, Vance McMahan of Texas, Don Taylor of Mississippi, and Jason Turner of Wisconsin -- to comment on the following questions about what the welfare-reform legislation of 1996 will mean for their states:</i></h3>
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>States have been ahead of the federal government in welfare reform for many years, and 43 states have already received some sort of waiver from federal welfare rules. What will be the most important changes for your state as a result of the federal legislation? How do these compare in magnitude with reforms your state has already embarked on?</i></b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Eloise Anderson, director, California Department of Social Services:</b> Under the new federal welfare legislation, recipients will no longer be able to receive aid indefinitely (until the youngest child at home turns 18) without working. Time limits will force more people into jobs. This will lead to more families entering the mainstream and over time becoming self-sufficient. Government will cease to be the first place families turn to when in trouble. And childbearing and parenting will again be a primary responsibility of parents.
<p>
<table width="170" align="right" cellspacing="7" cellpadding="7">
<tr>
<td valign=center>
<hr width=75></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>AFDC died on September 30, 1996. California, Mississippi, Texas, and Wisconsin say they're ready to take over</h3></font>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=center>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Families will become more accountable to each other. States will be given the opportunity to treat married and single-parent families more equally so that there is no penalty for marriage. Stricter paternity establishment will lead to greater child support. There will be no aid for teen parents who drop out of school and they will be required to live at home or in an adult-supervised setting as a condition of aid.  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The legislation also will remove costly and restrictive federal mandates and give states a <i>little</i> more flexibility to design programs that work best for their communities. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Vance McMahan, policy director, Office of the Governor, State of Texas:</b> The biggest impact of the federal welfare legislation may, at first, be more symbolic than substantive. The decision to end the federal entitlement to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) marks a reversal of 61 years of social policy, an admission that the current welfare system has become more a cause of poverty than a cure, and a recognition that perhaps someone outside Washington, D.C., may be able to do a better job at helping those in need. By so doing, the federal law gives states and communities more freedom to tailor their policies to reflect the values and specific needs of their people. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ending the welfare entitlement has also changed the fundamental question. Instead of asking, "What is this person entitled to?," states can now ask, "What does this person need to become self-sufficient?" By changing the question, the bill gives states the freedom to try different answers. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a practical matter, the bill's initial impact will be limited, since it allows states to continue to operate under existing waivers. Texas will be affected by the decision to cut off food stamps and SSI to some legal immigrants. State officials are trying to determine the impact of this provision. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new work-participation requirements will also affect Texas. Texas does not have a generous welfare grant ($188 a month for a family of three) and thus tends to have a welfare population that is relatively poorer and less educated than other states. Governor George Bush is, however, committed to marshaling all necessary resources to liberate as many people as possible from dependence on government. Welfare rolls in Texas have shrunk by 15 percent during his term. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Don Taylor, executive director, Mississippi Department of Human Services:</b> The current legislation provides a long overdue shifting of the balance of power between federal and state levels of government. Congress finally acknowledged that the "one size fits all" federal programs are an abysmal failure, so states will now be allowed to tailor welfare plans to meet specific needs of their states. We may now correctly measure the success of our programs by the number of individuals placed in the work force, not the number enrolled in training programs that often have no connection to the actual job market. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Jason Turner, director of capacity building, Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development:</b> The new law could not have been passed at a more propitious time for Wisconsin -- just as we were negotiating with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over the terms of the waiver, the new law made it possible to implement Governor Tommy Thompson's radical welfare replacement program, "Wisconsin Works," or "W2," without major compromises. This plan eliminates AFDC entirely and replaces it with a system of work opportunities for individuals of all abilities. It differs from other reform initiatives (such as two-years-and-off plans) in that no unrestricted cash assistance is provided, not even temporarily. Instead, individuals who need family income will have four work options available, starting at the top (private employment) and working down to community-service jobs or sheltered workshops, if necessary. Temporary "bridge" loans, subsidized child care, and subsidized medical insurance will be made available -- whatever is absolutely necessary to make work possible. But in the end, all parents will enjoy the dignity of earning their family income through work. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There were many obstacles for the governor to overcome in order to realize this concept. The ideological left in Wisconsin and in Washington had fully mobilized to oppose W2. But a new Republican legislative majority in Madison and the new federal legislation passed in Washington combined to make their protests moot.

<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Many liberals predict that children and families will be hurt by the welfare legislation. The Urban Institute has predicted an increase of 1.1 million children in poverty. The National Coalition for the Homeless declares that "without increased resources for child care, affordable housing, health care and education, this reform will prove to be most effective at moving people from welfare . . . into deeper poverty and homelessness." And Hugh Price, the president of the National Urban League, predicts that "desperate mothers" will "turn to hustling, prostitution, drug dealing, or panhandling." He says that "Washington has decided to end the War on Poverty and begin a war on poor children." How do you respond? </i></b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> The Urban Institute's and the National Urban League's predictions on poverty and homelessness do not take into account the behavioral changes that will result from time limits and other new rules under this welfare legislation. The panic is unwarranted.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Welfare recipients are no different than anybody else. They will do what it takes to survive. Once government gets out of their way, welfare recipients will respond accordingly.  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I take issue with the National Urban League's assumption that "desperate mothers" will "turn to hustling, prostitution, drug dealing, or panhandling." I see this as a put-down of AFDC recipients. These people are not criminals or lowlifes. I have always said that AFDC recipients are capable, rational, and smart enough to make it on their own without government's help. Advocates need to quit demeaning them as if they are helpless, hopeless, and criminal without government intervention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> The "war on poor children" began, however unintentionally, with the expansion of the welfare state, which trapped families in dependency by discouraging work and marriage. Studies show children raised in a welfare environment suffer from decreased cognitive abilities and increased behavioral and emotional problems. In Texas, we are committed to taking care of those who truly cannot take care of themselves. As for the rest of the welfare population, we will no longer treat them as victims and wards of the state, but instead as responsible individuals capable of self-improvement and self-sufficiency. That's why Texas requires each welfare recipient to sign a personal responsibility contract outlining what the state will do for them (give them a hand up through job placement, child care, transportation, et cetera) and what they will do in return (work, learn, or train for benefits; identify the father of their child; have their children immunized; stay off drugs; et cetera). <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> The "war on children" began when the federal government rewarded nonwork and nonmarriage. While perhaps well meaning, those who advocate raising family income artificially through welfare have made the state a competitor with the father and mother as the key providers for the family. In Mississippi, the value of welfare benefits to unwed mothers now exceeds the income of 17 to 30 percent of all single men. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Too many liberals still have a paternalistic plantation mentality. They think welfare recipients are incapable of achieving self-sufficiency, and thus forever dependent on government largesse. I invite those liberals to mull over the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt: "Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Half the counties in Wisconsin have reduced their AFDC caseloads <i>by more than 70 percent</i> since 1987 without succumbing to the dire predictions of the liberals. Since January of this year, Milwaukee has been reducing its caseload at an annual rate of 24 percent, and general assistance for childless adults was ended entirely last year without Wisconsin's largest city heaving-to. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What liberals have entirely failed to grasp is that social maladies, including poverty, are the result of learned behavior in which enforced idleness is a contributing factor. Far from sending nonworking adults "over the edge," required work thrusts people into constructive social interactions that can lift this depression born of isolation, and can identify other problems for resolution. <p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Many conservatives have argued that the principal objective of welfare reform should be to bring down the rate of illegitimacy and divorce. Do you think this will be achieved by the new welfare bill in your state? If so, how? If not, how else can families in your state be put back together?</i></b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> The aim of welfare reform is to make life better for children. Right now, AFDC children are left out of the mainstream because their parents are not required to work. They see their parents being unproductive and getting food, clothing, and shelter without having to work. Children become so unfamiliar with work that they lack the skills and discipline they need to succeed in a job. Nor do children ever see marriage, or understand its value. Having children out of marriage becomes the norm, and men are devalued. They never see a father in the home. Government has become the father, the provider of the family. By emphasizing work, welfare reform will lead to cooperation between a father and a mother, and create an interdependence for the well-being of the children, which will lead to cultural mainstreaming and stronger families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> No piece of legislation, no matter how bold, can single-handedly reverse the breakdown of the family. At a minimum, we can at least eliminate incentives to destructive behavior. To its credit, the federal welfare bill does that by setting tough work standards, requiring teen parents to live at home or in an adult-supervised setting, and providing incentive bonuses to states that reduce out-of-wedlock births.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governor Bush has worked to enact similar changes in Texas, but he also recognizes that out-of-wedlock births, hard-core drug use, and violent juvenile crime are fundamentally moral and spiritual problems that can't be solved by government alone. The solution to these problems lies in changing the culture, renewing our commitment to God, and returning to our bedrock values. In Texas, we are working not only to reform welfare, but also to nurture institutions that have traditionally and more effectively communicated our basic values: charities, churches, synagogues, and neighborhoods. These institutions hold the most promise for changing lives through compassion that is, in Marvin Olasky's words, "challenging, personal, and spiritual." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> More than 44 percent of births in Mississippi in 1993 were to unmarried mothers, and for teenagers, more than three-fourths of all births were illegitimate. Welfare has eroded the social foundation of marriage and made it financially irrelevant. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The welfare bill now allows our state to craft eligibility and benefits regulations to encourage marriage rather than reward irresponsible behavior. We hope this will begin to overcome the corrosive effect of welfare on the family structure. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Under W2, income is only received through work, so there is no economic incentive for illegitimacy. Nor can teens set up independent households with cash benefits under W2 -- they must live with their parents or in a supervised home for unwed mothers. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The authors of the welfare-reform bill should be commended for offering financial rewards to states that reduce illegitimacy. Although state policymakers have only an indirect influence on illegitimacy, this provision puts the subject on the table for ongoing discussion and debate. Let us look forward to the day when illegitimacy replaces poverty as our most-discussed social indicator. <p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that most states will accept a financial penalty rather than try to comply with the work requirements of the welfare legislation. Do you believe your state will be able to move the required proportion of recipients from welfare to work? And if so, how will you do this?</i></b>  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> Meeting the tough work requirements will be a challenge, but we have every intention of succeeding. Our current welfare-to-work program has achieved tremendous results in California counties even where unemployment rates are high. Last year, when Los Angeles County shifted from a classroom-training emphasis to a "work first" approach, the number of job placements for welfare recipients skyrocketed by 400 percent to 25,000. In rural Calaveras County, job placements from 1992-93 to 1994-95 increased by 90 percent. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our Employment Development Department is identifying entry-level jobs that are available in different communities, and the skills needed for those jobs. Relocation is one avenue to those jobs that we are looking into. But government can only help bridge the gap. The private sector is the job provider. Neighborhoods, communities, and churches also play a role in helping recipients become successful. And the real work in moving out of dependency must be done by the recipients. We must shift from the notion that government has the answers and will rescue people from themselves. We can provide people with information, but it is up to them to use it. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> The bar is high. The federal welfare bill sets a work participation rate of 25 percent for Fiscal Year 1997, rising to 50 percent for FY 2002. Yet the highly acclaimed work program in Riverside, California, managed to place only 30 percent of welfare recipients in long-term jobs. Given the flexibility to tailor work programs to the needs of our welfare population, Texas is committed to doing its best to meet the standard. We will have to restore the virtue and value of fatherhood. We will have to contract with private companies to place welfare recipients in real jobs, paying only for results. We will have to challenge and create incentives for Texas's private sector to provide more slots for on-the-job training for welfare recipients. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> Mississippi is already meeting the mandate with our WorkFirst pilot program. Under WorkFirst, implemented in 1995, the emphasis is on work, not on open-ended entitlements. The clients' first contact after being approved for benefits is with a job-placement specialist, not a social worker, as in the past. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The ability of states to meet the mandated work requirements is grossly underestimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Federal bureaucrats are undoubtedly fearful that states will, in fact, be successful in this endeavor and therefore set the stage for future transfer of additional programs to state control. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Work participation standards are an important tool for states. And universal recipient participation in some work activity is the only proven way for most programs to achieve dramatic results. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The CBO and many states are unnecessarily concerned about the cost of providing work requirement slots. These slots are by and large cheap to run -- the major expense is that of subsidizing associated child care in order to permit the covered individuals to work. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This concern also ignores a central dynamic of welfare reform. When individuals are faced with a choice of receiving welfare benefits in exchange for working in a work-requirement slot, or else going to work for wages in the private sector economy, most will choose the latter. Under these circumstances, the caseload quickly shrinks.
<p>
<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>Now that states have full responsibility for welfare, what elements of this responsibility would you like to turn over to churches, businesses, and other private organizations?</i> </b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> States now have the primary responsibility for welfare, but they cannot do it alone. Faith-based groups can provide counseling, temporary food and shelter, and clothing for those in need. Businesses need to be receptive to hiring. Goodwill Industries has worked with us closely to help those who face barriers to employment. It has a long history of helping the disabled find mainstream employment. Using nonprofits such as Goodwill is vital to the success of the new programs. We need to stop thinking that government owes us something and start thinking about duty, personal responsibility, and communities coming together to help those in crisis.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> Media reports on the welfare bill have overlooked a significant provision -- the "charitable choice" clause. Under "charitable choice," private, charitable, and faith-based groups can compete for contracts or participate in voucher programs whenever a state uses nongovernment providers to deliver welfare services. If we are to replace welfare with a more compassionate and effective system, faith-based institutions will have to be part of the answer -- whether it's a church providing day care or Victory Fellowship helping people kick drug addiction. As Governor Bush has said: "Government can hand out money, but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Governor Bush rejects the statist view that government has exclusive jurisdiction for the poor; rather, government shares responsibility with society's "little platoons" that do the heavy lifting of changing lives from the inside out. Texas's mission is to facilitate and cultivate these untapped resources, not to displace them, and certainly not to secularize their religious character. The governor has appointed a 16-member advisory task force on faith-based community-service programs to determine how best to free faith-based programs and organizations from unreasonable government regulations and allow them to go about the business of changing lives.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> Mississippi's "Faith and Families" program matches volunteer AFDC recipients to local churches and synagogues, thus restoring the historical role of religious institutions to help unfortunate members of their communities. To date, almost 300 churches and synagogues have been enlisted to "adopt" welfare recipients in their communities to help them transition into the work force.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The business community will now be able to determine and provide the type of training necessary to move welfare recipients into the work force. In lieu of the ineffective training provided by a variety of government programs for jobs that often do not exist, local businesses can provide real skills for real jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> Wisconsin now requires an AFDC applicant to enter into an interactive problem-solving session with a caseworker, who helps the applicant look for alternatives to welfare, including immediate employment. It has been shockingly effective -- in Milwaukee 28 percent of those exiting the problem-solving session decide they can do without AFDC after all, and elsewhere the proportion is as high as 50 percent. Interviews indicate that many AFDC applicants <i>like the idea that someone is helping them decide to do what they knew was right all along</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The point here is that many trapped inside the system are looking for some kind of moral guidance. But by and large government is not equipped to provide this guidance -- nor should it be. Under W2, churches are being asked to help develop homes for teen mothers and private charities are offering work opportunities for those needing to practice work before entering competitive private employment. Finally, the entire system, which was formerly run exclusively by state and county government, will be open under W2 to any private providers of services on a competitive bid basis.

<b><font size="+2">Q</font>: <i>What do you most dislike about the legislation, and why?</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Anderson (California):</b> There are still strings attached that work against California. The "maintenance of effort" requirement was not removed from the SSI/SSP program for the aged, blind, and disabled, giving us no flexibility to make the program more effective and cost-efficient. This will mean a loss in savings of $277 million for California.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal legislation is geared more toward state-run welfare systems and not county-run systems such as California's. We have far different issues than state-run programs and we need to be treated differently.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We are also a border state with nearly 40 percent of the legal immigrant population of this country. I believe that sponsors of immigrants should be held accountable for taking care of their own. If legal immigrants want to enjoy the benefits of their adopted homeland, they should take the next step and become U.S. citizens. However, I also believe immigration is a federal responsibility. The responsibility of caring for legal immigrants who have been allowed to enter federal programs should be a federal responsibility, not a state or local responsibility.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This welfare reform bill came to us in a 400-page document. If this is a first step, then I can accept it. If this is the end result, however, then the feds really haven't changed the rules.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	California needs relief from federal mandates, not more or different mandates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>McMahan (Texas):</b> The federal welfare bill does not allow states to receive credit for persons diverted from welfare or those who find a job after being on welfare for less than six months. States should be rewarded for such efforts. It is more expensive and more difficult to get someone off welfare than to take steps to keep them from ever going on. The bill also ties the hands of states by requiring a "maintenance of effort." This limits states' flexibility to design and implement their own programs and set their own spending priorities. The bill contains a number of other strings that ensure continued federal involvement.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States were not given any new flexibility on Medicaid. Federal mandates have made Medicaid the 800-pound gorilla of most state budgets -- at the expense of education and other programs. Medicaid now costs more than AFDC, food stamps, and SSI combined, and it keeps growing. In Texas, Medicaid spending as a percent of the state budget increased from 13 percent to 21 percent from 1990 to 1995. Fundamental welfare reform should include giving states freedom from oppressive Medicaid mandates so they can maximize the use of limited health-care dollars.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Taylor (Mississippi):</b> The reporting and data requirements of the 1996 legislation are burdensome, expensive, and time-consuming. The data required by the law exceed the needs of the state to effectively administer and efficiently monitor the program. These make-work requirements are a monumental waste of tax dollars designed to ensure that returning funds to the states will not adversely affect the number of federal bureaucrats in Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some habits die hard.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Turner (Wisconsin):</b> There is so much to like about the current federal legislation that one is loath to criticize, lest we all wake up and find out that the end of AFDC was just a wishful dream. So let us just take this opportunity to thank all of those who worked so hard for this day, including the leadership of the Congress and those engaged in the intellectual debates, including <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, the publisher of this magazine.

<p>
I have a feeling that the United States government is more corrupt today than at any other 
time in its history. I am not saying that there are more people on the take, that there are more 
bribes. I am not talking about Whitewater or comparable incidents. I am talking about a 
government corrupted by power. I am saying that the government has no sense of accountability 
or responsibility, and that the government of the United States actually views us, not as its 
citizens, but as its subjects. It has completely lost complete sight of the premise that the federal 
government derives its power from the states and from the people, and not the reverse.
I have found few days to be as enraging as those during which the Senate debated the 
Mitchell Health Care Plan. I read in the text of the plan that the states were allowed to levy taxes 
on the health care premiums of their citizens so that the states could pay for the new obligations 
that the federal government was imposing on them. The fact that we were permitted to do this, 
and that no one seemed to think that this was anything unusual, tells you how far we have gone 
down the road to statism.  Both parties, each for slightly different reasons, shoulder significant 
levels of guilt in this matter.
<P>
The federal government expresses its newfound dominion in a variety of ways. It exerts 
pressure through its courts, through the executive branch and through Congress. The federal gov-
ernment is now forcing the states to struggle with the imposition of unfunded mandates, a 
powerful concept under which the federal government tells the states what they must do and 
directs them to do it in the absence of federal funding.
<P>
	Congress long ago began to sense the rising tide of anti-tax sentiment and it just slipped 
the bond, ordered the States to raise taxes, and got out of it quite well. Congress also withholds 
funds in order to coerce the states' behavior. Look at what is happening in Virginia. While the 
EPA turns down plan after plan, the federal government threatens to withhold highway funds.  
The government also withheld funds from Wyoming for a long time because we did not raise the 
age of drinking for teenagers.
<P>
Some of the problems that we are now having are directly related to the Tenth Amendment. 
The federal government is a temptress. It holds out the promise of things to the states, but its 
promises are conditional. The Goals 2000: Educate America Act is one instance where this 
happened. The Crime Bill is another example. The idea is that if states conform their penal code 
to a concept developed in Washington, then money will be available for them to build prisons 
and hire police. The only problem is that to get the money, states have to cede authority back to 
the federal government.
<P>
The State is endlessly thumbing its nose at property rights. It is only now becoming a 
political liability to ignore them. Friedreich A. von Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, 
said that property is the key to guaranteeing freedom. According to von Hayek, any state which 
controls the power of property and production controls everything, and under these conditions, 
there can be no liberty or democracy.
<P>
	In 1993, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt gave an interview to Rolling Stone 
Magazine. The interviewer asked Babbitt about the concept of property rights. Babbitt replied 
that the old Anglo-Saxon idea of lines in the ground is no longer useful, that we have to develop 
a more communitarian sense of the rights of property. In response, the startled Rolling Stone 
interviewer commented that, in a more hysterical time, that notion would have been called 
communistic. My feeling is that you do not have to have lived in a hysterical time to have that 
reaction.
<P>
There are astonishing threats to free speech on the part of the federal government. Not the 
least of these threats is the recent Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) assault 
on a Berkeley group protesting the establishment of a housing project for the homeless in their 
neighborhood. The group was being investigated for violation the Fair Housing Act, simply for 
voicing their opinion that the housing plan had not been well thought out. Apparently, the 
government has decided that you may not object to administrative decisions under the Fair 
Housing Act.
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) told my community of Sheridan, Wyoming 
that it was in danger of putting the health and well-being of all of its citizens at risk if it contin-
ued to use its present water supply system. The EPA, pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, 
ordered Sheridan to install a new drinking water supply system. The community and the county 
worked with the EPA to develop a new reservoir and a new delivery plan and the plan was 
deemed acceptable by the administrators of the Act. There was debate in the community, as there 
always is within a community, over whether we ought to tax ourselves to implement the plan.  
On the day of the vote on the taxation issue, the EPA Region VIII Director issued a press release 
stating that if Sheridan did not vote to tax its elf, it would be fined an amount that would exceed 
our total assessed valuation within ten days of the imposition of the fine.  At that moment, we 
should have told the federal bureaucrats that they could be the mayor and county commissioner 
of Sheridan, that the county was theirs. But we did not tell them this and we voted to implement 
the plan.
<P>
Then, we were told by administrators of the Clean Water Act that we were going to flood 
some wetlands. The fact is that the wetland that we were flooding had been created by the 
original reservoir. Nonetheless, the EPA told us that we could not do it. Then the Corps of 
Engineers also said that we could not do it but then informed us that people would die and we 
would incur a large fine if we did not do it. So the community asked us, the congressional 
delegation, to get involved and see if there was a solution. In response, the Corps of Engineers 
and the EPA threatened the community for approaching their elected representatives. In my 
experience, threats of retaliation for appeals to elected representatives are not unique.
In short, the EPA said that we had not adequately assessed the alternative of condemnation. 
Keep in mind that this was a situation where a community's needs were more than fully satisfied 
by its existing water supply system, despite the fact that it had not quite satisfied all the ins and 
outs of the EPA. It seems very peculiar that under these circumstances the federal government 
would complain that the community failed to examine whether it had the authority to take water 
from some citizens of the community that is needed by other community residents.
<P>
	Every American is familiar with the Declaration of Independence's flowing statement, 
"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed 
by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of 
Happiness - That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their 
just Powers from the Consent of the Governed. . . .”    Every school boy and school girl knows it. 
It is published and promoted all the time. I suspect, however, that far fewer people are familiar 
with the passage which directly follows it, the portion which states that "whenever any Form of 
Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish 
it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its 
Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."
This is not a call to tear up the Constitution and start over. I do not believe that the 
Constitution is the problem. I do submit that there is an increasingly contentious relationship 
between our government and its citizens or, as I perceive it, the government and its subjects. 
Where does this contentiousness come from? It comes from within the bowels of the unelected 
bureaucrats - not identifiable, not removable. No one knows how to get at a government that 
reacts in such ways.
<P>
The topic chosen for this conference brought to mind an article I wrote for Notre Dame Law 
School's Journal of Legislation entitled, "Tyranny in America: Would Alexis Recognize This 
Place Today?'' In his book, Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville assessed the prospect 
of despotism materializing in the United States. De Tocqueville asserted that, "the species of 
oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything which ever before 
existed in the world. . . .” Contrary to mankind's previous experience with despotism, de 
Tocqueville predicted a new form.  De Tocqueville continued, "if despotism were to be 
established amongst the democratic nations of our day, it might assume a different character; it 
would be more extensive and more mild; it would degrade men without tormenting them. . . . I 
have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers, but rather with guardians."
<P>
	His warnings are pertinent to the topic of this conference because he describes self-
government as America's greatest virtue and its most sturdy impediment to tyranny. Self-govern-
ment was the bulwark which could ultimately protect the people of the United States from the 
advent of, what he termed, "administrative despotism". He felt the key to preventing ad-
ministrative despotism was maintaining and recognizing the fundamental differences between a 
centralized government and a centralized administration of that government. He elaborated on it 
by noting that the former exists in America, but the latter is nearly unknown there.
If the government, after having established the general principles of government, descended 
to the details of their application and if, having regulated the great interests of the country, it 
could descend to the circle of individual interests, freedom would soon be banished.  It is a very 
prophetic view of what we might do to ourselves as a nation with the democracy that we possess.
The original Articles of Confederation failed largely because the sovereign states retained 
total control over the powers of taxation, the raising of armies, and the regulation of commerce. 
As a result, the premise of the constitutional scheme devisethe delegates to the Constitutional 
Convention in 1787 was increased centralization of power and authority at the federal level. It 
was never their intent, however, that the administration of the central government was to be 
handled by or directed from the federal level. Far from it, Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist 
17 and 31, and James Madison in 46, repeatedly expressed their devout belief in, and the citizens' 
strong preference for government of a proximate nature.
<P>
	De Tocqueville's description mirrored this conception of American governance. He noted 
that, in the American republics, the secondary affairs of society had never been regulated by 
central authority and nothing to date has revealed its desire to interfere in them. The splendor of 
American society in those days was the almost invisible nature of government from the 
perspective of the average citizen.  Even when the federal government was empowered to act, it 
was largely incapable of forcing its will upon the citizens. If there was tremendous dissatisfaction 
with a directive of the federal government, state and local officials had sufficient stature and 
power to obviate what they believed to be illicit or malevolent actions. Also, the state and local 
officials were generally recognized as being closer, in terms of interest, to the people that were 
served, and thus in a better position to understand and respect the needs and desires of citizens. 
When the central government issued a decree, it had to entrust the execution of its will to its 
agents, over whom it frequently had no control. The townships, municipal bodies and counties 
form numerous concealed breakwaters which served to check or part the tides of popular 
determination. If an oppressive law were passed, liberty would still be protected by the method 
by which the law is executed.
<P>
With the modern advent of the unfunded mandate, of the overzealous bureaucrat, of coercive 
federal court orders and of the blackmail of States and localities though the attachment of strings 
to the granting of federal funds, the federal government circumvents all the protections that we 
thought were in place against administrative despotism. The statist view, and again I think that 
both parties are guilty of a major statist view, is that society has changed so dramatically that 
ordinary citizens cannot be trusted to make complex decisions themselves. Since citizens cannot 
be relied on to make enlightened and responsible decisions, the federal government has to 
determine the proper course for its citizens and ensure that its directives are enforced. This 
approach fundamentally asserts that self-government is ideal if it is simple and convenient, but 
not worth pursuing if it proves challenging or difficult. The principle of allowing citizens to 
make those choices for themselves which most directly affect them should be considered 
inviolable, irrespective of changing political climates, but it has not been considered inviolable.
<P>
	According to de Tocqueville, self-government is not only ideal but necessary since, even 
if the citizens of a nation are ignorant, apathetic, and selfish, any attempt by government to make 
the important or difficult decisions for them would only further aggravate these tendencies, not 
improve them. The reason is simple: it is precisely the exercise of self-government which makes 
citizens more attentive, more active.
<P>
A marvelous example of the enervating effects of democratic participation occurred 
following an incident in Kentucky in which a man in a pick-up truck drove up the exit ramp of an 
interstate highway. He was drunk. He crashed into a busload of children, burning them all - it 
was a terrible, terrible thing. The county in which it took place began to think that it was alcohol, 
not this individual, who was to blame. A referendum was put on the ballot forbidding all alcohol, 
in any form, for sale or consumption anywhere within the county.  In a county averaging forty 
percent participation in the electoral process, eighty-eight percent turned out to turn down that 
initiative. So, when affected, people do participate.
<P>
What has happened, though, with the advent of the Civil War, the Supreme Court's ever 
expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, the New Deal, the Warren Court's Activism, 
and the Great Society is that the locus of power has shifted decidedly to the central government. 
The citizens of America are beginning to be fed up with this and have declared this shift in power 
to be a failure. One of the most fascinating parts of this rejection by the American people is what 
is happening in the area of postal services.  With Federal Express, United Parcel Service, faxes 
and other things, we are now bypassing a government function that is largely viewed as 
inefficient.
<P>
In the area of security, the American people have basically declared that the police and the 
courts have not protected the country. There are neighborhood watches. There are external 
security systems around housing complexes. There are even some cities barring access to the city 
from the surrounding areas with gates and other methods of protection. In New York City, there 
are the Guardian Angels, and in most communities there are shopping malls.
<P>
	Every one always says, what do you mean malls? How are malls relevant to this 
discussion? My answer is that malls are what cities used to be. Go to a mall on a Saturday night 
and you see families walking safely with each other. You see young couples. You see people 
shopping. You see them standing in line for theaters. You see them at cafes enjoying themselves, 
feeling perfectly secure. Why? Because malls are private property and private security 
arrangements keep vagrants and other people out of them. In contrast, cities are not allowed to 
keep these people off the street.
<P>
In the area of education, there is a large move now toward privatization. States are beginning 
to experiment with all kinds of vouchers and other sorts of things. Families, not rich families but 
poor families, are trying to escape an educational system that is failing them and that is keeping 
them where they are. All around America you see people beginning to take action.
If we are going to change, it seems to me that several things have to take place. It is critical 
that the size and scope of government, both in manpower and resources, be severely limited. 
When people are talking about reducing taxes, it is the only means by which to reduce 
government. The government that is so big that it does not have to concern itself is too big to be 
a free government and it is becoming less free. Some of us believe that there ought to be an 
experimental assault on article III, section 2, pruning the right of the court to make certain 
decisions  
<P>
I honestly believe that we are at a sort of watershed time now, and I believe that watershed 
can actually work to our direct benefit if we recognize what must happen. Government cannot 
prescribe morals, but it can get out of the way. It can allow the can allow speech. I believe there 
are five legislative points and five points for any presidency that are important. Whatever they 
propose ought to be judged according to this five principles: 1) whether it restricts the growth of 
government; 2) whether it expands personal liberty; 3) whether it will it create economic growth; 
4) whether it will foster America's traditional value; and 5) whether it will ensure American 
security.
<P>
There is a last quote that I need to read you, also from the Declaration of Independence:
<blockquote>
<i>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for 
light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are 
more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the 
Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, 
pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute 
Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide 
new Guards for their future Security.</i>
</blockquote>
<P>
I believe that we are teetering on that time, and I believe that the powers of courts will be pruned 
if courts do not prune their powers themselves. I believe that people will begin to take back some 
of the powers that the States have lost under the Tenth Amendment.  I believe that you will find 
all kinds of resistance, as you are now finding from Virginia, from Wyoming, from Arizona, 
from Nevada, from other states, and from California, with their challenge to the federal 
government on the issue of immigrants.  You are beginning to see to movements to right 
ourselves. Organizations such as this one will serve as the intellectual basis from which these 
changes are derived.
<P>
<br>
<b>At this point, Senator Wallop took questions from the audience:  </b>
<P>
QUESTION: My question has to do with the premise of restriction.
<P>
SENATOR WALLOP: I do not pretend or propose to relegate all this power to the state 
legislatures, but I believe we have to demand a certain level of prudence. The states do have 
power, and the powers that were reserved to the states were not reserved to the federal 
government. Yet now these powers have been virtually universally usurped.  
<P>	
I do not believe that, for example, one welfare law crafted in Washington has any chance of 
being useful throughout America. We have seen that it does not work because, having spent well 
over a trillion dollars, poverty has increased in the United States since the Great Society 
programs were imposed.  
<P>
	One of the things that I believe in is welfare benefits being delivered within the states. The 
states and local communities certainly have an idea who is a gold digger and who has a genuine 
need, but a formula created in Washington and laid as a blanket across this country cannot 
possibly work, and it has not worked. That is why states are asking for and struggling to get 
waivers from the federal mandate.
<P>
So I believe that, yes, there are things that cross our borders as states, but there are far many 
more things that do not cross our borders, or ought not to, by way of a formula which the federal 
government has imposed. So prudence would be the standard by which we would make some of 
these decisions. There is a lot of room for prudence in what we see happening now as a result of 
the broad reach of the federal government.
<P>
QUESTION: Senator Wallop, it is clear that the Supreme Court has essentially interpreted the 
Tenth Amendment outside the context of the Constitution and it is going to be very difficult to 
get it back in because there is so much precedent. What wouldthink of the idea, which would 
eventually have to be a constitutional amendment, of creating a body to mediate the Tenth 
Amendment issues? A body, something like a conference of states, where the governor and the 
legislature would send a delegate. If a State thought its sovereignty has been infringed by the 
federal government, it could pass a resolution in the legislature saying so. Then Congress would 
then get a chance to reconsider their actions.  If Congress disagreed with the state, then a 
conference of states could adjudicate the matter. Essentially, the conference would get the 
Supreme Court's power to overturn certain kinds of federal legislation, maybe by a two-thirds 
vote. It would not be the case that anything could easily be overturned, but it would return the 
structure - the intended structure - in which the sovereign states would actually have some power 
to protect and take back the powers that they had lost.
<P>
SENATOR WALLOP: It sounds lawyerly to a layman, but I do not minimize the effort to restore 
Tenth Amendment rights. These efforts have tried and failed, but climates of opinion change and 
courts are clearly not immune to climates of opinion. If you have watched the history of 
decisions, they wander in one direction for periods of decades and then suddenly, to some eyes, 
they are enlightened and returned. To other eyes, they are not. There are always arguments about 
Supreme Court decisions. I do not know why anybody ever thought that five to four vote of the 
Court was a significantly stronger concept of American freedom than sixty votes in the Senate of 
the United States.
<P>
What really is necessary here is what is beginning to take place. That is the political 
realization that we have gone a bridge too far. Some of us have the feeling that we are counseling 
Russia to do the kinds of things and set up the kinds of systems that we viewed as our original 
premise and that somewhere in the night we are going to pass. We are going to wake up and find 
that they are the free country and that we are bound by the laws that we have allowed the federal 
government to impose on us.

California enjoys a record drop in crime</h2>

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i><br>
<a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/toc.html">November-December 1996, Number 80</a></b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Crime in California is dropping -- fast. So far, this decade looks to be the most promising for reducing crime since the state started keeping complete statistics in 1952. Although California suffered -- along with the rest of the nation -- while the crime rate nearly quadrupled between 1960 and 1980, California is now recording some of the largest crime reductions of any state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Preliminary crime statistics for 1995 show that the overall crime rate in California fell 8.5 percent; violent crimes dropped 5.5 percent and property crimes fell 10.1 percent. If the trend holds, California will record a third straight year of falling crime in 1996, including a marked acceleration in the last two years. 
The hard evidence points to historic decreases in all categories of crime in the state. California is about to set state records for:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>  The largest one-year drop in state history in the rate <i>and</i> number of crimes;	<li>  The largest two-year decline in the number of crimes;	<li>  The first two-year drop in all major categories of crime (homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft);	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the number of violent crimes;	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the rate and number of property crimes;	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the number of burglaries;	<li>  The largest one-year drop in the number of motor-vehicle thefts.

</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What accounts for these astonishing numbers? I would suggest it is in large part due to California's passage of a "three strikes and you're out" law, which has done more to stop revolving-door justice than any other measure in state or federal law. Enacted in 1994 by both popular initiative and legislative action, the law requires a defendant convicted of a felony to serve an indeterminate life sentence when it is proved that he has committed two or more previous felonies defined as "violent" or "serious." Offenders given a life sentence become eligible for parole only after serving 25 years or three times the term that the current conviction would ordinarily warrant, whichever is greater. A "two strikes" provision, part of the same law, requires that when a defendant is convicted of a felony, and has been previously convicted of one "serious or violent" felony, the term of imprisonment is twice the usual sentence provided for the second felony conviction.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In June 1996, the California Supreme Court held in <i>People v. Romero</i> that, notwithstanding the ostensible mandatory language of the "three strikes" law, judges retain the discretion to strike or dismiss prior felony convictions; the court's judgement relied on statutory interpretation and the separation of powers. Thus, the state of the law is that while judges have discretion to strike a prior conviction, our district attorneys will still prove prior felony convictions and state courts will still sentence offenders under "three strikes." I have sponsored legislation to narrowly define and restrict the discretion that judges will have in these cases.<p><b>Accountability for Criminal Choices</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As written and applied, "three strikes" is a model of strict and even-handed justice. It demands accountability, reflects common sense, presents a clear and certain penalty, and uncompromisingly invests in public safety. I like to reflect on former Chief Justice Warren Burger's comments made before an American Bar Association meeting in 1981: "A far greater factor is the deterrent effect of swift and certain consequences: swift arrest, prompt trial, certain penalty and -- at some point -- finality of judgment." Can anybody believe otherwise? The quotation reflects the chief justice's fundamental understanding that the rule of law affords the complementary blessings of both freedom and responsibility and provides the governing framework in which individual citizens make their individual decisions. The rule of law protects our free will from arbitrary constraints; at the same time, it provides consistency and impartiality to the life of the state and its citizens. What seems obvious in this formula is that as individuals exercise their individual, personal liberties in living their lives and in interacting with others, they also become personally accountable for the choices they make -- choices from which clear consequences arise. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Yet, many opponents of "three strikes" disagree with the notion of strict personal accountability. Of course, while most of the self-proclaimed experts in criminal justice state their objections on other grounds -- they call "three strikes" draconian, ineffective, too broad, too tough, and too expensive - the  real theme that resounds in their criticism is that "three strikes" "re-victimizes" persons who already have been "victimized" by the forces of an unfriendly society and an adversarial government. In short, their view is that the targets of "three strikes" are not accountable for their conduct because "complex" forces extrinsic to the individual are the principal causes of criminal activity: poor education, unemployment, a detrimental social situation, or even the law enforcement system. Further, these critics have employed this philosophy to demand that sentencing for convicted criminals be made in light of "mitigating circumstances" and that incarceration should be for "rehabilitative purposes" to redress what society "did" to the inmate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The voters of California have rejected this nonsense. And the record shows "three strikes" is doing precisely what the voters demanded when they overwhelmingly passed the initiative, by 72 percent to 28. The career criminal with multiple serious or violent felony convictions is being forced to make what should be an easy decision: Either stop committing felonies and live the remainder of your life in freedom, or spend 25 years to life in prison the next time you are caught and convicted of a felony. The career criminal will be held <i>personally accountable</i> for his decisions. Imagine that! When the voters rejected revolving-door justice, they rejected the arguments of apologists that we can divorce negative personal conduct from individual accountability. <p><b>Proportional Punishment</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The second criticism against "three strikes" by criminal apologists is that the law does not furnish proportionate punishment. These critics focus on the cases in which a habitual felon is charged with a "minor" property or drug offense that qualifies as a third strike. They allege it is wholly improper to impose an indeterminate life sentence for a "minor" crime and that instead the offender should be given special consideration or more lenient treatment. The philosophical approach advocated here is that criminal conduct should be viewed in isolation of past history and surrounding circumstances. If a habitual felon currently commits a crime that is classified as a felony under California law, and he has convictions for two previous "serious" felonies, is it any surprise that Californians want a tougher punishment for the current felony?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's examine what constitutes a "serious or violent felony" for a "three strikes" prior conviction: murder or voluntary manslaughter; mayhem; rape; sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, threat of great bodily injury, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person; oral copulation by force, violence, duress, et cetera; lewd or lascivious acts on children; felonies with personal use of firearm; attempted murder; assault with intent to commit rape or robbery; assault with deadly weapon; arson; kidnapping; selling drugs to minors; and many others. If these are not "serious" enough, I would like to know which ones should be dropped as insufficiently serious. When the third strike is but a "minor" felony, such as grand theft or possession of certain drugs for sale, why should society ignore the habitual criminal activity of this offender when sentencing him? <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Common sense dictates the answer to this question. First, society does not view crime in a vacuum. As Princeton professor John DiIulio recently wrote, "Most Americans rightly think in terms of total criminality -- the full social and moral weight of an offender's acts against life, liberty, and property. They reject the criminological equivalent of grade inflation -- judging plea-bargained-gorged prisoners by their last conviction rather than their overall criminal grade-point average, adult and juvenile." Second, an offender who has committed a series of violent or serious crimes is likely to commit additional crimes of the same nature; wisdom demands that an offender's criminal record be the starting point for determining punishment. Finally, the rule of law demands a response to a lifestyle of destruction and violence. There is nothing disproportionate about giving a harsh sentence to a felon who has not learned from having committed two serious felonies before. <p><b>Deterrence Effect</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There has been a marked split of opinion, at least in academia, as to how best to prevent crime. On the one hand, some argue that habitual criminal activity can be "cured" by placing offenders in correctional programs that renounce retributive goals and instead stress the redemptive value of education, vocational instruction, and even group therapy. Another school of thought centers on the positive behavioral effects of a system of clear and certain consequences for destructive and criminal behavior. Unfortunately, many in the "redemptive programs" group reject outright the legitimacy of deterrence. The causes of criminal behavior are far too complex, they say, to permit any generalizations about whether individuals will consider legal prohibitions or sanctions when they act and interact in society -- especially when they are hungry, ill-housed, under-educated, or emotionally neglected. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The value of deterrence, however, is grossly underestimated by these "experts," who have devised no way to prove or disprove its effects. I believe certainty of incarceration, for a long and inevitable period, nonetheless has a dramatic effect on the behavior of individuals. Consider the statement of a veteran homicide detective in the Sacramento police department as to the law's impact: "You hear [the criminals] talking about it all the time. These guys are really squirming. They know what's going on. . . . I've flipped 100 percent," Gregory Gaines told a <i>Sacramento Bee</i> reporter. Gaines had just been released from Folsom State Prison with two serious or violent felony convictions -- two "strikes" -- and told the reporter that many other inmates have decided to heed the warnings of the "three strikes" law. "It's a brand-new me, mainly because of the law. It's going to keep me working, keep my attitude adjusted."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most interesting statistics track the migratory patterns of felons on parole in California. In the last year before "three strikes" became law in 1994, 226 more paroled felons chose to move to California than moved out. After "three strikes" took effect, the flow reversed: 1,335 more paroled felons chose to leave California in 1995 than to enter. We've gone from being a net importer of paroled felons to a net exporter! Coincidence? Hardly. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another school of thought seeks to explain the reduction in crime in California solely as a function of social or demographic trends. They argue that a troubled economy breeds more crime. (This ignores that in 1992, 1993, and 1994, overall crime in California dropped even as the state's economy endured one of the worst economic recessions in its history.) They argue that the crime rate falls naturally when the proportion of males in the crime-prone age groups declines. (While this may be part of the explanation, no study we have found supports the notion that "demographic changes" alone drive the crime rate up or down.) Without admitting it, this side in the debate, like some of those in the "redemptive programs" community, believes that tough incarcerative penalties for criminals and tough law-enforcement strategies do not work. In short, they deny the obvious value of deterring crime as a means of preventing it. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the historical experience of no deterrence. California has about 138,000 inmates in its prisons today. When we began our push for a tougher response to crime in the early 1980s -- establishing punishment and social incapacitation as the priorities of our penal system -- the total inmate population was only 25,000, even though the crime rate reached an all-time high in 1980-81. Our prisons had revolving doors through which career criminals cycled, <i>undeterred by the prospect of a short prison stint</i>. Many California inmates viewed a stay in prison as a chance to receive neglected medical and dental care, and to beef up their muscles in the weight yard in preparation for the next "recess" on the outside. "Three strikes" and other tougher laws have begun to change that.<p>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the leadership of governors Deukmejian and Wilson and the state's vocal (and often overlooked) victims of crime, California embarked on an active prison building program in conjunction with tougher crime laws and more conservative judges. So where are we now? Today we have 138,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons. Unless you believe that releasing those additional 113,000 felons from our prisons tomorrow would have no effect on the number of crimes committed and that our laws, policies, and promise of punishments have no effect on the number of criminals on our streets and the amount of crime suffered by our state, it is clear that we are beginning to win the fight.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But what if we had not changed our incarceration policies so dramatically? What level of crime might California be suffering from today if the runaway trend of upward crime rates of the 1960s and 1970s had continued unabated? In 1994, California's overall crime rate was 3,147 crimes per 100,000 people. The rate would have reached 4,403 per 100,000 had the trend of the 1970s continued. In just the last two years -- the "three strikes" years -- we can estimate the level of crime victimization that would have occurred had our pre-"three strikes" crime rate remained unchanged. In the last two years, California would have had 907 additional murders, 2,015 additional rapes, 37,256 additional robberies, 11,602 additional aggravated assaults, 92,727 additional burglaries, and 56,991 additional motor vehicle thefts. A recent RAND Corp. study estimated that rigorous enforcement of "three strikes" will reduce serious felonies committed by adults in California between 22 and 34 percent below what would have occurred had the previous law remained in effect. The authors emphasized that about a third of the felonies eliminated will be violent crimes such as murder, rape, and assaults causing great bodily injury. The other two-thirds will be less violent, but still serious, felonies, including less-injurious assaults, most robberies, and burglaries. 
<p><b>Cost to Society</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The critics of "three strikes" also miss another obvious truth: A criminal in prison cannot commit crimes against the general public. In fact, the cost of crimes committed against our citizens is higher than the cost of incarcerating them. The critics are warning that "three strikes" --  and all our tougher laws -- will cost too much to implement. Yet, according to a 1992 U.S. Department of Justice report on justice expenditures and employment, only three cents of every tax dollar goes to public safety such as police, courts, prisons, jails, and related activities. Perhaps we should question why our priorities have been so backwards. I submit that, strictly analyzed in a cost-benefit perspective, the tough approach to crime is financially sound. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1996 recent study by the National Institute for Justice assessed the costs to society of murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, and burglaries. The costs included both tangible and intangible costs to the victims, their families, and society, from lost income and medical expenses to pain and suffering and risk of death. The federal study's calculations did not include direct costs to the criminal-justice system, such as police, jail, prosecution, courts, prisons, and the like. The costs to society and victims for each crime range from $2,940,000 for each murder to $1,400 for each burglary. Using these base figures, had California not experienced the post-"three strikes" drop in crime in 1994 and 1995, it would have cost us:
<p><ul>	<li>  $2.66 billion for the additional murders;	<li>  $174.3 million for the additional rapes;	<li>  $707.9 million for the additional robberies;	<li>  $108.5 million for the additional aggravated assaults;	<li>   $129.9 million for the additional burglaries.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Clearly, the costs to society of a return to the lenient approach, even in purely fiscal terms (which is obviously not the primary consideration when paired with the human costs of crime) are astronomical. Other approaches to preventing crime have value that I, for one, do not dispute. The move toward community-oriented policing must continue and thrive. California leads the nation in community-oriented policing, a philosophy that enables police officers to work more intensively with citizens in their neighborhoods, rather than scurrying from one 911 call to the next. It, too, costs money, but the investment is worth the up-front costs.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, some critics of "three strikes" argue that the example of New York City, which has enjoyed a steep drop in crime without the benefit of state laws similar to California's, undercuts the case for "three strikes" policies. New York City, however, invested in a comprehensive community-oriented policing program along with a "zero tolerance" policy that requires officers to strictly enforce every possible violation. Like "three strikes," New York City's program costs money -- and it works. (New York City has added 7,000 officers since 1990. The entire Los Angeles Police Department totals 8,737; New York City 37,800.) Ironically, it is deterrence again at work in New York City -- the criminals in the city know the police are there and change their behavior accordingly.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, we are told that a proportionally large group of young males, currently in their pre-teen years, will soon move into their "crime-prone" years. We should refuse to accept the notion that a high rate of crime will be committed by these youths. A juvenile crime wave is not inevitable, just as our high crime rates of the past were not inevitable. As a society we have to confront the conditions that exacerbate levels of juvenile crime and violence. Our challenge is to implement juvenile crime laws and policies which will deter as many as possible from a life of crime while still incarcerating those teenagers who commit serious violence on our citizens. There is an important place for prevention and intervention programs for our young. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although "three strikes" will incarcerate more habitual criminals, the costs are justified. The price of allowing these offenders to return to a lifestyle of victimizing citizens is too high. "Three strikes" incapacitates active criminals, who can no longer commit crimes against the public. "Three strikes" removes from our streets the harmful role models these offenders present to our youth and to gang "wannabes." "Three strikes" re-introduces into our collective consciousness a moral imperative that criminal activity should not be tolerated in any way. Most importantly, "three strikes" reduces crime by providing a solid and unquestionable deterrent to criminal behavior. California's sharp decline in crime in the last two years may be attributable to numerous, complex factors, but it is indisputable that "three strikes" has played a major role in reshaping public safety in California, both for law-abiding citizens and for would-be criminals. <p><i><b>Dan Lungren</b>, a Republican, is the attorney general of California.</i>

        THE CATO INSTITUTE<br>
		APRIL 28, 1994<br>					     
		By Senator Malcolm Wallop
<P>
As you may have noticed, last Friday was Earth Day.  Rallies, teach-ins, exhibitions were held in schools, churches and civic spaces around the country to celebrate clean air and water as well as efforts to protect endangered species, vanishing rain forests, and national treasuers like the Grand Canyon.  Who could be so vile as to be against such things?  Nobody.  Are we then all environmentalists?  Well, that depends on your definition.  You see, much of what passes for environmentalism today really has nothing to do with clean air and water, the health of humans or other species, and the beauty of wide-open spaces.  It has everything to do with dirty politics and the acquisition of power-indeed with the hoariest of political scams; invoking supposedly scientific knowledge of the public good to legitimize transfering money and power to one's own friends and ideological compatriots.
<P>
Collectivists promised a better world if only we would empower government to nationalize or regulate companies, to take over the providential functions of families, to monopolize education and, almost every where in the world, to collectivize medical care.  During the past several decades, and after harsh experiences, the public throughout the civilized world realized that all these schemes were scams.  The principal beneficiaries were the people who ran them, while the general public paid, got ever-worsening services, and was obliged to learn to court bureaucrats.  So now from Santiago to Stockholm, from Mexico to Milan to Moscow, privatization is the order of the day.  Governments have sold more than $260 billion in state enterprises.  Nations are privatizing pension systems, voucherizing medical care and education, and deregulating companies.  People are privatizing even systems once deemed inherently governmental-police and fire protection, mail delivery, prison management, trash collection-as much to rid themselves of corruption and to regain control of their own lives as to improve the yield of the money they pay for services.
<P>
But corrupt collectivists have no shame.  The moment one of their pseudoscientific claims is exposed, they invent another, confident that the public will take the loftiness of their expressed goals as a warrant of their good faith and competence. And so people who a few  years ago described themselves as scientific socialists now describe themselves as environmental experts.  But if you look at what they prescribe in the name of environmentalism now, you find that it is no different from what they were prescribing not so long ago in the name of some other pseudoscience.  In the name of the environment they can do what they could not do in the name of Marx or Keynes.  They can restructure the U.S. auto industry, block construction here while authorizing it there, punish politically incorrect constituencies in tobacco land or lumber land.  Every landowner, everyone who eats, showers, works, will have to pay and bow to the new masters.
<P>
And to whom do environmentalist proposals channel power and money?  Why to the environmental establishment, of course.  Note that of the first $1 billion allegedly spent for toxic waste cleanup under Superfund, the biggest federal environmental program, more than half went to well connected law firms, including the infamous Rose law firm.  And I assure you that the so-called cleanup contracts, with fat shares for consultants, are not given out by lottery either.  If the spoils of federal public works projects are doled out on the basis of politics, why should we expect the spoils of environmental policy to be any different?
<P>
So what about the rest of us who don't want power and privilege at other people's expense, the ones who really care about clean air and water?  Well, we had better realize that to get these goods we must do more or less what we do to get other kinds of goods.  Real environmentalism is not about commandeering other people's resources, destroying jobs, or attacking industry.  It's not about expanding and centralizing government power.  Real environmentalism is about good stewardship.  And what most effectively promotes good stewardship are the incentives created by private property rights and competitive markets.  Real environmentalism seeks to empower people, not governments.  If people are allowed to own more of the planet, they will take better care of it.    
			<center>
					<H4>The Market Failure Paradigm</H4>
			</center>
The policies and rhetoric of phony environmentalism are based upon a specific theoretical rationale-<I>market failure. </I>  Just as they used to say that unregulated private activity would produce poverty, now they say that individuals freely pursuing their interests cause pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion.  That, they say, is because markets do not reflect the social or external costs of economic activity.  Therefore, they argue, only a politically controlled marketplace is compatible with environmental quality.  This &quot;market failure&quot; paradigm has an almost unlimited potential for mischief.  Practically every private transaction has <I>some</I> effect on external parties or resources.  Since any economic activity may have some environmental impact, this approach demands that virtually all economic decisions be politically managed. 
<P>
Let me assure you, the threat of pervasive regulation is not imaginary.  The Environmental Protection Agency alone requires local governments to implement some 419 &quot;essential&quot; regulations. 
<P>
Environmental rules have imposed &quot;water efficiency&quot; standards on our shower heads and toilets and environmental agencies tell companies how their employees must commute to work.  In the name of air quality, biodiversity, waste disposal, recycling, and wetlands, America is rapidly adopting a green variant of centralized planning.  
<P>
But the premise is as bad as the conclusion.  Environmental problems are not the consequence of free markets and private property; rather, they result from too little reliance on private property and markets.  Whether we consider elephants in Africa, salmon streams in England, or forests in the United States, privately owned resources have been better protected than their politically-managed counterparts.  Because environmental degradation is caused substantially by government interference, a policy of ecological privatization-the extension of private property rights to the broadest possible array of natural resources-is the proper agenda for real environmentalism.
		<center>
				<H4>What Preserves?  What Destroys?</H4>
		</center>
Let's look at some examples of how markets and private ownership promote good stewardship.  
<P>
My first example is &quot;The Strange Story of the Disappearing Pigeons and the Flourishing Chickens!&quot;  When Columbus discovered America, there were billions of passenger pigeons, no chickens-now there are billions of chickens, no passenger pigeons.  
<P>
The reason is straightforward.  People concerned themselves with the welfare of stilt houses to shelter these vulnerable birds.  Farmers would stay up at night to protect them.  Researchers studied the tastes and nutritional needs of chickens, diseases were cured, and social pathologies (for example, the tendency of birds to peck one another to death) were resolved.  Private property linked chickens and mankind symbiotically.  
<P>
By contrast, passenger pigeons became extinct because they were the &quot;common heritage of all Americans.&quot;  Many people valued these birds but they had no way to translate their concern into effective action.  By law, wildlife is owned by &quot;the people&quot; collectively.  Private ownership of a pigeon was possible only if one first killed the bird.  Not surprisingly, pigeons were destroyed in huge numbers and the habitat for the bird shrank rapidly as America converted forests into lands suitable for chickens and other species that could be owned.  The point of this simple story?  Private ownership provides a critical linkage between man and nature, between economy and ecology.  Private property encourages human beings to consider the welfare of what they own; when you own it, if you destroy it you're the one who loses.  Common or public ownership provides far fewer and much weaker inducements to good stewardship; destroy an unowned property, and someone else bears the cost.
<P>
A limited experiment with privatization is working to save the African elephant, an animal imperiled by cows, ploughs and poaching.  Most media accounts blame the poaching on the international trade in ivory.  The solution thus seems obvious: Suppress the ivory trade!  Environmental groups endorsed this approach, now codified under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).  The ivory ban, they predicted, would reduce trade, lower prices and, thus, protect the elephant.  But the prediction, and the results, have gone awry.
<P>
Africans are poor.  If elephants do not contribute to their well being, Africans will convert elephant habitat to other land uses.  Without economic reasons for preserving the species, Africans are likely to view the elephant less as a noble animal than as a giant rat!  
<P>
The only way to ensure the survival of the African elephant is to let people own them.  As it happens, Zimbabwe has experimented with a limited form of privatization, and the results are encouraging.
<P>
Zimbabwe's government, recognizing that it could not effectively prevent poaching, created a mechanism whereby local tribal councils could petition to have elephants in their territory transferred from national to local control.  In effect, ownership rights were transferred to the local citizenry.  
<P>
The effects of this policy were significant.  Elephants provide over 10 million Zimbabwe dollars a year in income to about two dozen tribal villages.  Complaints that &quot;your&quot; elephants are causing problems quickly became pleas for advice on how best to protect &quot;our&quot; elephants.  Former poachers became game wardens, protecting the newly privatized species.  Individuals in the affected communities came to recognize that keeping an elephant alive today might well mean a better life for their families tomorrow.  Villagers guard against poachers, cull elephant herds to prevent overpopulation, and protect their investment in future ivory production and safari income.  As a result, the elephant population has grown from 30,000 to more than 70,000 over the past two decades.    
<P>
In contrast, in Kenya, where hunting and ivory sales are banned, poachers succeed in killing elephants because no one has an economic stake in protecting them.  The elephant population has plunged from 140,000 to 20,000 over the past two decades. 
<P>
If these examples are rejected because chickens, after all, are protected only to be killed and eaten, or because one believes privatization options are applicable only to species having direct commercial value-then consider cats, dogs, parakeets, tropical fish and other pets.  People protect these species not for monetary reasons or to grace the dining table, but rather because we enjoy and care for these animals.  Much the same can be said for privately-supported zoos and conservation centers that protect all sorts of endangered and threatened species-lemurs, butterflies, birds-not because of any profit margin, but because in the free-market, individuals have the ability to protect those things that they find valuable, for whatever reason they so choose. <P>
The pet example is an interesting one because it illustrates that ownership links man and nature in ways that extend beyond the strictly commercial sphere.  People care for specific animals and therefore are willing to devote time, energy and money to protecting them.  Ownership makes it possible for that effort not to be wasted.  I need not fear that my well fed and pampered parakeet will become my neighbor's Sunday lunch.  Moreover, although the relationship between pet and owner is a non-commercial one, a rich commercial sector-pet food companies, veterinary hospitals, pet care products, even pet grooming salons-has evolved to serve the owners and their pets. 
<P>
Green ideologues warn that thousands of species are disappearing each year, that the earth faces a biodiversity &quot;crisis.&quot;  As Julian Simon and the late Aaron Wildavsky have shown, the empirical data do not support such claims.  Nonetheless, it's worth pondering how we can possibly protect the 10 to 100 million species of plants and animals that are believed to exist today.  Current strategies would leave this task to governments.  Yet many of them are inept at protecting their human populations, never mind animals.  There are, however, more than 5.5 billion people in the world today.  If able to own some specific endangered species, many would do so.  If a few hundred or thousand people were overseeing each species, then the survival odds would greatly improve.  Moreover, since such species will often be protected in a fenced &quot;natural&quot; habitat, it's likely that other species will be protected as well.
<P>
The good news is, in spite of legal limitations on ownership of wildlife and habitat, grass-roots private conservation groups such as Ducks Unlimited, the National Wild Turkey Federation, and the North American Bluebird Society are achieving great results.  As a recent <I>Policy Review</I> article by Brian Jendryka reports, there are perhaps 1 to 2 billion more songbirds in the United States today than at the time of the Pilgrims.  The population of wild turkeys has increased from about 30,000 in the early 1900s to more than 4 million today.  Private citizens and organizations have built more than 100,000 bluebird houses in the past 15 years, helping to increase the Eastern bluebird population by 9.5 percent.
<P>
Private conservationists are protecting non-indigenous species as well, reports Ike Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.  David Bamberger, the former chairman of Church's Fried Chicken and now a game rancher, has single-handedly preserved 29 of the 31 remaining bloodlines of the Scimitar-horned Oryx, a rare antelope native to war-torn sub-Saharan Africa.  Bamberger is one of 450-plus ranchers in Texas who own an estimated 200,000 head of some 125 exotic species.  More than 19,000 of these animals belong to species that are imperiled in the wild.  Several are now more plentiful in Texas than in their lands of origin.</FONT>

In contrast, government has been a leading cause of environmental problems.  As Richard Stroup and Jane Shaw note in a book called <I>Taking the Environment Seriously</I>, the U.S. Forest Service has promoted clear-cutting in ecological sensitive forests where it is difficult to grow trees.  The Bureau of Reclamation has built dams that innundated canyons and free-flowing streams.  Department of Agriculture subsidies have encouraged farmers to drain wetlands, overuse marginal crop land, and use excessive amounts of pesticides.  The Armed Forces and the Department of Energy have created hazardous waste dumps that will cost untold billions of dollars to clean up.
<P>
How come?  Bureaucrats are no more evil than the rest of us-or maybe not much.  But they work with huge sums of other people's money.  They have the legal power to jail people who try to stop them, and prosper to the extent that they manage big projects and give out big contracts.  Furthermore, they bear little if any of the costs of their actions.  With such incentives, it is no wonder that they have often acted in total disregard of environmental concerns.
<P>
The relevant test for us as citizens is not whether markets are perfect, but whether they perform better than political arrangements.  If the market failure explanation were correct, one would expect that less market-oriented societies would have fewer environmental problems.  The opposite is the case.  Our worst ecological nightmares are the daily realities of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where government had the kind of environmental control powers that our environmental movement craves.  Experience shows that market economies consistently outperform socialist economies on ecological grounds.
<P>
Centralized ecological planning is a species of what Nobel economist Friedrich Hayek called the &quot;fatal conceit.&quot;  Hayek observed that the knowledge necessary to manage a modern economy is dispersed-only the individual knows the specific circumstances he faces, and only the individual knows the full range of options he might exercise to improve the situation.  This information is too extensive, too ephemeral, too non-quantitative, and too intuitive to be centralized and made available to any single mind or set of minds.  Furthermore, only if the individual cares enough to make the best of the little piece of the puzzle in his hands, can society expect to benefit from the richness of this dispersed information.  Like markets, ecosystems are too complex, too varied, and too sensitive to changing circumstances to be managed by a central authority.  Good environmental stewardship, no less than good business management, depends upon the kind of dispersed knowledge that is available only to self-interested individuals.
<P>
Bureaucratic environmental policies are also highly vulnerable to corruption.  The details of environmental policy have major economic implications; thus, interest groups will seek favorable treatment at the expense of groups less well organized or less politically powerful.  What we learned in school about regulatory agencies, that they are often captured by the strongest of the special interests they regulate, also applies to environmental regulation.  In the mid-1980s, for example, a coalition of environmental groups and waste treatment companies successfully lobbied to expand the number of Superfund sites and mandate the use of the most expensive cleanup methods.  They even succeeded in blocking measures aimed at reducing the production of hazardous waste!  These days a coalition of agricultural interests has sought to impose a more expensive and more heavily polluting fuel-ethanol-on an unsuspecting public in the name of clean air!  There is no end to political greed, and the more extensive political controls get, the more opportunities for special-interest politics we create.
<P>
The regulators themselves have incentives to put their organizational interests ahead of the public interest.  A 1987 survey of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials found little correlation between the officials' judgments as to which areas merited most attention and what the agency actually did.  In part, these skewed priorities result from the political imperatives of the budget process.  To enlarge its share of federal resources, EPA has not been above sensationalizing environmental risks such as asbestos in our schools, radon in our homes, and pesticide residues on our food.  When environmental policy is political, it is bound to reflect fads, careerism, and greed rather than scientific realities.  
<P>
Not surprisingly, bureaucratic approaches aren't working.  The New York Times has reported how a refinery in Yorktown, Virginia was required to spend 31 million dollars to control benzene emissions.  The regulatory requirements focused on the refinery's waste water treatment plant, but the majority of benzene emissions were coming from another part of the facility that would have been far less expensive to clean up-about 25 million dollars less.  And how about the Endangered Species Act, a very controversial law these days and one of my personal favorites  Since 1966, 1,354 species have been listed as endangered or threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.  Of these, only 19 species have been &quot;delisted&quot;-seven because they became extinct, eight because they were improperly listed in the first place.  Only four species have been delisted because they have actually recovered to the point where they are no longer threatened.  Yet according to the National Wilderness Institute, the American people spend over 3 million dollars per species on enforcing this ineffective law, and their are over 800 species on the list.  Not exactly a brilliant success.  And not so different from government performance regarding welfare and other matters. 	Then there is the problem of cost.  Business compliance expenses, paperwork burdens, and other direct costs of environmental regulation in the United States are now estimated at well over $150 billion a year, based on the calculations of the EPA-and I don't have to tell you about the EPA's reputation for less than accurate numbers.  Total costs, which include reduced levels of business formation and job creation, are significantly higher.  
<P>
Finally, the web of environmental regulations is restricting the freedom of our citizens and criminalizing what would otherwise be regarded as lawful behavior.  How does this item grab you?  In March of 1992, federal officials trespassed onto Richard Smith's ranch and seized the pickup trucks of Mr. Smith and his elderly father.  The Smiths were accused of poisoning endangered birds, even though the Fish and Wildlife Service was unable to present any evidence and formal charges were never filed.  Only nine months later were the trucks finally returned.
<P>
Some of you are no doubt familiar wiwth the story of John Pozgai, an immigrant from  Eastern Europe.  Pozgai purchased a 14-acre dump site across from his truck repair business in Morrisville, Pennsylvania.  He removed some 7,000 old tires and several rusting cars, and leveled the area with clean fill dirt.  His neighbors were pleased.  But in 1991, he was hauled into court by the EPA, charged with violating federal wetlands &quot;policy,&quot; sentenced to three years in prison, and slapped with a $200,000 fine (later commuted to $5,000).  His crime?  Using dirt without a permit.
<P>
Does that happen to everybody?  No.  We have all heard how the State of Arkansas gave special treatment to Tyson Foods because of their cozy relationship with the Governor.  If politics can provide protection to the propreitors of failed S&amp;Ls, it can give good cover to politically-powerful polluters.  It is the nature of politics, even when we try to use politics to protect nature; saying it is all for a good cause makes not a difference in the world.  Remember, the more expensive environmental regulation gets, the higher the economic stakes, the more incentive there will be to play by a special set of rules.
<P>
The current situation is unacceptable: we are spending vast sums, getting very little in return, stifling enteprise, surrendering our freedom to unelected bureaucrats, and encouraging corruption.  I hope you all will agree that there has got to be a better way.</FONT>

<h4>Solutions</h4>
</center>

Most environmental problems are not the fault of capitalism.  Rather, they stem from the <I>absence</I> of property rights and markets.  Since the air, the water, most species of mammals and fish and public lands have no private owners, they have few effective protectors and defenders.  Trees cannot have standing.  But behind many a tree, there could stand a private owner ready and able to defend his property.
<P>
Granted, privatizing trees and land animals usually presents no great technical difficulties, though some may find it politically controversial, so let's look at the hard cases.
<P>
In both England and America, the primary approach to protecting river quality is political.  A legislature sets water quality standards, and an environmental agency determines what effluent levels are compatible with those standards.  The agency then takes an inventory of emission sources along the river and decides what cleanup burdens each source will bear.  In the United States, the water quality standards and cleanup requirements imposed on municipalities have been more lenient than those placed on industry.  Moreover, enforcement has been less stringent.  The result is that today government polluters pose the main threat to river quality.
<P>
In England, much the same system prevails, but along some rivers, political controls are augmented by a system of private property defenses.  One such river, the Derby [pronounced Darby], illustrates the situation.  A fishing club, the Pride of Derby, held the rights to fish along a stretch of the river.  When the club found that water pollution was killing fish, it took action to defend its property rights.
<P>
As in the United States, the plaintiff looked upstream to determine which sources might contribute to the problem.  And as in the United States, both industrial and municipal sources were found.  The club approached both groups.  The industry reviewed the situation, recognized that it had indeed been &quot;trespassing,&quot; and negotiated a cleanup agreement.  
<P>
In contrast, the municipality argued that city governments faced more pressing responsibilities (public housing, unemployment relief, education, street and bridge maintenance) and should not be required to divert funds to any cleanup.  Besides, the city authorities argued, the cleanup would primarily benefit wealthy fishermen.  To spend money in this way was regressive and unfair. In effect, the municipality in England-like many in the UnitedStates-argued that not all polluters are equal; political polluters are entitled to special consideration.  
<P>
The Pride went to court, however, and prevailed.  The court held that the issue was not one of income distribution but rather one of trespass.  A municipality had no more right than anyone else to take another's property.  The case set a precedent which to this day puts potential polluters on notice that endangering river quality is not acceptable.  Note, also, that the Pride of Derby's success protected not only its stretch of the river but areas downstream as well.  What's more, it extended the umbrella of protection to species not highly valued by the fishermen.    
<P>
A property rights approach might also dramatically improve the way we manage and protect ground water.  Under current policies, users of groundwater have rights to the water they capture or consume, but not to water left in the ground.  Since users have no right to the water they conserve, their incentive is to overconsume.  This poses no great problem where groundwater is relatively abundant.  But when rising demand leads to groundwater depletion, the only recourse now available is to impose political controls on water usage. 
<P>
Fred Smith, a former EPA analyst who founded the Competitive Enterprise Institute ten years back, suggests we consider another approach.  He points out that a very different strategy has been successfully used to manage another valued underground liquid resource-oil.  In the United States and many other countries, underground rights in oil capture are assembled via &quot;unitization&quot; agreements into single pools that can be managed in an integrated fashion to ensure rational usage.  
<P>
This process is not simple; it involves difficult analytic procedures to determine the appropriate boundaries of the field, and requires costly legal maneuvering to reach agreement among the original owners.  Nonetheless, unitization has been widely applied and has done much to make possible the efficient use and conservation of petroleum.  Why not extend property rights to groundwater and see if unitization and private management agreements evolve?  
<P>
Now let's consider how property rights, markets, and emerging technologies may enable the private sector to play a greater role in protecting oceanic resources and airsheds.  One of the most cost-effective ways to protect ocean water quality and biodiversity would be to lift restrictions on offshore oil production.  I know this will strike the environmental establishment as outrageous heresy, but facts are facts.  Prohibiting offshore drilling has made the U.S. more dependent on imported oil.  And major oil spills are far more likely to occur because of tanker accidents than because of platform or pipeline accidents.
<P>
More important, offshore oil platforms actually protect marine biodiversity.  We often imagine the oceans as teaming with life. In fact, they are mostly vast underwater deserts.  Reefs are the breeding grounds of many marine flora and fauna, providing critical links in the planetary food chain.  In U.S. waters, reefs occur naturally only off the coasts of Florida and Hawaii.  Oil platforms have served as highly efficient artificial reefs, providing habitat shelter for many kinds of fish.  According to environmental scholar Robert J. Smith, biological studies of platform fish populations show concentrations 20-50 times greater than those found in normal sandy bottoms, and about 5 times those found at natural reefs.
<P>
People can create artificial reefs just by dumping durable objects such as rocks and cement-filled tires in sandy bottom waters.  Under the laws of most coastal states, however, private parties cannot establish ownership rights in artificial reefs.  This diminishes the incentive to build reefs, since the full economic benefits cannot be captured by the builders.  More reefs would be built if owners could charge fees to commercial fishermen, scuba clubs, and other interests desiring access.  
<P>
Moreover, owners would have an incentive to prevent overfishing and other environmental hazards that could destroy the long-term value of their property.  Conservation groups could also purchase the rights to such areas and manage them as marine wildlife refuges.
<P>
Market-based solutions to oceanic and atmospheric pollution are in their infancy; but here, too, new technologies promise to reduce our reliance on bureaucratic command-and-control mandates. The major challenge to extending private protection to oceans and airsheds is their fluid nature.  There are no fences separating your air from mine; there is no easy way to trace oceanic pollution to its source.  But we should not underestimate the ingenuity of free peoples to come up with solutions.
<P>
Using technologies known as gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, scientists can detect oceanic pollutants in quantities as small as one part in a trillion.  They can also identify the culprit by matching the pattern of the chemical constituents found in samples taken from the site with others from the suspected source.  This sort of chemical fingerprinting is already being used to determine liability for oil spills.  As the technique becomes more refined and more widely utilized, private parties may be able to sue for damages and make polluters pay.
<P>
Fred Smith foresees even more imaginative applications of technology to pollution control problems:
<P>
&quot;Tracers (oderants, coloring agents, isotopes) might be added to pollutants to ensure the damages were detected early where the costs of reduction were lower....There are exotic technologies that might well play a fencing role even for resources as complex as airsheds.  For example, lasimetrics, a technology which can already map atmospheric chemical concentrations from orbit, might in time provide a sophisticated means for tracking transnational pollution flows.  If that system were combined with a system under which each nation adopted some fingerprinting system to identify its major greenhouse gases (a kind of chemical zip code system), it would be possible to trace pollution to its source and thus make it possible to make polluters pay.&quot;
<P>
Some of this may be a long way off, but if we don't know where we want to go, we can be sure that we will never get there.
<P>
The goal of real environmentalism is to do well today, better tomorrow.  No one knows what kind of fencing and fingerprinting technologies may be available in the 21<SUP>st</SUP> century to identify which parties are trespassing (throwing their trash) into which backyards.  Yet, the dynamic record of market economies in finding ever more efficient ways of advancing human goals should inspire confidence and hope.  Private property creates a vast incentive system which encourages people having no direct linkage to a specific industry to seek to solve that sector's problems.   
<P>
These quick sketches do not argue that government has no role to play in the environmental field; preventing trespass and tort-environmental or otherwise-has always been a legitimate function of government.  However, government's role should be limited, and it should not stifle private sector experimentation and initiative.
<center>
<h4>Environment vs. Development: A False Antithesis</h4>
</center>
I've been arguing that private property rights can link ecology and the economy in ways that benefit both.  Green ideologues will vehemently deny this, claiming that economic development and environmental quality are incompatible objectives.  And indeed, if one only considers the well-publicized clashes between environmental groups and commercial interests over the use of public lands such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, one may well conclude that we must suppress business to protect the environment or sacrifice the environment to promote business.  But this a false dichotomy, an artificial problem created by government's control over natural resources.
<P>
Some 40 percent of all U.S. land is owned by governments-federal, state, and local.  Many public land tracts contain valuable commercial commodities <I>and</I> valuable ecological resources.  Developers and environmentalists clash over the disposition of those lands precisely because the lands are in the public domain. Each party tries to use its political muscle to deny or restrict access to its rivals.  An outcome that does justice to all the interests concerned is highly unlikely, not only because political power is distributed unequally, but also because the winners have no incentive to accomodate the losers.
<P>
Public policy ought to encourage environmentally responsible behavior.  But people behave responsibly only if they have to bear the costs of their actions.  The problem with public land management is just this:  the costs are borne by taxpayers and other third parties, rather than those who manage or use the land.  The environmental movement does not bear the economic costs-the jobs destroyed, the factories closed, the towns decimated-when it succeeds in locking up timberland or blocking oil production.  Industry, similarly, does not bear the costs when it develops public land in an environmentally destructive manner.  The bureaucrats who are supposed to weigh and balance these competing interests have no financial stake in the lands they manage.  In fact, they may have an incentive to mismanage public lands if the resulting environmental problems create pretexts for increasing agency budgets and enacting new regulations.
<P>
Private ownership, on the other hand, fosters responsible behavior.  In a splendid book entitled <I>Free Market Environmentalism</I>, Terry Anderson and Donald Leal provide several telling examples.  At a time when the federal government was encouraging environmental destruction on the Barrier Islands, commercial interests at Hilton Head Island discovered that conservation increased property values.  While the federal government has subsidized environmental damage in our national forests, companies such as International Paper have discovered that wildlife research and habitat protection can provide profitable recreational opportunities.
<P>
Private property not only encourages industry to respect environmental concerns, it also encourages environmental groups to accomodate economic interests.  Consider the Audubon Society's Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana.  The Rainey Sanctuary is home for deer, armadillo, muskrat, otter, mink, geese, and many other birds.  Since 1960, it has also been a site for oil wells run by Conoco.  Because Audubon owns the land, it can impose strict conditions on how the oil is extracted to ensure that wildlife is not damaged.  In return for allowing the oil company to produce on the sanctuary, Audubon receives royalties that it can plough into its environmental program.  Michigan's Audubon Society has similar arrangements with Mobile and Michigan Petroleum Exploration.   
<P>
These examples are noteworthy, because Audubon and other environmental groups fiercely opposed any oil exploration and production in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge.  Yet they recognize the value of reaching mutually beneficial compromises on their own land.  Private property encourages economically responsible conservation as well as environmentally responsible commercial development.  Audubon profits handsomely from their own oil drilling deals, and it is my understanding that the birds have not suffered a whit.  If private stewardship creates this type of win-win situation, we should try it more often.</FONT>
<center>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
</center>
Ecological central planning cannot protect the environment, but it can destroy civil and economic liberties.  America need not go any farther down this road.  The environment can be protected, and we can continue to reach new heights of prosperity.  Modern societies have succeeded only when ordinary citizens have been free to solve their own problems.  Ecological privatization is an unexplored means of achieving real benefits in the environmental field.
<P>
It's sometimes said that man is the only animal that fouls his own nest.  That's not true.  Most of us don't trash our own homes and gardens.  In fact, we usually don't trash our neighbor's yard.  We are far more likely to litter public streets and parks.  To save the earth, we must ensure that more of it is somebody's back yard.
<P>
It's not too late to rescue America
from centralized ecological planning.  But we must get serious
about shifting the environmental debate from the current <I>market
failure</I> paradigm to one based instead on a <I>failure to allow
markets</I>.  We should offer the American people an alternative
environmental vision-a vision in which each person, by protecting
his own property, protects the planet for the rest of us.  If
we begin now to rescue environmentalism from ideological pollution,
then maybe someday we, too, will have reason to celebrate Earth
Day.

control of the House, despite discouraging poll figures about
its leader..."
</blockquote>
<P>
    That view, of the vote ratifying the GOP win in 1994, was
rarely heard on the networks. In fact, no story on the Wednesday
night ABC, CBS or NBC evening shows told viewers that almost all
of the "extremist" freshmen won.
   <P>
 Among the winners, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho. Back on the
October 12 <I>Capital Gang</I>, The Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt
predicted: "I think the Gingrich robots are going to pay a
price. I mean Helen Chenoweth, the militia momma, is toast.
She's gone. Absolutely."
<P>
    Then followed this exchange:
<blockquote>
    Mark Shields: "Helen Chenoweth better start working on her
concession speech."<P>
    Time's Margaret Carlson: "Oh absolutely. Toast. Yeah."

 Early in the evening, all the networks falsely reported
that Senator Bob Smith would lose in New Hampshire. CBS provided
an explanation for the Republican loss. Bob Schieffer explained:  
 <P>
 <blockquote>  "I think that most Republicans considered Bob Smith, the New
Hampshire incumbent, perhaps, one of their most vulnerable
incumbents. This is a very interesting case Dan, he's a very
conservative Senator in a state that's becoming more moderate.
Most people on the national scene will recall him as the one
that fought against abortion over the past 3 or 4 years and
always brought all those graphic photos out to the Senate floor.
But in our polling, our exit polling today we found that the
moderate voters, 61 percent of them said that they voted for
Dick Swett. This is a state that is simply becoming more
moderate. When we ran this poll I think that almost half of the
people in New Hampshire told us that they now consider
themselves moderate. This used to be a very conservative state
but it got too moderate, I guess, for Bob Smith." 
</blockquote>
    In the end he wasn't too conservative for a newly moderate
state as he won re-election.

 Speaking of labeling, the networks provided plenty of it
Tuesday night. Senator Paul Wellstone got tagged "liberal" a few
times, but Republicans were described as conservative or "very"
conservative more often, especially on CNN. Some examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- Peter Jennings on ABC: "And the other thing which would
be quite a change, at least in ideological terms, is the
projection you made for Brownback in Kansas. Much more
conservative than the Republicans that Kansas usually sends to
Washington."
<P>
    -- Bob Schieffer on CBS, reporting the Georgia Senate race:
"Max Cleland, the Secretary of State and triple amputee down
there, the most popular vote getter. He even gets more votes
than Sam Nunn over the last 10 years was running against Guy
Millner a very conservative Republican." 
<P>
    -- Bruce Morton on CNN: "And finally Louisiana. That's
Bennett Johnston's old seat, where the Democrat Mary Landrieu is
in a very, very competitive race with a very, very conservative,
but there're a lot of those folks in Louisiana, state
Representative named Woody Jenkins."
<P>
    -- Frank Sesno on CNN: "Onto Illinois now, where Dick Durbin
turns back a challenge from Al Salvi, a very conservative
Republican there, but Dick Durbin winning there."
<P>
    -- Sesno again: "This seat was the one that was vacated when
Robert Dole took his leave to campaign for presidency. Jill
Docking the Democrat against Sam Brownback, very conservative
Republican."
<P>
    -- Morton again: "Still up in the air, Louisiana, where very
conservative Woody Jenkins won that odd, everybody-in primary
that they have."
<P>
    -- Exchange on CNN. Frank Sesno: "Helms ran a series of
really tough ads hitting his opponent Harvey Gantt,
African-American, with liberal liberal liberal label again."
    Bruce Morton: "Well the famous line I guess, more liberal
than Bill Clinton. Gasp! Shudder! Too liberal for North
Carolina. Helms always runs mean ads. I talked to one man down
there who were saying if he was running against Jesus he'd find
a way to attack him."
<P>
    -- Ken Bode on CNN: "That was a very clear choice for the
voters of Louisiana. Mary Landrieu is a moderate at least,
probably a liberal. And the person she was running against,
Woody Jenkins, a state legislator so conservative that in
twenty-some years, twenty-some years in the state legislature,
he did not vote for a single tax increase."
<P>
</blockquote>
    As 1am ET approached, CNN anchor Bernard Shaw assured
viewers: "A lot of Democrats have criticized us in our coverage
and conversely a lot of Republicans have criticized us in our
coverage. Never once in our coverage of this campaign story have
we played favorites. We don't play favorites."

 In speculating about what factors led to Clinton's
comeback, reporters repeatedly committed the biased reporting
that aided Clinton's cause: stating as fact that the GOP shut
down the government without mentioning how Clinton refused to
sign the spending resolutions. Some examples:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- Bernard Shaw on CNN: "Ken Bode making the point about,
and you Judy, that the President made this comeback, especially
after the disaster of 1994. The Republican Party actually helped
William Jefferson Clinton in that comeback, especially when they
voted to shut down Congress. The American people said the
Republicans went too far. We did not sent you to Washington to
shut down the federal government."
<P>
    -- Sam Donaldson on ABC on why Dole lost: "I think this was
set by two or three people. I think Alan Greenspan, who is the
Fed Chairman, helped engineer an economy that worked and it
worked for President Clinton. I think the Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich helped engineer a shutdown of the Congress twice,
that scared the country and that worked against Senator Dole, it
wasn't Senator Dole's fault...."
<P>
    -- Troy Roberts on Wednesday's <I>This Morning</I> on CBS: "Often
abrasive, Gingrich never mastered the fine art of compromise. 
Less than a year after he rode into Washington in triumph, he
was on the defensive. His gambit to shut down the government
over the budget backfired. Seizing the moment, President Clinton
quickly became the voice of centrist reason."

 Republicans may maintain control of both houses, but
they better not use their position to investigate Clinton
scandals. So warned several network reporters. Some examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw in prime time: "There is also a theory,
however, that if the Republicans begin to engage once again in a
lot of investigations that it will not do well for them four
years from now. Because the country in all the exit polling that
we're seeing so far is saying, 'Hey let's get on with the
business of solving the real problems that we have out there.'"
<P>
    -- NBC's Matt Lauer to Haley Barbour, on the Wednesday,
November 6 <I>Today</I>: "Mr. Barbour, exit polls show us that the
economy was still the number one issue on people's mind last
night. And although character and trust play a role, people
choose candidates based on their handling of the issues. With
that in mind, what do you say to people now who look to
Republicans in Congress and say, hey, move forward on key
legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the
Clinton White House?"
<P>
    -- ABC's John Cochran concluding his November 6 <I>World News
Tonight</I> story on the new Congress: "But both parties know the
public has a limited appetite for partisan head-bashing. And
today Senate Republicans said they had no plans to resume
investigations of the Whitewater affair. John Cochran, ABC News,
Capitol Hill."

    None too pleased with the passage of a proposition in
California to end racial discrimination, reporters tagged the
vote a step backward. Examples:
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- NBC's Maria Shriver to Jesse Jackson at about 12:48am ET:
"Affirmative action was a hotbed issue in this country, still a
big race on that subject going on about that in California. Did
you feel at times like we've turned back the clock on some of
these issues?"
<P>
    -- On Wednesday's <I>This Morning</I> co-host Jane Robelot
interviewed California Civil Rights Initiative chief Ward
Connerly:
<P> 
<blockquote>
"Good morning Mr. Connerly. Do you feel like Prop. 209
is going to stand up to the promised court challenges that it
faces?"
<P>
    Ward Connerly: "Absolutely, I think if you read the first
five words of the initiative, which say that the states shall
not discriminate. And by state I mean all governmental agencies
in the state. You recognize that it is already existing law and
the remainder of that first clause,  nor grant preferential
treatment to' and so on is really saying that discrimination
encompasses preferential treatment."
    Robelot: "But that's sort of living in an ideal world I mean
it's nice to say it on paper. If you look around at corporate
offices in America and in CEO's offices, you're gonna see very
few minorities and few women. Are we really ready to backtrack
on civil rights now, or on affirmative action?"

     Another election night, another night of wacky comments
from Dan Rather, aka Ratherisms:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- "Phil Jones is at the Dole HQ in Washington. Phil if you
are a Republican and you're a Bob Dole supporter, seeing New
Hampshire and Florida both fall into the column for Bill
Clinton, is it scary enough to make you swallow your gum?"
<P>
    -- "In Kentucky, in the presidential race, this is the way
it looks. This is with 47 percent of the precincts reporting.
Bill Clinton leading Bob Dole by just about the margin of
cigarette paper."
<P>
   -- "Our CBS news estimates is in one of the nastiest, 
smelliest campaigns of them all -- a lot of people
thought the stench from this would gag a buzzard -- Jeff
Sessions, the Alabama Attorney General, has beaten back the
effort of state senator Roger Bedford, to fill the seat of
retiring Democratic Senator Howell Heflin." 
<P>
    -- "Now, we may see Michael Jackson's baby before we know
the final outcome of this race for the House of Representatives
tonight..."
<P>
    -- In New Hampshire, closest Senate race in the country,
this race between Dick Swett and Bob Smith is hot and tight as a
too small bathing suit on a too long car ride back from the
beach."
<P>
    -- "Reelection of President Bill Clinton is as secure as a
double knot tied with wet rawhide and here's why..." 
<P>
    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw got into the act, offering this
Brokawism: "Just one state now closing its polls at this hour.
It's the home state of the incumbent President of the United
States, the state of Arkansas. No surprise, Bill Clinton now our
projected winner there. For him to lose Arkansas would be like
Elvis losing his hair. He could go on but it just wouldn't be
the same somehow."

     Networks reporters regularly referred to Bob Dole's
"harsh" rhetoric and media professional didn't complain. But in
Thursday's newspapers you may be reading about a critical
comment about Clinton that David Brinkley uttered. At the very
end of ABC's broadcast, just before 1am ET, Sam Donaldson, Cokie
Roberts, Jeff Greenfield, Lynn Sherr, and Hal Bruno stood by the
anchor desk where Peter Jennings and Brinkley sat. 
   <P>
 Jennings asked Brinkley for a final comment. Referring to
the assembled ABC crew, Brinkley announced: "OK, fine, I'm not
going to say much. Among things I admire, almost near the top is
creativeness, and everyone in this group has it. It shows in
your work, it shows in your thinking, and it shows in your
speech, what you do, what you write, what you say, and it's one
reason this group is so terrific. Bill Clinton has none of it,
he has not a creative bone in his body. Therefore, he's a bore
and will always be a bore."
<P>
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>  9)</FONT>
     Finally, Wednesday's NBC <I>Nightly News</I> concluded with a
piece from Mike Boettcher on what people want in second term.
Boettcher began: 
<P>
<blockquote>
    "When the sun touched the Pacific, America had made a
decision. Bob Dole's work was over. Bill Clinton's had just
begun. There, in a California night school was the gender gap.
The all-woman sign language class wanted their support for
Clinton rewarded."
  <P>
  Woman in the class: "I want to see a President that stands
for what he believes in and not somebody who just wants to
please the people."
<P>
</blockquote>
    So, someone who doesn't want a President who molds his views
to match polls voted for......Clinton. 
<P>Incredible.

<h2>State Groups That Fight for Mom and Dad</h2>
<b>by Charmaine Crouse Yoest</b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rudy Gonzalez, a "cowboy poet" with a handlebar mustache and a home-on-the-range accent, strummed his guitar, then launched into a joke. The crowd relaxed into laughter as he regaled them with tall tales and folk wisdom.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is the Idaho Family Forum's annual summer fundraiser, the Spud Bake, where this group of moms and dads marks the end of summer by eating baked potatoes. Lots of them. Followed by spud-shaped ice cream. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But cowboy poetry soon gave way to public policy. U.S. Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~craig/">Larry Craig</a> rose to address the group, and the question-and-answer session that followed was brisk and well informed. The Idaho Family Forum (IFF) and its supporters are dedicated to changing cultural trends that are undermining the stability of families -- from no-fault divorce to teen pregnancy to chronic welfare dependency.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Led by executive director Dennis Mansfield, a former businessman, the IFF is part of a growing national movement of independent, state-based policy organizations called Family Policy Councils (FPCs). There are now more than 30 such organizations across the country, loosely affiliated by shared goals, common strategies, and mutual support. In order to win the ears of lawmakers, the media, and academics, they prefer research over rallies and education over activism.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We are involved in an intellectually muscular and principled persuasion--almost like miniature <i>Crossfires</i> across the nation," says Mansfield. "We're not going to back down from anybody but we're going to use principled persuasion. We believe the weight of the facts wins the day." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like other FPC leaders, Mansfield is a familiar sight in the halls of his state capitol. But there's more to the movement than old-fashioned buttonholing. Legislative battles are really the "outworking of . . . intellectual battles," says Matt Daniels, the executive director of the Massachusetts Family Institute. That means fighting those battles at both the popular and academic levels--from public-service announcements about the benefits of fatherhood to thick policy papers on the social consequences of divorce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Steve Knudsen, the director of state and local affairs at the <a href="http://www.frc.org">Family Research Council</a>, in Washington, D.C., says that the FPCs exemplify the Jeffersonian ideal of the states as "laboratories of democracy." Now, in the era of devolution--the shifting of resources and responsibility out of Washington--they are strategically placed.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Our focus is on the long term," says Gary Palmer, the executive director of the Alabama Family Alliance. "We work on building relationships with policy-makers. We want to be the ones they turn to when they need accurate, reliable information." In more and more states around the country, FPCs and their staff are playing precisely that role. They advise governors and help craft legislation, they appear on talk shows and write syndicated columns, and they recruit the business and professional community as board members and supporters.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the last decade, 25 new family policy councils have been established, and have been deeply involved in some of their states' most significant battles over policy. The following are a few of their success stories:<a name="mich">
<p><b>Faulting No-Fault Divorce</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With 14 full-time staff and a budget of $1.3 million, the Michigan Family Forum is a leader among the FPCs. Its director is Randy Hekman, a former family-court judge with 12 children of his own.MFF laid the groundwork for divorce reform in Michigan in 1995, helping to ignite a similar reform revolution in states across the nation. In the fall, communications director Brian Willats drafted a report called "Breaking Up is Easy To Do: A Look at No-Fault Divorce in the State of Michigan."Filled with research documenting the consequences of family breakdown, it called for a return to the traditional fault system of divorce, except in cases of mutual consent in which minor children are not involved. Perhaps most important, the report called for a "children first" attitude in divorce considerations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The report was released at a legislative breakfast later that year and produced headlines across the state. State Representative Jessie Dalman then introduced divorce-reform legislation that incorporated the forum's recommendations. The bill became national news: "Michigan could set off a divorce counterrevolution," said the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. Dalman's bill was noted by the <i>New York Times, Newsweek</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>. Although the bill failed this year by a single vote, the Michigan Family Forum helped set the terms of what is now a national debate.<p>
<a name="wash"><b>Ads for Dads</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The voice is a dead giveaway. With that familiar, dynamic, raspy Kempian voice, Jeff Kemp couldn't escape identification as the son of the Republican vice presidential nominee if he wanted to. Kemp has followed his father -- first into professional football, and now into politics -- but Jeff has put his own imprimatur on political activism since taking the helm of the Washington Family Council (WFC), an organization with eight full-time employees and a budget of $600,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Before helping his father campaign, Kemp was busy barnstorming the state promoting the WFC's Fatherhood Initiative. Patterned on the National Fatherhood Initiative, the WFC's effort began with a statewide media barrage about the virtues of being a father. "We wanted to raise the bar for fatherhood," explains Randy Hicks, the WFC's associate director. They ran well-received radio ads produced by James Dobson's Focus on the Family and print ads created by the <a href="/frc">Family Research Council</a>. Both were tailored to address Washington state concerns. ABC's TV affiliate in Seattle soon invited Kemp to join a panel discussion with David Blankenhorn, a leading authority on fatherhood and the author of <i>Fatherless America</i>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So far, there is no legislative component to the initiative, but the campaign has had far-reaching results. The TV station was flooded with more than 500 calls -- more than it had ever received for any program. WFC prepared "fatherhood packets" -- information about how to strengthen the vital role of fathers in their families -- for these callers. The station then asked the WFC to produce a public-service announcement on fatherhood.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Soon Kemp and Hicks were traveling the state, meeting with managers of television stations to promote the PSA. Eventually every network affiliate in the state (at least a dozen stations) ran the ad. One station alone donated more than $250,000 in air time; a Seattle station was running the ad four times a day.<p>
<a name="ky"><b>Attacking Fluffy Education</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Family Foundation in Lexington, Kentucky, has established itself as an effective voice for conservative pro-family values, particularly in education. Since 1990, with the passage of the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), education has been one of the state's most controversial issues. The reason: The Kentucky education establishment used the Act to introduce outcome-based education and new tests without objective measures and to eliminate grades in primary schools. These "reforms" occurred without parental involvement and have been heralded by the national education establishment as a model reform effort.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The foundation launched the state's most potent criticism of the reforms. It insisted that the legislation's "Academic Expectations" component -- a list of 57 goals that serve as academic standards--was "vague, non-academic, and unmeasurable."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The foundation's arsenal consisted of carefully crafted arguments -- among them a pamphlet comparing  the state goals with standards based on work by former Secretary of Education <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>. Policy analyst Martin Cothran produced a blizzard of material for parents and policy-makers. The <i>Lexington Herald-Leader</i> profiled Cothran, calling him the leader of the opposition. Soon, Kentuckians saw newspaper headlines that read "Proof that KERA works still lacking" and "Discontent with KERA growing." In February, Governor Paul Patton established a task force to study whether the reforms were working.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Changing the law is the ultimate goal, but in the meantime, the foundation is happy to have changed the terms of the debate. "If all we had done was to change the law," says executive director Kent Ostrander, "I would be afraid the results wouldn't be long-term."
<p>
<a name="ala"><b>Betting Against Gambling</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Gary Palmer is another leader working behind the scenes to change his state. A former cost analyst for an engineering company, Palmer is an intense and compelling man with a thousand ideas -- half of which, it seems, he's on his way to achieving. In six years, he has built the Alabama Family Alliance into a $685,000 organization with a full-time staff of 10. "I believe in finding the best people and giving them the opportunity to excel," he says. His group has been so effective that Governor Fob James picked off two of the Family Alliance's top staffers. Palmer hires Ph.D.s for his policy slots and has a first-rate legal staff.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;He uses them to great strategic effect. This year the alliance grappled with the gaming industry. Gambling is illegal in Alabama, and the state house of representatives, where all revenue bills must originate, does not favor legalization. So when gambling interests targeted Mobile for expansion this year, they backed a legalization bill written as if it were not a revenue bill, and then introduced it in the state senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Palmer did not organize any rallies or demonstrations. But he and his staff were ready. Working with a pro-family senator, the alliance helped draft a request for a legal ruling from the state attorney general on the admissibility of a "non-revenue" gambling bill in the senate. The alliance's legal staff shared its extensive research on the case law with the attorney general, who then ruled that the legislation was a revenue bill and could not be introduced in the senate. It was quickly killed.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Policy analyst John Hill prepared a concise assessment of the economic and social costs of gambling. The report exposed state lotteries as a net loss for states using it to bring in revenue. As a result, the mayor of Mobile commissioned 41 local social-service agencies, including the American Red Cross and the United Way, to study the "social impact of gaming."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The conclusion? Fifteen million dollars in extra social-service costs to the city. "An increase in problems and demand for services attributable to gambling abuse or addiction will adversely affect the quality of life in Mobile for all its residents," the final report stated.

Writers have so confounded society with government as to leave little or no distinction between them." So wrote Thomas Paine in "Common Sense" in 1776. He could be writing today about those who look to government to solve all of America's problems.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 The House GOP freshmen reject this view. We know that government is only a part of society. Society is not a part of government. Government serves as only a portion of the entire society, and is not the entire society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Think of society as a chair. The legs of the chair represent four different and separate institutions. Government is just one leg; the others are families and the institutions that support them, religious and civic institutions, and business.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A stable chair frees you to sit, relax, eat, whatever you want to do, without worrying about falling on the floor. Similarly, the four institutions of society contribute equally to its stability. A child born into a society where all four institutions are healthy has the greatest opportunity for success in life. Consider the child's relationship to these four institutions: When family institutions are healthy, a child is more likely to learn respect for his parents. When government institutions are healthy, a child is more likely to obey the law. In healthy businesses, a child is more likely to learn the work ethic. In healthy religious institutions, a child is more likely to maintain a clear conscience before his or her God. With healthy and equal institutions, we can provide to every individual the freedom and security to pursue the promised opportunity for life, liberty, and happiness.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	During the past 100 years, America's government has become disproportionately large in relation to the country's other institutions. The result has been a burdensome governmental structure involved in virtually every aspect of our lives. The fundamental principles of the New Deal and Great Society programs -- the solving of social ills with governmental programs -- has resulted in a chair so unstable that a single finger can tip it over. Of all the money spent by government, 70 percent is controlled at the federal level, while 30 percent is controlled at the state and local levels. The 537 elected officials in Washington have substituted their "wisdom" for the wisdom of the thousands of local elected officials in our communities. The growth of the governmental leg has drawn too much away from the other core institutions, reducing their effectiveness and creating instability in America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our families have been decimated over the last 30 years by divorce, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, juvenile crime, and failing educational institutions. Religious and civic institutions are not functioning to their full potential. In his article "Bowling Alone" for the <i>Journal of Democracy</i>, Harvard professor Robert Putnam documented the significant decline in "social capital" and in participation in the civic associations of "civil society." In the political arena, declining voter participation and the community's feelings of disempowerment are symptoms of the deterioration of these institutions. In the business realm, our current fascination with "downsizing," layoffs, and superheated stock markets is a result of unstable institutions. The political community is particularly concerned about job insecurity, which has probably exacerbated the decline of business as well as religious and civic institutions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These concerns, I believe, prompted Americans to send a Republican-led Congress to Washington in November 1994. Our new Republican majority went about aggressively downsizing government. We acted on the promises of the Contract With America, like blockgranting programs to the 50 states. We set about reforming or eliminating the myriad federal welfare, job-training, and housing programs. We focused on deregulation and tax reform, trying to encourage the marketplace to shed government control. We even considered eliminating the Departments of Education, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, House Republicans failed to communicate a vision of America that included its other core institutions. We did not give enough thought to how families would react to the withdrawal of government from their lives. We did not articulate the need to re-create religious and civic institutions, or to develop self-regulation in the business realm. In short, we only looked at the institution we could influence directly: government. Until we can explain to the American people how we can rebuild the institutions of community while reducing government, then maybe we shouldn't be reducing government at all.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Through its disapproval of the government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996, the American people have told us, "We agree with downsizing government, but we're not going to let you do it unless you can show us how America will be a better place for everybody as a result." Thus the task we freshmen have set ourselves is to articulate our vision of the "New America."<p>	<b>The Legislative Program</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Freshman Class Vision articulates two essential elements (see <a href="#box">box</a>). One element is legislative reform, and the other is a higher level of personal responsibility in society. Both must happen simultaneously. The legislative program continues to be our priority in Washington. We must downsize, restructure, and reform government while we begin to rebuild the other core institutions. Four examples will give some idea of how this might happen:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Social programs.</b> During the 30 or so years of government expansion into welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid, dependency upon government has increased and the ranks of the needy have expanded. Many people believe that the values reflected in social programs and in helping with the care of the needy have a basis in Scripture, not in the Constitution. The Good Samaritan, after all, is found in the Bible. The New America vision calls for the care of the poor to shift from government to religious and civic institutions and the family, where it had historically resided prior to the development of the welfare state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Churches and faith-based organizations, nonprofit social-service agencies, and charities should have a prime role in providing for those in need. But if we are to begin to rely on nongovernmental institutions, then we must create legislation that encourages this transfer. How can we structure tax policy, for example, to provide a smooth transition from government programs to the religious, civic, and family institutions of this country?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In my opinion, we should encourage religious and civic institutions to take up social programs by giving healthy tax deductions to those contributing money to churches, charities, and other nonprofit groups. Under this policy, institutions caring for the needy expand, while the revenue propping up the government sector shrinks.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Regulation and tax relief.</b> As we reduce taxes and regulation of business, we reduce the overhead of a regulatory government. At the same time, the market will redirect resources currently consumed by taxes and regulatory compliance toward business expansion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Education.</b> Properly handled, reforms in education would help restore the institution of the family. The educational system, a governmental structure, must be accountable to parents, not the state. This can be achieved in part through voucher programs. My personal preference is to increase local control, and therefore encourage parental participation. The most telling problem with education, at least in local school districts, is that local elected officials have very little discretion over school spending; most is determined by state and federal mandates. If we send more dollars unencumbered to the local level, we will encourage more parents to get involved in their children's education. This will encourage parents -- and their children -- to assume personal responsibility for educational decisions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Localizing.</b> Localizing government, as with education, means shifting responsibilities back to the state and local levels. When we localize decisionmaking, we reduce the overhead of the federal government, thereby reducing its role.<p><b>Personal Responsibility</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By downsizing government and reinvigorating other institutions to fulfill their proper roles, we have begun to address our obligations as the freshmen elected in 1994. We have taken a necessary, though not sufficient, first step toward a New America.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Still, something is missing. The nongovernmental institutions are not functioning to their full capacity. By encouraging local control and involvement, we may have begun to address issues like juvenile crime and school accountability. Our problems, however, demand another, essential element: personal responsibility.


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Congress cannot raise the conscience of the American people, decrease our reliance on governmental institutions, and encourage the development of individual and community-based solutions to community problems. Personal responsibility cannot be legislated in Washington. We can't create good parents by passing a law. We can't make everybody go to church or other religious institutions or be ethical in business. There are some things that even Great Society advocates would agree government simply cannot do. Encouraging and creating personal responsibility is ultimately the task of the nation's religious institutions. It must happen in concert with downsizing government, and won't happen without it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Family institutions.</b> For members of a family, taking personal responsibility means meeting obligations, participating in family activities, and raising children well.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Business institutions.</b> Encouraging personal responsibility in business institutions would accomplish at least two things. One result would be fewer lawsuits; another would be the development of peer review, such as doctors policing doctors, lawyers policing lawyers, and like businesses policing one another. Peer review would achieve a more cost-effective regulatory scheme than government, with better results.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Governmental institutions.</b> We need to spread responsibility among the tens of thousands of state and local elected officials across the country. By raising the conscience of the American people, we can eventually change the distribution of government resources from 70 percent controlled at the federal level to 70 percent controlled at the state and local levels.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The central challenge is to downsize government in a responsible fashion that rebuilds the other core institutions in this country until they all achieve a final equality and balance. It is a huge job. It is one my colleagues and I face every day, and it will require the ongoing support of the American people. But it is a task we must accomplish to restore the stability of the American Dream and to provide freedom and security for all.

<h3>Blueprint To Renew Society</h3><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In order to provide greater freedom and security, the 74 members of the Republican Freshman Class stand for structural reform in America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We believe that government is too big in relation to other institutions in America.  We believe that reducing government should not, and cannot, occur without renewal of family, religious/ civic, and business institutions in American society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A balanced budget that privatizes, localizes, and eliminates federal government activities is the blueprint to renew society.  To renew society, however, the conscience of the American people must be raised, increasing personal responsibility and hence the effectiveness of all of our institutions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our vision is one in which family, religious/civic, business, and government institutions contribute equally to the foundation of a New America.

<title>ABIC - Presidential Candidates' Positions on Term Limits</title>

<h3>Where Do The Presidential Candidates Stand on Term Limits??
</h3></center>
<p>
<p>
ABIC has pulled together information from many sources, including press clippings, candidate questionnaires and candidate statements to put together a picture of where each presidential candidate stands on this important reform issue.  We've gathered what information we could about some of the key presidential candidates--if you have more information that can be substantiated, please let us know!
<p>
<b>The candidates:</b>
<p>
<center><h3>Bill Clinton (Democrat)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits</b>: Opposes
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
"No.  I share with supporters of congressional term limits their goal to reform our political system and renew our democracy.  I do not, however, believe that term limits are the appropriate means to achieve this desirable end."
<h6><p align="right">--USAToday (10/15/96), Answer to Candidate Questionnaire<br>
(Question: Do you support congressional term limits?)</p>
</h6><p>
"I've had my own reservations about term limits because I didn't necessarily think that -- as a national thing -- because I didn't necessarily think that voters in one state ought to tell voters in another how long they ought to b able to vote for the people of their choice."
<h6><p align="right">--telephone interview with the Denver Post (5/30/95)
</p></h6><p>
"I know they're popular, but I'm against them."
<h6><p align="right">--Presidential Debate in Richmond, Virginia (10/15/92)
</p></h6><p>
<i>What has he done?</i>
<p>
In 1992, the same year he was elected president, the voters of Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas passed term limits for their own congressional delegation.  When the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this law reached the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of 1994, President Clinton had his Solicitor General argue against the law before the High Court and against the voters of his own home state.  Ultimately the Court agreed with the President and overturned Arkansas' term limits law.
<p>
Since then, while Congress has attempted to pass a term limits constitutional amendment through both the House and Senate, the President stood by while members of his own party fought against the amendment in both chambers.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center><h3>Bob Dole (Republican)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits:</b> Supports
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
 "As president, I will push for an amendment to the Constitution that establishes a two-term limit for senators and a six-term limit for House members. I will continue to press for legislation that limits the power of special interest groups and makes representatives more accountable to their constituents. These decisive steps will further enhance the confidence of the electorate in Congress, and the laws it developed, as we enter the 21st century."
<h6><p align="right">--USAToday (10/15/96), Answer to Candidate Questionnaire<br>
(Question: Do you support congressional term limits?)</p>
</h6><p>
<i>What has he done?
</i><p>
In the early days of this Congress, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole promised that the Senate would have a vote on the term limits constitutional amendment.  In April of this year, he kept his promise and brought the amendment to the floor of the Senate for a vote.  Unfortunately, the Democrats filibustered, preventing the Senate from ever having a vote on the actual amendment.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center><h3>Ross Perot (Reform Party)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits:</b> Supports
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
"Yes. Our elected leaders must realize that serving the American people is a privilege, not a career. Seventy-four percent of the American people support term limits. It is time we passed a constitutional amendment limiting congressional terms."

<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly 40 years, my grandma taught poor immigrant first-graders in Brooklyn to read. She also taught remedial reading to teenagers who had somehow never mastered the written word. She was a marvelous teacher who combined patience, affection, and phonics, which she always said was the best way to learn. And at her funeral, many of her former pupils showed up to honor her memory.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Your grandmother gave me a gift I will never forget," one of them told me. "When she taught me to read, she changed my life. She opened doors that had slammed shut on me. She made it possible for me to succeed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I thought of my grandmother when I heard President Clinton's stirring call for a national literacy campaign at the Democratic convention in August. "Let us set a clear national goal," Clinton said. "All children should be able to read on their own by the third grade." Yes, I thought, the president is right on target: Literacy is the key to all other learning. Unless he can read, a child is doomed. And Grandma would have applauded Clinton's infectious, can-do spirit. She always insisted that <i>every</i> child could be taught to read.

</table>
<br><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Grandma also would applaud the precise, measurable standard the president set for his campaign. This is not some slippery, Goals 2000-type call to raise self-esteem or ensure children enter school "ready to learn." This is a real test measuring essential knowledge, the kind of test that good teachers prize. Either a child can read or he can't, in which case some other way to teach him must be found. And it's a badly needed test because, as President Clinton reminded us, 40 percent of eight-year-olds have serious reading difficulties.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The president's literacy proposal is attractive for other reasons. It calls not for a new bureaucratic program but rather a volunteer army of 1 million reading tutors. This is consistent with Clinton's appreciation of civil society and the American tradition of citizens stepping forward to solve the problems of their communities. So far so good. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But wait a minute: Where's the accountability for teachers? Just what are they supposed to be doing, if not teaching our children to read? If 40 percent of eight-year-olds have trouble reading, what's wrong with our public schools? Shouldn't we hire better teachers who can teach reading the way Grandma did? And why aren't problem readers helped by the $30 billion-plus we spend each year on special education?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The literacy proposal is typical of Clinton at his best and at his worst. He has a brilliant knack for focusing the nation's attention like a laser beam on a profound problem. He laces his solutions with culturally conservative notions such as rigorous testing and volunteerism rather than bureaucracy. But he totally ignores the need to reform existing institutions that are already expected to address the problem; in this case, he absolves the schools of their failure to teach. <i>President Clinton uses the language of personal responsibility to promote and perpetuate government irresponsibility.</i> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Clinton has defined himself as a cultural conservative. There are a few issues where he is on the cultural left: abortion, where he defends even a grisly procedure bordering on infanticide, and civil rights, where he defends racial preferences that violate the principle of equality before the law. On gay rights, he sends mixed signals. But on most social issues, Clinton is the most culturally conservative Democratic presidential nominee since Hubert Humphrey, perhaps even since Harry Truman. Consider the Clinton record:
<p>
<ul><li>	He has issued guidelines calling for more teaching about religion in public schools; during his presidency, National Public Radio and PBS have finally begun treating religion with respect. <li>	He has promoted the V-chip for TV sets to give parents more control over what their children watch.<li>	Over the objections of the American Civil Liberties Union, he has signed "Megan's Law"-style legislation to keep parents informed of convicted sex offenders living in their neighborhoods.<li>	He has endorsed youth curfews and school uniforms -- seemingly small measures, but a significant rebuke to "children's-rights" activists within the Democratic party who oppose any restrictions on the freedom of minors.<li>	He has said Dan Quayle was right about the irreplaceable benefits of the two-parent family.<li>	He and the First Lady have spoken out frequently about the importance of adoption, and, over the objections of the National Association of Black Social Workers, the president signed GOP legislation overturning barriers to transracial adoption.<li>	He has embraced the principles of the Founding in defining what it means to be an American: "If you believe in the values of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you are willing to work hard and play by the rules, you are part of our family."<li>	He has signed legislation protecting states from being forced to recognize homosexual marriages.<li>	He says that the three central principles of the Democratic Party in this election are "opportunity," "responsibility," and "community."<li>	Most prominently, despite the opposition of his party's left wing, the president signed the Republican welfare-reform legislation abolishing Aid to Families with Dependent Children as an entitlement and sending a clear signal that society expects able-bodied welfare recipients to work.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These moves to the center cannot be brushed off simply as election-year posturing or Dick Morris's triangulation strategy. Many of the president's cultural proposals reflect the work of William Galston, Elaine Kamarck, and other New Democrats associated with the communitarian movement and the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org">Progressive Policy Institute</a>. And Clinton targets cultural conservatism not just to swing voters but to the traditional base of the Democratic party. For instance, in 1993 at the Tennessee church where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his final sermon, Clinton imagined what Dr. King might say today:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"He would say, 'I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed.' 'I fought for freedom,' he would say, 'but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandon; not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them as if they don't amount to anything. . . . This is not what I lived and died for.' "<p><b>Co-Conspirator in Evasion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Clinton, in short, is guiding Democrats to a greater appreciation of family and religion and community. But he still promotes government's massive flight from responsibility. For the past 30 years, American mayors and governors have sought to deflect responsibility for failing schools, rising crime rates, and welfare dependency. "Don't blame us," the mayors and governors have said, "blame the federal government, which hasn't given us enough money." President Clinton is a co-conspirator in this strategy of evasion. He may say that "the era of Big Government is over," but he is expanding federal responsibility in a way that diffuses the accountability of public officials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Consider the president's much-trumpeted funding of "100,000 new police officers" for America's communities. In truth, Clinton's crime initiative has funded 20,000 new cops, a 3 percent addition to existing police forces. But the president has given America's mayors something more important than the few new officers in each city. Now the federal government shares responsibility for police protection. Cities can now cut their own funding of law enforcement with the expectation that the feds will make up the difference. Even better, the mayors can now blame Newt Gingrich and "GOP budget-cutting" for the failures of their own police departments.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Senator Dole has contributed to this irresponsibility, too. He has campaigned as if local law enforcement were the president's job. The real issue should not be whether Bill Clinton or Bob Dole is tougher on crime. The real issue is why city governments, run mostly by liberal Democrats, can't protect their citizens. If Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police chief William Bratton can cut crime by 35 percent in New York City, why can't Mayors Marion Barry and Ed Rendell do the same in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia? If California can cut crime by 9 percent in one year with a "three strikes and you're out" law, why can't other states? Americans ought to be asking themselves these questions, but with Dole's help, Clinton has muddied these comparisons by claiming a central role for the federal government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps no Clinton initiative promotes government irresponsibility more than his favorite, AmeriCorps. Modeled on the military, AmeriCorps has many culturally conservative attributes. It is dedicated to service, volunteerism, and duty to country. AmeriCorps sends its members to many fine organizations that foster personal responsibility. One such group, <a href="http://www.habitat.org">Habitat for Humanity</a>, promotes home ownership, self-help, and sweat equity as it helps low-income people build their own houses. 

<p><table width="170" align="right" cellpadding="3">

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>No, Mrs. Clinton, it doesn't take a president to raise a child. If everyone's responsible, no one's responsible.</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But for all its emphasis on personal responsibility, AmeriCorps aggravates the crisis in government irresponsibility. It is a federal organization parachuting into local communities to solve local problems -- helping a charter school in Oakland, a community-service program in Dallas, a police-cadet program in New York City. Many of these are worthy causes, but AmeriCorps usurps local responsibility. Local governments and private funders have the greatest stake in the success of such programs. They are also in the best position to hold them accountable for how money is spent. But these local institutions are less likely to seek or finance promising solutions if they think AmeriCorps will do it for them.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	AmeriCorps fosters irresponsibility in another way. The federal government now does so many things that it does nothing very well. At a time when government should focus on what it does best and what it alone can do, why is Clinton inflating an already-bloated public sector with volunteer organizations such as Habitat for Humanity that can prosper without government help?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Clinton's diffusion of responsibility is best reflected, of course, in the First Lady's breathtaking statement at the Democratic convention that "it takes a president" to raise a child. No, Mrs. Clinton, moms and dads raise children. Parents can be helped by a village, properly understood: by relatives, teachers, clergy, police, neighbors. But a village defined as a national community can't help them in any meaningful way. Children are in trouble today precisely because moms and dads -- and neighbors and relatives -- are abdicating their responsibility and expecting the president to come to the rescue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In his convention speech in August, the president defended welfare reform by saying, "Now there's no more 'Who's to blame?' on welfare. Now the only question is 'What to do?,' and we all have a responsibility." Therein lies the essence of Clintonism. Hold everyone responsible, hold no one accountable. When everyone has a responsibility, no one can be blamed when programs fail. And, if we take seriously the history of welfare, fail they will.

<h3>NEW FOREIGN POLICY CREDO: BE PREPARED</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 election campaign has been conspicuously quiet on foreign policy. Both major presidential candidates, catering to a post-Cold War public glad to be rid of the constant nuclear threat from the Soviet Union, have avoided the subject, thinking they were following the prudent political course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I disagree: Leadership requires more than merely reflecting the momentary concerns of the electorate. It requires not just talking about what people say they are concerned about, but also pointing out what they ought to be concerned about. And they ought to be concerned about foreign policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 The truth is that the United States is handling foreign policy challenges like Iraq, Bosnia, North Korea and Haiti on an ad hoc basis -- without adequate contingency plans already in place when trouble strikes. What this means is that it is only a matter of time before America is caught unprepared and becomes unnecessarily involved in another war or some other international crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
In the post-Cold War era, the United States has failed to set clear and meaningful criteria for action, stick to those criteria, and effectively communicate them to friends and enemies alike so other nations can predict how we will respond in a given situation. Without such guidelines, friends are left not knowing whether they can count on us, enemies are encouraged to test the waters to see what they can get away with, and our military is involved in matters best handled by other countries or by international social workers.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House should be formulating its plans for dealing with possible foreign policy crises now -- based on a clear understanding of U.S. interests and capabilities to shape events -- not after events start spinning out of control. Here is a "top-10 list," if you will, of worst-case foreign-policy scenarios the White House should be prepared to deal with should they arise, arranged in order from least to most likely: 
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #10</b> &#160; &#160;Civil war in Russia divides control of Russia's nuclear forces between various political and military factions. Based on false information that the United States is about to intervene militarily, a rogue commander authorizes a nuclear attack on the United States or U.S. forces in Europe. Unlikely, to be sure, but not impossible;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #9</b>  &#160; &#160;Next year, China decides to turn up the heat on Taiwan by establishing a naval blockade of that island nation or threatening a ballistic missile attack;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Scenario #8</b>  &#160; &#160;Iran tries to close down the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, bottling up some 20 percent of the world's oil supplies, or helps topple the monarchy in Saudi Arabia;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #7</b>  &#160; &#160;An Iraqi-backed terrorist group attacks U.S. troops in Kuwait with biological weapons -- anthrax spores, for example -- killing hundreds of American soldiers. However, no one takes credit and no one is sure who did it;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #6</b>  &#160; &#160;Russia threatens the Baltic states -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- with military action in response to NATO's decision to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in the alliance;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #5</b>  &#160; &#160;Boris Yeltsin dies and new Russian elections result in the rise of an unpredictable, anti-Western president like Alexander Lebed.  Or Yeltsin doesn't die, but becomes incapacitated, setting off a dangerous succession struggle in the Kremlin that destabilizes Russia;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #4</b>  &#160; &#160;Saddam Hussein shoots down a U.S. plane in the newly expanded no-fly zone in Northern Iraq and takes its pilot hostage;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #3</b>  &#160; &#160;North Korea decides to go down fighting, invades the South, overruns most of the 37,000 U.S. troops along the demilitarized zone, and reduces most of Seoul to rubble;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #2</b>  &#160; &#160;China decides to crack down on Hong Kong next year after the former British colony reverts to Beijing's rule;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #1</b> &#160; &#160;U.S. troops stay in Bosnia past the promised December deadline for withdrawal, and dissatisfied groups decide to eject the Americans by force, or radical Moslem terrorists launch attacks on remaining U.S. troops.
</blockquote>	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Does the administration have contingency plans in place should any of the above scenarios arise? To judge from its conduct so far on the world stage, it is highly improbable.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No administration, Republican or Democrat, should operate in the foreign policy arena without clearly understanding how America's interests would best be served in such crisis scenarios. Unless U.S. policy-makers are prepared to act with determined vision in the post-Cold War world, they place America at risk.

<center><i>Entrepreneurship Matters</i></center>
<P>
Entrepreneurship serves as fuel for the economy.  Entrepreneurs
are the ultimate source of innovation, invention, creativity,
and efficiencies that drive economic growth.
<P>
In turn, vigorous job creation depends upon the health of entrepreneurs
and small businesses.  Indeed, small to mid&#173;size firms (500
employees or less) account for about 70 percent to 80 percent
of new jobs created.
<P>
Given the central role of entrepreneurs and small businesses in
the economy, the impact of public policies on entrepreneurship
looms as a paramount concern.
<P>
Policies that are truly pro&#173;entrepreneur and pro&#173;small&#173;business
enhance incentives for working, investing, and risk taking, and
free up resources from government for private&#173;sector uses.
 These policies are no mystery: lower taxes, elimination of excessive
regulations, and smaller government.
<P>
Quite naturally, presidential leadership on small business issues
is critical.
<P>
<a name="two">
<center><i>The Clinton Plan</i></center>
<P>
President Clinton's economic plan faced an enormous obstacle before
even being formulated, i.e., previous anti&#173;entrepreneur measures
offered by the Clinton Administration.  The President's massive
1993 tax increase hit small businesses hard.  In fact, according
to the congressional Joint Economic Committee, small business
owners were saddled with the brunt of the increase in income tax
rates under the 1993 tax hike.  (See chart on following page.)
<P>
In addition, small businesses would have been devastated by mandates
and higher costs under the President's proposed federal takeover
of the nation's health care system.
<P>
Along with other anti&#173;small&#173;business initiatives (like
the minimum wage increase), the Clinton economic plan faces a
fairly deep hole from which to climb out.
<P>
The following Clinton proposals would directly impact entrepreneurs
and small business:
<ul>
<li>Limited expansion of IRAs for education, retirement and first&#173;time
home buying.  These measures would have a minor favorable impact
on small business by increasing incentives for saving and investment.
 However, the beneficial effects are limited by income caps.<BR>
<P>
<li>Welfare&#173;to&#173;work tax credit for employers hiring
welfare recipients (50 percent tax credit on first $10,000 of
wages and benefits &#173;&#173; available for two years) and an
expansion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.  This is a slight
boost for businesses willing and able to hire welfare recipients.
<li>Provide a tax incentive for businesses to undertake hazardous
waste site clean&#173;ups in distressed communities.  Such an
incentive amounts to little when compared with the federal government's
costly, unfair, and litigious policies regarding waste sites under
Superfund.
<li>Expand the number of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.
 Empowerment Zones offer rather minor tax breaks for businesses,
while Enterprise Communities merely allow for the distribution
of federal government pork.
<li>A series of tax increases (many rather technical) are proposed
to offset estimated revenue losses from other tax cuts and increased
programs.  These tax hikes include reforming depreciation deductions
to account more accurately for expected future income; restricting
interest deductions for corporations that invest in tax&#173;exempt
bonds; increase in the per&#173;passenger tax for international
flights from $6 to $16; eliminate $3.4 billion in unspecified
corporate &quot;subsidies&quot; (not specific &#173;&#173; good
idea if cutting back on corporate welfare; bad idea if tax increases);
establish a new $225 charge per flight, phased in over 3 years
for commercial and private corporate turbo jets and turbo prop
planes; establish a graduated filing fee structure according to
asset size for firms seeking to merge; eliminate the 70 percent
and 80 percent dividends&#173;received deductions for certain
debt&#173;like stock; impose a fee of $1 per check paid by the
U.S. government to its vendors; and more.
</ul>
The problem with this proposal is that the economy is not receiving
a full net tax cut, but merely replacing one kind of taxation
for another, with no clear benefits for pro&#173;growth economic
incentives.
<P>
<i>Clinton Plan: D&#173;<br></i>
<P>
Comment: The Clinton economic plan offers little hope that  current
tax and regulatory burdens will be eased any time soon.  This
plan fails to relieve any of the misery imposed on small businesses
in the 1993 tax hike.  No regulatory relief is provided.  And
no indications exist that government will be getting any smaller.
 Indeed, the few, minor tax cuts offered are not broad&#173;based
(government once again mistakenly tries to decide how best to
allocate resources) and are offset by other tax increases.  <BR>
<P>
Especially in light of the 1993 tax increase, the near catastrophic
health care plan, and other anti&#173;entrepreneur initiatives
over the past four years, the Clinton economic plan could have
easily warranted a failing grade.  Only minor enhancements in
incentives for savings salvaged a non&#173;failing grade.  Indeed,
considerable grade generosity was used in assigning a D&#173;
to the Clinton plan.<BR>
<P>
In the context of initiatives already advanced by the Clinton
Administration, entrepreneurs and small business generally remain
losers under the Clinton plan.<BR>
<P>
When entrepreneurs and small businesses lose, so does the economy.
 The Clinton Administration's projection of an under&#173;performing
economy &#173;&#173; with a real annual average economic growth
rate of 2.3 percent for the foreseeable future &#173;&#173; is
probably pretty accurate given this economic plan.  Though growth
could certainly wane further.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three">
<I>The Dole Plan<BR></I>
<P>
A Dole economic plan faced far less anti&#173;entrepreneurial
baggage than the Clinton plan.  Though, Dole's support for both
sizable tax increases (e.g., 1982 and 1990) and tax cuts (e.g.,
1981 and 1986, along with opposition to the 1993 tax hike) created
a more ambiguous environment.<BR>
<P>
The following Dole proposals would directly impact entrepreneurs
and small business:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li>A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board personal income tax
cut.  An across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes
benefits entrepreneurs and business in two primary ways: 1) incentives
for working, investing and risk taking are boosted; and 2) the
bottom line for most enterprises is directly impacted (79 percent
of all business tax returns are filed by non&#173;corporations
&#173;&#173; partnerships and sole proprietorships &#173;&#173;
and this rate jumps to almost almost 89 percent when accounting
for S&#173;Corporations).  <BR>
<dd>The only problems with this measure is that rates are not cut
deep enough (for example, after the Dole tax cut is fully implemented
the top tax rate will rest at 33.7 percent, still above the top
rate of 28 percent under President Reagan), or quickly enough
(phasing in the tax cut over three or four years will only delay
its benefits).<BR>
<li>A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax, dropping
the top rate from 28 percent to 14 percent.  No other public policy
step, perhaps barring a complete overhaul of our present tax system,
reaps more rewards for entrepreneurs and the economy than capital
gains tax reduction.  Incentives for investing and risk taking
will rise considerably under a 50 percent cut in the capital gains
tax rate.
<li>A cut in the estate tax by excluding an additional $1 million
of value from an estate for qualified family&#173;owned businesses.
 The estate tax amounts to nothing more than a government hostile
takeover of a business at death.  A cut in the estate tax will
boost incentives for investment and allow many family businesses
to live on and prosper.  The only problem with this proposal is
its somewhat limited scope.
<li>
Expansion of IRAs for retirement and education.  These measures
would have a minor favorable impact on small business by increasing
incentives for saving and investment.
<li>
Repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits.  Older
entrepreneurs &#173;&#173; perhaps retired from their original
jobs and trying to launch or expand a business &#173;&#173; will
benefit from a rollback in the 1993 tax increase on Social Security
benefits.
<li>
Regulatory reform including requiring that new regulations
pass muster of cost&#173;benefit analysis, risk assessment, and
independent peer&#173;review; new regulations be re&#173;evaluated
every four years; and a regulatory sunsetting task force review
all federal regulations with an eye toward eliminating the ineffective.
 Regulations have the same impact as do taxes &#173;&#173; raising
the costs of starting up, running, and expanding a business. 
Establishing a regulatory system where regulations must stand
up to more rigorous assessments before being implemented, and
afterwards being subject to regular review and sunsetting, amounts
to a major step in the right direction in regulatory policy.
<li>
Legal system reforms including a limit on punitive damages
in certain cases; abolishing joint and several liability for non&#173;economic
damages in civil cases; and curbing the use of contingency fees.
<BR>
<DD>Our current legal system can inflict considerable and sometimes
irreparable damage on small businesses, entrepreneurs, and our
economy.  Beginning to reform perverse liability schemes and limiting
some damages make for a good start.
<li>
Establish a clear, meaningful home&#173;office tax deduction
for home&#173;based businesses.  Home&#173;based businesses are
rapidly expanding as our economy decentralizes.  These home&#173;based
entrepreneurs need to operate under a clear set of tax rules,
and stop being eyed with suspicion by the IRS.
<li>
Reform independent contractor rules.  The question of who
is or is not classified by the IRS as an independent contractor
has long plagued small businesses and the self&#173;employed.
Clarity and simplicity are surely needed.
<li>
Boost the tax deduction for health insurance costs for the
self&#173;employed to 100 percent.  The self&#173;employed deserve
the same health insurance deduction as is provided for employer&#173;provided
health plans.
<li>
Sets out a long&#173;term goal of overhauling our current
tax code in favor of a fairer, flatter, simpler tax system.  Replacing
our current tax code makes sense.  The current code is riddled
with problems: tax rates are too high; capital taxed too heavily;
it's complicated and unclear; incentives for tax avoidance abound;
it's intrusive and bureaucratic; and it is set up to easily feed
government growth.
</ul>
<P>
The Dole plan deserves credit for noting the need to overhaul
the tax system, but disappoints in that it lacks a clear alternative
with a timetable.<BR>
<P>
<center><i>Dole Plan: B+</i></center>
<P>
Comment: The Dole economic plan amounts to an excellent start
at reducing the governmental burdens imposed on small businesses
and entrepreneurs.  Tax cuts, regulatory reform, and legal reforms
are all desperately needed. <BR>
<P>
While grading on the Clinton plan was generous, a grade of B+
for the Dole plan is a far tougher grade.  The Dole plan fell
short of a grade of A due to what it lacked.  Much more can be
done to spur entrepreneurship, like eliminating capital gains
and estate taxes, instituting deeper cuts in tax rates, and proposing
tougher regulatory standards (e.g., requiring Congress and the
president to sign off on all rules and regulations).  And as already
noted, a complete overhaul of our current tax code  is needed
rather quickly.
<P>
On whole, however, entrepreneurs and small businesses would be
winners under the Dole economic plan.
<P>
Naturally, in turn, the economy should grow at a faster pace.
 Current Administration assumptions place the average annual real
rate of economic growth at 2.3 percent into the foreseeable future.
 Such rates would grossly under&#173;perform the post&#173;Civil
War average rate of 3.5 percent.  The Dole camp projects that
real economic growth rates will average about 2.8 percent over
the next six years.  That is, the Dole changes will be worth about
0.5 percentage points in growth each year versus current projections.
 A new report by Gary and Aldona Robbins for the Institute for
Policy Innovation estimates an average annual percentage point
boost to real growth over the next six years of 0.55.
<P>
Given the economy's long&#173;term growth trend, these certainly
are not wild&#173;eyed projections.  In fact, they are conservative
as they only attempt to quantify and estimate the growth effects
of the tax cuts and do not take into account the impact of regulatory
and legal reforms, for example.
<P>
<a name="four">
<center><i>The Ideal: An A+ Economic Plan</i></center>
<P>
The following is offered as a model framework for an economic
plan that will boost investment, entrepreneurship, and economic
growth.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li>In the short run, cut income taxes across the board, and eliminate
the anti&#173;entrepreneur capital gains and estate taxes.
<li>In the longer run, replace our current messy, counter&#173;productive
tax system with a low&#173;rate, simple, consumption&#173;based
tax.  A low flat&#173;rate income tax or a low&#173;rate (i.e.,
less than 10 percent) national retail sales tax make sense.  
<li>A massive deregulation effort must be implemented.  This means
not only rolling back current onerous regulations, but establishing
a system that helps to prevent the imposition and continuation
of costly regulations, including congressional approval of all
rules and regulations, sunsetting regulations, and using sound
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost&#173;benefit analysis
when evaluating possible new or renewal of current regulations.
<li>Dramatic reductions in the size of government &#173;&#173;
federal, state, and local &#173;&#173; must occur.  Privatization,
competitive contracting, and cutbacks in and elimination of wasteful
programs must be implemented in order to cut government spending
and free up resources for more productive private&#173;sector
uses.
</ul>
<P>
Also, free trade and sound money are needed as foundations upon
which risk taking and the economy can flourish.  Indeed, this
pro&#173;entrepreneur agenda would more than likely place the
U.S. economy on a track above its post&#173;Civil War real average
growth rate.
<P>
As noted earlier, no mystery needs to be solved.  The policies
that benefit entrepreneurs, small business, and the economy are
clear: low taxes, elimination of excessive regulations, and small
government.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is considering how to help state and local officials combat violent teenage crime. In the House of Representatives, the most prominent proposal is the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565), sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime. The McCollum bill would change the federal criminal justice system by mandating that juveniles who commit two types of federal crime -- serious violent crimes or major drug trafficking offenses -- will be tried as adults in federal courts; it also would impose mandatory minimum sentences on juveniles who use firearms in the commission of a federal crime. In the Senate, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1996 (S. 1854), sponsored originally by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and former Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), would make similar improvements in federal law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the Hatch and McCollum bills would give states financial assistance to help them combat juvenile crime. The McCollum bill would replace the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) with a new Office of Juvenile Crime Control. In addition to serving as a clearinghouse for information disseminated to state officials, this office would make $500 million available to the states: $250 million in the form of "incentive grants" to help the states adopt needed reforms -- for example, tougher sanctions on juvenile criminals, mandatory restitution, and greater public availability of juvenile delinquency records -- and another $250 million in the form of block grants for the states to use as they think best in combating and preventing juvenile crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>State and Local Responsibility.</b> While Congress can assist local officials with block grants, however, taxpayers know that violent juvenile crime, like street crime in general, is primarily a state and local responsibility. And while the capacity of all government officials to cope with the broader cultural and social changes that appear to be driving increased juvenile criminal behavior is limited, state and local officials still can take decisive steps to curb violent juvenile crime.<sup>2</sup>  They can do this by using their police forces more effectively and by integrating innovative community police work with the efforts of community leaders and other agencies in the criminal justice system. This is happening already in such localities as New York City and Charleston, South Carolina. The McCollum bill would help the states by removing the federal mandates that prevent them from adopting many innovative solutions and by providing funds for effective new programs, including the Serious Habitual Offenders Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

SHOCAP is one of the most effective ways to attack the juvenile crime explosion. With sophisticated information technology, local officials can develop and share crime analysis and case management files on the most serious violent offenders in the community: serious habitual offenders. This pioneering effort to combine police work with emerging information technology, developed by a team of experts in the Justice Department during the Reagan Administration, combines the modern microelectronic revolution, sophisticated data collection and crime analysis, and community police work. Through computer analysis and effective local policing, it enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In order to institute SHOCAP, state and local officials should:
<p><ul>
<li> Establish an interagency council chaired by the chief of police and comprised of the CEOs of SHOCAP component agencies -- juvenile probation departments, prosecutors, juvenile judges, schools, social services, and public housing.
<p>
<li> Create or enhance crime analysis units within local police departments.
<p>
<li> Enlist the cooperation of state and local agencies in collecting and analyzing data, updating the case files of serious habitual offenders (SHOs), and establishing a strategy for dealing with this class of offenders.
<p>
<li> Identify serious habitual offenders. Approximately 6 percent of all juvenile offenders are responsible for up to 63 percent of violent juvenile crime.<sup>3</sup>  The procedure used to identify and classify these offenders should be rigorous; it should include, for example, an examination of previous offenses, arrest and court records, and social and family histories. Responsible officials then should use the information developed through this process to create sophisticated, computerized case management files.
<p>
<li> Share these case management files with police officials, judges, prosecutors, state probation and parole agencies, and (as needed) schools and social service agencies.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, states should reform the juvenile justice system by enacting laws to try violent juvenile criminals as adults when necessary, and by passing truth-in-sentencing laws that apply to violent juvenile offenders tried as adults.
<p>

<b>THE NEW FACE OF JUVENILE CRIME</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Violent teenage criminals are increasingly vicious. John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, says that "[t]he difference between the juvenile criminals of the 1950s and those of the 1970s and early 1980s was the difference between the Sharks and the Jets of <i>West Side Story</i> and the Bloods and the Crips. It is not inconceivable that the demographic surge of the next ten years will bring with it young criminals who make the Bloods and the Crips look tame."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan commission chaired by former Attorney General Griffin Bell and former White House Drug Policy Director <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a>, crimes committed by males ages 14 to 17 will increase by 23 percent between 1995 and 2005. Because of the deterioration of family life, and also because of their easy access to guns, these juveniles are likely to commit more vicious crimes than their predecessors, targeting strangers as well as known enemies.<sup>5</sup>  Louis Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, believes that continuation of current trends in juvenile crime "portends future crime and violence at nearly unprecedented levels."<sup>6</sup>  Recent reports of juvenile crime dropping are of little comfort in light of the coming demographic surge of juveniles in their crime-prone years from dysfunctional families.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growing numbers of young people, often from broken homes or so-called dysfunctional families, are committing murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping, and other violent acts. As John DiIulio and others argue, these emotionally damaged young people, growing up without faith, fathers, or families, often are the products of sexual or physical abuse. They live in an aimless and violent present; have no sense of the past and no hope for the future; and act, often ruthlessly, to gratify whatever urges or desires drive them at the moment. They commit unspeakably brutal crimes against other people, and their lack of remorse is shocking. They are what Professor DiIulio and others call urban "superpredators."  They are the ultimate urban nightmare, and their numbers are growing. The number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has increased nearly 60 percent over the last ten years:<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<ul>
<li>From 1985 to 1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year-old juveniles increased 207 percent. Arrests of 18-year-old to 20-year-old males for murder over the same period increased 119 percent.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1988 to 1992, the number of juveniles involved in aggravated assaults increased 80 percent to 77,900; the number involved in robberies went up 52 percent to 32,900; and the number involved in rapes rose 27 percent to 5,400. Overall, juvenile court cases increased 26 percent.<sup>10</sup>  If trends of the past ten years continue, arrests of juveniles for violent crimes will double by the year 2010.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1989 to 1993, transfers of juveniles to adult court because of delinquency increased 41 percent to 11,800 cases; for crimes against persons, the number of transfers increased 115 percent to 5,000 cases.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<li>Of 1,471,200 juvenile court cases in 1992, personal offenses were up 56 percent to 301,000; property offenses were up 56 percent to 842,000; and public order offenses were up 21 percent to 255,900.<sup>13</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Young Victims.</b> Young people ages 12 to 17 are the most frequent victims of violent crime. They are raped, robbed, or assaulted at five times the rate of adults 35 years old or older. In 1992, one juvenile in 13 was the victim of violent crime -- up 23 percent from 1987.<sup>14</sup>  Also in 1992, 23 percent of the victims of the 6.6 million violent crimes committed in the United States were juveniles; the juvenile victimization rate was 74.2 cases per 1,000 juveniles, compared to 13.9 cases per 1,000 adults 35 years old or older.<sup>15</sup>  Overall, the sad fact is that
<p>
<blockquote>
	Crime has seriously affected teenagers' lives, especially those who live in neighborhoods seriously hurt by crime, drugs and gangs. The effects are insidious and long-standing. Teenagers protect themselves by carrying weapons, skipping school, changing their routes to and from classes, changing friends or letting their grades slip. For many young Americans, the carefree days of adolescence are a nostalgic fantasy.<sup>16</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even more shocking than the sheer volume of violent juvenile crime is the brutality of the crime committed for trivial motives: a pair of sneakers, a jacket, a real or imagined insult, a momentary cheap thrill. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A 59-year-old man out on a morning stroll in Lake Tahoe was fatally shot four times by teenagers "looking for someone to scare."  The police say the four teenagers -- just 15 and 16 years old -- were "thrill shooting."
<p>
<li> A 12-year-old and two other youths were charged with kidnapping a 57-year-old man and taking a joy ride in his Toyota. As the man pleaded for his life, the juveniles shot him to death.
<p>
<li> A 14-year-old boy was murdered while trying to reclaim a $2,500 stereo system he had received from his grandfather. Five juveniles, ranging in age from 15 through 17 years, were charged with the crime.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seasoned big-city homicide detectives have a hard time coming to grips with the horror of these kinds of cases: The crimes are senseless, the motives banal, and the perpetrators all so young. These shocking incidents -- which occur in America's suburbs as well as its inner cities -- are creating a growing consensus among the American people: They have had enough. Lenient sentencing based strictly on age is no longer acceptable for crimes of this magnitude.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Loss of Public Confidence.</b> Polls show that Americans are unhappy with the system as it is: 49 percent believe rehabilitation programs for juveniles are not successful, 52 percent believe the punishments juveniles receive should be the same as those given adults, and 83 percent think juveniles who commit two or more crimes should receive the same sentencing as adults.<sup>18</sup>  A 1995 Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans also advocate the death penalty for juveniles who commit murder, as opposed to 24 percent in 1957.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Teenagers themselves take a hard stance on how their peers should be treated if they commit violent crimes. Over 93 percent believe that those accused of murder or rape should be tried as adults. Moreover, they do not believe these offenders should receive special consideration because of their age.<sup>20</sup>  This is consistent with broad public, judicial, and law enforcement sentiment, which generally has favored holding juveniles more accountable for their criminal actions in recent years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The juvenile justice system that prevails in many states today does juvenile criminals no favors by being lenient. According to a 1985 Rand Corporation study, "[w]aiting for chronic offenders to build a record of many arrests and minor dispositions only compounds the problems that must be dealt with later."<sup>21</sup>
<p>
<b>WHY TODAY'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS FAILING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1899, when Illinois adopted the first Juvenile Court Act, America's juvenile courts have been unable to deal effectively with the violent juvenile criminal. Law enforcement officers and a growing number of private citizens realize that this continuing failure undermines the credibility of the whole juvenile justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ultimate price for this failure, of course, is paid by innocent citizens. For example, only hours after returning home from a special school program in Costa Rica, Cindy Del Carmen Villalba, an honor student at Rutgers University, was killed in a botched robbery attempt. Corie Miller, age 17, and two accomplices were charged in her death. Miller had been eluding police for about a week when the slaying occurred. He had fled a Paterson, New Jersey, "get-tough" rehabilitation program that was supposed to be a "last ditch effort to reform him."  In the case of this habitual juvenile offender, it took the murder of a young, intelligent girl with a bright future to force the justice system to take a second look and finally adopt a tougher stance.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Failure to Target Serious Habitual Offenders.</b> In many states, the greatest single weakness of the effort to combat juvenile crime is a simple failure to target the most dangerous young offenders. This weakness arises from a reluctance on the part of juvenile justice officials to admit that there is a point at which a delinquent youth becomes such a threat to the community that he or she must be held accountable and incarcerated. Under the current system, the seriously violent juvenile can become invisible by being mixed in with the general population of non-violent and non-habitual juvenile offenders. Overwhelmingly, most urban young people who get arrested for a crime get arrested only once; seldom are they a serious or long-term threat to the safety of other citizens. Put another way, not all juvenile delinquents are alike, and very few are serious habitual offenders. The official failure to discriminate between minor offenders and hard-core criminal youth undermines the effectiveness of the entire system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most active juvenile delinquents also are the most dangerous. Often invisible to the officials who preside over the system, they are painfully visible to the victims they assault, rob, and kill. Official failure to develop credible control measures to suppress habitual juvenile offenders also sows the seeds of racial prejudice. With the rise of juvenile crime, an increasingly angry and insecure public tends to look upon all juveniles, particularly black male teenagers, as threats to the community. Most juvenile offenders, however, are not: 58 percent of young black males never have any contact with the police; and of the other 42 percent, an overwhelming majority do not go on to become SHOs.<sup>23</sup>  It is therefore vital that state and local officials, as well as taxpayers, begin to think and act differently toward the occasional juvenile delinquent. The SHO, on the other hand, is a career criminal in the making.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Information Gap.</b> Chronic offenders usually can be identified solely on the basis of their juvenile records. This evidence, however, normally does not accumulate until after the youth's 16th birthday. If additional factors describing the youth's school performance and home situation are included, the age at which youthful chronic offenders can be identified and an intervention mounted may be moved up several years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In reality, these young criminals are shunted in and out of state and local agencies by bureaucrats who are supposed to be running the system but who often seem to lack a collective awareness of the kind of young people they are processing. Too often, they are oblivious to the repeated and increasingly serious nature of the behavior of these young criminals. This official failure to share information can occur for many reasons: because it is not required by state law, because of bureaucratic inertia or lack of imagination, or even because of simple negligence. It is a key weakness in the current system. Most of the juvenile codes in the United States contain statutory language indicating that the juvenile judge should consider police reports; field interview reports; citations; social history information (such as data on school, family, and work); drug involvement information; motor vehicle operation information; associates' history; offense digests; victim accounts; and other relevant information, including medical and juvenile victimization data. Only rarely, however, is this information used or shared among youth service agencies; it often is not even made available to the presiding judge.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Declining Police Morale.</b> The continuing failure of the juvenile justice system in many states contributes to defeatism and low morale among local police. Police officers frequently do not treat juvenile crime the same as they treat crime committed by adults. Since no one else in the criminal justice system seems to be serious about punishing juvenile criminals, police officers often feel they will be wasting their time if they pursue these cases with the same zeal they display in pursuing adult criminals. They have learned from painful and frustrating personal experience that spending street time trying to suppress juvenile crime by arrests is futile; nothing will be done to the young criminals, who will just be allowed back out on the streets.<sup>24</sup>  As a result, many patrol officers shift juvenile crime problems to the local department's juvenile unit, transferring both the problem and the responsibility to a specialized unit that already is overloaded.
<p>
<b>WHY STATES AND LOCALITIES SHOULD ADOPT SHOCAP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The SHOCAP system has been employed successfully in over 150 communities in the United States and Canada, including Oxnard, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tallahassee, Florida; Prince William County, Virginia; and Tampa, Florida (Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office). SHOCAP works in these communities because it provides accurate, documented support to police in tactical operations focused on their most active criminals. SHOCAP enables law enforcement officials to give direction to police in the field so that they can use their patrol activities to prevent and suppress the criminal activities of SHOs. Through computers and information sharing, SHOCAP provides field forces with comprehensive information on a SHO's criminal activities beyond beat or shift boundaries. The system works because a computerized case file -- either on-line in a police cruiser or accessible by police dispatchers -- can be punched up by the police within seconds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps the most dramatic example of SHOCAP's effectiveness is Oxnard, California. Despite having one of the lowest police-to-population ratios in the country, over a three-year period in the 1980s, Oxnard experienced a 38 percent reduction in violent crime and a 60 percent drop in the murder rate. It did this by targeting and successfully incarcerating a greater number of SHOs than were targeted and incarcerated in jurisdictions not using SHOCAP. Recognizing that most crime is committed by a small minority of felons, Oxnard officials used SHOCAP to remove 30 of these hard-core juvenile offenders from the streets.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But SHOCAP is more than an effective short-term anti-crime program; it also has longer term preventive effects when employed consistently by local police officials and social service agencies. SHOCAP has received several evaluations in both the United States and Canada. Since 1983, for example, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has evaluated the program three times. The first evaluation process lasted from May 1, 1983, until July 1, 1986, and served as the basis for later implementation of the program. Additional studies began on January 1, 1985. These evaluations indicated that most project cities which remained in the program exceeded their expectations and reduced crime rates in neighborhoods from which SHOs were removed. The Canadian government's 1993-1994 evaluation of the Calgary SHOCAP program led the Solicitor General of Canada to recommend that SHOCAP be considered by other Canadian jurisdictions.<sup>26</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW TO IDENTIFY SERIOUS HABITUAL OFFENDERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In every community, there is the potential for only 2 percent of the juvenile offender population to be responsible for up to 60 percent of the violent juvenile crime.<sup>27</sup>  These serious repeat offenders, who all too often eventually become adult career criminals, bleed the life from the community, endangering public safety and undermining economic stability.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, only 25 to 35 juveniles in every 100,000 members of the population will engage in criminal activity that matches the Serious Habitual Offender pattern. Based on criteria developed by the Reagan team at the Department of Justice, this means that 0.03 percent to 0.04 percent of all juveniles between 14 and 17 years old will be SHOs. At the same time, for each SHO, four other juveniles are at risk of becoming SHOs themselves.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Profile of a SHO.</b> Data collected and analyzed by the Reagan Administration team at the U.S. Department of Justice in the 1980s presents a graphic portrait of the serious habitual offender. The typical SHO is male, 15 years and six months old. He has been arrested 11 to 14 times, exclusive of status offenses, and five times for felonies. He comes from a dysfunctional family; and in 46 percent of cases, at least one of his parents also has an arrest history. He has received long-term and continuing social services from as many as six different community service agencies, including family, youth, mental health, social services, school, juvenile, or police authorities,<sup>29</sup> and continues to drain these resources for years before he is finally incarcerated as a career criminal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The typical SHO's family history follows a classic pattern of social pathologies: 53 percent of his siblings also have a history of arrest; and in 59 percent of these cases, there is no father figure in the home. The absence of a father is particularly destructive for boys; only 2 percent of SHOs are female. Furthermore, 68 percent of these offenders have committed crimes of violence, 15 percent have a history of committing sex crimes, and 51 percent have a reported missing or runaway record. If a broken family characterized by physical or sexual abuse is an early indicator of criminal behavior, then virtually all of these serious habitual offenders fit this category. Not surprisingly, these findings are consistent with the Heritage Foundation's widely reported analysis of the true root causes of violent crime, particularly the crimogenic conditions associated with broken or dysfunctional families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, SHOs do not consider the crimes they have committed to be all that bad.<sup>31</sup>  Forty-five percent are gang members, 64 percent associate with other serious habitual offenders, and 75 percent abuse drugs. School, social, and employment experiences are not good experiences for SHOs,<sup>32</sup> who invariably have no moral compass. The SHO seems to feel that, no matter what he does, the system barely notices. The effect inevitably is to reinforce his criminal inclinations; when released from a state prison, for example, one in 30 of these offenders probably will commit murder.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Recent empirical evidence shows that illegal drug use among the young is on the rise.<sup>34</sup>  It is worth noting, therefore, that a significant majority of all SHOs use or sell illegal drugs and often become addicted themselves. Illegal drug use and alcohol abuse tend to be regular features of their criminal conduct. Drugs, in particular, are part of the criminal scene of these juvenile offenders, and the use and sale of drugs contributes significantly to a SHO's other criminal activity. The need to purchase illegal drugs, combined with the warped hedonism of the addict, shapes and drives much of the criminal activity of this class of criminals.
<p>
<b>HOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN DEAL WITH SERIOUS HABITUAL OFFENDERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Following a step-by-step process, a community can set up an interagency council to coordinate efforts by the police and other local government and social service agencies to collect and analyze the essential data on SHOs, train police and local government staff in the use of information technology, and establish a strategy for dealing with these offenders that includes referrals to social service agencies for use in a judge's decision to incarcerate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program, essentially a comprehensive information and case management process, is directed by the police department's crime analysis unit. Information is collected from and shared with prosecutors, schools, probation officials, judges, correctional departments, and social service and welfare agencies. When community leaders initiate this process, however, they must remember their target: The purpose of SHOCAP is not to curb public nuisances, disorderly conduct among teenagers, or general property crime, but to identify, isolate, and control a very small group of serious habitual juvenile offenders -- only about 35 per 100,000 in the general population. Through SHOCAP, the community can concentrate its law enforcement and criminal justice resources on apprehending and incarcerating these juveniles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

SHOCAP also can lay the groundwork for appropriate intervention by public or private social service or welfare agencies participating in the program. As Professor DiIulio and others argue, the best weapon against violent crime is one that stops juveniles who are at risk of becoming career criminals in the first place. With early, targeted intervention by dedicated local community organizations -- especially religious or faith-based institutions with a social service capacity -- such children can be taught to tell right from wrong, can acquire personal discipline and moral virtues, and can learn to respect both themselves and others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certain conditions are essential to the success of any local SHOCAP program:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>CONDITION #1: Establish the local police as the lead agency in tracking serious habitual offenders.</b> The police department is the logical lead agency in a SHOCAP program. Police officers have the first contact with criminals in the community. Police work is a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year job that involves the front-line responsibility and experience needed to handle criminal information. The police therefore have the ability to gather, organize, and analyze a SHO case file; they are familiar with SHOs and their case histories, as well as the kinds of crimes they commit and how they operate. On patrol in the neighborhoods, they will know where SHOs live and who their associates are, as well as their family and criminal histories.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Functional crime analysis by police is essential to SHOCAP, but local officials in each case will have to review the capacity of their own police agency to function as primary collector and analyzer of the basic SHOCAP information. This capacity varies from department to department; only two-thirds of all local police departments use computers, but many have a separate crime analysis unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With regard to the police department's role, a cautionary note is in order: SHOCAP must be a department-wide responsibility. Placing the responsibility, particularly for data collection and analysis, with the juvenile division sends the signal that this unit can take care of the problem, and the rest of the police force need not concern itself with this juvenile project. Such an approach cuts off the agency's most important tactical muscle -- the cop on patrol in the neighborhood.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>CONDITION #2: Require local government agencies to share information on serious habitual offenders.</b> The adoption of a Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program is predicated on gathering and analyzing data, and then planning an appropriate response to SHOs. The SHOCAP process improves operational coordination among the police, prosecutors, courts, probation departments, schools, correctional agencies, social and family services, and other public and private community organizations. Computerized case management procedures for tracking serious habitual juvenile offenders allow the police to identify the warning signs of potential SHOs, such as a home characterized by domestic violence or sexual and physical abuse. Then, using the information gleaned from these routine police reports, local officials can assign responsibility for intervention or monitoring to public or private social service agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential that welfare agencies and schools be included in the information gathering process. The families of serious habitual offenders often receive various types of public assistance.<sup>35</sup>  At the state and local levels, where many of these welfare programs are administered, social service workers who know the welfare histories and family structures of potential and active SHOs can provide important information on child abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the 1996 federal welfare reform, which includes block granting of welfare assistance and responsibilities to the states, cooperation among state welfare or social service agencies should improve significantly. Vital child victim and abuse information collected by social service agents in the course of their routine duties can give particular direction to law enforcement, probation, court, and corrections officers. Public housing authorities or managers also have tremendous potential to assist law enforcement officers in developing a database of serious habitual offenders. A juvenile growing up in public housing is four to five times more likely to become a SHO than is a juvenile growing up in non-public housing.<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School officials, especially administrators, also can play a significant role in monitoring SHOs because SHOs invariably disrupt the classroom and are poor candidates for continuing in public school.<sup>37</sup>  School officials get to know who the serious habitual offenders are because of the pressures of trying to maintain order and discipline in the classroom, and usually have to spend more time monitoring them than they do with other students. Under certain circumstances, specialized schools designed to handle disruptive students should be an integral part of the intervention plan for these juveniles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the 1980s, juvenile justice files and crime, school, welfare, social service, and probation records rarely were shared between agencies. State and local officials, misconstruing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA),<sup>38</sup> frequently overreacted by withholding even basic "juvenile information."  Law enforcement and other agencies strained to keep secret common street information regarding a juvenile's conduct or the receipt of social services or welfare benefits. Before SHOCAP was implemented, juvenile judges and prosecutors in current SHOCAP jurisdictions often had access to less than 30 percent of the information needed for filings or court dispositions. In places like Colorado Springs and Oxnard, for example, there was little, if any, sharing of information between agencies. Where SHOCAP has been implemented, however, there has been remarkable progress in breaking down barriers to the gathering of appropriate information on juvenile criminal conduct. A new consensus has been emerging, both on sharing juvenile records and on what information within these records ought to be considered relevant.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A SHOCAP case file should include the following types of information: biographical data; a description of prior and current offenses, including criminal history; a listing of known and suspected associates and confederates; any gang or drug involvement; a description of any "fencing" activity; a concise, comprehensive narrative portrait; field investigation data (FI cards); motor vehicle ownership and violation information; whether the subject has been named as a suspect in other crimes; victimization history; the status offense history of the victim as well as the SHO; any active warrants; school, employment, and family histories; social and medical services history; and prior conduct in detention and correctional facilities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some states, however, may need to enact SHOCAP enabling legislation, which allows the sharing of juvenile records and information before SHOCAP can be established.<sup>39</sup>  Such legislation helps establish working relationships among law enforcement and local government agencies so they can build an effective database and case management system. To date, seven states have adopted or are working on SHOCAP enabling legislation.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Condition #3: Establish local criteria for identifying serious habitual offenders.</b> Each local jurisdiction must tailor its SHO criteria to fit its own crime problems, keeping in mind the capacity of its own law enforcement agencies. The criteria for identifying and tracking juvenile crime should focus on the worst juvenile offenders -- those who repeatedly have displayed serious criminal misconduct. Local officials must resist the temptation to broaden the net to include less serious offenders. Without this discipline, the program's focus will be lost, and the system will be swamped with marginal threats to community safety.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Based on the experience of local SHOCAP sites and an analysis conducted by Justice Department officials during the Reagan Administration, the following criteria conform to the case histories of the 35 most serious juvenile offenders per 100,000:<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Five arrests, with three chargeable as felonies, and three arrests within the last 12 months; or
<p>
<li> Ten arrests, with two chargeable as felonies, and three arrests within the last 12 months; or
<p>
<li> One arrest for three or more burglaries, robberies, or sexual assaults within the preceding 12 months; or
<p>
<li> Ten total arrests, with eight or more for misdemeanor crimes of theft, assault, battery, narcotics, or controlled substance abuse, or for possession of weapons, and three arrests within the preceding 12 months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By using such criteria, local officials can estimate the caseload for all components of the criminal justice system, including the arrest, detention, and prosecution of serious habitual offenders and the extent of supervision to be provided by corrections officers after a SHO is released from prison. On the basis of this projected caseload, local officials also can inventory the resources available to concentrate on these juveniles (including both public and private social service agencies desiring to participate in the prevention aspects of the SHOCAP program) and allocate those resources accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Condition #4: Require that information on serious habitual offenders be shared with the courts and their officers.</b> In court proceedings, as well as in probation and parole hearings, the comprehensive case management files developed through SHOCAP can be invaluable. Juvenile judges can be assured that whatever judicial decisions they make are based on the best information available. The same is true for judges in adult criminal courts who have access to such files.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, prosecutors will have the sort of comprehensive information they need to prosecute serious habitual offenders successfully. In fact, once a jurisdiction's SHOCAP program matures, and depending on caseload, the local prosecutor's office should consider creating a specific case management position, both to manage these cases more efficiently and to support vertical prosecution of SHOs.<sup>42</sup>  In addition, SHOCAP gives prosecutors a ready-made case priority and assignment schedule. A complete SHOCAP file ensures that SHOs are charged with the highest legally provable offense, prevents the inappropriate pretrial release of such offenders, and prevents the sealing or destroying of the records of juveniles designated as SHOs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Juvenile probation officers will find that the case file preparation generated by the SHOCAP process can lessen their casework and fortify their recommendations to the courts on the disposition of juvenile cases. They can develop specialized individual programs and custody levels for such offenders, making a sharp distinction between SHOs and other juvenile delinquents. The most important task is to develop specialized control measures for the SHO on probation or back on the streets after release from prison.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>CUTTING SHORT A CRIMINAL CAREER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For law-abiding citizens, the career criminal is Public Enemy Number One. By using modern information technology and case management as embodied in Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Programs, law enforcement officers and local government officials can target and track society's most dangerous criminals. Almost without exception, the adult career criminal was a serious habitual offender as a juvenile. Once again, this is a very small minority of the population: 94 percent of the juveniles arrested for a criminal offense are never arrested again, 4 percent are arrested on a regular basis, and only 2 percent are arrested repeatedly and go on to become serious habitual offenders and career criminals.<sup>43</sup>  Career criminals exhibit common patterns of behavior, as well as a relationship between age and criminal behavior. Unfortunately, however, today's juvenile justice and adult criminal justice systems are not adequately linked.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since both the volume and intensity of juvenile crime have increased and are likely to escalate in the future, it is no longer feasible to wait until these career criminals reach adulthood to protect society from their actions.<sup>45</sup>  There are stages in the life of the typical career criminal.<sup>46</sup>  By channeling resources on the basis of a comprehensive case management system, SHOCAP can play a crucial role in stifling a criminal career at each stage. State and local officials therefore should adopt a SHOCAP program and try some juvenile offenders 18 years old and under as adults.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stages of Development.</b> In the first stage of criminal development, as amply documented by <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, these serious habitual offenders come from abusive, broken, or neglectful homes.<sup>47</sup>  Looking backward through the SHOCAP telescope, local law enforcement and criminal justice officials can trace the pattern of abuse and neglect that often results in a delinquent and criminal lifestyle. Based on the SHOCAP criteria and amplified by indices of negative social conditions identified by the Heritage Foundation, state and local officials can design an early intervention strategy for juveniles who are at risk of becoming serious habitual offenders and career criminals. Such a strategy can focus community resources, including private-sector charitable, social, and religious institutions, on potential and active SHOs and stop their criminal careers before they gain momentum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the second stage of the criminal's development, from 13 to 18 years of age, the SHOCAP process helps judges and other state and local criminal justice officials answer a critical question: Is the offender, based on his record, likely to respond to intensive intervention by social service agencies, or is he in fact a youthful career criminal who cannot be rehabilitated and should be locked up?  State corrections officials simply do not know how to rehabilitate some violent young criminals who pose such a clear danger to society that they must be separated from the community and controlled. SHOCAP can help state and local judges and other responsible officials determine who among a larger class of young offenders are the incorrigibles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From the vantage point of public safety, the best that state and local officials can do with the incorrigible juvenile SHO when the crime is serious is to try him as an adult, sentence him as an adult, and require him to serve at least 85 percent of his sentence, as specified by the truth-in-sentencing laws called for in recent federal legislation and enacted in 22 states.<sup>48</sup>  This would mean that a 15-year-old serious habitual offender who is given 20 years for second degree murder would serve at least 17 years before being released at age 32. Thus, the serious offender would have spent his highest crime years locked up, unable to prey on more victims.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the third stage of a criminal's career, from 18 to 30 years of age, SHOCAP gives state and local criminal justice officials complete criminal histories of career offenders at the time they are arrested. The police, prosecutors, and judges know instantly that they are dealing with a SHO and not a petty or first time offender. Currently, however, an adult criminal's previous juvenile records are not available to the system in most jurisdictions. As a result, 18-year-olds with lengthy records of serious and violent crime frequently are treated as first-time offenders.
<p>
<b>A NEW POLICY TO COMBAT VIOLENT JUVENILE CRIME</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's juvenile and criminal justice system still works too slowly to be effective in identifying and incarcerating career criminals. Congress can assist state and local officials with money, technology, and advice -- and by removing federal mandates in the juvenile judicial system -- but controlling and combating serious crime remains the responsibility primarily of state and local government. State and local leaders can take a variety of concrete steps to combat the scourge of violent crime, especially crimes committed by juveniles. Innovative police methods like those implemented in cities like Houston and New York are reducing the rate of violent crime.<sup>49</sup>  Beyond adopting an information management system like SHOCAP, state and local leaders can take three other steps to stop these criminal careers before they run their destructive course:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Target and track serious habitual offenders.</b> Enact legislation at the state level that enables local officials to share crucial juvenile case files and establish an effective Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program in their local jurisdictions. SHOCAP can make available to police and state law enforcement officers, as well as judicial and corrections officials, the information they need to identify and respond to the most dangerous young criminals in their communities.
<p>
<li><b>  Try as adults all juveniles who commit heinous crimes.</b> Enact state laws to try juvenile offenders as adults for specific violent offenses. Under Title I of Representative McCollum's Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996, a juvenile criminal 14 or more years of age who is convicted of a serious federal violent crime or "a major drug trafficking offense" automatically can be tried as an adult. States should consider similar legislation for state offenses.
<p>
<li><b> Enact truth-in-sentencing laws.</b> Pass legislation requiring all violent offenders, including juveniles tried as adults, to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.<sup>50</sup>  Thus far, 22 states have adopted such laws. As the bipartisan Council on Crime in America has concluded, probation, parole, and other forms of non-incarceration often take the place of prison, even for violent offenders. More than half of convicted violent felons still are not sentenced to prison.<sup>51</sup>  This must end.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can encourage state and local officials in their efforts to combat juvenile crime. The Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1996 sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch and former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole would allow states to try the most serious violent juvenile offenders (those charged with federal offenses) as adults. In many respects, this bill complements the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 sponsored by Representative McCollum. Both bills also give financial assistance to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ultimately, however, the war to defeat the growing menace of violent juvenile crime must be fought and won by state and local officials who are smart, tough, and tenacious. The SHOCAP process is a valuable weapon for communities fighting the war on crime. It combines the advances of the modern microelectronic revolution with sophisticated crime and data analysis to target and track America's most crucial crime perpetrator: the violent habitual juvenile offender.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By providing instant access to shared information and a complete case file with relevant information, SHOCAP not only will improve the capability of the local police, but also will enhance the quality and caliber of decisions made by key officials in the criminal justice system. Courts, probation and parole departments, correctional officials, and social service and welfare agencies all will benefit from a strong database on juvenile offenders and from shared access to case management files.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Today's serious habitual offenders are tomorrow's career criminals. Children who look more like victims of abuse and neglect than criminals at age 13 may well be engaged in repeatedly committing the community's most serious and violent offenses from ages 14 to 17. They are a serious and growing threat to public safety. Fortunately, if adopted, SHOCAP and the other reforms advocated in this paper can help America's communities make their streets, schools, and neighborhoods safe again.

<P>
<FONT FACE="">National Press Club:  Thank you, Chairman Devine.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">I want to begin my remarks today with a short
story about something that happened to me recently.  Two nights
ago, I was interviewed on CNBC about my organization's efforts
to reduce wiretapping.  In the middle of the interview, the host
took a call from a clear conservative.  Her remark was simple
and to the point -- and the usual remark all conservatives get
from liberals.  &quot;If you are for reducing wiretapping, then
you must be for terrorism.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Conservatives get nailed with that broad brush
every day when it comes to the environment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reforming the Clean Air Act --
therefore we are for dirty air.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reforming the Clean Water Act --
therefore we are for dirty water.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reform of the Endangered Species
Act -- therefore, we hate wildlife.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><I><B><FONT FACE="">Of course, nothing could be farther
from the truth.<BR>
</FONT></B></I></U>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Conservatives see people as a part of nature.
 Liberals see people as the enemy of nature.  Environmental policies
over the past several decades, while the Democrats have been in
charge of Congress, have illustrated just that view.  In that
time, we have seen more regulations, more government control over
federal lands and private property, higher taxes, and lower involvement
of the private sector.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Today, if you strike oil on your land, the
value of your property goes up.  However, if you find an endangered
species on your land, your property value plummets.  When your
land value goes down, you and your family are at risk.  This creates
a threat to both people and wildlife.  Is the safety of the golden
cheeked warbler more important that your family's well-being?
 Liberals say yes.  Under conservative proposals, the question
need not be asked or answered.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">This platform calls for tax incentives to protect
species, preserve your property, and enhance the environment.
 The value of your property will rise and the antagonistic relationship
between land owners and wildlife will end.  This platform defines
excessive regulation of property as a &quot;taking&quot; under
the 5th Amendment.  Land owners must be compensated when their
land is abused by the federal government.  Today, there is no
financial constraint on federal agencies, such as the Fish and
Wildlife Service, from over regulating your property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">If there were a dollar amount attached to every
action that the federal government takes in dealing with private
property, less property will be taken and the government would
need more solid evidence before taking property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">This platform reduces regulation, puts a better
balance on economic factors, demands more scientific accountability,
keeps our environment, wildlife, and natural resources healthy
and protected, and protects property rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<B><FONT FACE="">NATURAL RESOURCES, ENVIRONMENT AND PROPERTY
RIGHTS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">All Americans want to have a cleaner, healthier,
safer environment. The question is how to reach those goals. We
believe that outdated programs such as Superfund, the Clean Water,
Clean Air and Endangered Species Acts must be reformed so that
the well being of human beings is considered the ultimate measure,
responsible scientific standards are incorporated, solutions are
developed at a site- and situation-specific level rather than
by bureaucratic mandate, market mechanisms are employed to reach
goals, and private property try rights are protected. Using all
of these tools improves the environment while protecting rights
and allowing for economic progress. To do so effectively, we must
use scientifically rigorous risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis
for all regulatory activities. Superfund is a colossally expensive
example of what not to do. Billions have been spent in some cases
to make soil squeaky clean, while true toxic waste sites have
often remained untouched for years. We commend the Republican
Congress for passing true reform: the Unfunded Mandates Relief
Act, and the majority of Republicans who supported the Risk Assessment
and Cost Benefits Act, the Regulatory Reform and Relief Act, and
the Clean Water Amendments of 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Most current government policies have been
based on an outdated, bureaucratic, command-and-control model
of forcing compliance. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is a
prime example that has failed in its purpose and done great harm.
Rather than saving endangered species, the real fruits of this
law have been violation of property rights on a massive scale
and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars
of economic activity and land values. As a result, even the Democratic
Congress of President Clinton's first two years was unable to
re-authorize the Act (forcing it to operate only under appropriations
bills). Consequently, we support a new vision on how to conserve
species. We support a non-regulatory, incentive-based system that
rewards property owners for good stewardship of wildlife habitat
and which will begin to re-establish trust between land owners,
communities and officials. We commend those members of Congress
who introduced a measure that meets these goals, the Endangered
Species Recovery and Conservation Incentive Act of 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Over the past three decades, national regulations
of natural resource management and laws promulgated in the name
of the environment have asserted more and more control over how
citizens can use their property. We believe that excessive regulation
of property undermines its integrity and amounts to a &quot;taking&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment, without providing compensation for
the private loss. We recognize the great value of private property
in ensuring a healthy, productive and beautiful environment. Accordingly,
we support regulatory takings compensation for regulations that
effectively end use of property. We commend those members of the
House who voted to provide such protection in The Private Property
Protection Act of 1995 and those members of the Senate who supported
Senator Dole's Omnibus Property Rights Act.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Renewable resources-trees, plants, soil, air,
water, fish and wildlife and collections thereof such as wetlands,
deserts, forests and prairies-are the resources that produce food,
clothing, medicine, shelter and essential human needs.    Human
life depends upon them. In most cases, such resources are continually
regenerated and have a profound ability<B> </B>to carry, recycle,
recover and cleanse. These characteristics make it possible to
wisely use renewable resources and conserve them for future generations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Agriculture and energy are the building blocks
of modern life and remain vital to survival. Human ingenuity can
conserve, develop and improve resources through privatization
and the use of enterprise. We support the private nature of the
American farm system and the entrepreneurship of the American
farmer and rancher. We salute the Freedom to Farm legislation
passed by the Republican 104th Congress and encourage other responsible
movements toward a true market system. We likewise note that our
energy system, primarily private, made the American economic miracle
possible. We support elimination of the Department of Energy to
emphasize the need for greater privatization and deregulation.
We oppose efforts to nationalize under the Department the electric
utility industry and support its continued deregulation and privatization
under state regulatory policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">With large majorities of the land in the West
owned by the government, Democrat Party policies have severely
restricted natural resource production and even recreation activities
without improving the environmental quality of these lands. We
support responsible privatization of such lands, particularly
those under the Bureau of Land Management, while we support preserving
historic rights to water, mining claims, grazing permits, rights
of access, hunting and contracts. We oppose new additions to the
government's already large land stock through additions to national
forests, wildlife refuges and parks well beyond Federal ability
to manage them. We oppose the intrusive and destructive policies
of the Clinton Administration designed to halt timber production
in the most productive forests, force livestock off traditional
ranges, limit mineral and oil exploration and production, establish
an intrusive national biological survey, and restrict hunting.
We also oppose policies which conveyed decision-making over American
resources to international bodies such as the Convention on Climate
Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Montreal Protocol,
and the myriad United Nations UNESCO programs. We reject these
environmentally and economically disastrous policies. We instead
support our new and workable vision for ensuring that all Americans
have a healthier, cleaner and safer environment.</FONT>

<I><DD>With President Clinton's signing of welfare reform legislation, almost everyone now agrees that the 
welfare state has been a failure.  Government welfare programs, rather than providing a temporary safety net for those who have fallen on hard times, have too often become a long-term snare that discourages self-sufficiency. But what will replace the welfare state?
<BR>
<DD>Proponents of the status quo often say that viable private alternatives to government welfare do not exist or cannot be created.  Yet such alternatives flourished in the past, and some still flourish today.  They need to receive greater public attention and, more importantly, they need to be duplicated.
<BR>
<DD>The four books reviewed in this month's </I>Alternatives in Philanthropy<I> explore some of these alternatives and suggest changes that can be made in public policy to help restore private charity to its once indispensable role. Together, they offer a compelling vision of a post-welfare society.</I><BR>

<BR>Visiting Fellow</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<DD>For years, the debate over welfare reform has 
centered around money.  Liberals have contended that the 
problems of the poor can be solved by spending more tax dollars. 
 Most of this money, of course, has ended up in the hands 
of middle-class professionals who deal with the 
poorsociologists, nonprofit executives, and social workers.  
And because the number of poor people has not fallen even 
as government spending on poverty programs has 
increased, liberals have called for even more tax funding of 
nonprofit organizations that ostensibly serve the poor.
<BR>
<DD>The standard conservative response has been to call 
for cuts in welfare.  Cut payments and impose time limits 
on benefits, conservatives have argued, and the poor 
will struggle in low-wage jobs and gradually move up 
the income ladder as earlier generations did.
<BR>
<DD>This view is not without merit.  In the late 1980s, 
the American Enterprise Institute's Michael Novak convened 
a team of policy analysts, both liberal and conservative, 
to see if they could reach a consensus on how to 
reduce poverty.  They concluded that in order to avoid 
long-term poverty, a person must do three things: finish high 
school, get married, and get a job -- any job.  (See 
<I>The New Consensus on Poverty and Welfare</I>, Washington, DC: AEI, 1987.) 
 Even the lowest-paying jobs teach important skills such 
as punctuality and courtesy that are essential in all kinds 
of work.
<BR>
<DD>Against the liberal argument, it can also be said that 
the poor, like everyone else, respond to incentives.  In 
large cities, the homeless often receive many kinds of 
benefits, from shelter to food to medicine to evenin a few 
&quot;progressive&quot; citieselectronic mail addresses.  Of course, 
this does nothing to reduce homelessness.  In fact, many of 
the homeless seem to prefer life on the streets to the 
demands earning a living in mainstream society.
<P>
<B>Changing the Terms of Debate</B>
<BR>
<DD>Marvin Olasky, whose 1992 book <I>The Tragedy of 
American Compassion</I> helped spark a renewed debate on 
how best to help the poor, seeks to change the focus of 
welfare discussions.  He argues that many of the problems the 
poor face are not financial but cultural and spiritual.  He 
contends that many 19th-century charities effectively 
fought poverty by helping the poor on an individual basis 
and through biblical and moral teaching.  <I>Renewing 
American Compassion: How Compassion for the Needy Can 
Turn Ordinary Citizens into Heroes</I> (New York: Free Press, 
201 pages, $21.00) continues Olasky's exploration of why 
private charity is a better way to help the poor than 
government subsidy.
<BR>
<DD>&quot;Private charities had succeeded in helping many 
individuals,&quot; Olasky writes, &quot;because they offered 
compassion that was challenging, personal, and spiritually based.  
Government over time proved itself incapable of doing 
the same; instead, governmental charity emphasized 
entitlement rather than challenge, bureaucracy rather than 
personal help, and a reduction of man to material being only.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>In the first chapter, Olasky examines recent efforts 
in Wisconsin to reform welfare by imposing work 
requirements and time limits on benefits.  While supporting 
some of these reforms, he argues that Wisconsin's reforms 
include &quot;a package of social-worker intensive programs 
that will continue to keep the welfare world safe for 
bureaucracy.&quot;  Moreover, the Wisconsin effort is essentially 
a compromise intended to please liberals, conservatives, 
and feminists.  Liberals under the reform get a continuation 
of the welfare state.  Conservatives get some insistence 
on work, as welfare recipients are required to get a job 
or spend 32 hours per week in classes to prepare them 
for work.  And feminists get an assurance that welfare 
agencies will not elevate the traditional family above other 
living arrangements.  On the walls of a Kenosha, 
Wisconsin welfare office are such slogans as &quot;A family
doesn’t need a man to be whole” and “Stop waiting for Prince Charming, his horse broke down.”
<BR>
<DD>While it’s too early to tell what results these reforms as well as recent federal legislation will produce, Olasky suggests that most reformers are asking the wrong questions.  Perhaps current reforms will prompt some mothers to enter the work force, but will government programs ensure that poor women don’t form single-parent households in the first place?  “Long-term poverty fighting,” he contends, “depends on affecting not just the outside of a person, but the inside as well.”
<BR>
<DD>In the second chapter, Olasky explores several faith-based private alternatives to Wisconsin’s reform efforts.  In Milwaukee’s Parklawn housing project, Deborah Darden heads the Right Alternative Family Services Center, which teaches responsibility to welfare mothers and their children.  He also visits Milwaukee’s Professional Receptionist Institute, where Lessie Handy teaches poor women how to get jobs as receptionists.  According to Handy, her school has had 206 graduates in its short existence, 186 of whom currently have jobs.
<BR>
<DD>These charities, Olasky contends, do a better job with less money than their state-run counterparts because they teach moral lessons as well as job skills.  “No bureaucracy, and no amount of money, can buy the reformation of morals that is desperately needed.”
<P>
<B>Lessons from History</B><BR>
<DD>In subsequent chapters, Olasky returns to history to discuss principles that charity workers and organizations used to help the poor.  New York City’s Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children (founded 1797) provided food, clothing, and medicine—but no cash—to those it believed would be propelled toward greater self-sufficiency.  Other 19th-century charities admonished volunteers to follow such principles as: help the deserving poor one at a time, and treat them as friends and neighbors, not clients.  
Most 19th-century social reformers opposed
any massive national effort to address poverty.  An 
1844 edition of <I>McGuffey's Reader</I>, for example, criticized 
a &quot;Mr. Fantom&quot; who had &quot;noble zeal for the 
<I>millions</I>&quot; but &quot;little compassion for the units.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Around the turn of the century, however, these 
effective charities were superseded by large national 
organizations that thought it more important to fight the presumed 
&quot;social causes&quot; of poverty.  Progressive reformers replaced 
the reform-minded Christianity of their parents and 
grandparents with a weaker, utopian faith which held that a 
New Jerusalem could be built in America through 
government action.  As Frank Lovejoy, president of the National 
Conference of Social Work, said in a 1920 address, 
social workers could become &quot;social engineers&quot; who would 
create &quot;a divine order on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Ultimately, the ideas of Progressives led to the 
welfare programs of the Great Society.  But today, Olasky 
contends, the welfare state is like an abandoned church: its 
structure still stands, but the faith that built it is long dead.
<P>
<B>Moving Beyond the Status Quo</B>
<BR>
<DD>Olasky observes, however, that many smaller nonprofits, often with shoestring budgets, have adapted or retained the methods of 19th-century charities.  Reformers such as Bob Cote in Denver, Hannah Hawkins in Washington, D.C., and Freddie Garcia in San Antonio change lives through tough-love approaches.  As welfare agencies stagnate under the dead weight of disproved theories and political inertia, smaller, nimbler nonprofits are succeeding.
<BR>
<DD>Olasky argues that thousands of poverty-fighting groups will do more for the poor than a massive and costly welfare state.
To help them, he proposes greatly expanded tax credits for charitable activities.  He supports the proposals of Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN) that would give a $500 tax credit to taxpayers who contribute to direct-service charities, and an additional $500 credit to taxpayers who take care of homeless people, battered and pregnant women, or those requiring hospice care.
<BR>
<DD>But Olasky believes that more dramatic reforms 
are necessary.  He calls for devolving welfare to the states 
and reducing the average federal tax burden by $3,000 
per person.  To offset the loss of federal revenue, state 
taxes would rise by $2,500 per person.  However, those 
who contributed $3,000 in time or money to 
poverty-fighting organizations would be exempt from the new state tax.
<BR>
<DD>Tax credits, Olasky concludes, can play a part in 
ensuring that more Americans practice true compassion 
toward the needy.  But personal changes in the beliefs of 
millions of Americans will be necessary if poverty is to be reduced. 
 &quot;With supportive laws and rules,&quot; Olasky says, 
&quot;compassionate individuals can make real progress toward 
reducing some of our most serious social pathologies, but the 
crucial change is still the one that goes on in each individual 
soul, not in the federal or state capitals.&quot;

<DD>Is there a viable private alternative to the welfare state? 
 This is the question posed by David G. Green, director

Economic Affairs, in <I>Community without Politics: A Market 
Approach to Welfare Reform</I> (London: IEA, [2 Lord 
North Street, SW1p 3LB, tel: 0171-799-3745], 1996, 184 
pp., &#163;8.00).  Green, a leading expert on welfare in Great 
Britain, brings a much-needed classical liberal perspective to 
the issue of how to replace the welfare state.  Most of 
his analyses and recommendations are applicable to the 
United States.
<BR>
<DD>Before the welfare state, Green argues, most 
Britons assumed responsibility for fostering a &quot;public but not 
political domain&quot; of duties to care for those unable to 
support themselves.  They prioritized responsibility for this 
task: first, the individual or family; second, the community 
as distinct from the state; and finally, the government.  
This formed the basis for an ethos of &quot;community without 
politics&quot; in which ordinary people helped the less 
fortunate without generally resorting to government.  This 
ethos, argues Green, urgently needs to be revived.
<P>
<B>Liberty and Community: A Restatement</B>
<BR>
<DD>Green argues that the Thatcher and Reagan 
administrations failed to curtail government welfare because 
they could not change public beliefs that doing so would 
be harmful and immoral.  He contends that this attitude 
still predominates because few people can envision 
private alternatives to welfare and because &quot;collectivists 
have successfully established in the public mind . . . that 
to demand more government welfare . . . is proof of 
compassion.&quot;  Moreover, advocates of freedom have been 
preoccupied with economic issues while overlooking the 
importance of voluntary associations in addressing social 
problems.
<BR>
<DD>Green believes that fundamental welfare reform 
depends in part on reviving classical liberal conceptions of 
freedom and community.  These, he suggests, have important 
implications for both givers and receivers of charity.  To 
most 19th-century liberals, freedom was not &quot;laissez-faire&quot; 
or liberation from obstacles to one's desires, but the 
exercise of responsibility for self-improvement and for making 
the world a better place for others.  Historically, advocates 
of liberty &quot;wanted to create and foster institutions that 
would encourage self-improvement.  Civic capitalists always 
understood that life is a perpetual struggle against 
imperfection.  They did not, of course, expect perfection to 
be achieved.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Drawing on the work of political philosopher 
Michael Oakeshott, Green uses the term &quot;civil association&quot; to 
describe the kind of community classical liberals sought 
to build.  Advocates of civil association held that 
individuals were intelligent agents capable of overcoming 
obstacles and charting their course in life.  Freedom, while 
demanding much of the individual, was experienced as a 
pleasure, not a burden.  A sense of community arose from a 
shared understanding that everyone, through the exercise of 
responsibility and virtue, had both the chance to achieve 
his or her potential and a responsibility to help others 
achieve theirs.
<BR>
<DD>But Green notes that when the 20th-century welfare 
state tried to solve problems that all individuals 
facefrom saving for health care to guarding against poverty in 
old ageit undermined opportunities to address those 
problems individually and through voluntary associations: 
it &quot;weakened human character by diminishing 
opportunities for us to develop our skills and our virtues through 
direct participation in overcoming the hazards of life. . . .  
There can be no virtue without practice and no practice while 
the state monopolizes all important services.&quot;  If the 
welfare state is to be replaced, each of us must be willing to 
shoulder more responsibility for our own welfare and the welfare 
of others.
<P>
<B>Reforming the Nonprofit Sector</B><BR>
<DD>Green succinctly explains why the welfare state 
has encouraged long-term dependency and effectively 
refutes arguments often used to justify expansive welfare 
programs.  But his main contribution may be the many 
proposals he advances to scale back the welfare leviathan 
and allow private initiative to flourish.
<BR>
<DD>Recognizing that private alternatives to welfare will 
not become widespread so long as nonprofit organizations 
rely on government funds, Green suggests that the law 
recognize two types of nonprofits: &quot;registered charities&quot; 
that depend entirely on private funding and &quot;registered 
voluntary associations&quot; that receive partial funding from 
government.  Only the former would enjoy tax-exempt status.  
This change, Green believes, would encourage more 
nonprofits to forego government funding.
<BR>
<DD>Green also proposes that advocates of nonprofit 
reform create a membership organization to represent 
privately supported nonprofits.  Its goal would be to &quot;build a 
movement of those who take pride in ensuring that vital tasks 
are undertaken without resort to government . . . and to 
encourage the new spirit among others.&quot; Green further 
proposes that businesses reorient their giving programs to 
favor privately supported nonprofits and that they refuse to 
fund nonprofits that seek to expand the welfare state.
<P>
<B>Policy Proposals</B>
<BR>
<DD>Green outlines four policy changes that must occur if 
the poor are to become economically self-sufficient:
<UL>
<LI>Promote economic growth and end over-regulation that is responsible for unemployment.
<LI>Acknowledge that self-destructive behavior is a major cause of poverty.  Discretionary assistance is more likely to help the needy than cash payments and one-size-fits-all entitlement programs.
<LI>Cut income taxes to allow wage earners to keep more of their earnings, and end income taxes on savings.
<LI>Revive the tradition of community without politics.
</UL>
<BR>
<DD>Green discusses how voluntary organizations could do 
a better job of providing two types of government 
benefits: insurable contingencies (such as sick pay and 
disability benefits) and unemployment compensation.  To 
privatize insurable contingencies, the government would honor 
existing commitments but at a set date pay no new benefits. 
Reductions in spending would be matched by tax 
cuts, allowing workers to retain more of their earnings to 
buy health insurance or set aside money in case of ill health.
<BR>
<DD>Green proposes four ways to handle individuals 
with costly pre-existing health conditions:
<UL>
<LI>The government could pay insurance companies a one-time lump sum in exchange for accepting such persons
<LI>Risk pools, like those in use in the U.S., could be created;
<LI>Insurers could be required to accept a certain number of uninsurable persons based on market share;
<LI>Traditional provident dispensaries, similar to America's community health clinics, could be reestablished.  
The poor would pay what they could for health 
care while the better-off would pay more.  As Green notes, 
&quot;the British people have traditionally been generous and 
many may well be attracted to support provident associations. 
Today, organizations which have an ethical as well as 
a commercial purpose are already popular, including 
unit trusts [mutual funds] promising `ethical investments.'&quot;
</UL>
<DD>Green argues that Britain's current unemployment 
compensation system encourages an attitude of &quot;claim all 
you can get.&quot;  But private organizations, he contends, are 
better suited to develop tailor-made programs that help 
individuals regain employment: &quot;A face-to-face relationship with 
a voluntary association worker will not have the same 
corrupting effect because all assistance will be 
discretionary and subject to mutual agreement.  In such a 
personal relationship, mutual respect, honour and good faith have 
a chance, but an arms-length relationship with a public 
official encourages dishonesty, bad faith and `working 
the system.'&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Green proposes giving the unemployed the option of choosing either government unemployment benefits or 
assistance from privately funded employment organizations. 
Individuals choosing the former would have to spend 
all their savings and deduct any part-time income before 
receiving benefits.  Those choosing private support, 
however, would not be legally obliged to do either.
<P>
<B>Dealing with Illegitimacy</B><BR>
<DD>Green believes that &quot;to father a child and to refuse to 
take responsibility should be clearly marked out as one of 
the lowest things a man can do.&quot;  To deter men from 
fathering children out of wedlock, he proposes three new 
criminal offenses, possibly carrying jail sentences:
<UL>
<LI>A father's failure to register his child's birth;
<LI>Threatening the mother with violence to conceal the father's identity;
<LI>Failing to pay child support.
</UL>
<DD>Green proposes that fathers who refuse to pay 
child support be legally required to turn over all earnings, 
savings, and non-essential possessions until their obligation 
is fulfilled.  He also proposes that fathers who quit working 
to avoid child support be forced to work at special centers.  
&quot;It may be necessary in a few cases to make this work 
obligation especially burdensome, perhaps by requiring 
performance of hard labour for up to ten hours a day. . . .  
These measures will strike many as severe, and that is 
their intention.  They are likely to bring about a 
substantial behavioural change in men.&quot;
<P>Green also recommends that never-married mothers 
with children over two years of age be required to work as 
a condition of receiving benefits.  He speculates that the 
need for day care would make mandatory workfare more 
costly in the short run.  However, if &quot;the future promises a 
five-day working week plus caring for the child alone in the 
evenings and weekends, fewer [women] will choose it.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Road Ahead</B><BR>
<DD>Green aptly summarizes today's welfare problem 
by quoting J.S. Mill: &quot;A people among whom there is no 
habit of spontaneous action for a collective interestwho 
look habitually to their government to command or prompt 
them in all matters of joint concern who expect to have 
everything done for them, except what can be made an affair 
of mere habit and routinehave their faculties only 
half developed.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>The current welfare crisis, as Green amply makes 
clear, is not primarily financial but moral: welfare has 
undermined the determination of recipients to become 
self-sufficient and discouraged those who can help from doing so.
<BR>
<DD>As the 20th century draws to a close, more people 
are becoming convinced that the all-embracing welfare 
state cannot work.  Yet it is not sufficient to demolish the 
myth of the beneficent welfare state. <I>Community without 
Politics</I> outlines important steps that must be taken to 
make viable private alternatives to welfare a reality.
<BR>

book, <I>Reinventing Civil Society: The Rediscovery of 
Welfare without Politics</I>, see the April 1994 issue of

<I>To Empower People</I></FONT><BR>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Daniel T. Oliver, Editor</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<P>
<DD>In 1977, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) 
published a forty-five page pamphlet entitled <I>To 
Empower People</I>.  Its authors, sociologist Peter L. Berger 
(now director of the Institute for the Study of Economic 
Culture at Boston University) and Catholic theologian 
Richard John Neuhaus (president of the Institute on Religion 
and Public Life and editor-in-chief of its monthly journal, 
<I>First Things</I>), argued compellingly that &quot;mediating 
structures&quot;institutions such as neighborhoods, families, churches, 
and voluntary associationsserve as an important bridge 
between individuals' private lives and the larger 
institutions of society.  Mediating structures, they declared, are vital 
to maintaining social cohesion and preventing social 
breakdown.
<BR>
<DD>AEI has republished the original work along with 
eleven new essays by prominent observers of American civic 
life in <I>To Empower People: From State to Civil 
Society</I> (Washington, DC: The AEI Press, 1996, 223 pages, $24.95, 
tel: [202] 862-5800).  The essayists offer insight into how 
the ideas of Berger and Neuhaus have helped to shape 
thinking about public policy over the last 20 years and 
contemplate the future course of public policy.  The introductory 
essay by AEI scholar Michael Novak, winner of the 
1994 Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion and a member 
of Capital Research Center's National Advisory Board, 
offers this prediction: &quot;The political party that makes 
mediating structures the North Star of a new bipartisan agenda 
will dominate practical politics for the next fifty years.&quot;
<UL>
<LI>Douglas J. Besharov, resident scholar at AEI, suggests ways to generate funding for mediating institutions that do not rely on direct federal monies;
<LI>Stuart M. Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, describes how public policy can encourage the growth of mediating structures;
<LI>William A. Galston, former deputy assistant to President Clinton for domestic policy, tells how &quot;New Democrats&quot; in the executive branch have sought to reinvigorate mediating structures;
<LI>David G. Green, director of the Health and Welfare Unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs, analyzes how the welfare state has undermined mediating institutions and suggests ways to address this problem;
<LI>Michael J. Horowitz, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget, proposes legal reforms that can help restore the role of mediating structures;
<LI>Michael S. Joyce and William A. Schambra, president and director of general programs, respectively, of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, examine how the erosion of the Great Society ideal has laid the foundation for a revival of mediating structures;
<LI>Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Hudson Institute, explains how federally funded nonprofits present a major obstacle to restoring mediating structures;
<LI>Marvin Olasky, senior fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation and author of the new book <I>Renewing American Compassion</I>, examines how the effectiveness of one mediating structurea homeless rehabilitation center was undermined by government funding;
<LI>James K. Pinkerton, former deputy assistant to Presidents Reagan and Bush for policy planning, describes how the concept of mediating structures has been incorporated into presidential campaigns since 1977.
<LI>Robert L. Woodson, president and founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, highlights several successful grassroots mediating institutions that can serve as an inspiration to others.
</UL>
<DD>Looking over their 1977 essay, Berger and Neuhaus 
note that today's political climate is more favorable to 
realizing their vision of reinvigorated mediating institutions.  
Indeed, they originally stressed that they were not 
primarily concerned with reducing the cost of government or 
devolving government responsibilities since &quot;that would be 
tantamount to dismantling the welfare state.&quot;  They now 
state that &quot;it seems plausible to us to be less cautious on 
both counts.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Berger and Neuhaus also note that a major obstacle 
to reviving mediating structures is the &quot;very large and 
powerful vested interests [that] have grown up around 
every policy of the welfare state.  The paradigm shift suggested 
by the concept of mediating structures directly threatens 
some of those interests.  Needless to say, they will fight back. . . . 
The deformation of mediating structures by this process 
of creeping `governmentalism' must be at the center of 
any rethinking of social policy.&quot;

<I>The Home</I><BR></FONT>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Martin Morse Wooster, Visiting Fellow</B><BR></FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<DD>One issue often raised in the welfare debate is what to 
do about children who have lost one or both parents or who 
for some reason cannot remain with their biological parents. 
 It's clear that the existing state foster-care system is 
expensive and ineffective.  But would orphanages be a 
practical and humane alternative?
<BR>
<DD>That's the question posed by Richard B. McKenzie in 
his latest book, <I>The Home: A Memoir of Growing Up in 
an Orphanage</I> (New York: Basic Books, 1996, 227 
pages, $22.00).  McKenzie, an economist at the University 
of California at Irvine, is perhaps best known for his 
1993 book <I>What Went Right in the 1980s</I>, an analysis of 
economic policy during the Reagan Administration.  
Unlike McKenzie's usual focus on public policy, 
<I>The Home</I> is a narrative account of McKenzie's boyhood years at a 
North Carolina orphanage.
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie is very candid about his life at The 
Home, telling how his experiences there helped him mature 
and become a responsible adult.  He concludes that on 
balance The Home helped both him and his fellow orphans.  
&quot;Obviously, if any of us had been given a choice between 
growing up with Ozzie and Harriet or in The Home, we would 
surely have taken the former,&quot; he writes.  &quot;But our families 
had failed us, and we didn't want to take the risk that 
another family would do the same.  Virtually all of us today 
shudder at the foster-care option.  Foster families cannot 
offer children a sense of permanence, and the children can 
never be sure whether foster parents are taking them in as 
a personal mission or just for the money.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie's account of recent changes at The Home 
is engaging if not saddening.  During the 1950s, 
when McKenzie was there, the institution was affiliated with 
the Presbyterian Church.  It had large farms where the 
orphans worked after school and during the summer.  It also had 
its own school, although in later years McKenzie and 
his fellow orphans went to a nearby high school.
<BR>
<DD>In the late 1960s, The Home underwent massive change. 
 Its board decided to transform the institution into a 
foster-care center, admitting only troubled children.  
Meanwhile, The Home's administrators, while retaining the 
institution's name in order to attract donors, cut off relations 
with alumni and forbade them from visiting students 
during reunion weekends.
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie observes that as a foster-care center, 
The Home has become vastly more expensive.  Tuition is 
now $45,000 a year!almost twice as much as Harvard 
tuition and fifteen times more than when McKenzie was there.  
And despite these huge fees, the school no longer provides 
jobs for students because it cannot afford to pay them.
<BR>
<DD>Surveying other orphans who grew up in The 
Home, McKenzie finds that most have become solid 
citizensministers, managers, doctors, bankers.  Far from 
being damaged by their time in The Home, McKenzie argues 
that they gained a sense of permanence they would never 
have had if they had bounced from one foster home to the next. 
 &quot;Children need, at a minimum, a safe, stable, 
structured, and permanent place that provides opportunities for 
personal growth, a chance to live down and away from 
the problems of their past.  They need the break I was 
lucky enough to get at The Home.&quot;
<BR>

in &quot;Orphanages: Did They Throttle the Children in their 
Care?&quot; <I>The Public Interest</I>, Winter 1996.)<BR>

</center><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration claims that its military intervention in Haiti has been one of the greatest foreign policy successes in American history. During the vice presidential debate on October 9, 1996, Vice President Albert Gore said that Operation Restore Democracy is "one of the most deft uses of diplomacy and military force in combination that you will find anywhere in the annals of the history of this country."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The truth, however, is that two years after Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to the Haitian presidency under the protective umbrella of 23,000 American soldiers -- and at a cost of $3 billion to America's taxpayers -- Haiti remains a cauldron of barely contained violence. Despite this ill-advised intervention in domestic Haitian politics, democracy has not come to Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Instead, a one-party government controlled by Aristide's Lavalas party has shut out most of Haiti's genuine democrats. An Aristide puppet, Rene Preval, now rules Haiti as president. Economic reforms are stalled. There are no property rights. The judicial system does not function. An inexperienced and weak U.S.-trained Haitian police force has been unable to stop political killings, and is outnumbered by more than 6,000 armed members of rival left-wing gangs and right-wing demobilized soldiers who are responsible for growing urban and rural violence. Economic and political pressures to migrate from Haiti to the U.S. remain high. Finally, despite massive amounts of U.S. aid, about 70 percent of the people are illiterate, and 60 percent remain unemployed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>President Preval: Aristide's Puppet.</b> Aristide would still be president of Haiti today if the Clinton Administration had not pressured him strongly in 1995 to step aside and allow a democratic transition of power to a new elected president. Aristide chose Rene Preval as his successor. On December 17, 1995, Preval, a lifelong friend and close supporter of Aristide, was elected President of Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, turnout was light as 21 Haitian political parties boycotted the elections to protest what some opposition leaders called Aristide's "use of the cloak of democracy to justify the installation of a dictatorship."<sup>1</sup>  More than 70 percent of the country's 3.7 million eligible voters stayed home, many of them intimidated by supporters of Aristide who systematically harassed and murdered his political opponents throughout 1995 in advance of the presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some two dozen democratic Haitian leaders opposed to Aristide were murdered during 1995 while Aristide was still in power -- and while American troops were still stationed in large numbers on Haitian soil. Members of Aristide's hand-picked, U.S.-trained palace security unit in Port-au-Prince were implicated directly in many of these killings. Nonetheless, Aristide rejected private entreaties by U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Swing, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and other U.S. officials that he fire the suspects and order police investigations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Clinton: Unable to Stop the Killing.</b> On September 24, 1996, White House counsel Jack Quinn notified Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House Committee on International Relations, that President Clinton had invoked executive privilege to deny a request for key documents that might shed some light on whether the Administration has tried to conceal the fact that U.S. officials have known since early 1995 that "death squads" loyal to Aristide are operating out of the presidential palace.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Representative Gilman says that the Clinton Administration "has been aware since early 1995 that death-squads were operating under the direction of top security aides to President Aristide."<sup>2</sup>  Ambassador Swing reported the first killings in a cable to the State Department dated February 18, 1995; he also admitted in a September 1995 cable to the State Department that the Aristide government had stonewalled an FBI investigation of these political assassinations. In fact, not one of the Clinton Administration officials who testified before or briefed the House Committee on International Relations on ten separate occasions in 1995 ever revealed any information about these specific reports of palace death squads. The first such acknowledgment did not occur until public testimony before the committee on January 4, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When Preval became president in 1996, Aristide's palace guards -- trained in Virginia by American security experts at a cost of more than $5.5 million to U.S. taxpayers -- remained at Preval's side. Moreover, killers assigned to the presidential security unit continued to gun down Aristide's opponents. The Clinton Administration, for example, has information implicating members of the palace guard in the August 20, 1996, political assassinations of the Reverend Antoine Leroy and Jacques Fleurival, leaders of the opposition Mobilization for National Development (MDN), in Port-au-Prince. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott, however, did not tell the House committee, in sworn written testimony submitted on September 9, 1996, that Haitians implicated in the 1995 political killings of Aristide's opponents remained in the Haitian palace guard.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On September 13, 1996, the Clinton Administration rushed 22 armed bodyguards from the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) to Port-au-Prince to guard the life of President Preval. This group of American security officials was reinforced by 22 Navy and Air Force civilian guards and contractors, in addition to 70 Canadian soldiers who were deployed in a security perimeter surrounding the presidential palace. The day before the U.S. bodyguards arrived in Port-au-Prince, Preval transferred the head of the palace guard (Joseph Moise) and his deputy (Milien Romage) to other security functions within the Haitian government. As many as a dozen political assassins loyal to Aristide may still hold their jobs in the palace guard, working alongside U.S. government bodyguards assigned to protect Preval.
<p>

Haiti's rising violence and political instability reportedly have prodded Pentagon planners to revisit contingency plans for the possible reintroduction of U.S. troops. These troops would be in addition to the 160 U.S. soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division that were deployed briefly in July 1996 after the Clinton Administration learned of credible assassination threats against Aristide and Preval, and 50 U.S. Marines that were sent to Port-au-Prince on August 20, 1996, following the commando-style executions of opposition leaders Leroy and Fleurival. Although Clinton Administration officials have explained the rotation of American combat troops through Haiti as "training exercises," Ambassador Swing acknowledged to Congress on September 27, 1996, that these small U.S. troop deployments are intended to augment security and keep the lid on Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stuck in Haiti.</b> Prominent Members of Congress suspect that the Clinton Administration is misleading both Congress and the American people about Haiti. Congressional efforts to overcome the Administration's stonewalling on Haiti should be intensified. In an October 22, 1996, press release issued by the House International Relations Committee, Representative Gilman said that "Enough evidence exists to justify a further inquiry into the possible existence of a conspiracy to withhold this information from Congress."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House and Senate should challenge President Clinton's use of executive privilege to hide the failure of Operation Restore Democracy. They can do this by holding hearings on Haiti and by compelling the appearance -- as witnesses under oath -- of top Administration officials involved in Haiti policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the Administration balks at disclosing the truth about Haiti, Congress should take steps to block all financial aid to Haiti from the Agency for International Development (AID) and multilateral lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Inter-American Development Bank. Congress also should block further U.S. funding for the Canadian-led U.N. security mission in Haiti and compel the withdrawal of all remaining U.S. troops and other American security officials from Haiti. Finally, the U.S. should make it clear to Haiti's government and people that all Haitian immigrants caught trying to enter America illegally will be repatriated immediately and without appeal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to get to the bottom of what is going on in Haiti. U.S. personnel in Haiti are in danger of becoming not guarantors of democracy, but a palace guard for a corrupt and bloody regime.

<CENTER>by Malcolm Wallop</CENTER>
<P>
Washington has taken such a beating in recent decades
because the citizens of this great country do not believe that
the Congress or the White House know the value of a tax dollar.
 Oh, they say they do.  It is a great sound bite on the campaign
trail.  The new freshman class in Congress seems to understand.
 They have held the leadership's feet to the fire through the
entire budget debate.  We can only hope that the freshman stay
vigilant, do not get seduced by the trappings of Washington, and
maintain a determination to keep sacred the value of the tax dollar.
<P>
The Clinton Administration could stand to take a
few lessons from the Republican House freshmen.  It is not a stretch
to say that Bill Clinton's &quot;ethic&quot;-that the government
is the nursemaid of all citizens-has been wholeheartedly embraced
by all presidential and political appointees.  It is remarkable
to what a broad extent that ethic has been transformed into government
policy.
<P>
Case in point.  The Clinton Administration's premise:
Cigarette smoke is bad for your health.  The Clinton Administration's
answer?  Destroy the tobacco industry with taxpayer funds and
protect us from ourselves.
<P>
The issue of tobacco and its effects on our health
is a legitimate issue, but the government's vendetta singling
out an industry is quite another.  I am not just talking about
the FDA rule to limit the tobacco industry's First Amendment rights.
 The proposed FDA rule is a dangerous course that Bill Clinton
willingly charts. He and his ilk prefer politics to the Constitution.
 The First Amendment is a simple nuisance, the Constitution is
an impediment to efficient government.
<P>
We Americans have become immune to our lawmakers
chipping away at our Constitutional rights.  We no longer lash
out when they whittle away at more of our freedoms.  When Americans
do lash out at their government, they are dismissed as radicals,
anarchists, militia members, or simply, the &quot;angry block.&quot;
 Nonetheless, when these attacks on our personal freedoms are
done with taxpayers money, all Americans must stand up and take
notice.
<P>
Whether you like smoking or not, your money is being
used to destroy the American tobacco industry.  If you think this
is all right, just think of this. Do you enjoy a nice thick steak
on occasion?  How about a cold beer during a hot summer day or
a nice glass of wine during an elegant meal?  I do and, in fact,
I occasionally enjoy a cigar.
<P>
Is it a stretch to think that this government could
attack other American industries such as the meat industry or
the alcohol industry.  On September 19, 1995, approximately 40
anti-drinking organizations wrote to President Clinton asking
for the FDA rule be applied to cover the sale of alcohol, as well.
 And that is how it begins.
<P>
Once the first spark hits, all gasoline burns.  The
Clinton Administration jumps into its &quot;nanny&quot; role and
begins spending taxpayer dollars to &quot;protect&quot; us all
from &quot;evils&quot; of their choosing.
<P>
Just this year, the National Cancer Institute awarded
a grant of $606,000 to Stanton Glantz, Ph.D. to &quot;study&quot;
tobacco industry political contributions and their effect on legislative
policy in California.  The National Cancer Institute is a scientific
body not a political research firm.  In what scientific realm
does the study of political contributions fall?  Furthermore,
could NCI find anyone more biased than anti-smoking crusader Glantz?
 Speaking to a  conference in April of 1990, Dr. Glantz remarked,
&quot;We are on a roll and the bastards [tobacco industry] are
on the run and I urge you to keep chasing them.  In researching
scientific data, one would assume that credible research comes
from a totally objective approach to a given project.  Giving
Dr. Glantz a grant to study the tobacco industry is akin to the
EEOC giving Mark Furman a grant to study race relations.
<P>
Another example of President Clinton's efforts to
kill the tobacco industry is a $950,000 grant to Northeastern
University to, in the words of professor Richard Daynard, principle
investigator, &quot;develop strategies to thwart the bullying
tactics of the tobacco industry.&quot;  By the way, Professor
Daynard has been an advocate of tobacco control policies since
the mid-70's.  I would say that qualifies him as an &quot;objective&quot;
researcher.  Of course, we are talking about the Clinton Administration
where scientific data is less relevant than the point they're
after.
<P>
These two absurd grants simply scratch the surface.
 If that $606,000 and that $950,000 of taxpayers money can be
used to investigate the tobacco industry, look out, your industry
could very well be next.  There is no constitutional basis or
authority for their assault.  Again, it is the battle between
those who believe in big government and those whose preference
is limited government.  It is the battle between those who believe
that one tax dollar is theirs to spend in any way and those who
would like that tax dollar returned to the taxpayer.
<P>
To smokers or those who detest smoking, funding these
federal projects to promote a political motive is unethical. 
Moreover, funding these projects to single out and destroy a particular
industry is near criminal.
<P>
While the President goes after the tobacco industry
with a vengeance, his administration happily uses other taxpayer
dollars to benefit his political friends.  Between July of 1993
and June of 1994, the Clinton Administration handed the AFL-CIO
over $2 million, the National Education Association $385,000,
the Teamsters over $3.5 million.  What did Democrats get in return
from the happy Unions?  From 1988 to 1993, Unions gave Democrat
House Members $57 million to $4.7 for Republicans.  In that same
time span, Unions gave Democrat Senate candidates $15 million
to $1.5 million for Republicans.  In 1994, the Democratic National
Committee received $835,000 from Unions and the Republican National
Committee received, are you ready?-$0.
<P>
Here it is in a nutshell.  Spend lavishly to kill
an industry in free market America and then turn around to give
taxpayer money to your friends.  Bill Clinton is truly amazing.
 He finds nothing wrong with this scenario.
<P>
Every single tax dollar begins as the fruits of someone's
labor.  Using taxpayer money to destroy an industry or help a
political friend is wrong and Bill Clinton, had he any conviction,
would agree.

<center><h2>Free at Last: Black America Signs up for School Choice</h2>

<b>By Nina Shokraii</b>
<p>
<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i><br>
<a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/toc.html">November-December 1996, Number 80</a></b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A powerful grass-roots movement is slowly gathering force that may transform the politics of American education. Its human face is not white but black; its resources few but its determination strong. And its goal is freedom. Although most black political leaders still actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, their constituents are growing increasingly angry at the public schools' disastrous record of teaching black children. As a result, black parents, pastors, local officials, and civil-rights leaders are beginning to embrace school vouchers, charter schools, and other reforms that offer alternatives to dismal public schools. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These African Americans believe that academic achievement is the key to their economic independence. They want schools that involve them in their children's education while imposing high standards and strict discipline, and they reject the notion that poverty somehow renders parents less interested in their children's academic well-being. As their numbers swell, teachers unions will find it increasingly difficult to hold back reforms that offer black children a better chance. 
<p><table width="170" align="left" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>Standards, discipline, and parental involvement are pulling black parents toward school choice</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This new movement is already spreading throughout the country. In Cleveland, African Americans like councilwoman Fannie Lewis, school principals Lydia Harris and Sister Hasina Renee, and school-board member Genevieve Mitchell led the fight for a new state law that provides vouchers this fall for 2,000 low-income children. Lewis, Harris, Renee, and Mitchell vigorously supported Republican governor George Voinovich as he moved his voucher proposal through the state legislature. Lewis recruited 300 citizens in her neighborhood of Hough, the site of race riots in 1968, to travel to Columbus to lobby for the scholarship program. Last fall, when the governor's staff organized a press conference to announce the signing of the bill, jubilant black students and their parents packed the hallways and aisles.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, support for vouchers in Cleveland was so strong that nearly 6,300 students, almost all of them black, applied for only 2,000 slots, which were filled by lottery. By mid-September of this year, 1,410 of the students had enrolled in a religious school. Councilwoman Lewis, a mother and 46-year Cleveland resident, attributes this flight to public schools' dismal educational record and indifference to parents. "The quality of public schools in Hough is poor," she says. "The roofs leak and the schools sometimes lack books, chairs, and other materials. Of the more than $7,000 spent on each child in the Cleveland public schools, only a fraction goes to classroom education." Thanks to vouchers, this fall Lewis was able to open her own community school, the Hough-Brooks Academy for Higher Learning -- a nonsectarian school run by a community board with a curriculum emphasizing the arts and cultural awareness. Lewis hopes this will "force school officials to pay more attention to parents' concerns and to provide safer and better schools." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Milwaukee, as Dan McGroarty has shown in his new book, <i>Break These Chains</i>, blacks have been the principal supporters of two Wisconsin voucher programs. "The battle for Parental Choice," McGroarty writes, "began in the church basements and meeting halls of Milwaukee's Near North Side," a poor neighborhood where only 48 percent of adults hold a job. "From the start, the Milwaukee proponents' language was appropriated from the civil-rights movement. Their rhetoric was more redolent of Martin Luther King Jr. than the free-market pronouncements favored by conservative voucher proponents."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The engineer of Milwaukee's first voucher plan, which was limited to nonsectarian schools, was Annette "Polly" Williams, a black Democratic state representative from the Near North Side. Having fought the school system a dozen years earlier for busing her daughter to a bad public school, Williams was familiar with the Milwaukee education establishment's indifference to the needs of low-income black families. "The system is the system. It doesn't care. It doesn't feel," Williams told McGroarty. "The way I saw it, [it] is preparing our children for slavery. Look at the situation: Drop out by 10th grade, get into the street life. When you should be walking across the stage getting a diploma, you're standing in front of a judge wearing chains." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Committed to breaking up the system for the sake of the young black children in her community, Williams gradually mobilized her army of mothers and grandmothers, most of whom were on welfare, and all of whom were determined to "do right by their children." Aware of her army's powerful impact on lawmakers, she convinced the chairman of the state assembly's urban-education committee to hold a public hearing on her school-choice plan on the morning of February 23, 1990. The three-hour-long hearing, which attracted 200 low-income minority parents and children, prompted the committee to approve her proposal. Soon thereafter, it passed the assembly and the senate and was signed into law by Republican governor Tommy Thompson. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Throughout the endeavor, only one local newspaper captured Williams's crusade in a concise and accurate way: <i>Community Journal</i>, whose editor, Mikel Holt, is yet another fan of school choice. As for Milwaukee's mainstream dailies, McGroarty notes, "they attacked Williams repeatedly. One went as far as portraying her in a cartoon as a stick-up artist pointing a pistol at a public-school teacher." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Having survived a grueling round of constitutional scrutiny, the program generated so much support that in September 1994, 750 mostly low-income blacks rallied for its expansion. This time, a new generation of African-American educators joined Williams in the battle. They included Zakiya Courtney, then principal of the Urban Day School and now the director of a grass-roots group called Parents for School Choice; Brother Bob Smith, the principal of the outstanding inner-city school Messmer High; and Howard Fuller, then superintendent of Milwaukee public schools. Last year, the school board and the teachers unions mailed 3,000 videotapes attacking Fuller's stance on choice, calling it an attempt to scale back or completely cut educational programs. The unions succeeded in establishing an anti-reform majority on the board of education, which prompted Fuller's resignation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But according to a February 1995 report by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 95 percent of African Americans polled in Milwaukee support school choice, and 70 percent believe that students in private and religious schools get a better education than students in the Milwaukee public schools. Finally ceding to their constituents' demands, the Wisconsin legislature last year expanded the program to include religious schools, increased the number of vouchers from 1,500 to 15,000, and eliminated restrictions on the number of choice students in participating schools. In response, voucher opponents immediately and successfully sought an injunction from the courts and have, so far, blocked the plan's implementation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The parents, however, are equally determined. In February 1996, for instance, Courtney filled nine buses with 500 mostly black parents and children to attend a rally at the capitol, in Madison. There they voiced their enthusiasm for the newly enacted plan, which was being challenged in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. After a tie vote, the court sent the case back to trial court, where Dane County Circuit Judge Paul Higginbotham refused to lift the injunction blocking religious schools' participation in the program. "The state cannot do indirectly what it can't do directly," he said.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Higginbotham did allow the state to issue up to 15,000 vouchers for private nonreligious schools. But Courtney and Milwaukee's parents eagerly await the day the court will grant them complete authority over the upbringing of their children -- including the freedom to send them to a religious school. Meanwhile, 4,500 low-income Milwaukee students are going to religious schools this year with privately financed vouchers -- thanks to the generosity of the Bradley Foundation and 1,040 private donors who gave more than $4 million to help the students hurt by Higginbotham's decision.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Florida, T. Willard Fair, the president and chief executive officer of the liberal Urban League of Miami, and the Reverend R.B. Holmes, a black Baptist pastor from Tallahassee, are the principal supporters of a new charter school law enacted in April. The Florida plan allows any creative educator to open a school, free of the red tape that binds most public schools (such as  teacher certification and state-imposed standards). Fair formed a partnership with Jeb Bush, the conservative Republican candidate for governor in 1994, to advance the legislation. Fair described public schools as "too regulated, entrenched in bureaucracy, with overcrowded classrooms, out-of-control children, and teachers who are not held accountable due to too much union interference." And so he created Florida's first charter school, whose student body is almost entirely low-income and African-American.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Similarly, Holmes opened the C.K. Steele-Leroy Collins charter middle school, with a student body that is 75 percent black. His school is modeled after a Christian academy he created five years ago, which he describes as a school that "all people, [whether] black, white, rich, or poor want to send their kids to." To Holmes, charter schools mean "freedom to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, respect, responsibility, and entrepreneurship all in one--without the bureaucratic strings attached." A 1995 survey by the Foundation for Florida's Future found that Florida's black citizens supported school choice and charter schools by 68 percent and 63 percent, respectively.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In California, voucher supporters include Anyam Palmer, the principal of the Afrocentric Marcus Garvey School in South Central Los Angeles, who views "the present school system [as] the vehicle that puts us on welfare, in prison, and leaves us illiterate. . . . School choice is the only way out of this vicious cycle." "Public education is not working for most minority citizens in the inner city," says Bishop George D. McKinney Jr. of San Diego, who has set up a school at St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ. Testifying for vouchers last year before the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families,  McKinney faulted public schools for "low expectations . . . of minority students" and "the systematic tracking of minority students toward nonacademic programs." A recent survey of South Central's residents by the Center for the Study of Popular Culture found that 77 percent of minorities supported vouchers. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Californians may not win the right to vouchers in the near future, but an innovative charter-school law, passed in 1992, offers blacks a close alternative. According to the Hudson Institute, the California plan gives "charter petitioners the right to seek significant autonomy from local board control [and provides] a blanket waiver from most state laws and regulations." Jonathan Williams, the black principal of the Accelerated School, in South Central Los Angeles, says that a charter-school system offers "more freedom, choice, and responsibility." Accelerated's student body comprises 50 percent blacks and 50 percent Hispanics; a majority of students belong to low or low-moderate income groups.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Williams believes charter schools are the solution to the educational crisis. "With charters you can keep the system public and free, while instilling stronger accountability," he contends. Without union pressure and  handouts, "I feel like a professional instead of a wage earner." Williams's school sits in a gang-infested neighborhood. "It is not unusual for us to hear gun fights, and notice the residues of drug abuse around the school grounds," he says. But with a low student-to-teacher ratio, lots of parental involvement, and zero tolerance toward violence and drugs, Williams avoids the problems that incapacitate many public schools every year. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Michigan, the TEACH Michigan Education Fund reports that black educators have launched one out of every three Michigan charter schools. According to Bryan Taylor, the fund's executive director, "5,000 applicants applied for 330 spots when the first charter school came to Detroit; African-American educators led most of them." In Michigan, where charter schools are called "public-school academies," the law allows any individual or group to develop a charter and to seek sponsorship from a variety of entities such as the board of a state public university. The program's key supporters include black leaders like the Reverend Ned Adams Jr., an official of the Council of Baptist Pastors, which assists member churches in Detroit interested in starting charter schools; and Larry Patrick, the former president of the Detroit Board of Education and an avid advocate "for parents having as many choices as possible for the education of their children."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another black charter-school fan is Freya Rivers. The frustrated former Lansing public-school teacher now serves as district superintendent, full-time language-arts teacher, and part-time janitor and nurse. Her school, the Sanfoka Shule charter school in Lansing, targets at-risk elementary school students. In the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> earlier this year, she said, "I have two students who were [in special education in traditional Lansing public schools]. They couldn't even write their names or recognize any words. . . . I use the same methods to teach them that I use with the other students. Now both of them are writing sentences." In fact, 85 percent of the first- and second-graders Sanfoka received from Lansing public schools were illiterate; now all are able to read.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Texas, ardent African-American voucher promoters include Democratic state representative Glenn Lewis, the former general counsel for the Tarrant County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and his liberal legislative colleague Ron Wilson. Fueled by support from a growing number of black churches, including the Reverend Raymond Bryant's Union Center African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Conroe, the leaders foresee a strong chance to enact school choice in their state next year. A 1995 Texas Poll showed black support for vouchers at 59 percent, and a growing number of church groups, ministers, and community groups also believe vouchers are the next step. Says Michael Williams, a black conservative and former assistant education secretary in the Bush administration, "The [African-American] community looks to choice as the vehicle to reclaim control over the learning of the next generation of African-American scholars and leaders." Allan Parker, the president of the Texas Justice Foundation, whose group has convened a citizens' task force to investigate why Texas minority students fare worse than whites on the state's achievement tests, works closely with these leaders in promoting school choice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All of these low-income parents and community leaders seek the same opportunities for their children that middle- and upper-income black parents enjoy. "I don't think African-American parents are any different than other parents," says Michigan's Larry Patrick. "All they want is quality education for their children. Wealthy parents, like the president, can make this choice; poor ones cannot. . . . Most African-American leaders [seem to] practice choice in their own lives and support [it] on a personal level." Denis Doyle, a senior fellow with The Heritage Foundation, notes that black teachers are twice as likely as other black parents to send their children to a private school, and 30 percent of Congressional Black Caucus members with children send their children to private schools. Meanwhile, only 4 percent of blacks possess the means to exercise this option. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps this is why a poll by the left-leaning Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in April 1996 reveals that African Americans favor school choice more strongly than the general population. Support registers highest among women (51 percent), parents (61 percent), and younger African Americans (64 percent among 18- to 25-year-olds, 61 percent among 26- to 35-year-olds). These numbers are particularly telling when you consider that only 18 percent of blacks support the devolving of power from the federal government to the state and local levels. Says Brian Jones, the president of the Center for New Black Leadership, they reflect "a stalwart trend towards reclaiming the power of parents." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With respect to charter schools, the Hudson Institute's Educational Excellence Network recently reported similar positive conclusions. The report finds a high level of satisfaction with charter schools among most students, and cites the schools' clear academic expectations, safety, individualized instruction, committed teachers, and familial atmosphere. Hudson found that 63 percent of the students attending charter schools nationwide belong to a racial minority -- including 19 percent who are African-American--and that 55 percent are poor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What drives African Americans toward choice and charter schools? Standards, discipline, and parental involvement are the three core reasons.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Joyce Watkins, a resident of Chicago's West Side and a mother of seven, wants higher academic standards and eagerly hopes her city will adopt some form of school choice soon. "Where I'm from," she says, "public education offers leftovers. It means getting lost in the cracks." What frustrates Watkins the most is public-school teachers' lack of interest in her children's academic achievement. "They come home without homework sometimes," she laments. "The quality of education is really low. . . . I often wonder if teachers and school counselors even know my children's names, since they are too busy disciplining unruly students." Watkins would prefer sending her children to Providence St. Mel, a Catholic school in her neighborhood, even though she belongs to a different Christian denomination. "If they gave us more choices, more kids would go to school, stay in school, and graduate to college. . . . You would also see the crime rate go down because the kids would be in class, not on the streets. . . . That's where the opportunity lies." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Gloria Grayson, a mother in Milwaukee whose two daughters now attend a private school, abhors the absence of strict disciplinary guidelines in public schools. "They were not learning. Classes were large and pupil-to-teacher ratios were high," she says. "The children were afraid and could not concentrate because they had to deal with their undisciplined peers rather than listen and learn in class. Teachers were not able or did not try to maintain adequate control over their classes. As a result, classes progressed slowly. Teachers and administrators had nothing but excuses for the poor education my children were receiving. The . . . schools are filled with drugs and violence. They graduate drug dealers. At best, children leave those schools not with a diploma, but with battle scars." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Grayson and Watkins join other parents and educators in blaming the education system's lack of interest in their concerns. After all, as Cleveland councilwoman Fannie Lewis notes, "parents have little influence over education policy. The school board often will go into executive session to shut out community attendance at its meetings." Texas legislator Glenn Lewis, whose constituents show their anger by picketing outside school-board meetings, concurs. He considers choice a means to provide parents with more leverage over the school boards and "an opportunity to improve public schools . . . because so long as they are guaranteed our parents' dollars, they have no incentives to listen." According to a poll by the Center for Education Reform, 61 percent of blacks say "the quality of their public school could be improved a great deal," compared with 44 percent of the general population.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To find those key ingredients of a good education, black parents often gravitate towards religious education. As Fannie Lewis observes, "in most instances [the parents'] decisions have nothing to do with religion. They want their children in a safe environment with strong disciplinary standards where they can get a good education." Sectarian schools constitute 85 percent of all private schools; of that share, more than half are Catholic. Others include religious schools run by Baptists, Lutherans, Seventh-Day Adventists, and Muslims. These schools, especially in urban areas, enroll growing numbers of ethnic minority students, according to the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA). NCEA also reports that in the last 20 years, the minority percentages have more than doubled in all Catholic schools, from 10.8 percent in 1970-71 to 23.5 percent in 1992-93. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bob Smith, the veteran superintendent of Milwaukee's Messmer High School, a Catholic school, attests to these facts. "Catholic schools have been known for high-quality education since the black migration from the South. For many years, next to public schools, they were the only safe haven for blacks in the segregation era." He proudly cites the St. Benedict the Moor School, known today as the Urban Day School, as an example. The black all-male boarding school boasts a number of high-profile alumni, including Dizzy Gillespie, the jazz musician; Harold Washington, the first black mayor of Chicago; and Redd Foxx, the comedian and television star. Catholic schools are popular with parents, Smith says, because they are "safe havens against drugs, violence, and uncaring teachers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A forthcoming study in the <i>Journal of Labor Economics</i> supports the believers in religious schooling by revealing that those most likely to benefit from a Catholic-school education are minorities, many of whom are not Catholic, who attend big-city schools. The paper's author, University of Chicago economist Derek Neal, observes that "in the urban minority sample, Catholic schooling dramatically increases the probability of high school graduation . . . [and increases] college graduation rates." According to Neal, that translates into future wage gains. Among the study's sample of urban blacks and Hispanics, the probability of graduating from high school rises from 62 percent to at least 88 percent when the public-school students are placed in a Catholic secondary school. "For urban whites," he continues, "the effects are . . . always smaller in magnitude. In fact, [their] estimated wage gain from Catholic schooling is not statistically different." Neal concludes that "urban minority students benefit most from access to Catholic schools because their local public-school alternatives are poor."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps this explains why New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently urged educators to use the city's Catholic schools as a "guide" to reforms. He noted in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article in 1995 that the city's Catholic and public schools enroll about the same proportion of students with multiple risk factors, but that Catholic schools have a dropout rate of 0.1 percent, compared with 18 percent in the public schools. Giuliani also observed that, despite popular belief, Catholic schools have expulsion rates of only 2 percent. The mayor has recently proposed a measure allowing students performing in the bottom 5 percent to attend religious schools.<p><table width="170" align="right" cellpadding="3">

</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, a recent report by Jay Greene of the University of Houston and Paul Peterson of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government fortifies the supporters of choice. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that students participating in the Milwaukee choice experiment, 70 percent of whom are African American, made major academic improvements compared with a control group in public schools. In fact, after three years, the gap between the test scores of whites and minorities narrowed by 33 to 50 percent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite the growing black support for vouchers, the civil-rights establishment and most black leaders in Congress and state legislatures remain steadfastly opposed. Their explanations range from fears of losing their best students to private schools (so-called creaming) and segregation to concerns that private schools will soak up public funds. Jessica Butler, a spokesperson for the Greater Harrisburg branch of the NAACP, exclaims "tuition vouchers are just the latest scheme for abandoning our public schools." Michael Myers, the president and executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, says, "School choice is a gimmick. There is no such thing as school choice for children who don't have a choice," since private schools get to select the types of students they like.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Militant opposition to choice may also stem from the influence of large, monied teachers unions, which see any choice outside the public schools as a threat to their monopoly. Teachers unions adamantly opposed a small school-choice plan tagged to Congress's District of Columbia appropriations bill last fall. After it passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, the plan died in the Senate, despite the support of local leaders like Franklin Smith, the city's schools superintendent, and Mayor Marion Barry. Throughout the proceedings, District of Columbia delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and the Congressional Black Caucus sided with the unions and refused to endorse school choice for the city's neediest children. Explaining her reasons for opposing the modest school choice proposal, Norton told the <i>Washington Post</i> on November 3, 1995, "It's not about money, it's about the strong feeling in the District that District schools are where most of the children are going to be, so we need to spend money fixing up our schools." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"School choice creams the public schools of their best students, and robs them of their much needed funds for educating the needy kids left behind," explains Daniel E. Katz, legal counsel for the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). "Choice also raises the specter of segregation." But as Cleveland's Lydia Harris, principal of one of the nation's best private schools, can attest, this description is inaccurate. In <i>World</i> magazine, she recently said, "There's no cream on my crop until we put it there. It's a myth that we take discipline problems and throw them out of school. It's the other way around. I get the kids the public schools can't handle." And she does all this at a per-pupil cost one-seventh that of Cleveland public schools.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Choice is just a subterfuge for segregation, like it was in the South," says Felmers Chaney, the head of the Milwaukee NAACP, which joined the lawsuit against the initial Milwaukee school-choice plan as lead plaintiff. "Taken as a whole, expanded [school choice] will deny African Americans equal educational opportunity," asserted Chaney in a recent brief against the expanded Milwaukee school-choice plan. To many of its black critics, the NAACP seems more concerned with integration than with quality education for black children. Even so, opponents of vouchers need only examine the work of the late James Coleman, of the University of Chicago, which shows not only that poor black youngsters fare better in religious schools than in public schools, but also that a child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. As for the Milwaukee plan, the NAACP ought to take a look at the high level of integration in Milwaukee private schools in comparison to its public schools.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some critics argue that the education establishment opposes school choice for a very basic reason: self-preservation. "Perhaps one of the strongest reasons why the civil-rights establishment opposes choice is economic," says Brian Jones. "They strongly feel that competition and privatization will leave them out in the cold." Public schools employ a large portion of the African-American professional community; some of them may view school choice and charter schools as programs designed to rob them of tenured jobs. To convince public-school employees that market forces will provide jobs for the best teachers and administrators from these public schools is next to impossible. Of course, as Milwaukee's Zakiya Courtney points, the number of kids in the school system won't shrink. "This won't impact the teachers," she says. "It will only affect the pencil pushers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Will saving jobs justify depriving innocent children of a quality education? To answer this question, these leaders ought to talk to students and their parents, visit the neighborhood private schools these children could go to, and perform a cost-benefit analysis of the savings associated with sending children to these schools. "Once you do this, you can't help but become a believer in school choice," says Messmer's Smith.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	School choice is the civil-rights movement of the 1990s. Says Milwaukee's Polly Williams, "I am one of those people who is supposed to be very stupid because I am black, I live in the inner city, I am poor, and I raised my children in a single parent home. Well, those are lies. The only thing different about us is that we have been deprived of resources and access. When you empower parents like me, there is a major difference. We become responsible for our own lives. . . . We want to be empowered, and that is what the choice program has done."<p>

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>On Monday and Tuesday nights the CBS and NBC evening <a href="#newscasts">newscasts did not run any stories</a>
from their correspondents traveling with Clinton and Dole. ABC didn't on Tuesday either, but Monday night ABC's Brit Hume
actually employed the term "harsh" to Clinton.
<li>The <a href="#fundraising">questionable fundraising sources</a> for the Democrats is getting some network attention. Tuesday night's World News Tonight included a story a  Florida drug dealer invited to a White House dinner.
<li>A CBS reporter says a second Clinton term will bring more <a href="#moderate">"moderate appointments" to the Supreme Court,</a> but he's immediately contradicted in the next soundbite.
<li>PBS's Frontline asks <a href="#press">"Why America Hates the Press."</a> But in one hour a reason left unmentioned: liberal bias.
<li>CNN's <a href="#rook">Susan Rook</a> cites Bob Dole's divorce as proof his word is not his bond.
</ol>
<a name="newscasts">
<hr>
1) Monday night CBS and NBC covered the day's campaigning with 
their anchors giving brief reports. NBC Nightly News ran a lengthy piece 
from Andrea Mitchell on the Indonesian money trail.
<P>
On the October 21 World News Tonight, Brit Hume reported President 
Clinton's reaction to the fundraising scandals. Hume offered a unique use 
of the term "harsh," applying it to Clinton instead of Dole:
<P>
<DD>"President Clinton though stayed as far above the fracas as possible. 
He personally said not a word about it as he campaigned in Ohio and Michigan
today. But his campaign thought enough of the matter to send out a spokesman 
to denounce Bob Dole on it in the harshest terms."
<BR>
<DD>Joe Lockhart, Clinton-Gore Press Secretary: "You know Bob Dole talking 
about campaign finance reform is like Dr. Jack Kevorkian talking about the 
sanctity of life. It doesn't work. He has no credibility."
<P>
<a name="fundraising">
<hr>
2) On Tuesday's World News Tonight (October 22) Brian Ross explored a 
convicted drug dealer who got a White House dinner for his $20,000.
<P>
<DD>Brian Ross: "At the very time twice convicted Jorge Cabrera was setting 
up his latest cocaine smuggling deal last December in the Florida Keys, 
Democratic fundraisers were arranging for him to attend a White House dinner 
with President Clinton. All it took was a $20,000 campaign contribution to 
the Democratic Party...."
<BR>
<DD>"A few weeks after the White House dinner federal agents raided Cabrera's 
hideout and seized more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine, leading to Cabrera's 
conviction in July. Still, the Democrats didn't return his money until last 
week when after a  reporter for Newsweek asked about it and the party finally 
checked into Cabrera's background. According to Cabrera's lawyer there are 
pictures of the drug smuggler at the White House and at another dinner here 
in Florida with Vice President Gore. But federal prosecutors demanded all 
copies and negatives of those photos and the Justice Department is refusing 
to make them public."
<P>

<hr>
3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this humorous sequence during a 
story on Monday's This Morning on who Dole and Clinton might appoint to the 
Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Troy Roberts: "Court observers believe a Bob Dole presidency 
would move the court to the right and President Clinton would stick with 
moderate appointments should he win a second term."
<P>
<DD>Clint Bolick, Institute for Justice: "Bill Clinton has tended to appoint 
very well qualified people but people who are quite liberal. I expect that he'll 
continue doing that if he gets a second term and the Republican Senate will have 
no option but to confirm those people." 
<P>
<a name="press">
<hr>
4) In most markets Tuesday night PBS aired an edition of Frontline 
titled "Why America Hates the Press." The show approached the subject from the 
left, using the James Fallows critique as its guide. There was plenty on the 
evils of the McLaughlin Group, celebrity journalism, reporters taking speaking 
fees and how awful it was for the Washington Post to put on the front page a 
story about Bob Woodward's new book.
<P>
One theme that was absent: Any consideration of how liberal bias might be 
turning people off. Just take a look at this list of those featured in the PBS 
show, as listed in the Washington Post's TV Week on Sunday:
<P>
"Michael Kelly, editor of the New Republic; the New York Times's R.W. 'Johnny' 
Apple; James Fallows of U.S. News & World report; Tom Brokaw and Andrea Mitchell 
of NBC News; Tim Russert, host of NBC's Meet the Press; McLaughlin Group panelists 
Jack Germond of the Balitimore Sun, Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune; 
Howard Kurtz, Bob Woodward and David Broder of The Washington Post; Paul Taylor, 
a former Post reporter; and National Public Radio's Elizabeth Arnold and

5) CNN's Susan Rook took a nice little pot shot at Bob Dole last week. 
In his Media Notes column on October 21, The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz relayed 
an exchange from CNN's TalkBack Live (3-4pm ET), though he didn't provide a show date. 
<P>
After the RNC's Ed Gillespie asserted that for Bob Dole "his word is his bond," 
Rook shot back: "Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when 
he said, 'Until death do us part?'" Kurtz noted that after an audience member called 
it a cheap shot, Rook agreed: "Mea culpa. My apologies to Bob and Elizabeth Dole."

Executive Memorandum 465<br>
October 23, 1996<br><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	On October 17, President Boris Yeltsin fired National Security Aide and Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed, denouncing him for "acting without proper authority" and committing "errors intolerable to Russia." Yeltsin's allies went even further: Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin charged the controversial general with "Bonapartism," while Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov accused him of plotting a coup.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed's dismissal was the culmination of a long and complicated series of maneuvers initiated by Chernomyrdin and Presidential Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais. With Yeltsin clearly ill and in his last term, all of the politicians around him, including Lebed, have been engaged in a power struggle that is likely to continue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed, an outspoken retired paratroop lieutenant general, emerged as a serious contender for the presidency by finishing third in the first round of presidential elections held on June 16, 1996. The 11 million votes cast in his favor earned him much acclaim -- and numerous enemies in the Kremlin. In the second round of elections, held on July 3, Lebed grudgingly endorsed Yeltsin (and thereby insured his victory) in exchange for being nominated as National Security Aide to the President and Security Council Secretary.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	An extremely ambitious man, Lebed refused to have his authority confined to a merely advisory role on the Security Council. Even before taking office, he succeeded in engineering the dismissal of his rival and former boss, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Lebed then proceeded to meddle in economic affairs, an area normally regarded as the Prime Minister's territory. He also began advocating a new anti-corruption campaign which, had it been implemented, would have been ruinous for the many highly placed Russian officials who often are accused of corruption in the media.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed succeeded in pushing for a swift settlement in Chechnya, which made him the most popular Russian politician. At the same time, however, he challenged the vested interests of extremely influential forces in Russia. Interior Minister Kulikov became his archrival after Lebed demanded his dismissal as the main culprit in the Chechnya fiasco. Virtually the entire upper echelon of power quickly united against Lebed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to senior government officials, the anti-Lebed coalition came to include communists and nationalists. Lebed contributed to the growing sentiment against him by coming out with a series of wild accusations against his own prot‚g‚, the popular Defense Minister General Igor Rodionov. He also made the mistake of allying himself with the extremely unpopular General Alexander Korzhakov, Yeltsin's former chief bodyguard. This move infuriated both President Yeltsin and the Russian media.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When Lebed finally was ousted, the main charge against him was that he was preparing a coup. This accusation appears to be false. Unlike Chernomyrdin and Chubais, Lebed has neither a nationwide organization nor a strong bureaucratic structure standing behind him. His actions may have been aimed at improving his standing by creating a powerful support structure of his own. He openly proposed creating regional branches for the Security Council, for example, as well as a paramilitary "Russian Legion" to combat organized crime and ethnic violence. According to Kulikov, documents distributed by Lebed indicated that this Legion was supposed to "detain and liquidate leaders of political groups and movements" which threatened national security or the integrity of the Russian state. However, such an apparatus would have taken months to establish.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Had Lebed really planned a mutiny with the aid of his Legion, it is highly unlikely that he would have shared his plans in advance with the Defense and Interior Ministers or sought their consent. However, his proposal was a useful blunder in the hands of his rivals. Kulikov was the one to articulate the charges--with Chernomyrdin's or possibly Yeltsin's approval. Getting Lebed out of the way apparently was a matter of personal survival for Kulikov, since Lebed's people reportedly have accumulated evidence of his involvement in massive fraud and embezzlement in Chechnya.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed still has high hopes for the future. Despite his dismissal, his popularity continues to be high. He is credited with stopping the war in Chechnya, which claimed 100,000 lives. If hostilities resume because of pressure from Kulikov and his allies, Lebed's rating will skyrocket.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Russian public has always favored the political underdog. This helped Boris Yeltsin in the late 1980s, and it is helping Lebed now. Should Yeltsin retire or pass away in the near future, new presidential elections will be called. If this scenario develops, Lebed will have a good chance of succeeding Yeltsin if he can muster enough financial and media support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed's chief opponent for the presidency would be Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Unlike Lebed, Chernomyrdin lacks charisma; but he does command huge organizational and financial resources as well as the loyalty of local political elites. Chernomyrdin could establish a broad anti-Lebed coalition. The Prime Minister also would be in a position to encourage media efforts to discredit Lebed. But it is too early to tell whether these measures would be sufficient to prevent Lebed from ascending to power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	If Yeltsin remains in power for at least two more years, Lebed's chances of winning the presidency will diminish. Much would depend upon his ability to establish a nationwide political movement and secure the support of local elites and business interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite the turmoil surrounding Lebed's dismissal, Russia does not appear to be heading for civil war. The army is politically passive, and its support for Lebed is neither total nor unconditional. Lebed tried to boost his popularity in the armed forces by supporting the disappointed paratroopers against a Defense Ministry decision to cut airborne forces. However, the top brass moved quickly to instill discipline. General Kazantsev, Deputy Commander of the Airborne Troops, was fired for publicly opposing the force reduction and siding with Lebed. Lebed appears to realize that any appeal to the army to rise in mutiny would only provoke bloodshed and ruin his chances of achieving his ambitious political goals peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Nevertheless, Lebed's dismissal could have a dramatic impact on Russia's domestic and foreign policies. Most important, the peace he worked to secure in Chechnya could be disavowed, causing disaster for Russians and Chechens alike. Lebed's more reasonable approach to NATO expansion and NATO-Russia cooperation also could be renounced. In the economic arena, Chernomyrdin's government will feel more comfortable and confident without Lebed, whose constant support of a larger military budget and subsidies for the military-industrial complex was a thorn in the Prime Minister's side.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	A populist politician, Lebed could initiate a campaign focused on saving the peace in Chechnya and denouncing government corruption. Such an onslaught would mobilize many of his supporters. It is therefore possible that the government might move preemptively against him -- for example, by stepping up the orchestrated media campaign against him, or even by bringing criminal charges.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	During his short time in office, Lebed made many controversial statements on domestic and foreign policy. He has shown himself to be both unpredictable and anything but a team player. His departure leaves the Yeltsin administration more united and consolidated, and thus more predictable for the U.S. -- at least in the short run. To this extent, Lebed's firing could be good news for American policy. However, not everything Lebed stood for was inimical to U.S. interests and values. In dealing with the Kremlin, the Clinton Administration and the West should insist that the best features of Lebed's legacy -- cooperation with NATO, the fight against crime and corruption, and the end of hostilities in Chechnya -- be continued even after his dismissal.

<H3>Four items today:</H3>
<p><br>
<ol>
<li><a href="#vargas">On Good Morning America, Elizabeth Vargas</a> asked Jack Kemp
about Bob Dole's hypocrisy in opposing Whitewater pardons after
having supported the pardoning of Casper Weinberger. But Vargas
and others in the media have ignored some key differences.
<li><a href="#shaw">To CNN's Bernard Shaw, raising ethics isn't a valid concern</a>
worthy of discussion. It's either an "attack" or an "insult."
<li><a href="#cbs">The co-host of CBS This Morning, however, offered</a> a
contrarian view Thursday. He suggested that the media are wrong
to consider negative campaigning off limits. 
<li><a href="#nq">The text of the October 21 edition of <I>Notable Quotables</I></a>,
jammed with the most biased quotes of the past two weeks,
including many examples of reporters calling Dole mean and
nasty.
</ol><br>
<a name=vargas>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> MRC analyst Gene Eliasen caught a couple of interesting questions posed during Thursday's Good Morning America. Interviewing Jack Kemp and Leon Panetta, Elizabeth Vargas asked Kemp: 
<blockquote>"Senator Dole had pledged to keep this campaign on a
positive note. You, in your debate said yourself that negative
attacks are, quote, 'beneath Bob Dole.' Why then the decision to
launch specific, some would say negative, attacks last night?"
<br>
    Her next question: "Mr. Kemp, you do know that Senator Dole
also fought to get a pardon for Casper Weinberger several years
ago. It would seem that many, in the eyes of some, it's a bit
hypocritical to criticize the President for, for possibly
considering pardons this year."
</blockquote>
Like other reporters over the past couple of days who have
highlighted the Dole pardon hypocrisy theme, Vargas failed to
note some key differences between Weinberger and Whitewater.
Former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh raised the issue
Tuesday. But the October 16 <I>USA Today</I> noted that Walsh claimed
that Dole had "urged pardons for crimes of constitutional
dimension." Whitewater crimes hardly raise constitutional
balance of power issues. There is a difference between a
President pardoning business associates who committed crimes to
make money for themselves and a cabinet member indicted for
carrying out policies while in office.
<p>
<a name="shaw">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> After Wednesday night's debate, MRC analyst Clay Waters
noticed, CNN's Bernard Shaw concluded the post-debate analysis 
by posing this question to the audience: "I only leave you with 
this question: Is a question about character and ethics a quote 
'insult,' or an 'attack'?"
<p>
<a name="cbs">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> On the bright side, the media's attitude that anything
negative or critical said of Clinton is "nasty" or "harsh," was
noted by the co-host of CBS This Morning. Thursday morning
(October 17) Jose Diaz-Balart asked CBS analyst Kevin Phillips: 
<blockquote>
"It seems like everywhere else in the world, where there is
a democracy, people are allowed to talk about the other
candidate's failures as a politician. Here, it seems, that many
in the media call that name calling and personal attacks. Are we
in the media making too much of pointing out what seemed to be
just inconsistencies in a candidate?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Good morning, everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego." -- Matt Lauer
leading off his October 16 Today newscast.
<p>
"Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing for a kind of
carpet bombing on character?" -- Dan Rather to Rita Braver on
what the White House faced from Bob Dole in that night's debate,
Oct. 16 Evening News.
<p>
"Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter,
or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his
contest with Bill Clinton?" -- Bernard Shaw on the "Bozo"
comment, October 8 Inside Politics.
<p>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in the
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for
a Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures,
in the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" --
Katie Couric to Elizabeth Dole, October 8 Today.
<p>
"Let me just turn to the presidential campaign very quickly. As
you've heard, Tim, it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp
yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to
answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically
capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange.
Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
-- Katie Couric to Tim Russert, Oct. 9 Today.
<p>
"In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob
Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical,
that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from
questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." -- NBC
reporter David Bloom, October 14 Nightly News.
<p>
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night." -- CBS This
Morning co-host Mark McEwen to Fred Barnes the morning after
the first debate, Oct. 7.
</blockquote>
<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Phil Jones: CBS Hatchet Man</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"He's got to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15
percent tax cut, can be paid for without draconian cuts in
social programs. He wants to talk about the character issue, but
he can't get personal or look mean-spirited doing it." -- Phil
Jones on what Dole needed to do in the upcoming debate, October
4 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"I think that if I had to say probably where he was the weakest
and where he really needed to score was, he needed to explain to
the American people how this country can afford that 15 percent
tax cut, the centerpiece of his campaign, without these
draconian cuts. I don't think he has done that yet." -- Reporter
Phil Jones on CBS after the October 6 debate.
<p>
"It's a tough speech for him to make because he runs the risk of
looking desperate and mean-spirited." -- Phil Jones on Dole
raising Clinton's "public ethics," October 15 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole because of
the debate format. The candidates will be facing voters who are
asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole has never been
able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he got back in his
1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing he needs
tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the questioners
who thinks he's being too mean." -- Phil Jones, October 16 CBS
Evening News.
</blockquote>
<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Characterwise, It's Clinton Over Reagan</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"In the first two years this is a man [Clinton] who tried his
best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight for
gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
-- Bryant Gumbel to David Maraniss, MSNBC's InterNight, October
10.
<p>
"Lou, I know you feel as if Reagan had few, if any, character
flaws. But let me ask you this. When one sidesteps, or refuses
to acknowledge the consequences of their policies or actions,
why shouldn't that be viewed as a character flaw? Or when one
lies. For example, let me roll a clip and then we'll come back.
This one deals with Iran-Contra." -- Gumbel to Washington Post
reporter Lou Cannon, same show.
<p>
"While he appeared to be empathetic, his policies caused
enormous suffering for those who were least able to afford it?"
-- Gumbel to Cannon in discussion about Ronald Reagan, same
show.
<p>
"Elections, like actions, have consequences. Sometimes it's hard
to know what they might be. Did Americans know that electing
Ronald Reagan would send the deficit through the roof? Do we
know that electing Bob Dole would lessen drug use?" -- CNN
reporter Bruce Morton on Late Edition, September 29.

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Hateful Hunt Hates Conservatives, Loves Liberals</b></FONT></CENTER>

"I think North Carolina is a test in the great divide in the
Republican conservative movement. There's the politics of hope
personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms." -- Wall Street Journal Executive
Washington Editor Al Hunt, October 5 Capital Gang on CNN.
<p>
"Kenneth Starr, the supposedly non-partisan independent counsel
investigating the Clintons, was the featured speaker yesterday
at a luncheon sponsored by right wing hatemonger Pat Robertson
[who runs the] Christian Broadcasting Network and Regent Law
School. By pandering to Clinton-haters, Mr. Starr appears to be
abandoning all pretenses of impartiality. He went into this job
with a reputation as a fair-minded conservative. He now looks
more like a political hit man desperately eager for a future
Supreme Court appointment." -- Al Hunt's Outrage of the Week,
October 5 Capital Gang.
<p>
"Whatever you thought of Jimmy Carter as President, he has been
a great ex-President, helping to avoid bloodshed from North
Korea to Haiti, bringing health care to children in Africa and
Latin America. Even Bob Novak has lauded some of these efforts.
The outrage? The Nobel Peace prize for years has given President
Carter the back of its hand. It can make amends next week and
give him what he deserves: the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize." -- Al
Hunt, September 28 Capital Gang.

you may hear a lot about this weekend. It purports to show a
connection between women who have had abortions and the risk of
developing breast cancer. And if you see it around, remember
this. It is not original research, but an analysis of 23 earlier
studies. And the National Cancer Institute says those individual
studies were actually inconclusive, and because of that, various
other scientists say today the Penn State report is flawed." --

I'm standing there with one of our younger producers at MSNBC.
She's 24 or something and I said `What do you think?' She said,
`You know, he scares me.' And I said, `What do you mean he
scares you?' She said `It doesn't matter what he's trying to

<title>LIUNA, Organized Crime, and the Clinton Administration - Heritage</title>

<h3>LIUNA, ORGANIZED CRIME, AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</h3>
<b>A Government Reform Project Study</b>
<p>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a><br> 
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 281<br>
October 20, 1996<br>
<p></center>
<font size="-1">(Updating <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip10.html"><i>Government Integrity Project Report</i> No. 10</a>, "Organized Crime, Organized Labor, and Corruption of the Federal Grants Process," July 31, 1996.)</font>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a February 1995 consent decree, the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) admitted that several of its locals and affiliates operated under the influence of organized crime. Over the past two decades, at least 80 officials of LIUNA and its affiliates have been convicted of various organized crime-related activities, including bribery, embezzlement, interstate transportation of stolen merchandise, and attempted murder. Notwithstanding this record, the Justice Department under the Clinton Administration has allowed LIUNA's leadership to remain largely in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In hearings this summer, Congress raised questions about whether the Justice Department's treatment of LIUNA was influenced by the union's political ties to the Clinton Administration.<sup>1</sup>  After the Justice Department investigation was disclosed publicly, LIUNA significantly increased its political activity. Despite its relatively modest size, it became the largest union contributor of "soft money" to the Democratic Party, as well as the fourth-largest political action committee (PAC) contributor among all of the nation's labor unions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the first two full fiscal years under the Clinton Administration, LIUNA received nearly $30 million in federal grants. Many of these grants were awarded to LIUNA's education and training programs, a special focus of criminal investigations of the union. Congress should direct the General Accounting Office to investigate whether taxpayer funds were abused and whether government grantmakers were ignorant of, or simply chose to ignore, evidence of LIUNA's abuse of education and training funds.
<p>
<b>LIUNA's Record of Partisan Politics</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Around the time the Justice Department investigation of LIUNA became public knowledge in October 1993, the union dramatically increased its involvement in partisan politics. During the first ten months of 1993, it gave $50,600 in "soft money" donations to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Between January and September 1996, it gave $460,000 to the DNC, making it the top soft money donor among labor unions. Although LIUNA has only one-third the membership of the National Education Association, its soft-money donations exceed the NEA's by 50 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA's political action committee, the Laborers' Political League (LPL), has grown in influence over the same time period. The 16th-largest labor PAC in 1993-1994, the LPL has become the 4th-biggest in the 1995-1996 election cycle. Since 1993, it has donated over $2.1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA General President Arthur Coia also has become a leading fund-raiser for the Democratic Party. He served as co-host for a 1994 fund-raiser that brought more than $3.5 million into DNC coffers and as Vice Chairman of a May 1996 event that raised more than $12 million for the DNC. These efforts and others earned Coia the privilege of frequent access to the White House. He also has traveled with the President on numerous occasions, even accompanying him to greet the Pope in Denver.
<p>
<b>Cash-Back Bonus: Nearly $30 Million in Federal Grants in FY 1994 and 1995</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During 1994 and 1995, the first two full fiscal years of the Clinton Administration, LIUNA's largesse to the Democratic Party was reciprocated more than tenfold in the form of nearly $30 million in grants from the federal government. Such federal subsidies are especially significant to the financially strapped union, which last year ran an operating deficit of $11.8 million.3
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As detailed in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip10.html"><i>GIP Report</i> No. 10</a>, four federal agencies -- the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Department of Labor (DOL) -- awarded 38 grants totaling $11,376,000 to LIUNA and its affiliates in FY 1994 alone. Moreover, in April 1995, just two months after it signed the consent decree publicly acknowledging the influence of organized crime in its ranks, the union received a $3.5 million training and education grant from HUD.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now The Heritage Foundation has obtained copies of numerous FY 1995 grants to LIUNA and its affiliates. During FY 1995, in addition to the $3.5 million HUD grant, LIUNA and its affiliates benefited from 12 grants totaling $14,832,000 from six federal agencies: DOL, EPA, HUD, HHS, the Department of Education, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (see <a href="#app">Appendix</a>). The majority of these grants were awarded after the February 1995 LIUNA-Department of Justice consent decree had been signed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most significant among the FY 1995 grants was $9.3 million from the National Institutes of Health's Superfund Worker Training Program, awarded on September 15, 1995. This grant, nearly six times the program's average grant of $1.59 million, amounted to more than one-third of the Superfund Worker Training Program's entire $30.3 million 1995 grant budget.
<p>
<b>LIUNA's Record of Training Fund Abuses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bulk of these 1994 and 1995 federal grants to LIUNA funded education and training programs, where much of the criminal activity in the union took place. The November 1994 complaint against LIUNA, drafted by the Department of Justice but never filed in court, alleged that "in or about 1986 to on or about July 31, 1994," LIUNA officials -- including Coia -- sought to "defraud training and education funds of various upstate locals" in New York, employing "actual and threatened force" to "induce the locals to surrender control of these funds."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Department of Labor's Inspector General recently hailed the conviction of one LIUNA official for conspiracy to steal union training funds.4  But despite this conviction and other government allegations, federal grants continue to flow to a group that admittedly has been infiltrated by organized crime.
<p>
<b>GAO Should Investigate LIUNA's Federal Grants</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should call upon its investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, to examine the process by which federal officials awarded such major grants to LIUNA. The GAO investigation should attempt to determine whether any of the training and education grants awarded to LIUNA and its affiliates were connected in any way to the allegations, prosecutions, or convictions against LIUNA officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA officials have been both charged with and convicted of abusing training and education funds. The federal government provided tens of millions of dollars in training and education grants to the union. Even minimal concern about taxpayer funds would more than justify an inquiry as to whether known abuses involved the use of federal grants.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO also should try to ascertain whether federal grantmakers adequately monitored the receipt and use of taxpayer funds by union officials. Relevant grantmakers at agencies that have supported LIUNA should be asked about their knowledge of allegations of criminal infiltration of LIUNA and their agencies' efforts to prevent such wrongdoing in the future. Moreover, the GAO should begin an immediate review of FY 1996 and FY 1997 grants to LIUNA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House Judiciary Committee has yet to conclude its investigation of whether LIUNA's political ties allowed it to escape harsh legal sanction from the Justice Department. It seems clear, however, that LIUNA General President Arthur Coia used his ties to the White House to seek federal grant dollars. According to an article in the May 1996 <i>Washington Monthly</i>, Coia personally lobbied the President for grant money at a fall 1994 Oval Office meeting, and the President informed Coia that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes would handle such matters.<sup>5</sup>  (Before joining the Clinton Administration, Ickes practiced labor law; LIUNA was one of his clients.<sup>6</sup>) Normally, federal grants are issued directly by agencies without White House intervention. Although White House intervention in the grants process may not be illegal, it is unusual enough to merit further GAO examination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to examining the specifics of the LIUNA case, the GAO should recommend guidelines to help federal agencies determine how to respond properly to grant requests from organizations operating under substantial allegations of criminal wrongdoing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are focusing on a topic which
once was taboo but now is a regular part of many television
sitcoms.  It's a hot point of controversy between people who
believe there are reliable standards of right and wrong and
those who believe anything goes.

<p>

The topic is homosexuality, but the story tellers 
will not be policy experts or politicians.  You'll hear from 
former homosexuals about their life experiences.

<p>

With the AIDS quilt celebration just last week, 
many people were talking about coming out as a homosexual.
But have you ever heard of National Coming OUT OF 
Homosexuality Day?  Begun by Michael Johnston, the day is 
part of a vision of many people who have suffered because 
they believed the message, once gay, always gay.  Michael's 
perspective is especially poignant because he is slowly
dying of AIDS.

<p>

This is an important show, because it not only 
provides a viewpoint of homosexuality that other networks 
have virtually ignored; it contains vital information for 
parents struggling to understand their gay children and 
striving to find a way to talk about these tough issues.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council.  Election day is quickly 
approaching, and the candidates continue to square off on 
issue after issue. Tonight the last Presidential debate of 
this cycle will occur, and Gary discusses possible outcomes. 
Let's hear what he has to say about the race to November 5 
as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: My pleasure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been a lot of talk about 
how these issues need to be run in the campaign.  We've seen 
a lot of economic issues.  But it seems that the social 
issues that created great coalitions are missing in action.
What's your perspective?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think economics are important, and, 
you know, incomes have been stagnating.  We haven't had the 
job growth we should have, and those things should be 
discussed.

<p>

But I have to admit, I am furious that some of the 
most profound things facing the country -- issues about 
life, about the family, about values -- that these things 
seem to be ignored by both of the major candidates and the 
campaigns this year, and I think the American people are 
losing out.  I think we deserve a more electrifying, 
enlightening debate on some of the things that define who we 
are as Americans.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It has been interesting if you look 
at the polling data, Gary, that people are saying they are 
not going to vote.  There is a tremendous lack of voter 
interest.  In fact, we are looking at possible record lows 
in participation. What do you think will capture voter 
interest?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I sure see a link between the 
lack of voter interest and the fact that there has not been 
any passion in this campaign.  And you're right; there's a 
really clear trend line here.  People didn't watch the 
conventions at the same level that they've watched 
conventions in the past.

<p>

Apparently, the first debate, the viewer audience 
was off at least 20 percent. I don't have any reason to 
believe that the debate tonight or the one later in the week 
is going to have any bigger audience.

<p>

So the American people seem to be tuning out, and 
that's strange.  I don't think they would be tuning out if 
they thought there were really profound questions on the 
table being settled.  So it's something that I think both 
parties ought to be worried about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think would capture the 
attention of the American voter?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think excitement captures 
their attention.  I think they want to see, even though the 
voters seem to say that they don't like negative 
campaigning, nonetheless, I think they do want passion.  
They want one candidate to say, Look, your vision for 
America is wrong.  You've done this, this, this, and this.  
Here's what I want to do.  Here's what I believe about the 
American family.  Here's how I can make our streets safer, 
our schools work, protect the handicapped, our unborn 
children, and so forth.

<p>

I think if you could get a discussion on those 
things, the American people would tune out from some of the 
other stations they're watching, the sports events and so 
forth, and tune in to a very important debate about the kind 
of country we are.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In terms of campaign themes, Bob 
Dole seems to have two:  I'm going to cut your taxes and 
Bill Clinton is a liberal.  But "liberal" seems a little 
undefined.  How can we clarify what that means?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, both those themes are good 
themes from Bob Dole's standpoint.  Here's his problem.  On 
the tax cut theme, he is urging a tax cut after two 
betrayals that the American people have experienced.  First 
they watched George Bush say, "Read my lips," and they 
watched that promise go down the drain.  And then fresh in 
their minds is the fact that Bill Clinton promised a middle-class 
tax cut four years ago, and once again, we got a tax increase.

<p>

So you can't be angry at Americans for listening 
to Bob Dole and saying to themselves, "Oh, yeah, here's 
another guy who says he's going to cut our taxes; I don't 
believe it."  So there's a credibility problem there.

<p>

Quite frankly, if I were Bob Dole, I would say, 
"Look, elect me President, give me a Republican Congress, 
and if I don't lower your taxes in one year, I'll resign."
That would deal with the credibility issue, and that would 
get the attention of the American people.

<p>

On the other issue of accusing Clinton of being a 
liberal, he is a liberal.  Unfortunately, Bob Dole is 
leaving out half the issues that define his liberalism.  He 
is not reminding them of the five executive orders that 
Clinton signed on abortion the first day he was in office.
I mean, here's a President that says he's basically a 
moderate in this issue; he's an extremist on that issue.

<p>

It was really the cultural and social issues that 
Republicans used in the past to label Democratic candidates 
as being liberal or extreme, and at least as of now, the 
Republican campaign has not done that this year, and I think 
as a result, they are not getting the so-called Reagan 
Democrats to vote for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that was very interesting, 
Gary, during the debate was when Bob Dole turns to Bill 
Clinton and says that he had promised not to bring up 
Whitewater. It seems a strange thing to make a promise 
about. Did you find that odd?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yeah, gee, when did that happen?  I 
mean, when did they have that private meeting where Bob Dole 
agreed to take off of the table one of the biggest 
vulnerabilities that Bill Clinton has?  I was astonished.  I 
was shocked by it.  I was also surprised that the media 
didn't pick up on it.  It seems to me that in that one 
little exchange, Bob Dole told us about something that no 
one knew about before, that there had been some sort of a 
conversation between him and the President where he agreed 
to let the President off the hook.

<p>

Now, I am interested in what the President did in 
exchange for that. It couldn't be not to label Dole as an 
extremist. The Clinton campaign does that all the time.  It 
couldn't be to no longer make older people fearful because 
Bob Dole is going to take away their Medicare.  Bill Clinton 
does that all the time.  So what did Bob Dole get for this 
promise not to bring up the greatest vulnerability that Bill 
Clinton has?  I'm afraid he didn't get anything, and as a 
result, we are all losing as a result of that for not 
hearing that issue being debated.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Another issue which came up during 
the debates was the issue of whether or not Bill Clinton 
will do a Presidential pardon for friends, former business 
partners, and possibly people who joined with him, 
allegedly, in criminal activity.  This is all being 
determined. The President has absolute power to pardon 
anyone he wants and seems to be dangling this over the heads 
of former friends.

<p>

The pardon issue has a lot of power, potentially.
What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I don't know what to make of it.  It 
was clear when the question was raised that Bill Clinton 
refused to eliminate the possibility of pardons.  We may 
have a Presidential first here, because some of the pardons 
we're talking about could extend to family members of the 
President.

<p>

So again, this is an important issue.  If I were 
Bob Dole, I would be hitting the President every day on 
this:  Will you promise the American people to not use your 
Presidential powers to thwart justice, to thwart the logical 
outcome of the cases that are pending in the Whitewater 
investigation?  I think it is a mistake to not press the 
President on that issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Last question for you, Gary.  Where 
do the campaigns go from here?  It's clear that, so far for 
voters, it has been a very lackluster exchange.  What can 
they do to change that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, there are only a 
couple of times in a campaign where a candidate gets the 
chance to let the American people see him or her without the 
filter of the media.  One is your acceptance speech at the 
convention. The other is these debates.  There is only one 
more Presidential debate left.  This one is going to be a 
town hall forum, where Bill Clinton tends to shine.

<p>

I would hope that Bob Dole, in that last 
opportunity before the American people, will without 
hesitation define Bill Clinton as a liberal across the board 
on economic issues, on the size of government, on how 
high taxes should be, and on the important social issues.
If he does that, we are going to have a much closer election 
than anybody thinks.  If he doesn't do it, then I am afraid 
Bill Clinton is going to have four more years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll 
introduce you to a man who is dying of AIDS; yet he brings a 
story of hope to those struggling in a homosexual lifestyle. 
You will not want to miss his story and the amazing stories 
of others who have come out of homosexuality.  Please stay 
tuned.

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, held October 
11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Today and today's observance is 
critical for this country.  It is critical for the youth of 
our country, and it is critical for the moral foundations of 
our society.

<p>

For 10 years we have been experiencing an 
onslaught of deception and lies coming from organizations 
like National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights 
Campaign, PFLAG, which is Parents and Friends of Lesbians 
and Gays -- which they're not, by the way -- and other 
organizations that have no hesitancy to absolutely lie about 
the information they put out and are drenching in hypocrisy.

<p>

One of the most intolerant groups in this country 
are homosexual activists.  They tolerate only those who want 
to accept and approve and promote homosexuality.

<p>

We have a little bit different message today.
It's not really political; it is a message of hope and a 
message of warning -- a message of warning to the American 
public and to our young people that involvement in 
homosexuality can kill you.  It can kill you emotionally, it 
can kill you physically, and it can certainly kill you 
spiritually.

<p>

The consequences of homosexuality, I think, are 
best shown by the event going on behind us today:  the AIDS 
quilt.  We are here today, and as an individual with AIDS, I 
grieve for those looking at the AIDS quilt today, 
homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, family members, wives, 
brothers and sisters.  But what I really grieve as well is 
that there is an effort in this country to promote a 
behavior that is responsible for a huge percentage of those 
panels on that quilt today.

<p>

How is a country that has any morality left, how 
can it possibly promote to our young people a behavior that 
causes so much tragedy, so much pain, and so much death?

<p>

[Conclusion of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Michael, you have been involved for 
many years reaching out to homosexuals and working with 
former homosexuals.  What gave you the courage and the 
interest to reach out to them?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Well, the passion really came from 
my own experience and struggle with homosexuality.  I was 
introduced to homosexuality by a peer friend of mine, 
actually about a year older, (who) asked me if I wanted to 
go to a disco one night.  Like most young people, I was 
looking for a place to fit in, a sense of acceptance from 
others.  I had been fairly shy all my life, and so this 
opportunity to fit in with the "in" crowd was something that 
I was excited about.  So without even thinking about it, I 
said, "Sure, I'll go."

<p>

That night, however, he placed his hand on my leg 
and he said, "It's a gay bar.  Do you mind?"  Well, I didn't 
think twice about it.  I wish I had.  It was one of the 
worst decisions I made in my life, and I ended up going into 
a homosexual disco that night, and from a human experience, 
it was probably one of the most exciting experiences I had 
had up to that point in my life.  The lights were blaring, 
the music was playing, there was a lot of camaraderie and 
closeness going on, and I liked that.  And that night he 
first introduced me to my first homosexual experience, and I 
remained in the homosexual community for just under 13 years 
and even remained in it for two years after I tested 
positive for HIV back in 1986.

<p>

My relationship and my experience coming out of 
homosexuality has less to do with homosexuality than it does 
about my personal faith in Jesus Christ and my relationship 
with Him.  And so my passion is, as I sit here dying slowly 
from AIDS, I don't want to see the young people in this 
country go through what I have gone through.

<p>

When I came out of homosexuality, I thought I was 
the only person this had ever happened to.  I want young 
people to know that there are others who have struggled with 
it. There are others out there that are willing to help 
them, and not just young people but men and women, some of 
them who have been in the homosexual subculture for many, 
many years, that there is hope for them, that their lives 
don't have to be full of despair.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things, though, that 
people talk about with homosexuality is that once gay, 
always gay.  Did you receive that message while you were in 
the community?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Sure. Now, of course, as I was 
growing up in this country, there was still a sense of shame 
associated with homosexual behavior.  To a large extent, 
that shame has dropped in this culture.  We have done away 
with a lot of our sodomy laws, and today it is fashionable, 
particularly if you look at the young people graduating from 
high school, they are coming out of high school believing 
that homosexuality is just something cool, just something 
you can experiment with.  It's a life-changing decision, and 
it very often can lead to an individual's death.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: From your own experience, did you 
feel once gay, always gay, was accurate?  Did you feel 
trapped in your lifestyle?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: I went back and forth. I did do 
some reading as I was struggling with this.  I, of course, 
as a Christian, knew deep in my soul that something was 
wrong.  I didn't know why God didn't seem to be changing me. 
I didn't know what to do about it.

<p>

As I grew up as young Christian, in my family, we 
didn't use the Word of God as a basis for truth.  We must 
have some objective truth in our lives, as a country and as 
individuals.  Otherwise, we end up with moral anarchy.
Well, that was what was happening in my heart, was personal 
moral anarchy.  I had no basis on which to make my life 
decisions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Michael, you are the national 
chairman of National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, which 
you designed to coincide with the AIDS quilt and with 
National Coming Out Day, which is very popular with 
homosexual activists, and they encourage people to come out 
and say to the world, "Yes, I am gay."

<p>

Do you think that is a good idea to affiliate 
yourself with that message?  Is coming out as a homosexual 
something people should do?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: You mean as an individual, for them to come out?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: You know, really, when you think 
about it -- let me just be blunt here -- when an individual 
"comes out" and proclaims their homosexuality, really, what 
they are doing is standing up and saying, "I'm a sexual 
deviant, and I'm proud of it."  That's what we're really 
talking about.  Homosexuality, up until the last decade, I 
would say, was still considered to be deviant human 
behavior, certainly because of religious reasons but also 
because of the consequences of the behavior itself.  It's a 
terribly tragic medical consequence of those who involve 
themselves in it.

<p>

The tragedy, though, I think is most keen when we 
look at our children.  It is not uncommon for a young person 
who is going through adolescence to struggle with a sense of 
who they are, to struggle with their sexuality.  I think we 
can all remember doing that.  And certainly as homosexuality 
is held out more and more as an option, I think more and 
more children will deal with it.

<p>

But for organizations like PFLAG and the National 
Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Human Rights Campaign, all pro-
homosexual activist groups, to tell a child that if they 
have even ever had a thought in that direction, that they 
ought to come out of the closet, as they say, and proclaim 
their homosexuality, will destroy many of those young 
people's lives.

<p>

<p>

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, held October 11, 
1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. CHRIS JOHNSON: I come to you this morning 
with some very important news -- how detrimental the 
homosexual lifestyle can be.  I come to expose myths that we 
were born this way, that once a homosexual, always a 
homosexual. I come to you as a witness, one who lived in 
this lifestyle for over 10 years of my life.  Actually, it 
became a death style. Slowly I was dying spiritually, 
mentally, and also physically.  I was involved in alcohol 
and drugs so deeply, this was ingrained within me, because 
that was the lifestyle, to constantly stay high, not be 
aware or conscious of actually how hurt one really was in 
this lifestyle.

<p>

There was no fulfillment internally, spiritually. 
It was a constant trying to find satisfaction in another 
male in physical terms.  But that could never satisfy the 
deep need that was on the inside.  It was so much hurt and 
bitterness that I had seen within this lifestyle.  But I 
knew that only God, that only God could actually change me, 
that I could not change myself, for the Word of God says, 
what is impossible with man is possible with God.

<p>

And, yes, it was impossible for me, of my own 
power, to walk out of this lifestyle, and one cannot do it 
within his own power.  But with the power of God, one can 
walk out of this lifestyle.

<p>

Recently, I guess about five years ago, I was 
tested as being HIV positive, also.  At this particular 
time, I thought that my life was over.  But God had still 
given me promises in my life and said that one day I would 
have a wife and have a family.  So I stand now married, 
having two children.  My children are HIV negative as well 
as my wife is HIV negative.

<p>

So I come to give you hope and to bring you truth, 
that just because you may be in the homosexual lifestyle 
today, you do not have to stay in this lifestyle.  God has 
given you a choice that if you believe His Word, you can 
walk out of this lifestyle and you can have a more 
fulfilling life.  Jesus says that He comes that you may have 
life and have it more abundantly.

<p>

I am a witness that it is much more of an abundant 
life that I live today than I could even imagine when I was 
living in the homosexual lifestyle.

<p>

[Conclusion of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What has been the impact so far of 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: I think the first impact, and 
probably the most important in my view, is that it will and 
has already begun to provide a sense of support and 
encouragement to the many men and women who are actively 
struggling to walk away from homosexuality.

<p>

I think, as I mentioned earlier, when it happened 
to me, I thought I was the only one out there.  It really is 
the best-kept secret around, that there's thousands of us 
across the country who have successfully walked away.

<p>

I think, also, it will and already has begun to 
educate the American public that this is not just a 
personality issue; this is a specific behavior with specific 
consequences, and very often detrimental not only to the 
individual involved but to society as a whole.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As an outsider looking in, Michael, 
it seems that there's a lot of hostility directed toward you 
from homosexual activists and even from the media.  Has that 
been your experience?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Yes, and you know why?  I think 
they are afraid of the truth, because if there is something 
spiritually sinful about homosexuality, then many of these 
same individuals must also have some kind of sin in their 
lives, and they don't want to confront that.  No human being 
does.

<p>

We know there is a God. At least we know there is 
a God. The Bible says that He has made Himself known by the 
things that are.  But if we acknowledge too much about God, 
then we have to acknowledge our sinfulness before Him, and 
then we've got to deal with it, and that means going to the 
cross, the cross where Jesus Christ hung, spilled His blood, 
and paid for our sins, all of us, and some folks just don't 
want to deal with that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a man who is dying from AIDS 
today, what hope, Michael, do you have for the people who 
are listening to us?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: The hope is a Person.  His name is 
Jesus Christ.  He is not just a religious figure.  He is the 
Son of God.  He is God Incarnate.  And that is the hope of 
mankind, whether we are talking about homosexuality or all 
of the other evils and wickedness that plague humanity.  He 
is the hope.

<p>

An increased economy is not a hope.  Quite 
frankly, we've got a lot of moral reprobates in the 
Republican and Democratic Party.  I am not looking there for 
hope.  They don't have the answers.  Bill Clinton doesn't 
have the answers.  Quite frankly, I am not sure Bob Dole has 
the answers.

<p>

But God does.  He knows what the problems are.  He 
knows the longing in our heart to be loved.  And the 
wonderful thing about God is He knows me better than I even 
know myself.  He knows the ugly that I haven't even seen 
yet, and I will be frank with you, I have seen a lot of ugly 
in my heart, a lot of darkness.  But He loves me, anyway.  
That is something that homosexual relationships can never 
provide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This year was the second annual 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, and I know you 
worked long and hard on it, Michael.  How can people get 
involved for the third annual Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: They can call us at Kerusso 
Ministries.  Do you have the number?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: All right. It is area code 757 
872-8878, and we're modern, so we have an e-mail address.
If they have e-mail, they can contact us at 
KERUSSOMIN@AOL.COM, and we will be glad to get the
information to them.

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day, held October 11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. BOYER: I am a former lesbian, and I am a 
representative and a board member with Exodus, which is a 
worldwide coalition reaching out to those who desire freedom 
from the gay life.  This is a global movement where 
thousands are walking out of the gay life.

<p>

[End of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jane, how long have you been 
involved in ex-gay ministries?

<p>

MS. BOYER: I have been involved for about eight 
or nine years.  It all began when I attended my first Exodus 
conference in 1989 looking for an answer because I was 
dealing with homosexuality.

<p>

I had heard for a number of years that I was born 
gay and that there was no hope for change, and then I found 
out about Exodus, and so my car was packed and I was heading 
down to my first conference with Exodus in Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So you went to your first conference 
while you were still in the lifestyle just to see what you 
would see.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes. My life was in crisis at that 
time.  I had lived a double life.  I have been a Christian 
now since I was age 5, but about halfway through my 
marriage, I fell into lesbian relationships, and I lived the 
gay life, lived a double life, for about five years.

<p>

Towards the end of that, though, my husband found 
out and I was faced with making some of the most difficult 
decisions that I have ever had to make, and that is, I was 
faced with should I leave my husband, who is a fine 
Christian man but whom I had no desire for at that time, and 
leave my lesbian lover, whom I felt I could not live 
without.  I also had to decide between the gay community, 
which gave me much support and acceptance, and the church, 
which I felt was very cold and detached.

<p>

And so at that time, I hit bottom.  I was very 
depressed and I felt hopeless.  I was in despair, and I even 
contemplated suicide because there just seemed to be no hope 
for change and no hope for my marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of people watching have a 
difficult time understanding how you would get involved with 
a homosexual lifestyle.  How did that transpire for you?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Well, if you were to talk about what 
causes homosexuality, homosexuality is not inborn; 
homosexuality is caused by emotional wounding as a child, 
and the research is very clear about that.  My background 
was very dysfunctional.  I had been abused sexually and 
physically, and I had grown to develop quite a hatred for 
men.  Just line them up against the wall, and I will shoot 
them all and let God sort them out, thank you.

<p>

But God has really changed my heart.  I mean, I 
really love men today.  I love being around them, and I have 
close, healthy relationships with other men, and my husband 
is my best friend.  I mean, God has really healed our 
marriage.  We have been married 18 years now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Wow! So you were struggling with 
kind of a hatred for men, which is very typical of a lesbian 
experience.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes, it is.  In fact, the work that I 
do now, I run a support group.  I am founder and director of 
Amazing Grace in Portland, Maine, which is an affiliate of 
Exodus.  Our purpose is to reach out to those who desire 
freedom from homosexuality and other forms of sexual 
brokenness such as cross-dressing, transsexuality, 
pedophilia, and sex addiction.

<p>

The men and women that are coming to Amazing 
Grace, they are all born-again believers, they are all 
Christians.  We haven't even tapped into the gay community 
at this point in time.  But my point being is that even 
though we are born-again Christians, it doesn't mean that at 
the moment of salvation that all of our hurts just magically 
go away.  So it is a process.  It is a process of healing.

<p>

The women that I work with, I have never known a 
lesbian who has not been hurt and wounded by a man some 
period in her life, whether it be sexual abuse, physical 
abuse, which causes her to shut down in fear towards any 
relationship with a man.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been a lot of media 
attention on the sitcom Ellen and whether that character 
will come out as a lesbian.  One has to wonder whether a 
sitcom is really going to portray the homosexual lifestyle 
accurately, whether we are going to see a very upbeat 
picture.  What is the reality of the homosexual and lesbian 
lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: You know, I have been accused of being 
homophobic and what have you, but in areas that are most 
accepting of homosexuality, such as Hollywood and San 
Francisco and New York, there is the highest percentage of 
suicide, death from chemical dependency, drug addiction, 
alcoholism, and HIV amongst the gay community, and I am 
concerned about that, because I love the homosexual.
Obviously, in those areas that they are receiving the 
greatest acceptance, there is the highest percentage of 
death and despair amongst the gay community.

<p>

So in regard to your question, the show, I am 
sure, will not portray the reality of the gay life. It is 
portrayed as being wonderful and pleasurable and whatever, 
but it is not that way in real life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jane, how difficult was it for you 
to leave the lesbian lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: It was one of the most difficult 
decisions that I have ever had to made.  My decision to 
leave the gay community was not based on what I wanted; it 
was based on what God wanted.  God was very clear to me in 
telling me that I was called to a radical obedience, radical 
to His Word, radical to His will in my life, radical to His 
calling, regardless of how I felt.

<p>

I did not want to leave this woman that I was 
involved with.  I did not want to leave the gay life.  These 
were my gay friends.  These were my whole life.  The gay 
life was my whole life.  The gay community was my social 
life.  That was my identity, and God was telling me to give 
it up.

<p>

I remember wrestling with God and saying, "God, 
but don't you know that this is the best thing I have ever 
known, and don't you know that the environment that I was 
raised, there was not a whole lot of love, not a whole lot 
of acceptance, and this is the best love that I have ever 
known?"  But God was calling me to a radical obedience.

<p>

What happened at that time is that I made the 
decision to leave the gay community but not knowing for sure 
if He could fill the hurts, that emptiness, that longing to 
be loved that I had carried around my whole life, and Jesus 
touched my heart in a way that I had never known, and His 
love began to flow into my heart in those places that were 
empty, and I began to realize that lesbian love is a 
counterfeit, it's a lie, and we are far too easily pleased 
with a counterfeit.  And that is what the gay community -- 
that is the deception, is that when they turn to homosexual 
behavior, when they turn to these gay relationships, it 
doesn't fill.  It gives the illusion of being satisfying.  
But it really doesn't.  It really doesn't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think it is possible for 
someone struggling with their feelings of homosexuality to 
leave that lifestyle without a faith experience?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Absolutely. It entails, though -- it 
is much like coming out of the disease of alcoholism.  I 
also work in the field of chemical dependency, and it 
entails a twofold process.  It involves putting down the 
booze and then working through those issues, the root 
issues, the hurts, the brokenness, the broken relationships, 
the self-hatred, the bitterness.  All of those things need 
to be dealt with in order to deal with the whole concept of 
alcoholism.

<p>

The same thing with homosexuality.  In order to 
come out of homosexuality, you make the commitment, you make 
the decision that you are going to leave this way of life, 
that you are not going to turn to homosexual behavior.  It 
is sin.  And then we allow Jesus to encounter the hurts with 
His love, His grace, and His mercy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You are a counselor now, Jane.  When 
someone comes to you and they are struggling with 
homosexuality, what are their greatest fears?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Their greatest fears are that their 
feelings will never go away.  The other is that, what if God 
never changes me?  What if I never know intimacy with Jesus 
Christ because it has not worked before?  And so part of the 
process there is identifying the blocks that keep Jesus out.

<p>

What happens is that in a dysfunctional 
environment where there may be chemical dependency, there is 
abuse or whatever, a little child will look to the father, 
and the father is like God to this little child.  Dad is 
all-powerful, Dad is all-knowing, Dad is the authoritative 
word.  And so, based on our relationships with our fathers, 
we perceive God.  So if Dad was not the giver of good 
things, then we perceive that God is not the giver of good 
things.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: For someone who is watching this 
show and may be struggling with homosexual feelings or even 
be in the lifestyle, what is the first step toward getting 
free?

<p>

MS. BOYER: To realize that there is hope for 
change. It is a painful process.  It is not an easy 
process. This is not a quick fix.  And it entails 
commitment to Jesus Christ, it entails commitment to His 
Word, and it also entails allowing Him to encounter the 
hurts with His love and His grace.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a lot of attention paid in 
ex-gay ministry to men and to males leaving homosexuality, 
and in fact a lot of the leaders in ex-gay ministry are men. 
Some of the research would indicate that it is actually 
tougher for women to leave the lifestyle, which is why there 
aren't as many women up front.  Would you agree that it is 
harder for women to leave the lesbian lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: It is difficult in the sense that male 
homosexuality often entails sexual addictive-compulsive 
behaviors, where there are one-night encounters, that kind 
of thing.  But with women, it is a whole different thing.  
It is much more an emotional enmeshment that is very, very 
difficult to break, because when two women come together in 
this kind of relationship, you are both broken people in a 
lot of pain, in need to be loved and accepted, a lack of 
identity, a lack of self-worth, and then you come together 
enmeshed, and you see the other person as survival.  You see 
this person as vital to your survival.

<p>

What I do is, when I am talking to two women who 
are involved, I would not initially tell them that they have 
to break off the relationship.  I help them first identify 
the hurts that they are dealing with.  Eventually, as time 
goes on, they begin to let go of the relationship.

<p>

But it is much like grieving the loss of a loved 
one.  There is a process where you grieve, you allow the 
feelings to come up, you get to a point where you accept the 
fact that the person is no longer coming back, or maybe 
through divorce or whatever.  This is much the same way.

<p>

When someone breaks off in a relationship, it is a 
very, very painful process.  And unless you are willing to 
go through this process with them, we need to leave them 
alone and refer them to someone who is willing to go through 
that process with them.

<p>

So it is more than just saying to two women, no 
more contact and you need to cut it off.  It is a process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's the nature of the bond.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Exactly.  It is a very difficult bond 
to break, and it does take time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are international ministries 
that reach out to homosexuals and are a support system for 
homosexuals.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you tell us about them?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Well, Exodus is a worldwide coalition 
of Christian organizations reaching out to those who desire 
freedom from homosexuality.  Once a year they hold a 
national conference whereas 500, 600 people attend.  These 
people come from all over the country, around the world, 
proclaiming freedom from homosexuality.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you Robert 
Knight, FRC's Director of Cultural Studies.  Over the years, 
Bob has presented the often unpopular facts about 
homosexuality and the destruction it brings to individuals, 
families, and society.

<p>

Bob has been accused of hatemongering and called 
many names.  But the truth about Bob's perspective could be 
seen at a press conference opening the second annual 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day.  Let's take a 
look.

<p>

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day Press Conference, held October 10, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: First, I would like to thank Michael 
Johnston for organizing this event.  Michael, as you have 
seen, is a man of great courage and integrity.  He is a 
great personal friend, and I grieve with him and his parents 
as we watch him struggle with this deadly disease that has 
invaded his body.

<p>

But I thank God that he has the courage to say the 
things he does in order that others may not fall into that 
path and suffer the same consequences.  A lot of people 
aren't willing to do that, and you can see the tragedy 
unfold.  You can just wander down to the Mall and look at 
that AIDS quilt.

<p>

For Family Research Council, our concern is the 
same as Michael's, that the facts aren't getting out about 
this vital issue affecting all Americans.  You only hear one 
side normally, and that is the mantra of tolerance, of 
acceptance.

<p>

But you have to wonder what we are being asked to 
accept.  If being asked to accept more of the kind of 
behavior that has made that AIDS quilt possible is what we 
are being asked to accept, that is unacceptable.

<p>

When the facts are known, most people turn from 
homosexuality and reject it in terms of support.  It is not 
easy for those struggling with these desires.  But I think 
one of the bigger lies that is told about the lifestyle is 
that somehow homosexuals are different from the rest of us, 
that they have an exemption from the responsibility to live 
by the rules of nature and nature's God that the rest of us 
have.

<p>

Well, the good news is that homosexuals really are 
no different from anybody else, and they have the same 
chance for salvation as anybody.  Everybody struggles with 
lusts and temptations.  The idea of a sexual orientation 
without sexual behavior is a patent absurdity, because we 
are concerned about the behavior.  We are concerned about 
the consequences of that behavior, and not just physical but 
the emotional consequences, the effect on people's families.

<p>

This whole idea that what you do sexually is only 
your own business is another great myth, because it does 
affect other people.  Everybody with children knows that if 
the kids go out and you don't know where they are until 2 in 
the morning, you can bet that affects you deeply.  It isn't 
just them.

<p>

The idea that once you're gay, you're always gay, 
is the mantra of the gay rights movement.  You're born that 
way.  Genetic studies allege to show that there is a genetic 
component to homosexuality.

<p>

All too often we have seen the media -- and I am 
not criticizing anybody in particular here -- rush to accept 
these studies without critical analysis.  But even a cursory 
glance at these studies for a genetic basis for 
homosexuality reveals that you can drive a truck through 
them.  They have terrific holes.  Reputable scientists in 
major scientific journals have discredited them and said 
that whatever they show, it isn't a genetic cause for 
homosexuality.

<p>

I would like to see that reported, because a lot 
of people struggling with homosexuality, particularly young 
people in their teens, raging with hormones, wondering who 
they are, shouldn't be told that they are inescapably gay 
just because they have had some thoughts in that direction.

<p>

We have seen a major movement into America's 
schools with the message that homosexuality has to be 
affirmed because we have to conquer homophobia.  Gay 
students have to be singled out and affirmed in their 
sexuality lest they get suicidal.  This is recruitment, 
plain and simple.  It is a way of shepherding people into a 
death style.  It has got to stop, and I think Americans will 
stop it if they get the facts about it.

<p>

I think most Americans are not aware of how heavy 
the propaganda is in America's schools.  We are now seeing 
it on America's television programs.  In Los Angeles 
magazine two months ago, a gay writer bragged that virtually 
all situation comedies on television are written, produced, 
and directed by homosexuals, who do have an agenda, and it 
goes beyond just leave us alone, just tolerate what we do.  
It is to force acceptance of this lifestyle, this death 
style, on the rest of America.

<p>

What is the gay attitude that they are projecting 
through these television shows?  According to the gay 
writer, it is an ironic detachment from anything else going 
on in the programs; in other words, the outsider's point of 
view.  It is also a heavy dose of sexuality and sexual 
innuendo.

<p>

I don't think I am the only person in America who 
has noticed that American situation comedies are just 
drenched with sexuality and of a type that smacks of the gay 
lifestyle.  It all has to do with casual sex, hit-and-run 
sex, lusting after bodies instead of hearts.  It is anything 
but a healthy lifestyle that we are being sold on America's 
TV screens.

<p>

One thing Family Research Council does is try to 
present facts that you won't find in major media.  I come 
out of a media background myself.  I was an editor for the 
<i>Los Angeles Times</i> for seven years and worked for newspapers 
for 15 years on both coasts.  And I can tell you, I have 
never seen an issue treated with less objectivity than the 
homosexual rights issue. You are only getting one side out 
there, and we are here to present the other side with 
courageous people like Michael Johnston.

<p>

What we are here to do today is to bring hope.  We 
are not here to talk about policy decisions or governmental 
rules or regulations.  We are here to talk about human 
beings and human hearts that can change when they are 
presented the truth.  The truth is Jesus Christ can bring 
anybody to salvation, can heal any wound, can bring a 
wholesome, full spiritual being to anyone.  And if 
homosexuals are being told they are somehow not qualified 
for that, well, that's a lie.  They are loved by God like 
everyone else, and they deserve the same chance.  If you are 
out there struggling with homosexuality, don't believe the 
lie that you can't change.

<p>

Overpopulation and unwanted pregnancy are real problems; lofty pronouncements cannot solve them. But it is equally unrealistic to assume that human beings, even potential or nascent ones, are as replaceable, and hence disposable, as automobile parts.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When the <a href="http://www.npr.gov">National Performance Review</a> (NPR) was unveiled with great fanfare in September 1993, President Clinton promised to "reinvent" the federal government because "it's not just broke, it's broken."  Now, as it celebrates the NPR's third anniversary, the White House claims its reinventing efforts have saved taxpayers $118 billion and "reduced the size of the federal workforce by nearly 240,000 workers -- its smallest level in 30 years."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The reality, however, is quite different: Most government agencies remain both broke and broken. While it is true that there are fewer civilian federal workers than at any point since 1965, the NPR's purported savings (even if taken at face value) amount to shaving only one penny from every federal dollar spent. Sadly, there is little evidence to show that even these meager amounts actually accrued as real savings for American taxpayers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Over the past four years, both the tax burden on families and the level of federal spending have gone up, not down. If the Administration truly had downsized the government, taxpayers would have reaped a tax windfall and Uncle Sam would have spent proportionately less. But instead of realizing a smaller budget from these savings, Washington will spend nearly $190 billion more this year than it did in 1992, George Bush's last year in office -- a 14 percent increase.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the elimination of some 240,000 positions in the federal workforce has been achieved without terminating one major agency. The reason is simple: 75 percent of these reductions were in national defense-related civilian positions. Today, Washington is simply spending more taxpayer money with fewer workers. Spending per government worker has jumped 30 percent since 1993. This is hardly the kind of efficiency taxpayers might expect from a government the President says should work better and cost less.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NPR's reinvention efforts have done little to cure the widespread cancer of waste and mismanagement throughout the government. Dozens of reports issued recently by such official "watchdogs" as the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and various agency Inspectors General (IGs) confirm that the Clinton Administration has failed to address the most serious problems in government agencies: severe financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, poor stewardship of government assets, and the ability of programs to survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Financial Weaknesses.</b> GAO and Inspector General audits have "identified hundreds of billions of dollars of accounting errors -- mistakes and omissions that can render information provided to managers and the Congress virtually useless."<sup>2</sup>  Even at the Internal Revenue Service, some $1.4 trillion in total revenue and $122 billion in tax refunds cannot be verified or reconciled; nor can the IRS substantiate the amounts reported for taxes collected (including Social Security, income, and excise taxes).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Management Weaknesses.</b> The Department of Housing and Urban Development's own Inspector General found that HUD never completed its 1993 reorganization plan and that, because of HUD's continuing resource management weaknesses, there is little assurance that its $1 billion annual salaries and expenses budget is used either efficiently or effectively to further the agency's mission and minimize program risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Federal Dinosaurs Saved from Extinction.</b> The Rural Electrification Administration was created in 1935 to help local utility companies bring electricity to rural areas. In 1949, REA's mission was expanded, with the assistance of Congress, to provide loans to rural telephone companies. REA continues today as part of the new Rural Utilities Service created by the Clinton Administration and the 103rd Congress. The new agency will give grants and loans to improve rural water and sewer service as well.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Rampant Duplication.</b> The Department of Commerce shares its mission with at least 71 other federal departments, agencies, and offices; for example, export promotion programs are fragmented among 19 agencies. "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Poor Stewardship of Federal Assets.</b> According to many sources, the known environmental cleanup costs at government-owned facilities could reach $400 billion over the next few decades; as much as $350 billion of this liability is forecast for Department of Energy facilities alone. In addition, hundreds of other government-owned physical assets, such as the National Highway System, the National Park System, dams, waterways, computer systems, and buildings, are coming dangerously close to collapse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These examples of rampant government waste and inefficiency have been well documented by Washington's own watchdogs. Yet while this waste and mismanagement persists, the White House has pushed an agenda of pseudo-reform designed to get media attention rather than to get to the root of government's most pressing problems. The truth is that the Administration's reinventing government program has had little material impact on the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans. Taxpayers want real solutions for the deep problems facing the federal government. They do not want obsolete and inefficient government programs simply to waste their money more efficiently.
<p>
<b>REINVENTING GOVERNMENT BY SAVING PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House claim that the National Performance Review has produced the smallest government in 30 years derives from a fundamental error: The Administration wrongly equates the size of government with the size of the civilian workforce. While the number of federal workers has declined, the NPR's efforts have neither stemmed the tide of government spending nor halted the persistent waste and mismanagement that plague most federal agencies. Quite simply, Washington is just as wasteful and costly today as it was when the Administration began reinventing government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the White House released the first report of the National Performance Review (known as NPR Phase I) on September 7, 1993, Americans were told that this was a blueprint for "reinventing" government. The six-month-long effort produced over 1,200 specific recommendations intended to "make government work better and cost less."  The Administration promised that the NPR's recommendations would save $108 billion between FY 1995 and FY 1999.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

NPR Phase I savings were expected to come from five major reform initiatives. The White House claimed that the bulk of the savings ($40 billion) would come from "Streamlining the Bureaucracy Through Reengineering" by cutting the civil service by a total of 252,000 full-time equivalent positions (FTEs). About 20 percent of the expected savings was to come from "Reinventing Federal Procurement," while lesser savings would be achieved by "Reengineering Through Information Technology" and "Reducing Intergovernmental Administrative Costs."  Finally, over $36.4 billion was expected to be saved from "Changes in Individual Agencies" even though at least $8 billion of this amount was from new revenues, not spending cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, the Administration released NPR Phase II as a response to the serious downsizing proposals being debated within the new Republican-controlled Congress. These new initiatives were predicted to save an additional $69 billion through FY 1999, bringing the total expected savings from "reinventing government" to $177 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From day one, however, it was clear that even the first phase would have a minimal impact on the size and scope of the federal budget. First, the much-touted $108 billion in savings actually represented a small fraction of projected federal spending. At the time the NPR report was released, the Congressional Budget Office projected federal spending would total $8.73 trillion for fiscal years 1995-1999. Thus, the $108 billion the White House claimed it would save from reinventing government amounted to just 1.2 cents for every dollar the government was projected to spend over the five-year period.<sup>4</sup>  Adding the NPR's Phase II proposals to this formula brings the total savings on every dollar of federal spending to just two cents. Second, the White House boosted its promised savings by basing its estimates on a "baseline" projection of federal spending. A baseline assumes that federal programs will grow because of such factors as economic inflation, population expansion, and other statutory formulas; it therefore follows that small programmatic changes can alter a baseline projection considerably -- and that any "savings" calculated from such a baseline also will be overstated considerably.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of these problems, the GAO reported that it could neither confirm nor track the NPR's promised savings. When Members of Congress specifically asked the GAO to look at the Administration's Phase II estimates, the GAO said "it would be difficult or impossible to verify most of the NPR II savings estimates."<sup>5</sup>  With respect to the elusive nature of such estimates, the GAO observed that:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	All savings estimates, including those for the NPR II recommendations, are point-in-time estimates. That is, they are measurements of future anticipated savings based on the policies and economic conditions prevailing at the time the estimate is made. Once an estimate is prepared and time passes, it becomes difficult or impossible to retrace the original steps and reconstruct events in order to determine the validity of the original estimate.... [E]ven if the NPR II savings estimates could be shown to have been correct at the time, we could not effectively track for most of the proposals whether the savings estimated are being achieved.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Superficial Savings from Reinventing Government</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the difficulty encountered by the GAO in trying to measure the accuracy of the White House's savings estimates, taxpayers and the media should be cautious in accepting at face value the latest figures claimed in the NPR's third annual report, <i>The Best Kept Secrets in Government</i>, released on September 20, 1996. The Administration claims in this report that its measures will have achieved about $118 billion in eventual savings between fiscal years 1995 and 2000.<sup>7</sup>  This total represents roughly two-thirds of the promised savings from NPR Phase I combined with roughly one-third of the expected savings from NPR Phase II.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These savings are trivial when compared to Washington's appetite for spending. Current CBO estimates put total federal spending (actual and projected) for fiscal years 1995-2000 at over $10 trillion. Thus, the Administration's "banked" savings of $118 billion will amount to just 1.2 cents for every federal dollar spent during this period. Unfortunately, even these modest savings will not accrue as actual savings for taxpayers, having disappeared instead into more government spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most misleading Administration claim is the so-called savings achieved by reducing the federal civilian workforce, which the NPR proposed to cut by 252,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs).<sup>8</sup>  In March 1994, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, which enacted the Administration's goal of reducing the civilian workforce but raised the number of positions to be cut to 272,000. While federal agencies are well underway in their efforts to meet this goal, these efforts have not yet led to a smaller government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
First, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 would save taxpayers $32.8 billion over five years. It is interesting to note that this estimate is 20 percent less than the amount the White House calculated would be saved by cutting 20,000 fewer FTEs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Second, the so-called savings achieved by these reductions were not dedicated to deficit reduction. Instead, Congress and the President used them to finance the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, commonly known as the 1994 crime bill. To be sure, many taxpayers would rather spend money on so-called crime prevention programs than on federal bureaucrats. However, the White House has grossly misled taxpayers by implying that this reduction in the federal workforce has saved taxpayers' money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, though Clinton's FY 1997 budget projects the number of civilian federal workers to be the smallest since 1965, the cost of the civilian workforce continues to escalate. As Chart 1 shows, since 1993 the number of civilian FTEs has declined by 11 percent, but the total cost of the civilian workforce has increased by 4.5 percent, from $111 billion to $115 billion. The reduced costs associated with the 17 percent decline in civilian defense employment since 1993 masks an 8 percent, or $5.7 billion, increase in the costs of employing non-defense government workers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And third, the Administration rarely mentions that 75 percent of the total federal workforce reductions have come at the expense of civilian workers at the Department of Defense (DOD). According to recent testimony by an official of the General Accounting Office:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Although the workforce reductions occurred governmentwide, they were not evenly distributed among agencies. Indeed, most of the downsizing took place at DOD. [As is shown in Table 3,] DOD absorbed nearly three quarters of the FTE reductions in fiscal year 1994 and over half of the governmentwide reductions in fiscal year 1995. In fiscal year 1997, <i>DOD is expected to absorb all of the FTE reductions made that year while the non-DOD workforce is expected to increase by a net total of 0.2 percent</i>, according to the President's fiscal year 1997 budget [emphasis added].<sup>9</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the civilian workforce is the smallest it has been since 1965, the Administration should not imply -- as it often does -- that all parts of the government are smaller. While DOD's civilian workforce today is 22 percent smaller than it was in 1965, the non-DOD civilian workforce is 40 percent larger today than 30 years ago. This follows the overall shift in federal resources away from national defense toward domestic spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense spending consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy. Under Clinton's policies, defense spending has fallen to less than 17 percent of overall federal spending and roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The bottom line is that overall federal spending has continued to grow despite three years of reinventing government. Since 1992, total federal spending is up by $189 billion, almost 14 percent; and it would be much higher had defense spending not declined by $36 billion during this same period, a process that began under George Bush. Indeed, non-defense domestic spending has increased $195 billion, or 23 percent, since 1992. This spending would have been considerably higher if the 104th Congress had not forced Clinton into accepting spending bills that cut discretionary spending for the first time in 25 years and terminated some 270 programs and projects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a perverse way, the NPR has achieved its goal of making the federal workforce more efficient. When Clinton kicked off the NPR in 1993, overall federal spending amounted to roughly $653,600 per federal worker. Under the President's proposed FY 1997 budget, however, the government would spend $856,000 per federal worker, an increase of some $202,000, or 30 percent.<sup>10</sup>  This means that the typical government worker wastes 30 percent more taxpayers' dollars today than before the onset of the Administration's reform efforts.
<p>
<b>FEW NPR ACTION ITEMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief reasons the NPR -- especially in Phase I -- has recorded so few savings in its three-year effort to reinvent government is that few of its recommendations have been undertaken by federal agencies. While it is too early to assess the progress of NPR Phase II, the GAO's recent analysis of the Phase I successes claimed by the White House found that only 294 (24 percent) of the 1,203 original "action items necessary to implement the NPR's recommendations to make the government work better and cost less" were completed by January 1996.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, the NPR recorded a total of 380 recommendations as completed, but the GAO found that nearly one-fourth of these had yet to be completed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In some cases, the GAO noted that the agencies either modified or watered down the original recommendations to make them more achievable. In one case, for example, "The description in NPR's records for action item PROC15.03 was changed from 'train procurement officials on source selection techniques' to 'develop a course to train procurement officials.'"<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As amusing as such findings may be, the fact remains that neither of these recommendations has any substantive bearing on the size or scope of government or on the actual service delivered to taxpayers. Indeed, both of these action items are process-oriented pseudo-reforms designed by bureaucrats to benefit bureaucrats.
<p>
<b>Pseudo-Reforms, Pseudo-Results</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many of the NPR Phase I action items marked completed fall into such a category of "pseudo-reforms."  They often sound impressive, and a few may even make the bureaucracy work better for bureaucrats. But they have little substantive impact, either on the functioning of the program or on its cost to taxpayers. Indeed, the bureaucracy often invents these pseudo-reforms to divert attention from the real question of whether or not the program should exist at all. Management expert Peter Drucker has criticized the NPR on this point:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway. They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank manager expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly-run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own -- without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Indeed, by focusing attention on <I>reinventing</i> government rather than <i>downsizing</i> government, the NPR unwittingly validated the process by which government workers block real reforms with pseudo-reforms and the way in which programs continually recast themselves to justify their existence. The continuous process of reinvention is how programs designed 40 or 50 years ago to address a specific problem can continue decades after the reason for their creation has passed. The fact that the NPR put so much trust in bureaucrats to reform their agencies and programs from within has contributed to this and, in some cases, has led to a reduction rather than an increase in accountability. In the end, the government may work better for bureaucrats, but not for all Americans.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The accompanying sample of completed NPR action items -- for which the White House now proudly congratulates itself -- illustrates the kind of pseudo-reforms that would not merit notice on Drucker's bulletin board.<sup>14</sup>

<p>
<b>A GOVERNMENT IN SHAMBLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The problems facing the federal government are not trivial, and they merit serious action by the White House. Washington institutions have become monuments to the needs and priorities of the 19th century, the Great Depression, World War II, and the Great Society. No amount of "reinventing" can turn institutions that were created to address problems the nation faced 30, 50, or even 100 years ago into agencies capable of meeting the needs of Americans in the 21st century.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the Administration's effort to streamline and improve the functioning of federal agencies, severe waste and mismanagement persist throughout the government. The government's own "watchdogs," such as the General Accounting Office and various agency Inspectors General, confirm that the problems plaguing agencies include severe financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, poor stewardship of government assets, and the ability of programs to survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
<b>Financial Weaknesses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Bill Clinton entered the White House in 1993, the GAO warned that "widespread financial management weaknesses are crippling the ability of our leaders to effectively run the federal government.... Not only does the government do an abysmal job of rudimentary bookkeeping, but it is also far from having the modern financial systems one would expect of a superpower."<sup>15</sup>  Unfortunately, the situation has changed little since the GAO issued its report.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, the GAO and most agency Inspectors General continue to uncover vast amounts of financial mismanagement in federal agencies of all sizes, from the $570 million Corporation for National Service to the $55 billion U.S. Department of Agriculture. The problems identified range from "shortcomings in accounting and financial systems" to "material weaknesses in the internal controls for financial management that result in a lack of accurate and reliable financial information."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While taxpayers are right to be shocked by reports of widespread financial mismanagement in government, Members of Congress -- who are responsible for approving funding for federal programs -- should be no less so. Unless those responsible for administering a program can provide a full accounting of how taxpayers' money was spent in the past, Members should be hesitant to spend more taxpayers' money on that program. As the GAO reported recently:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Financial audits have also shown that agencies often do not follow rudimentary bookkeeping practices, such as reconciling their accounting records with Treasury accounts or their own subsidiary ledgers. <i>These audits have identified hundreds of billions of dollars of accounting errors -- mistakes and omissions that can render information provided to managers and the Congress virtually useless</i> [emphasis added].<sup>16</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher has testified to Congress, the federal government is the nation's largest single source of credit, yet lending programs cannot provide accurate and reliable data. According to Bowsher, the FY 1994 financial audit reports from the Farmers Home Administration, Federal Housing Administration, Federal Family Education Loan Program, and Small Business Administration "revealed that agencies' estimates of the subsidy costs of their credit programs reflected in the budget are not accurate. Based on these audits, budget decisionmakers know that they have reason to question the amount of future budget requests for these agencies."<sup>17</sup>  Even worse is the acknowledgment that lending agencies are not able to collect on the loans they have made or guaranteed. As of the end of FY 1994, "the government reported (1) $241 billion in nontax receivables, of which $49 billion, or 20 percent, was reported to be delinquent and (2) $694 billion in guarantees of outstanding loans for which it was contingently liable."<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of these serious financial management problems, the Administration incredibly proposed to reorient the mission of agency Inspectors General away from oversight and toward a more management-oriented role.<sup>19</sup>  According to Ronald C. Moe, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service and Johns Hopkins University:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The report criticizes the IGs for being overzealous in their pursuit of "waste, fraud and abuse...."  The report repeats that it is interested in results, not processes. Therefore it views IGs as a problem since they are designed to punish those who violate processes.... The answer to the problem of overzealous IGs is to reculturate them to think and act less like IGs and more like managers.20
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Implementing such a recommendation would effectively neutralize the abilities of the principal fiscal watchdogs within each agency and thereby further erode the financial accountability of government workers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To varying degrees, nearly every major federal agency suffers from some form of financial management problem. Examples of problems in the following agencies vary from a lack of qualified accounting staff to an inability to maintain accurate records.
<p>
<b>Department of Agriculture</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In financial terms, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is one of the federal government's most troubled agencies. In FY 1994, the USDA spent over $60 billion, yet the agency's Inspector General was unable to express an opinion on its financial statements for the year because of system-wide weaknesses in the department's financial accounting system. Among the problems cited by the IG:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	We were unable to substantiate certain cash balances because of unsupported write-offs and adjustments. Reconciliations were not always performed appropriately and balances reported for certain Treasury symbols contained unexplained negative balances.<sup>21</sup>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	We also could not determine whether approximately $500 million in accounts receivable and $445 million in accounts payable balances were materially stated.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Sufficient, competent evidential matter was also unavailable to support the reasonableness of about $32.8 billion in "Credit Program Receivables and Related Foreclosed Property" and $485 million in "Estimated Losses on Loan Guarantees."<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	We noted inadequate documentation, pervasive instances of error and material control weaknesses when accounting for approximately $7 billion of Property, Plant and Equipment.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Department does not maintain an integrated, automated system for maintaining applicable records, existing records were not consistently updated, supporting documentation was inadequate, and capitalization rates were not consistently applied.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Food and Consumer Service (FCS) could not provide "sufficient, competent, evidential matter to fully support" about $13.5 billion in "primary grant operating/program expenses for the Child Nutrition Programs, Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Food Stamp Program Administration, and Food Donation Program."  Nor could it document "nonoperating changes stated at about $3.2 billion."<sup>26</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The General Accounting Office has also noted severe financial weaknesses in other USDA-administered programs. For example:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	At the request of Representatives John Kasich (R-OH) and Don Young (R-AK), the GAO asked the U.S. Forest Service to provide revenue and cost data for each of the national forests it manages for fiscal years 1992-1995. In FY 1995 alone, "over $1.3 billion was appropriated to manage the National Forest System, and revenue generated from the use of the forests totaled about $1.0 billion."  However, the USFS was unable to comply with the GAO's request "because of shortcomings in its accounting and financial information systems" which "does not enable the Service to associate the costs incurred in generating revenues from various forest uses."  USFS officials admitted that there were "various material weaknesses in the internal controls for financial management that result in a lack of accurate and reliable financial information...."<sup>27</sup>

</blockquote><p>

<b>Department of Commerce</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite years of stern warnings, the Commerce Department's Inspector General continues to find department-wide material weaknesses in financial management systems.<sup>28</sup>  Among the more severe problems identified by the IG:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	During our survey of BXA [the Bureau of Export Administration], we identified significant deficiencies in the internal control structure that would inhibit the agency's ability to produce accurate, reliable financial information.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	We have repeatedly reported on the inadequacies in Census' financial management practices and systems, identifying several obstacles to change: lack of senior financial managers and leadership, lack of designation of financial management as a bureau priority, and lack of qualified financial management staff.<sup>30</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The IG gave qualified (disclaimer) financial audits of the Economic Development Administration (EDA), International Trade Administration (ITA), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), "all of which have multiple material weaknesses and have shown only limited improvement."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the Department of Defense spends over $250 billion annually and manages over $1 trillion in assets, according to the GAO, its financial management problems are so widespread that "no single military service or major component has been able to withstand the scrutiny of a financial statement audit."<sup>32</sup>  Though DOD is developing a new accounting system, the GAO reports that this system will not be completed until the end of FY 1998. This means the year 2000 is the earliest DOD's IG could render an audit opinion on the agency's financial statement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Among the problems identified at DOD are overpayments and errors in record keeping:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As of August 1995, DOD problem disbursements -- those for which the Department can not match a disbursement with a related obligation -- were reported to be $28 billion -- and DOD continues to make hundreds of millions of dollars in overpayments to its contractors. As a result, DOD can not ensure that it does not spend more than it is authorized -- a basic fund control responsibility;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	DOD does not have adequate records or controls over the multibillion dollar investment in government furnished property and equipment;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[T]o an even greater extent than other military services, the Navy is plagued by troublesome financial management deficiencies involving tens of billions of dollars.<sup>33</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>U.S. Department of Energy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This year, the Department of Energy's Inspector General could not express an opinion on DOE's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for FY 1995 because "the audit disclosed reportable conditions in the Department's internal control structure that adversely affected its ability to manage and account for its assets and liabilities."<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, "these weaknesses related to estimating the Department's unfunded environmental liability of $196 billion, accountability and valuation of over $23 billion in property, plant, and equipment, and the inability of the Department's financial management system to produce adjusted consolidated financial statements."<sup>35</sup>
<p>

<b>Department of the Interior</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Trust Funds Management oversees Indian trust fund accounts totaling about "$2.6 billion, including approximately $2.1 billion for about 1,500 tribal accounts and about $453 million for nearly 390,000 Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts."<sup>36</sup>  Remarkably, though some of these accounts were 50 to 100 years old, they had never been reconciled until BIA undertook this effort in 1991. According to the GAO:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[D]espite over 5 years of effort and about $21 million in contracting fees, due to missing records, a total of $2.4 billion... could not be traced to supporting documentation and only about 10 percent of the leases selected for reconciliation could be verified.<sup>37</sup>
</blockquote><p>

<b>Department of Justice</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Department of Justice claims that one of the reasons its major bureaus, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Attorneys Office, and U.S. Marshals Service, have not been audited is the "lack of experienced staff to prepare financial statements."<sup>38</sup>  DOJ also claims it lacks the funds necessary to contract for the audits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) is supposed to collect fees for serving legal processes. However, DOJ's Inspector General found that "none of the districts calculated fees and commission correctly" and that "over 80 percent of the districts did not collect all fees due."  Moreover, the IG "could not estimate whether the USMS was over- or under-collecting fees because 67 percent of districts did not track all information needed to perform this calculation."<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of the Treasury</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of all the Cabinet departments, the Department of the Treasury is the one most Americans would agree should be beyond financial reproach. Unfortunately, however, Treasury manages two of the government's more financially troubled agencies -- the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Internal Revenue Service.</b> As the principal agency charged with collecting revenue for the U.S. Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service has perhaps the worst financial management system in all of government. This year, as in past years, the GAO could not audit the IRS's books because of widespread financial deficiencies. Among the problems identified by the GAO:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The amounts of total revenue ($1.4 trillion) and tax refunds ($122 billion) cannot be verified or reconciled to accounting records maintained for individual taxpayers in the aggregate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The amounts reported for taxes collected (social security, income, and excise taxes, for example) cannot be substantiated.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The reliability of reported estimates of $113 billion for valid accounts receivable and $46 billion for collectible accounts receivable cannot be determined.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	A significant portion of the agency's reported $3 billion in nonpayroll operating expenses cannot be verified.<sup>40</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Customs Service.</b> Only the Internal Revenue Service collects more revenue for the federal Treasury than the U.S. Customs Service. Audits have uncovered financial management problems so severe that, according to the GAO, they "impaired Customs' ability to effectively ensure that carriers, importers, and their agents complied with laws intended to ensure fair trade practices and protect the American people from unsafe and illegal [<i>sic</i>] imported goods."<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO reported the following problems, which Customs claims it is committed to correcting. The GAO found that Customs did not:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	adequately ensure that all goods imported into the United States were properly identified and that the related duties, taxes, and fees on imports, reported to be over $21 billion for fiscal year 1993, were properly assessed and collected;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have adequate controls to detect and prevent excessive or duplicate refund payments;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have adequate accountability over tons of illegal drugs and millions of dollars of cash and property seized or used in its enforcement efforts....<sup>42</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Department of Veterans Affairs</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Department of Veterans Affairs' Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 could not be certified by the Inspector General because DVA's "unreliable" accounting records, procedures, and internal controls did not support the $11.4 billion reported for real property, plant, and equipment, as well as the $3.3 billion in net receivables.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
<b>Independent Agencies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Financial management problems are not limited to the major Cabinet-level agencies. Smaller, independent agencies also show a lack of financial accountability. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Corporation for National and Community Service.</b> Created in 1993, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNS) is one of the youngest agencies in the federal government. Spending some $570 million annually, it administers such programs as AmeriCorps, VISTA, and the National Civilian Community Corps.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite being such a young agency, independent auditors "found that CNS' general ledger system is outmoded and poorly designed."  The auditors informed the program's Inspector General "that due to weaknesses in CNS' financial systems, accounting records and management controls, the financial statements were unauditable."<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Environmental Protection Agency.</b> The EPA's Inspector General could not determine whether the FY 1995 Superfund Trust Fund Financial Statements were accurate because of "weaknesses in the areas of accounting for property, accounting for the components of net position, recording reimbursable Superfund oversight costs as assets," and numerous other technical problems.<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IG could not verify the accuracy of the financial statements for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, the Oil Spill Trust Fund, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Fund.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The IG also found material weaknesses in the Agency's property management system. "We found leases that had not been capitalized, inventories had not been completed at some locations, and some contractors did not provide reports on the value of EPA property in their possession."<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Social Security Administration.</b> The Social Security Administration's Inspector General found that the systems which generate the Agency's accounts receivable data continue to suffer material weaknesses. According to the IG, "<I>the SSA's overpayment systems cannot identify how much is owed or collected</I> [emphasis added]."<sup>47</sup>

<p>
<b>Management Weaknesses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Performance Review argues persuasively that the industrial-age management structures employed by government agencies are no longer suited to "today's world of rapid change, lightning-quick information technologies, tough global competition, and demanding customers.... "<sup>48</sup> After all, suggests the report, "Saturn isn't run the way General Motors was. Intel isn't run the way IBM was."<sup>49</sup>  The NPR's solution to this problem is to reinvent federal agencies into "entrepreneurial organizations" with authority devolved to the lowest possible level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As persuasive as this line of argument might be, some analysts suggest that devolving authority in government -- a politically rooted institution -- can lead to the unintended consequence of undermining presidential authority. Ronald Moe is highly critical of the NPR's entrepreneurial agenda. Moe writes that under the NPR's management theory of devolution:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[T]he President's management responsibilities and authorities will be diminished as will be the institutional capacity of the central management agencies....  The President, in turn, is seen more as a catalytic agent than as the legal agent of a sovereign power.<sup>50</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of increasing bureaucratic accountability, Moe argues, the NPR's agenda will reduce accountability:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The net result of the Gore Report when its recommendations are implemented to the maximum degree possible in the political realm will be a government much less accountable to the citizens for its performance. The institutional presidency and the central management agencies are being intentionally weakened in their management roles.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Indeed, most federal agencies suffer management weaknesses that result in fraud, waste, cost overruns, and no accountability for program performance.
<p>
<b>Department of Agriculture</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Roughly half of the Department of Agriculture's $55 billion per year budget is spent on one program -- the Food Stamp Program (FSP). Waste, fraud, and abuse in the Food Stamp Program has been estimated by the USDA Inspector General at $3 billion per year. Yet, according to the IG, the Food and Consumer Service (FCS), which runs the Food Stamp Program, "does not require preauthorization visits to applicant stores. After authorization, periodic visits are not made unless trafficking is suspected."  During a recent nationwide sweep of more than 5,000 stores, the IG found that one-sixth (roughly 830) clearly were not eligible for the program. Among the ineligible vendors cited were a pizza restaurant in California, a vacant store in St. Louis, and the owner of 12 ice cream trucks in South Carolina.<sup>51</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Error rates in the Food Stamp Program have escalated since 1989. According to the Department of Agriculture's Inspector General, the combined value of FSP overpayments and underpayments jumped from $1.1 billion in FY 1989 to approximately $2.3 billion in FY 1994.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All states were to have implemented the Disqualified Recipient System (DRS) by April 1994. This Food Stamp monitoring system is intended to "track individuals who have been disqualified from FSP because of intentional program violations."<sup>53</sup>  However, in 1996 the IG found that 26 states had not fully implemented the tracking system. As a result, thousands of individuals who have been disqualified in one state could apply for benefits in another state or county without being caught.
<p>
<b>Department of Commerce</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although it has the smallest budget of all the major Cabinet agencies, the Department of Commerce is a management nightmare. Even its own Inspector General admits Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."  The GAO reports that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" by sharing its "missions with at least some 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Examples of the department's more significant management problems include:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</b> In 1992, NOAA began a $1.9 billion, 15-year plan to modernize its in-house fleet of research vessels. Since then, the Commerce Department's IG repeatedly has urged NOAA to explore more cost-effective options such as privatization. NOAA has ignored these suggestions even though the IG found that "(1) NOAA's fleet is clearly more expensive than available alternatives, (2) its decisions regarding the fleet have been based on faulty assumptions and inaccurate cost data, and (3) its actions have impeded attempts to form external partnerships with public and private sector organizations."<sup>55</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>National Weather Service (NWS).</b> For over ten years, NOAA's IG has warned repeatedly of management problems in the NWS's $4.5 billion modernization program. In a recent report, the IG focused on cost overruns and delays in just one part of the modernization program -- the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS). According to the IG, "In 1985 NOAA estimated that the [AWIPS] program would cost $350 million and be completed in 1995. As of 1995, the NOAA estimate had risen to $525 million, with a 1999 completion date. We believe that AWIPS will probably cost over $625 million and take nearly twice as long as originally planned."<sup>56</sup>  Further, the IG is "convinced that AWIPS is still dangerously schedule-driven: NOAA is attempting to develop and deploy the system much too quickly because the agency is under intense pressure to show progress."<sup>57</sup>
<p>

<b>Bureau of the Census.</b> The Commerce Department's IG recently questioned the readiness of the Bureau of the Census to implement the 2000 census. The IG found that "the bureau had selected a new design with questionable components" and "lacked an effective organization for planning and implementing the decennial."  The IG concluded that "the bureau's fragmented organizational and decision-making structure is not conducive to completing, substantiating, and implementing any design."<sup>58</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Energy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In response to plans by members of the 104th Congress to terminate the Department of Energy, the department embarked on its own Strategic Plan in April 1995. DOE management estimates this initiative will save about $1.7 billion over five years, a mere 2.5 percent of the $67.5 billion projected to be spent on DOE programs during the same period. DOE's management problems, especially its lax oversight of contractors, have been criticized repeatedly by the GAO and by the department's own Inspector General. GAO officials have testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight...."<sup>59</sup>  Specific Inspector General findings include the following:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1989, DOE has 
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	received about $10 billion for environmental restoration projects at its 130 facilities across the country. These projects are aimed at cleaning up more than 10,500 individual waste sites.... To date, much of the $10 billion has gone to study waste sites and develop an approach to their remediation, as required by environmental laws, rather than to actually clean them up.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Attempts to establish direct accountability among program offices at headquarters, administrative units, field offices, and the national laboratories have been especially difficult. Reporting relationships changed often and sometimes have been confusing.<sup>61</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An IG audit found that the department "spent about $29 million to design, modify and produce 87 accident resistant containers for the Air Force. However, the Air Force did not want them and expressed no desire to use these containers."  According to a GAO interview with DOE management, "this particular case was an exception in that the Department was responding to a 'sincerely felt' requirement."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IG discovered that "the Department allowed arms and military-type equipment to be loaned for extended periods of time even though it had established specific policies prohibiting the practice."<sup>63</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In May 1995, DOE attempted to justify its existence in the face of congressional attacks by publishing <i>Success Stories: The Energy Mission in the Market Place. Success Stories</i> highlights over 60 technologies developed or supported by DOE's applied research and development programs. This report, however, only fueled congressional criticism following a GAO analysis of 15 randomly selected "success stories."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO "found problems with the analysis DOE used to support the benefits cited in 11 out of the 15 cases" it reviewed. "These problems include basic math errors, problems in the supporting economic analysis, and unsupported links between the benefits cited and DOE's role or the technology. These problems make DOE's estimates of the benefits for these cases questionable."<sup>64</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Housing and Urban Development</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has had a long and colorful history of scandal, from gross mismanagement to outright corruption. In December 1994, the Clinton Administration released HUD's "Reinvention Blueprint," intended to "improve HUD's overall program delivery structure."<sup>65</sup>  According to HUD's Inspector General, however, this blueprint and the 1993 reorganization plan that preceded it have largely failed to improve HUD's operations. The IG found that:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	HUD's 1993 reorganization was never fully completed, given that HUD's considerable headquarters resources were never reorganized, and the field office restructuring and staff reassignments were never fully carried out.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	HUD does not maintain a bottom-up budget formulation process to identify resource needs based on detailed analysis of its program roles, functions, processes and anticipated workloads.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the OIG's [Office of Inspector General's] view, resource management decisions related to HUD's reinvention proposals have been made without sufficient analysis and detailed planning to assure the feasibility and benefits of the decisions.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of HUD's continuing resource management weaknesses, there is little assurance that HUD's $1 billion annual salaries and expenses budget is efficiently and effectively used to further HUD's mission and minimize program risks.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	HUD has only been able to accumulate rudimentary performance measure data for many of its programs.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 The need for improved HUD enforcement culture is still frequently evidenced in the lack of management action on the results of OIG audit findings of waste, abuse and funding misuse in HUD programs.<sup>67</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Department of Justice</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Justice Department's Inspector General found that the Drug Enforcement Administration's "official property records were materially misstated."  With a property inventory of 111,000 items valued at some $290 million, DEA does "not have a comprehensive, reliable property management program."<sup>68</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Transportation</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recent resignation of DOT Inspector General Mary Schiavo because of unaddressed problems at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has drawn attention to the systemic management problems throughout the entire $39 billion agency. For instance, although the FAA employs about 5,000 people performing safety-related inspections and oversight, the IG discovered severe management weaknesses throughout the system:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA's inventory acceptance procedures for aircraft parts purchased for FAA aircraft failed to detect that about 39 percent of the parts were of unknown origin and could not be traced to FAA-approved manufacturers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA-established parts manufacturer approval process had been compromised, and manufacturers produced and sold replacement aircraft parts without an FAA-approved quality assurance manufacturing system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA databases contained incomplete, inconsistent, and inaccurate data that does not reliably support safety-related decisions and will not effectively support FAA's inspection and certification mission.<sup>69</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another safety-related program, the IG found that the Federal Highway Administration's "motor carrier assistance program safety inspections had limited effectiveness."<sup>70</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

DOT also has a poor track record in grant and asset management oversight. The Federal Transit Administration, for example, which gives out about $4.5 billion in grants annually, was placed on the GAO's "High-Risk" list of troubled programs because "FTA's past oversight and enforcement practices failed to protect the government from waste and mismanagement."<sup>71</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
DOT's Inspector General also has cited the FAA and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) for poor management over acquisitions and assets. According to the IG, although the FAA and USCG planned to spend $2.3 billion in FY 1996 on capital investments, both agencies 
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have a history of inadequate mission analysis, frequently changing requirements, insufficient operational testing, inadequate contractor oversight, and poor contractor performance. Acquisition staffs have not been well-trained or highly supervised.... Problems such as inadequate specifications and testing have resulted in purchases of expensive equipment that did not satisfactorily perform its intended function.... FAA's AAS Program experienced substantial cost overruns and schedule delays. Initially estimated to cost $2.5 billion to complete, today's estimate is over $6 billion.<sup>72</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Federal Dinosaurs Saved from Extinction</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most taxpayers would be stunned to learn how old many federal programs and agencies really are. Large segments of the federal bureaucracy were created decades ago for purposes long since forgotten. One of the ways obsolete programs like the pre-World War II-era Rural Electrification Administration, the National Helium Reserves, and the Agricultural Extension Service become cemented in the federal budget is by continually reinventing themselves to "address" the needs of the day.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the numerous examples of programs evolving and adapting to ensure their survival are the following:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Rural Electrification Administration</b> was created in 1935 to help local utility companies bring electricity to rural areas. In 1949, REA's mission was expanded, with the assistance of Congress, to provide loans to rural telephone companies. REA continues today as part of the new Rural Utilities Service created by the Clinton Administration and the 103rd Congress. The new agency will give grants and loans to improve rural water and sewer service as well.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Export-Import Bank</b> was created in 1934 to finance exports to Russia. Today, the bank backs some $18 billion per year in cheap credit to major corporations such as Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas, and General Electric. In the 60 years since its creation, the Export-Import Bank has lost $8 billion on its operations -- practically all of it in the last 15 years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The National Fertilizer Development Center</b>, built as a munitions factory during World War I, was converted into a fertilizer plant and given to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the early 1930s. Fearing Congress would close it down, this obsolete program then reinvented itself and changed its name to the TVA Environmental Research Center as a way to chase federal research dollars. The 104th Congress, however, finally began taking steps to close this unnecessary program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By focusing its efforts on <i>reinventing</i> government rather than <i>downsizing</i> government, the Clinton Administration has validated and institutionalized the evolutionary survival process of obsolete government programs. Outmoded agencies do not need to worry about being terminated as long as they create a new mission for themselves.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One such outmoded agency is the Bureau of Reclamation, established in 1902 to bring water to arid Western states through public works projects such as the Hoover and Grand Coulee dams. The power generated by Reclamation's 56 hydropower plants makes it the second-largest power producer in the nation. Now that the West has been tamed, there is a strong argument to be made for ending the Bureau of Reclamation and privatizing its facilities in the way countries from China to Chile have sold government-owned utilities to the private sector.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the Administration has modestly endorsed privatizing some of the government's power distribution enterprises, it also recommends "creating a new mission for the Bureau of Reclamation."  According to the NPR, Reclamation "needs to redefine its mission toward new environmental priorities and clarify its role in water management."<sup>73</sup>  The Administration thus is sending a clear signal to other outmoded agencies: They need never fear being closed as long as they can find new missions for themselves.
<p>
<b>Rampant Duplication</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs rarely die, bureaus, agencies, and programs duplicate each other's functions throughout government. Government auditors, as well as analysts at the National Performance Review, have identified a staggering degree of duplication throughout the federal bureaucracy. For example, the NPR found that "much of Washington's domestic agenda, $226 billion, to be precise," is allocated to state and local governments "through an array of more than 600 different grant programs," many of which target the same populations for assistance.<sup>74</sup>  Moreover, each of these programs has strings attached that bind the hands of local officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO has identified duplication and fragmentation of government functions both across and within agencies. This creates considerable confusion for potential program recipients, who often are at a loss as to which program suits their particular needs, and for policymakers who must make funding decisions based on unreliable information. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> Some 15 separate government departments and agencies spend $20 billion a year on over 160 employment and training programs.<sup>75</sup>  The GAO found, however, that "almost 40 percent of the programs could not accurately tell us how many people were served each year... and less than 50 percent of the programs collected data on whether or not participants obtained jobs after they received services."<sup>76</sup>
<p>
<li> According to the NPR, Washington spends "about $60 billion a year on the well-being of children. But we have created at least 340 separate programs for families and children administered by 11 different federal agencies and departments."<sup>77</sup>
<p>
<li> The GAO has identified 72 federal programs and initiatives managed by eight different agencies that either directly or indirectly support water quality protection and enhancement. According to agency estimates, about "$4.6 billion and 10,680 full-time equivalent staff were dedicated to efforts related to water quality in fiscal year 1995, and about $5.1 billion was requested, appropriated, or otherwise provided for these programs for fiscal year 1996."<sup>78</sup>
<p>
<li>The GAO has identified 131 programs, administered by 16 different departments and agencies, targeted to assisting "at-risk" or delinquent youth. The Department of Health and Human Services managed the majority -- 58 separate programs. The cost of these 131 programs tops $4 billion per year. According to the GAO, "our analysis showed that, in many cases, it was possible for two or more programs to provide similar services to the same target group."<sup>79</sup>
<p>
<li> "The Department of Commerce shares its mission with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<sup>80</sup>  Commerce has "14 subordinate organizations addressing missions as varied as natural resources; advancement of commerce; area and regional development; and research and general education aids."<sup>81</sup>
<p>
<li> Federal law enforcement activities are spread among five major departments and four independent agencies.<sup>82</sup>
<p>
<li>Export promotion programs are fragmented among 19 agencies. "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<sup>83</sup>  According to the GAO, "it is unclear that [USDA's] export credit guarantee programs have resulted in increased agricultural exports."<sup>84</sup>
<p>
<li> In the Department of Agriculture, as many as 12 different agencies spend over $1 billion per year to administer 35 different laws pertaining to food safety. As a result, the current food safety system suffers from overlapping and duplicative inspections, poor conditions, inefficient allocation of resources, and outdated inspection procedures.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
<li> The USDA administers 14 food assistance programs serving 39 million people annually. 
<p>
<li> The cost of these programs has skyrocketed from $664 million in FY 1967 to about $37 billion in FY 1994. According to the GAO, their complex structure has caused overlapping of benefits and functions, inconsistent administrative procedures, and confusion for applicants who attempt to access the system.<sup>86</sup>
<p>
<li> At a cost of $1 billion to $3 billion per year, some two dozen federal agencies engage in mapmaking and geographic data collection activities.
<p>
<li> There are at least 14 major federal housing programs for low-income persons. Many state governments also operate independent public housing programs. Total housing aid for these beneficiaries equaled $23.5 billion in FY 1993.
<p>
<li> The Department of Education alone manages over 240 programs, yet federal spending comprises about 6 percent of all education spending.
<p>
<li> There are at least 62 federal economic development programs under the jurisdiction of 18 different departments and agencies.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration has a mixed record in consolidating duplicative programs and functions in government agencies. The Administration has recommended consolidating programs within the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, to name a few. However, had these consolidation proposals been enacted, the savings to taxpayers would have been minimal at best.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the most part, the Administration has displayed a zealous belief that better management and "coordination" can overcome the problems of duplication and fragmentation. NPR documents are replete with recommendations to create new programs, interagency coordinating councils, and oversight boards to overcome duplicative programs and functions. For example, the Administration created the nationwide One Stop Shopping program to help people seeking job training navigate through the maze of over 160 education training programs. A simple solution would be to eliminate these programs and use the $20 billion now spent on them each year to finance vouchers or tax credits for those seeking employment training. The Administration, however, even fought House and Senate attempts to consolidate between 75 and 100 of these job training programs into simple block grants to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of the NPR's so-called successes include the expansion of what can be called the informal level of government, comprised of interagency councils and coordinating committees. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> The Administration created a National Spatial Data Infrastructure project to coordinate the two dozen agencies involved in mapmaking and data collection.
<p>
<li> The NPR recommended the creation of "regional ecosystem management teams for each of the cross-agency ecosystem management projects."<sup>87</sup>
<p>
<li> To "strengthen the financial management roles of OMB and Treasury," the NPR recommended the creation of "a governmentwide budget and financial information steering group."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
<li> To solve the problems caused by 19 different export programs, the NPR recommended that the "President should issue an executive order to grant the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) broader authority to control federal export promotion efforts."<sup>89</sup>
<p>
<li> To "improve the delivery of federal domestic grant programs," the NPR recommended the creation of "a Cabinet-level Enterprise Board to oversee new initiatives in community empowerment."<sup>90</sup>  Apparently, the NPR did not think this recommendation duplicated its proposal to reinvent the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) and charge it with improving intergovernmental service delivery.
<p>
<li> To coordinate science policy, the NPR recommended that the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology be modified and reconstituted by presidential directive "as the National Science and Technology Council."<sup>91</sup>
<p>
<li> To solve procurement problems, the NPR recommended the creation of "an interagency team to develop a plan for improving federal information technology acquisitions."<sup>92</sup> The problem of overregulation was to be solved by the creation of "an interagency Regulatory Coordinating Group to share information and coordinate approaches to regulatory issues."<sup>93</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Ronald Moe, expanding this informal layer of government will further reduce the authority and management function of the President: "What does this devolution of management functions to the employee and broadening span of control mean to the President?  For one thing, it will mean that presidents will have to manage more through negotiations than through authoritative relationships."<sup>94</sup>  Moe believes the permanent bureaucracy, not the President, will then have ultimate control over federal policy.
<p>
<b>Poor Stewardship of Federal Assets</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Washington's poor record of managing the nation's assets has created an almost unaffordable liability for future taxpayers. According to many sources, the known environmental cleanup costs at government-owned facilities could reach $400 billion over the next few decades, with as much as $350 billion of this liability incurred at Department of Energy facilities alone. Hundreds of other government-owned physical assets, such as the National Highway System, the Park System, dams, waterways, computer systems, and buildings, are coming dangerously close to collapse. With a greater share of the federal budget dedicated to entitlement programs, it is unlikely the resources will be there when the bill comes due for these liabilities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The political and bureaucratic processes do not encourage protection of the long-term health of government assets. Since these assets are "owned" by everyone for the use of all citizens, it is in no one's interest (be he citizen, politician, or bureaucrat) to ensure that they are sufficiently maintained for the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are three principal reasons why public resources tend to fall into disrepair faster than private assets and why they fail to get the funds necessary to insure proper upkeep and maintenance. First, public assets typically are underpriced (often free), so consumers of public resources have an incentive to use as much of a resource as they can before the next consumer does. Second, the political process rewards short-term spending priorities, such as pork-barrel projects, and discourages long-term spending on maintaining assets. Third, agency managers are not punished for failing to maintain an asset as they would be in the private sector.<sup>95</sup>  In a perverse way, the political budgetary process can reward an agency with a new program to "modernize" a neglected asset.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the many examples of "government failure" that has allowed public assets to deteriorate are the following:
<p><ul>
<li> According to GAO Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, "The poor condition of agency financial systems is a symptom of a much broader issue -- the federal government's overall inability to effectively manage investments in information technology (IT). Many projects have been poorly managed, cost much more than anticipated, and have not provided intended benefits."<sup>96</sup>  Moreover, "In March 1995, OMB reported that 39 percent of agency systems were originally implemented over 10 years ago; 53 percent need to be replaced or upgraded within the next 5 years."<sup>97</sup>
<p>
<li> Many of the 337 dams built by the Bureau of Reclamation are over a half-century old and in desperate need of repair.<sup>98</sup>
<p>
<li> The Forest Service needs $644 million to maintain and reconstruct trails and recreation sites.<sup>99</sup>
<p>
<li> The National Park Service has a $4 billion backlog of infrastructure maintenance, nearly double the backlog the Service reported in 1993. As a result, the infrastructure at many of the nation's most famous sites, such as the Grand Canyon, the Washington Monument, and Independence Hall, is "at risk."<sup>100</sup>
<p>
<li> By the turn of the century, many of the water resources projects in the Army Corps of Engineers' $125 billion inventory will have reached the end of their design life. "The major structures have an average age of 33 years, and 12 percent of the projects are over 50 years old."<sup>101</sup>
<p>
<li> As of FY 1995, the Federal Highway Administration reported that 18 percent of the bridges in the National Highway System and 14 percent of the bridges in other federal-aid highways, were functionally obsolete. The FHWA estimates the "average annual cost to maintain bridge conditions and performance... at $5.2 billion over the next 15 years."<sup>102</sup>
<p>
<li> The Federal Highway Administration assists in the maintenance and construction of over 58,000 miles of roads within the Forest Service and the National Park Service, as well as on Indian Reservations. The vast majority of these roads are reported to be in fair or poor condition. The FHWA estimates that the total backlog of improvements needed on these roads is $8.5 billion.<sup>103</sup>
<p>
<li> "Years of neglect at Department of Defense and Department of Energy installations have left a legacy of contamination that these agencies now estimate may cost close to $200 billion to correct. These estimates do not take into account the full federal cleanup liability."<sup>104</sup>
<p>
<li> About 270 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserves cannot be safely removed at this time because of water leakage, natural gas seepage, and heat buildup. The cost of maintaining this 20-year-old facility grows each year.<sup>105</sup>
<p>
<li> Ongoing Federal Aviation Administration modernization projects are years behind schedule, with the Air Traffic Control System dependent on obsolete equipment. "Of the more than 200 projects in FAA's modernization effort, only 36 are completed, accounting for just 3 percent of the $32 billion" FAA will have to spend to upgrade the Air Traffic Control System between 1982 and 2000.<sup>106</sup>
<p>
<li> The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<sup>107</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Reinvention" cannot save programs as broken as these from eventual collapse. The only way to raise the capital necessary to rescue them is through privatization. The Clinton Administration, however, has made only token gestures toward privatization and has not seriously advanced such proposals in Congress. As a result, the nation's assets continue to deteriorate, placing and enormous liability on the next generation of taxpayers.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After three years of "reinventing government," federal spending continues to soar and Washington continues to waste taxpayers' money on programs that should be dramatically overhauled, terminated, privatized, or transferred to state or local governments. The civilian federal workforce has fallen to its lowest level since 1965, but Washington simply spends 30 percent more for every government worker. This is not the kind of efficiency taxpayers thought they were getting from a government that the Administration itself says must "work better and cost less."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Moreover, reports conducted by official "watchdog" agencies like the U.S. General Accounting Office and agency Inspectors General document a government in shambles, unable to perform even rudimentary functions in an efficient manner. Meanwhile, the Administration's pseudo-reforms may entertain the media, but they fail either to address or to remedy the government's most serious problems. Reinvention has failed to cure such problems as widespread financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, deteriorating assets, and programs that survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Clinton was right when he said that the federal government is "not just broke, it's broken."  But his solution, and the solutions put forward by the National Performance Review, amount to little more than putting new paint on an old termite-infested house with a crumbling foundation. Given the weakened state of too many government programs, it may be time to move out the remodelers and bring in the wrecking ball.

<center><h2>SPEECH NEVER PROHIBITED -- UNTIL NOW,<br>
VICTORY IN <i>SCHENCK</i> CASE &quot;CRUCIAL&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h4>Family Research Council filed brief/attended arguments today.</h4>
</center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Never in the history of our country
has a federal court prohibited peaceful, non-threatening speech
on a public sidewalk where access to businesses is not impeded,&quot;
noted Family Research Council Legal Director Cathy Cleaver on
Wednesday.

<p>

She made her comments following oral arguments before the Supreme
Court today in <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New
York.</I>  The Court examined an injunction prohibiting sidewalk
counselors from speaking within 15 feet of anyone going to or
coming from an abortion clinic -- even on public streets and sidewalks.
<b>Family Research Council filed a brief with the Court and held
a Moot Court to assist the lawyers with oral argument preparation.</b>

<p>

Miss Cleaver, who is an attorney, observed: &quot;Several justices
today seemed to agree with the argument of Jay Sekulow of the
American Center for Law and Justice who made a First Amendment
case. Sekulow said sidewalk counselors must remain free to appeal
to young mothers for the lives of their unborn children. 'There
is no medical exception to the First Amendment,' he argued. Justices
Ginsberg and Breyer seemed to be saying that the possibility of
jostling outside a clinic is significant enough to consider silencing
free speech protections in the Constitution.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Sekulow agreed that those acts can rightly be stopped,
but that stopping all speech was overkill.  Justice Scalia, in
a colorful moment, suggested that Mr. Sekulow was, in essence,
saying: 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never
hurt me.'&quot;

<p>

<b>Cleaver said, &quot;A victory in the <I>Schenck</I> case is
crucial to show that the First Amendment is not a promise only
for the politically correct, and that the rights of, as Justice
Scalia calls it,  a 'currently disfavored class' of pro-life Americans
are not trashed.&quot;</b>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For the past nine months, over 35,000<sup>1</sup> members of America's armed forces have been deployed as part of the NATO implementation force in Bosnia (IFOR). These soldiers were sent to the Balkans to enforce the military provisions of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Dayton Peace Accord</a> of November 1995. President Bill Clinton, in an address to the nation on November 27, 1995, told the American people that the mission "should and will take about one year."<sup>2</sup>  The House and Senate subsequently adopted resolutions expressing reluctant support for the Bosnia mission and authorizing the deployment of U.S. troops specifically for this one-year period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, recent press reports revealed that the Clinton Administration plans to deploy at least 5,000 new GIs to Bosnia in a "covering force" mission that would last at least until March 1997.<sup>3</sup>  Administration officials defending the surprise move stressed the unstable and dangerous situation in Bosnia as the cause for deployment. In the meantime, NATO has called for a continued military presence in Bosnia (what has been called a "stabilization force").
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Administration officials have refused to define what role the U.S. might play in Bosnia beyond next spring. On October 3, 1996, Secretary of Defense William Perry assured the Senate Armed Services Committee that no firm commitment to a new NATO force has been made; during NATO meetings in Norway the previous week, however, the Secretary of Defense refused to specify any conditions or guidelines that might frame the circumstances in which the U.S. might participate in a new implementation force for Bosnia. This ambiguity has left the door wide open for an open-ended and undefined U.S. military commitment to Bosnia that could last throughout 1997 and beyond.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such a commitment is both unwise and disproportional to U.S. national security interests in Bosnia. The U.S. needs a plan to extricate its forces from Bosnia in stages and to turn the responsibility for consolidating the peace to other European organizations. To ensure that it does not become bogged down in an open-ended military commitment in Bosnia, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li> Keep only a limited number of U.S. support troops in place in Bosnia in 1997. There should be no American combat ground troops in a new IFOR.
<p>
<li> Organize a follow-on implementation force in Bosnia under NATO's new Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept with a European commander.
<p>
<li> Remove all U.S. troops from the Balkans by 1998.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This staged removal of the U.S. and NATO from Bosnia is necessary if the U.S. and its flagship alliance, NATO, are to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to Bosnia. For 32 years, the United Nations has been chained to an open-ended peacekeeping commitment in Cyprus. It would be highly injurious to NATO to be involved in Bosnia for the next 30 years. To avoid making Bosnia a ward of the U.S., and NATO an emasculated collective security or peacekeeping alliance, the U.S. must now put forth those conditions to European allies.
<p>

<b>THE POLITICAL FAILURE OF PEACEKEEPING IN BOSNIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia has been a military success but a political failure. This contradiction is rooted in the fact that the military provisions of the Dayton Accord are working at cross purposes with its political provisions. The military mission is to separate the existing Serb, Croat, and Muslim forces, while the political goal is to unify Bosnia. These goals are irreconcilable. Since the beginning of the mission, the military component has endured steady criticism about its refusal to launch manhunts for indicted war criminals and strictly enforce the right of refugees to return to their pre-war homes. If NATO undertook these tasks, however, it could re-ignite the war it is supposed to be preventing, not to mention embarking on the sort of "mission creep" that doomed the United Nations' intervention in Somalia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As a result, the efforts of 53,000 military troops from some 30 countries have done little to advance the political provisions of the Dayton agreement. The principal mission of the military forces while manning the zone of separation in Bosnia was self-preservation. This was especially true of U.S. troops, whose missions were organized mainly to avoid casualties in an election year. While the U.S. has suffered only one death from hostile incidents since December 1995, the IFOR operation has cost $3.5 billion -- more than twice the Administration's 1995 estimate.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That investment was intended to finance a one-year military effort aimed at implementing the political provisions of the Dayton Peace Accord. That hope is looking bleak, however; the September 14 elections in Bosnia merely confirmed the illusionary nature of the Dayton agreements, evident to many in 1995.<sup>5</sup>  The Dayton Accord's goal of a united and multiethnic Bosnia is wholly unrealizable. In the recent elections, over 80 percent of Bosnians voted in solid ethnic blocs, and few refugees crossed ethnic lines to vote in their pre-war districts. Thus, the factions of Bosnia have claimed with ballots what they had fought for with bullets. As Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI) noted on the eve of the elections, this "bring[s] us back to where we started: a region full of hostile, ethnically divided factions facing off at tenuous borders, under unstable military, economic, and social conditions."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Dayton Accord's vision of a multiethnic Bosnia is doomed, and partition appears to be inevitable. All that remains is to establish the political goals of a follow-on peacekeeping force and devise the military missions needed to achieve those goals. More important for U.S. military planners will be whether the goals of the military forces are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable, and whether they truly contribute to achieving the political goals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

NATO planners are creating four options for IFOR II. The working assumption is that the U.S. will play a leading role in all of them.
<blockquote>
<b>OPTION #1: Complete withdrawal.</b> This is the least likely option and will get little attention and consideration. America's European allies, who have always been more realistic about the many years that will be needed to patch up Bosnia, regard the one-year time limit as no more than a U.S. election-year ploy. This option presents a stark alternative that probably will be rejected by NATO. No one in NATO wants to walk away from Bosnia entirely.
<p>
<b>OPTION #2: War prevention.</b> This option foresees a smaller NATO force with significant combat capabilities. This force, charged mainly with keeping the factions from resuming the war, would deter (and perhaps defeat) any large-scale organized violence that might break out after the departure of IFOR. Given the European reliance on U.S. combat capabilities, this option would require a significant U.S. military presence. The assumption is that the Bosnians would carry on with political reconciliation under a NATO security umbrella designed to prevent the renewal of factional fighting.
<p>
<b>OPTION #3: A "sustainment" force.</b> This force, about half the size of IFOR, would require about 20,000 troops in Bosnia. It would have the unclear mission of maintaining a general atmosphere of peace and security. It also would be more involved in the political reconciliation of Bosnia than a "war prevention" force but probably would continue to avoid such tasks as hunting down war criminals and enforcing the return of refugees to their pre-war homes. NATO is most likely to choose this option because its mission is the least clear and therefore less likely to polarize either the NATO allies or political factions inside Bosnia. All sides can see in this option exactly what they wish to see. The Europeans could envision an extended presence, while the U.S. would be happy with a reduced presence.
<p>
<b>OPTION #4: Full-scale continuation of IFOR and its current mission.</b> Adoption of this option is not likely because it would require a continued American commitment of some 35,000 U.S. troops to the region -- a politically insupportable position in the U.S. In addition, while America has every intention of reducing its commitment, the European allies have made it clear that they will not increase their own troop commitment to keep a follow-on force up to IFOR's current strength.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Options 2, 3, and 4 all involve a significant U.S. ground presence in the Balkans for the foreseeable future: 10,000 to 12,000 U.S. ground troops in Bosnia, Croatia, and Hungary. The U.S. has laid down no criteria for U.S. participation in a follow-on force; nor has the Pentagon recommended one of these NATO options to the President. This public refusal to specify the conditions under which U.S. troops will participate has left NATO planners with the impression that the level of American participation in IFOR II will remain the same as it was in the original mission. Conversely, the European allies have set forth their criteria by stating repeatedly that they have no intention of staying in Bosnia if the U.S. pulls out.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the U.S. has hinted at reducing its presence in Bosnia, the Europeans have made no efforts to step into the leadership vacuum if the U.S. leaves. German officials say they are prepared to provide up to 3,000 soldiers for an IFOR II of 20,000 to 25,000 troops.<sup>7</sup>  The French and British commitments to a follow-on force will be consistent with their commitments to the original IFOR; neither government has indicated a willingness to change its level of commitment to a Bosnian peace force. In any event, the European assumption is that America is still expected to provide the lion's share of any new peacekeeping force. There is no evidence whatever that America's European allies are prepared to step up to the plate and assume a greater share of the military burden in Bosnia.
<p>
<b>THE BIG PICTURE: BOSNIA AND NATO'S DIVISION OF LABOR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Politicians from all sides of the American political spectrum maintain that while the U.S. is a world leader, it cannot be responsible for policing the world. Distinguishing between the two roles of global power and global cop requires the ability to choose where and when to use America's military forces, as well as to understand how they can be used most effectively. It also requires an alliance system in which the U.S. acts like a great power and does not try to put out every brushfire in the world. America must demand that prosperous and powerful allies take the lead in addressing local crises that are peripheral to American security interests. If the U.S. does not enforce this implicit bargain, the allies will continue to let it do the heavy lifting in missions like Bosnia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This unfair and unwise sharing of the security burden in Europe is neither politically nor militarily sustainable. In addition to perpetuating an outdated division of labor, it flies in the face of at least three long-range political and security trends in the alliance.
<p><blockquote>
<b>TREND #1: Strategic Strain.</b><br>
Because of post-Cold War cuts in the U.S. defense budget, America's armed forces have shrunk by some 35 percent since 1991. However, while "supply" has been reduced, "demand" has not diminished. America's overseas military requirements have not decreased since the end of the Cold War. In fact, they have increased in many circumstances. As a result, the U.S. does not have a force large enough to carry out the national security strategy designed by the President. It is well-known that the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review (BUR) Force will not be large enough to fulfill the task of winning the number of major regional conflicts required by the present national strategy. It also is widely known that the current force is not adequately funded.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
What is less well-known is the effect of this double mismatch on the men and women of America's armed forces. Attempts to bridge this gap between the ends and means of American strategy have left America's armed forces severely strained, demoralized, and unprepared for the future. The results: U.S. forces deploy at three to four times the rate of the Cold War; major combat training exercises have been canceled; "gaps" appear regularly in the coverage provided by the shrinking Navy to key regions of the globe; problems with divorce, quality of life, and re-enlistment are on the rise; and money spent to recapitalize the armed forces for the future is down by some 70 percent since the Reagan years.<sup>9</sup>  Robert Gaskin, a former Pentagon planner, states that the armed forces' men and materiel are "approaching burnout."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) believes that strategic strain is "stretching our military [to] the verge of the breaking point."  He warns that "at some point somebody needs to stand up and say there is a minimum size to being the world's only superpower, and we have gotten smaller than that in terms of our regular units, and we have an obligation to insist on a military in which people can serve without being burned out by the sheer constancy of their being used."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<b>TREND #2: Diverging Military Competencies.</b><br>
The core competencies of the armed forces of the United States and its European allies are diverging, making the European allies more dependent on the U.S. for military operations. For the most part, the U.S. armed forces are focused on deterrence and warfighting against aggressive states. While the U.S. is prepared to go to war in a number of regions to protect American interests and American allies; the NATO allies are slashing defense spending and refocusing their military establishments on peacekeeping and operations other than war.
<p>
As in the United States, monetary concerns are one of the principal driving forces behind the changing military capabilities of the NATO allies. While Korea and Japan have increased their defense spending since the end of the Cold War, America's European allies have cut defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) by an average of one-third.<sup>12</sup>  Most of these funding reductions have been precipitated by the need to meet the stringent fiscal requirements of European Union monetary integration.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
More important, America's allies are not investing in military systems needed to project power and conduct sustained warfighting campaigns; rather, they are preparing for regional peacekeeping and other low-intensity conflicts. With only a few exceptions, they are not investing in strategic airlift and sealift; strategic logistics systems; space-based command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) networks; and modern weapon systems based on revolutionary advances in information technology.<sup>14</sup>  In Bosnia, while the allies provide over 50 percent of the implementation force, the U.S. supplies 46 of the 48 satellites used by IFOR for command, control, communications, and intelligence.
<p>
<b>TREND #3: Diverging Security Interests.</b><br>
During the Cold War, the overwhelming threat from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused allied interests to converge and provided a centripetal force that held NATO together. However, most post-Cold War security challenges will be well below the threshold of a major power threat. Problems like the ethnic battles in the former Yugoslavia threaten local and regional security interests more directly than they do the more global security interests of the United States. Common sense would dictate that local powers and regional security arrangements should be the "primary care networks" for small regional security crises. States with the most immediate interests should be the principal candidates for providing most of the resources necessary to solve the problem.
<p>
The recent series of confrontations with Iraq and the multinational operation in Somalia highlight the diverging security interests of the U.S. and its allies. In both cases, the coalitions were faced with relatively minor threats but could not agree on common approaches to solving the crises. In Iraq, the French criticized the U.S. action and refused to help the British and American air forces patrolling the extended no-fly zone. In Somalia, the U.S. virtually accused the Italian contingent of being in league with warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed and even publicly asked the U.N. to fire the Italian commander. These examples highlight the fact that when allies face lesser threats, their interests can differ greatly. It therefore behooves an alliance managing a crisis like Bosnia to match the differing interests and capabilities of various allies to different roles and responsibilities. In other words, the U.S. should not be expected to have the same degree of interest in a local European security affair as the European allies themselves have.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: A New Security Bargain </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These trends suggest that the U.S. needs to strike a new security bargain with its European allies. The U.S. should keep the military alliances that served it well during the Cold War and are still useful in protecting vital interests, but it must adapt them to the changing nature of the post-Cold War world. America's role in these alliances should be focused on the military tasks that directly protect America's vital interests. This means, primarily, deterring major power threats to the United States and such key regions as Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf, and ensuring unimpeded U.S. access to such key global systems as trade, finance, energy, and natural resources. America's alliances exist to serve these missions and to make American power more effective by harnessing and using the resources and energies of allies who share these goals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In return for this commitment to the major tasks of global security, America's allies increasingly must take the lead in smaller regional and local security crises that exist well below the threshold of vital U.S. national interests. In these crises, the U.S. must play only a supporting role, helping allies with unique and decisive U.S. military capabilities. In general, America must reserve its limited resources for the singular and critical tasks of global security that it alone can accomplish.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Good leaders measure the differing talents and resources of their team, and match missions and tasks to those team members most suited for the job. In this way, the overall effect of the alliance is more than the sum of its members. As management guru Peter Drucker has noted, "effective leaders delegate a good many things; they have to or they drown in trivia. But they do not delegate the one thing that only they can do with excellence, the one thing that will make a difference, the one thing that will set standards, the one thing they want to be remembered for. They do it."<sup>15</sup>  The U.S. cannot and should not delegate its superpower role in global security, but it can and must delegate regional peacekeeping to those local powers well-equipped to do it.
<p>

<b>WHAT KIND OF NEW PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN BOSNIA?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A follow-on Bosnian peacekeeping force, or IFOR II, should be smaller; should have fewer tanks, artillery, and other "heavy" forces; and should be more European. The U.S. and its European allies generally agree on those conditions, but they have very different ideas about the extent to which the U.S. should be involved. Since the Dayton Accord was signed, European officials have been much more realistic and forthcoming about the need for a long-term military commitment to Bosnia. Moreover, French and British officials repeatedly have insisted that they would not keep forces in Bosnia if U.S. forces were withdrawn. Thus, the negotiations over an IFOR II are likely to come down to a battle of political will, with the European allies attempting to obtain the largest U.S. commitment they can while the U.S. tries to provide the smallest force possible. To avoid this trap, the U.S. should take the initiative in the NATO planning cycle. To prepare for this, the U.S. should insist on the following specific conditions:
<p><ul>
<li><b> NATO should use the new Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept to organize a follow-on peacekeeping force in Bosnia.</b> A U.S. initiative, the CJTF was conceived in 1993 and, after several years of painstaking negotiations, agreed upon by NATO ministers in June 1996. The Combined Joint Task Force is a flexible military structure in which Europeans can lead while still borrowing some NATO resources for the task at hand. The CJTF makes it possible for European allies to assume the chief responsibility for regional problems (like Bosnia) while the U.S. commitment to NATO remains focused on the collective defense of Europe against outside aggression.16  It also is a practical mechanism that can stiffen the political resolve among European allies about their abilities to organize and undertake small crisis management, humanitarian relief, and peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
A CJTF for a follow-on force in Bosnia can come in several forms and can be led either by NATO or by a European security organization like the West European Union (WEU). The units involved in a CJTF are "separable but not separate" and could be "leased" from NATO. A CJTF is temporary and mission specific: Its units return to the NATO fold after mission completion or in the event of more important NATO contingencies.
<p>
Any force following IFOR should have less combat power and more civilian resources. The military mission of separating Bosnian forces can be accomplished by European combat troops. The important work left to be done in the political, economic, and social reconstruction of Bosnia is the province of civilian aid workers and administrators, not combat troops.
<p>
<li><b> The new force should be less American and more European.</b> The U.S. is involved in NATO to help protect Europe from major power threats, not to police out-of-area ethnic disputes. Moreover, the U.S. cannot credibly undertake the former task while involved in the latter.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
As a general proposition, the U.S. should limit its contribution to support units that are truly unique and decisive for the European-led effort: air and sea support, command and control resources, communications units, and limited logistics support from Hungary and Croatia. U.S. units in Bosnia itself should be restricted to combat service support units such as intelligence, command and control, communications, medical, military police, and civil affairs. In addition, for contingency planning purposes, the U.S. can provide a quick-reaction combat force from either the airborne infantry regiment in Vicenza, Italy, or an armored task force stationed temporarily in Hungary. This force could reinforce European peacekeepers in the event of an emergency they are unable to handle.
<p><li>
<b>American armed forces should not be involved in Bosnia in any capacity after 1997.</b> A continued NATO presence in Bosnia, led by Europeans and supported by the United States, will buy the Bosnians even more "breathing space."  After 1997, however, any continuation of the military mission should come from Europe alone. The U.S. and NATO can leave Bosnia with their accomplishments intact if it is done in stages and while preparing other European organizations, such as the Western European Union or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to take over after NATO's departure.<sup>18</sup> 
<p>
<li><b>Control and management of the Bosnian peacekeeping force should devolve eventually from NATO to other European initiatives like the WEU and OSCE.</b> NATO must reassume its principal role as the alliance providing for the collective defense of Europe. If NATO sees its <i>raison d'etre</i> in collective security actions like Balkan peacekeeping, it will become as emasculated as the OSCE.<sup>19</sup>  NATO is built around a clear mission and focused purpose; it should not become the dumping ground for every security crisis in Europe.
<p>
<li><b>The new force should resemble a traditional peacekeeping operation.</b> NATO should abandon the unrealizable goal of an integrated Bosnia as envisaged under the Dayton Accord. There is no achievable military mission for a follow-on force in Bosnia that would support the goals of Dayton. On the other hand, reduced political expectations about Bosnian integration can be supported by a peacekeeping presence throughout 1997. If the political solution is realistic and recognizes that Bosnia will evolve based on some form of partition, peacekeepers can support that goal. European-led peacekeepers therefore should limit their military ambitions to manning the zones of separation to ensure that no large-scale combat operations are conducted within Bosnia.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There is no way to predict with assurance what will happen to Bosnia in 1997 and beyond. Most experts agree that the prospects for a multiethnic state as envisaged by the Dayton Accord are dim. Because this political forecast is so gloomy and the political goals are so contentious and unachievable, it is highly doubtful that a clear and authoritative military mission can be defined for IFOR II. This combination of factors points to a protracted international presence that will have to "muddle-through" in Bosnia for years to come.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A new peacekeeping force should not be led by the United States. In the long run, such a presence should be the responsibility of an organization like the WEU or OSCE. America's main purpose in NATO should not be to police out-of-area ethnic conflicts in Europe.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. participation in IFOR is coming to a close, and Congress should hold the President to his promise of a mission that would take "about one year."  A follow-on force in Bosnia can include a small U.S. support presence, but the entire enterprise must be underpinned by the clear indication of a European willingness to take charge of a difficult situation now that "breathing room" has been attained with the help of the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To support its European allies, the U.S. should accept the temporary attachment of American troops to a new Bosnian peacekeeping force. However, this force should be composed largely of European ground troops, and U.S. forces should remain under U.S. command. In this way, America can do what it does best -- focus on larger military contingencies -- while the Europeans take on a larger share of the peacekeeping burden.

<title>"HARM REDUCTION" AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DRUG WAR?</title>

<p>

<h2>&quot;HARM REDUCTION&quot;<br>
AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DRUG<br>
WAR?</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

&quot;Harm reduction&quot; is a new approach to the drug abuse
crisis which is winning disciples worldwide.  Its goal is to legalize
drugs, stop illicit substance interdiction efforts and step up
abuse treatment.

<p>

The &quot;harm reduction&quot; approach maintains that drug abuse
is inevitable and that society must learn to accept the &quot;responsible
use&quot; of psychoactive substances.  It ignores the physiological
and psychological effects of illicit drugs, preferring concepts
that include outright legalization of all drugs or non-enforcement
of existing drug laws.  There is evidence that the United States
is embracing &quot;harm reduction.&quot;

<p><ul>

<li>In 1996 Californians are being asked to decide whether to
legalize the medical use of marijuana even though pot's healing
qualities have never been proven and there are thousands of scientific
reports showing harmful effects.  Similar initiatives are gaining
momentum in other states.

<p>

<li>Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has introduced legislation which
provides &quot;for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]
This legislation has both Republican and Democrat co-sponsors.

<p>

<li>There are at least 75 needle giveaway programs in 55 American
cities.[2] These programs give needles to addicts to ostensibly
slow the spread of the AIDS virus, but there is evidence that
high risk drug abusers are at least as likely to contract the
disease through sexual contact. Moreover, giving needles encourages
drug abuse. Some of these programs are paid for with tax dollars.

<p>

<li>Conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr. has joined the
harm reduction camp.  The February 1996 edition of  <I>National
Review</I> featured Buckley and six &quot;harm reduction&quot;
proponents agreeing that the drug war has failed and calling for
decriminalization of illicit drugs.

<p>

<li>Billionaire philanthropist George Soros has given $15 million
to fund organizations that actively promote harm reduction programs.
Soros is also the major financial backer for California's medical
marijuana ballot initiative and has financed many needle giveaway
programs.[3]

<p>

<li>Major television networks have featured news magazines that
sympathetically portray harm reduction as an answer to the &quot;failed&quot;
drug war. On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier began her news
magazine, &quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
with the statement, &quot;If America cannot win the war on drugs,
it should try instead to reduce the harm associated with drug
abuse.&quot;

<p>

<li>The Clinton administration has overseen a &quot;controlled
shift&quot; in drug policy from an aggressive interdiction policy
to one of harm reduction.  The federal government's ability to
disrupt drug shipments has been reduced by 64 percent.[4] Foreign
anti-drug programs have been cut by 55 percent and domestic marijuana
eradication by 59 percent. Meanwhile, between 1992 and 1996 funds
for treatment rose 19 percent.[5]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>THE ORIGINS OF &QUOT;HARM REDUCTION&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction was appropriated from the safety and insurance
industries. These industries try to minimize the consequences
and probabilities of accidents and costly illnesses by providing
incentives for behaviors like wearing safety belts, not smoking,
exercising regularly and avoiding high-risk sports such as skydiving
and auto racing.  This business philosophy has been transferred
into drug-related public policy.

<p>

The Netherlands was the first country to adopt a &quot;harm reduction&quot;
public policy.  In the 1970s, the Dutch responded to an outbreak
of hepatitis among injection drug users by passing out clean needles.
The concept gained momentum with the AIDS epidemic and quickly
spread across Europe. Harm reducers have expanded the concept
to include heroin maintenance programs, legalization of marijuana
and reduced interdiction and enforcement efforts.

<p>

America's Harm Reduction Coalition published an article that outlines
defining practices.[6]

<p><ul>

<li>&quot;Every time a needle exchange program participant ditches
a used syringe to avoid arrest rather than bring it back to the
exchange, he is practicing harm reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;And every time a dope-injecting [person] or pot smoker
spends all day traveling around the city in search of good drugs,
as inconvenient as this may be, she is practicing a form of harm
reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;Every time a methadone patient 'beats' his urine to
stay in the program, he is practicing harm reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;A user might be able to do the networking needed to
find good drugs in the half an hour he spends at a street-based
needle exchange site -- networking that might otherwise have taken
half a day.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;While not legally available to users unless they are
a patient of an authorized clinic, there is an underground system
for obtaining methadone that most commonly revolves around the
sale of weekend pick-ups.  Lovers, spouses, family members, and
friends often share a single methadone prescription.&quot;

</ul><p>

The American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS project is a leading
promoter of &quot;harm reduction&quot; in America. &quot;Harm
reduction attempts to instrumentalize the notion of meeting individuals
'where they're at,'&quot; says the ACLU, &quot;by providing each
user with as many techniques and tools as possible to reduce that
user's particular drug-related problems.&quot;[7] It labels &quot;harm
reduction&quot; the &quot;safe sex&quot; approach to preventing
drug abuse.

<p>

The whole harm reduction approach is a complete reversal of the
&quot;zero tolerance&quot; nature of this nation's recent drug
policy.  According to the ACLU, harm reduction &quot;assumes that
drug users' civil rights and individual autonomy should be respected,
treats drug users as important participants in the process of
gaining or maintaining control over their drug use, and makes
no moral judgment based solely upon an individual's use of drugs.&quot;[8]

<p>

Wayne Roques, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
disagrees. &quot;Harm reduction entails enabling the users to
continue their self-destructive behavior,&quot; says Roques.[9]
&quot;It is more logical to reduce the demand for drugs by improving
and expanding law enforcement, education, prevention, research,
rehabilitation and recovery programs.&quot;[10]

<p>

<center><h3>HARM REDUCTION'S POPULARITY</h3></center>

<p>

The successful anti-drug efforts of the 1980s cut abuse in half
and slowed the flow of illicit drugs to American shores.  That
victory was based on a balanced interdiction (supply reduction)
and simple &quot;just say no&quot; demand reduction policy, but
recently those trends have changed dramatically.

<p>

Demand has increased especially among adolescents. On August
20, 1996, the federal government released the National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse indicating that an estimated 12.8 million
Americans are currently abusing illicit drugs.  Adolescent abuse
is especially high.  Since 1992 drug abuse by teenagers has risen
105 percent.[11]

<p>

As abuse has risen, efforts to reduce supply have declined. Consider
recent evidence.

<p><ul>

<li>A June 1996 General Accounting Office report, &quot;Counternarcotics
Efforts in Mexico,&quot; states, &quot;Mexico is the primary [70
percent] transit country for cocaine entering the United States
from South America.&quot;  The report says that interdiction funding
for the transit zone has declined from &quot;about $1 billion
in fiscal year 1992 to about $570 million in fiscal year 1995.&quot;
This decline happened in spite of the State Department's March
1996 assertion that &quot;no country in the world poses a more
immediate narcotics threat to the United States than Mexico.&quot;[12]

<p>

<li>An April 1996 General Accounting Office report, entitled &quot;U.S.
Interdiction Efforts in the Caribbean Decline,&quot; states that
&quot;30 percent of the cocaine entering the United States comes
through the Caribbean section of the transit zone.&quot;  In November
1993, the executive branch issued a counternarcotics policy which
called for a &quot;controlled shift in emphasis from the transit
zone to the source countries.&quot;  The same GAO report states:
&quot;While a reduction in the interdiction effort was envisioned
in the new cocaine strategy, the strategy also anticipated an
increase in source country funding that never materialized.&quot;[13]

<p>

<li>Domestic efforts to eradicate marijuana have been cut 59 percent
since 1992.[14]

<p>

<li>Since 1993 anti-drug defense funding has been cut 32 percent,
and government-wide interdiction funding has dropped 55 percent.[15]

</ul><p>

No policy shift was announced during the 1992 campaign.  Presidential
candidate Bill Clinton told the Democratic National Convention
in July 1992, &quot;[President Bush] hasn't fought a real war
on crime and drugs. I will.&quot;[16] He promised to combine tough
law enforcement with expanded treatment and prevention programs.

<p>

The President's 1993 &quot;controlled shift&quot; and his 1995
National Drug Strategy left little doubt that interdiction was
taking a backseat to harm reduction with a focus on treatment.
In his strategy Clinton states: &quot;The National Drug Control
Strategy...confirms...my priorities for addressing this nation's
continuing drug problem....This strategy gives those who have
fallen prey to drugs the opportunity to change their behavior.&quot;[17]

<p>

A Pentagon-commissioned report suggests that Clinton's &quot;controlled
shift&quot; has failed.  The 1996 study, by the Institute for
Defense Analyses, a Pentagon-funded think tank, criticizes the
shift away from interdiction to treatment.  It concludes that
interdiction is the most successful and cost-effective way of
dealing with the nation's drug epidemic.  Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.)
said of the Clinton administration and the IDA report, &quot;I
think they knowingly and willingly suppressed this document....If
they are trying to cook the report or modify it from its original
conclusions, I'd be even more concerned.&quot;[18]

<p>

<center><h3>HARM REDUCTION OVERSEAS</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction advocates are quick to tout the successes of foreign
drug policy experiments.  They suggest that America should declare
defeat and mimic foreign drug policy.  On close examination, the
foreign &quot;experiments&quot; may well represent yet another
form of defeat.

<p>

The European Cities on Drug Policy (ECDP) is the primary torch-bearer
for Europe's  harm reduction philosophy.  In 1990, the city of
Frankfurt/Main, Germany hosted ECDP's first international conference
which included officials from 22 cities and regions.  That conference
adopted the so-called Frankfurt Resolution which called for heroin
distribution to drug addicts, decriminalization of cannabis and
the introduction of shooting galleries (safe havens for abusers
to inject illicit drugs).[19] Today, it encourages other cities and
nations to embrace the tenets of harm reduction.  One of its first
disciples was Scotland.

<p>

&quot;Harm reduction really sounds good,&quot; says Kerry Condron,
18, a heroin addict from Glasgow, Scotland, &quot;but it doesn't
work.&quot;[20] Condron says that harm reduction has become another
way of perpetuating addiction.

<p>

Glasgow's harm reduction goal was to prevent the spread of AIDS
and to reduce crime.  Drug addicts were given clean needles and
methadone, a heroin substitute.[21]

<p>

Maxie Richards runs a home for Glasgow addicts.  She says that
harm reduction has become a vested interest of the social service
industry, and with only one purpose: keeping social peace at the
cost of dispensing drugs.  She argues that social workers have
too much power.  According to Richards, the harm reduction approach
says, &quot;If you have to take drugs we can live with it.&quot;[22]
In fact, harm reduction policies are often harmful.

<p>

Richards' views on harm reduction needle-exchanges have scientific
support. The August 3, 1996 edition of <I>The Lancet</I>, a respected
British medical journal, profiled a Montreal, Canada study which
found that injection drug users were two times more likely to
become infected with HIV than those who did not.  Researcher Julie
Bruneau said that the increased HIV risks were &quot;substantial
and consistent...despite extensive adjustments for confounders.&quot;[23]

<p>

The Dutch say they want to &quot;normalize&quot; addicts through
their harm reduction policy.  They do this by providing social
services such as medical care, housing, free methadone and needles.
About half of Amsterdam's [the largest Dutch city] 400 general
medical practitioners prescribe methadone for their patients.[24]

<p>

&quot;Normalizing&quot; includes providing clean needles to addicts.
Ton Quadt, the Rotterdam coordinator of all drug treatment programs
says, &quot;If you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people
don't have to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is
lessened, and I think the Dutch number will prove it.&quot;[25]

<p>

Studies of the Dutch policy provide some revealing numbers indeed.
In 1993, Dr. Karl Gunning, a Dutch physician and a harm reduction
opponent, wrote, &quot;The harm reduction Dutch policy of containing
heroin addiction through distribution of free needles and syringes
and through methadone distribution has not prevented the spread
of heroin addiction, curtailed drug-related crime, nor has it
proven to decrease the level of HIV infection.&quot;[26]

<p>

The Dutch harm reduction policy has, however, contributed to more
abuse.  Dr. Frans Koopsman, public relations director for the
Dutch government-funded treatment center &quot;De Hoop,&quot;
said, &quot;There's no taboo anymore on drug use.  For a great
part drug use is normalized in the sense that youngsters appear
to make no big fuss about using drugs.&quot;  He reports that
adolescent cannabis abuse has doubled since 1990 with perhaps
nine percent using pot on a regular basis.  He also reports that
80 percent of Dutch criminal activity is linked to drug abuse.[28]

<p>

Paul Oldenburger, a Delfzijl businessman, declares, &quot;The
war on drugs -- we lost it a long time ago.&quot;  He offered,
&quot;These coffee shops, they don't just sell the soft drugs.
Hard drugs are available too, and it's an easy step from one
to the other.&quot;[29]

<p>

Ernst Gunst manages a cannabis-selling club in the Dutch town
of Delfzijl.  Gunst's Paradox Cafe operates out of rented, municipally-owned
space and next door to the town library.  His business has the
support of the mayor and police chief.  Gunst explains that his
cafe is an experiment in cannabis regulation.  The town fathers
hope it will drive criminal elements out of business and keep
them out.[30]

<p>

Gunst espouses a harm reduction philosophy, explaining, &quot;The
message is:  Don't do drugs.  But if you want to use drugs, do
it in a healthy, conscious way.&quot;  He warns, &quot;If you
forbid it, people still want to use it, like the U.S. during prohibition.&quot;
Gunst says his cannabis supply is regularly checked for impurities
and the content levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in
cannabis.  He emphasizes health, explaining, &quot;That's why
we sell no soft drinks.  Coca-Cola is just water and sugar. It's
not healthy.&quot;[31]

<p>

The Dutch harm reducers have a worldwide reach via the Internet.
The Dutch drug-dealing firm Neuroroom sells &quot;weedcigars&quot;
and ready-made joints and slices of weed-hash cake via computer.
Payments for the drugs are handled by the Dutch PostBank.  According
to the Internet site, Neuroroom has &quot;successfully delivered
soft drugs to:  Japan, Israel, Sarajevo, USA, Sweden, Norway...and
of course, the Netherlands. Until now, we did a 95 percent delivery.&quot;[32]

<p>

Switzerland is seen as a model harm reduction state and has long
been a social Petri dish.  Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx's closest
collaborator, said, &quot;Small countries like Belgium and Switzerland
are modern political laboratories, the experimental fields in
which the kind of experience is collected that shall be applied
later on in large countries.&quot;

<p>

In 1986, the Swiss began experimenting with needle programs. 
After legalizing over-the-counter syringe sales, the Swiss soon
embraced free needle distribution.  In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz
Park was opened for free needle distribution, and soon the city
was flooded with foreign addicts.  As many as 15,000 needles were
given away each day before the park was closed in 1992.[33]

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program.  She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of harm reducers.[34]

<p>

The Swiss government began a heroin giveaway program in 1993.
There is an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin, morphine
and methadone are given away.  The project, scheduled to end in
December, 1996, includes 700 addicts.  Nearly half of these addicts
are HIV-positive.  They are given free drugs up to nine times
a day.  At night they are given heroin cigarettes for use at home.
The cost is covered by health insurance or the government.[35]

<p>

The experiment's goal, according to Dr. Haller, is to improve
addict health, decrease criminal activity, cut addicts off from
drug dealers and stop abuse.  Unfortunately, the number of addicts
is rising, and the experiment has cut neither illegal drug abuse
nor crime.  It is also reported that police officials in Bern
and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug consumers and
dealers.[36]

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICA'S HARM REDUCTION DISCIPLES</h3></center>

<p>

America's cadre of harm reduction disciples is growing in influence.
They have moved into elitist ranks, and many are financed by
pro-drug billionaire financier George Soros.

<p>

Soros, a Hungarian immigrant worth perhaps $1 billion, reportedly
gave away more than $350-million last year, the bulk to Eastern
European projects.[37] He has invested in American social problems,
such as schools, abortion rights, electoral politics, drugs and
death.  In 1995, he gave $5 million to the American &quot;Project
on Death in America&quot; and over the last few years, he has
given as estimated $15 million to drug legalization organizations.[38]

<p>

Soros is a very influential man.  He deals with social issues,
saying that he indulges his &quot;messianic fantasies in giving
away money.&quot;[39] According to Kevin Quigley, a scholar at the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars in Washington,
Soros is &quot;viewed as having more clout than Secretary of State
Warren Christopher&quot; in Eastern Europe.[40]

<p>

He created the New York-based Open Society Institute to oversee
his programs. OSI has grown from just 64 employees in 1994 to
more than 160 today.  &quot;I want to create an organization,&quot;
says Soros, &quot;that can function without me.&quot;[41] That promises
a long life for his radical drug policy views.

<p>

Soros declares the drug war lost. In his book, <I>Soros on Soros</I>,
he says, &quot;I think that the whole idea of eradicating the
drug problem is a false idea....A drug-free America is simply
not possible....Once you accept this point, you may be able to
develop a more rational approach to the problem.&quot;[42]

<p>

Ethan Nadelmann runs Soros' The Lindesmith Center in New York
and is Soros's mouthpiece on drug legalization.  Nadelmann told
the pro-drug magazine <I>High Times</I>, &quot;If by legalization
you mean it's time to make marijuana available in a regulated
way, then I am for legalization.  If you mean that we should prescribe
heroin for addicts, then, yeah, I am for legalization.  If it
means that we should legalize the personal use of drugs by adult
Americans, well, yeah, I'm for that kind of legalization.&quot;[43]

<p>

&quot;Until a couple of years ago,&quot; Nadelmann told the <I>New
York Times</I>, &quot;there was only one person in the country
giving over $100,000 to the [drug legalization] movement.&quot;
He referred to a Chicago donor named Richard Dennis.  Now, according
to Nadelmann, &quot;there are four, five, six people willing to
give $100,000 or more, of which no one is in Soros's league.&quot;
On March 8, 1996, Soros gave $200,000 to salvage California's
Proposition 215 (the medical marijuana ballot initiative).[44]

<p>

Mr. Soros has also given $6 million to the Washington, D.C.-based
Drug Policy Foundation.  Soros supports the DPF, saying, &quot;I
do think we need a more open debate [on drugs] and more humane
policies in this country....I think the DPF will play a key role
in bringing about these changes.&quot;[45]

<p>

In 1995, the DPF used the money Soros provided to make grants
to groups like the Cannabis Action Network in Berkeley, California
($25,000), New York Harm-Reduction Educators ($25,000), NORML
(two grants totaling $23,000), and the Los Angeles-based Clean
Needles Now ($25,000).[46]

<p>

The DPF frequently hosts Capitol Hill seminars to brief staffers
about drug policy.  Arnold Trebach, DPF's president and an American
University professor, showed his harm reduction colors at a Capitol
Hill seminar, explaining, &quot;[The] dominant morality is that
drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[47] Trebach said
the federal government needle-exchange policy is &quot;obscene&quot;
because Congress has made the use of taxpayer money for needle
giveaways conditional on proof that syringe exchanges reduce the
spread of AIDS without encouraging drug abuse.

<p>

Clearly, wealthy men like Soros have considerable sway with some
politicians.  Soros spokesman Nadelmann told <I>Reason</I> magazine,
&quot;The replacement of the Bush administration with the Clinton
administration was generally a good thing.  It brought in a lot
of new blood, new thinking.&quot;[48] Even Clinton deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott has described Soros as &quot;a national
resource -- indeed, a national treasure.&quot;  Whether the mutual
admiration extends to drug policy remains to be seen.[49]

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON'S HARM REDUCTION CADRE</h3></center>

<p>

This summer the White House grudgingly acknowledged past drug
use by 21 employees.  Secret Service agent Jeff Undercoffer told
a House subcommittee, &quot;I have seen cocaine usage. I have
seen hallucinogenic usages, crack usages.&quot;[50] This is in addition
to the president's and vice president's admission to past drug
use.[51] When faced with his 1992 MTV declaration, &quot;I tried
before [to inhale a marijuana cigarette],&quot; Clinton now says
he regrets the comment.

<p>

Patsy Thomasson, Director of White House administration, once
served at the right hand of Dan Lasater, who pleaded guilty to
federal drug charges.  Her past association with a convicted drug
felon impelled the Senate to vote 98-0 in June 1994 to require
the president to certify that Thomasson has no history of drug
abuse.[52]

<p>

A number of Clinton's non-White House advisors are harm reducers.
His Yale Law School mentor, Steven Duke, advocates legalizing
most illicit drugs in his 1993 book, <I>America's Longest War:
Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</I>.[53] Even the president's
pastor, the Reverend Walter Shropshire of the Foundry United Methodist
Church, has said he believes the government would create &quot;a
safer environment for all of us&quot; if now-illicit drugs were
legalized.[54]

<p>

Clinton's 1992 campaign received drug policy advice from Mathea
Falco. Falco is now the president of Drug Strategies, a non-profit
organization funded by Soros, who gave Falco's organization a
reported $2 million in 1994.

<p>

Falco worked closely with Dr. Peter Bourne, President Carter's
drug policy chief, who fell from power after he allegedly snorted
cocaine at a National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) party.  Dr. Bourne volunteered that &quot;about half
the White House staff&quot; had attended the NORML party &quot;looking
as though they belonged.&quot;[55]

<p>

Falco, once appointed to NORML's board of advisors, believes drug
interdiction does not work and supports medical use of marijuana
and needle exchanges.  In 1977, she told a congressional committee
that she favored marijuana decriminalization.  Falco was seriously
considered a candidate for the Clinton administration's drug czar.[56]

<p>

Mark Kleiman was hired by the administration to review the performance
of the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Kleiman is a UCLA professor
and author of <I>Against Excess,</I> which includes an endorsement
of marijuana legalization.[57] In a 1986 <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
article, he advocated marijuana legalization.  In April 1993,
Kleiman spoke at a conference sponsored by NORML, stating, &quot;The
hardest...problem...facing American drug policy is how to make
the psychedelics available...[f]or their beneficial uses to people.&quot;[58]

<p>

Kleiman continues to have inside influence.  In October 1994,
John Carnevale, director of Office of Planning and Budget, Executive
Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control Policy,
defended the drug czar's decision to employ Kleiman's services.
Carnevale said that Kleiman's organization, BOTEC, Inc., &quot;has
conducted a number of important studies over the past few years
for ONDCP, especially in the area of monitoring the emerging heroin
situation.&quot;[59] Kleiman was listed by then-drug czar Lee Brown
as one of the many &quot;expert individuals&quot; helping the
drug czar formulate the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy.

<p>

Clinton hired Joycelyn Elders as surgeon general.  She stated,
&quot;If the doctor feels that this [marijuana] is an appropriate
medication for his patients to use, I would very much support
the medication being available.&quot;[60] Marijuana has never been
scientifically shown to be either safe or effective for the treatment
of any condition.

<p>

Elders responded to a question from a member of the pro-drug Drug
Policy Foundation at a National Press Club luncheon by stating,
&quot;I do feel that we would markedly reduce our crime rate if
drugs were legalized.&quot;[61] At that time her son's 10-year cocaine
problem was not public.  Over the next year, Kevin Elders was
to be arrested and convicted for selling cocaine to an undercover
agent.  Elders and Clinton's first AIDS czar, Kristine Gebbie,
pushed needle giveaways for drug addicts.[62]

<p>

In January 1994, Philip Lee, Clinton's assistant secretary of
Health and Human Services, announced a review of the federal ban
against the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.[63] Lee's friend,
Dennis Peron, is a leader with California's 1996 marijuana legalization
ballot initiative.[64] Peron's headquarters were inside the Cannabis
Buyers' Club of San Francisco, which illegally sold marijuana
and was raided August 4 by law enforcement agencies.[65] Before Lee
took office in 1993, Peron told an LSD conference that Lee &quot;is going 
to reinstate the medical marijuana program when he is appointed.&quot;[66]

<p>

On January 23, 1996, Clinton radically reversed his drug philosophy.
He hired Army General Barry McCaffrey to mount an all-out attack
against well-entrenched drug traffickers.  This election year
turnaround came on the heels of a call by Senator Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) for abolishing the drug czar's office.

<p>

Shelby blamed the administration for sending &quot;a mixed message
to America's youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.&quot;
&quot;I object to the administration's handling of this issue,&quot;
said Shelby, &quot;[and] its lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;[67]

<p>

Since taking office, McCaffrey has been in damage control mode.
He has patched up relations with Congress and local anti-drug
organizations.  He has re-established a tough approach to the
drug war. Not everyone believes this paradigm shift will last,
however. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> has editorialized that
a second Clinton term will find McCaffrey job hunting.[68]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction is a failed philosophy, much as the &quot;safe
sex&quot; approach has failed to slow the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases among young Americans.  A balanced effort to reduce both
the supply of and demand for drugs worked in the past and will
work again.

<p>

Drug policy has seen at least two historic flip-flops over the
past few decades, each with tragic results.  Under President Richard
Nixon strong interdiction and the creation of the DEA, coupled
with solid demand-reduction efforts, crippled the illicit drug
trade and abuse plummeted.  By contrast, President Jimmy Carter
embraced a harm-reduction philosophy which led to historic levels
of abuse.  Carter's legacy was reversed by Nancy Reagan's &quot;just
say no&quot; campaign.

<p>

The start-up of a serious drug war began during the Reagan-Bush
years, characterized by stiff interdiction balanced with locally
run demand reduction.  The Clinton administration's harm reduction
approach has once again turned policy on its head.  Hopefully,
Mr. Clinton has seen the error of his first three years and General
McCaffrey's tough, anti-harm-reduction approach is indicative
of a renewed seriousness about fighting drugs.

<CENTER><B>Tax Pledge to Small Business A Decisive Factor in '96<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- Taxes will remain the number one issue for small businesses in the 1996 elections, and individuals seeking public office who pledge not to raise taxes while advocating fundamental tax reform will fare better with this large and growing constituency according to a national small business advocacy organization.
<P>
"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the growth and survival of small businesses at ever stage of their development, you can bet that this issue will be a priority for each and every small business person who votes on November 5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill today at a press conference with a coalition of groups supporting the Taxpayer Protection Pledge -- an effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform.  When signed by a Member of Congress or candidate for public office, the Pledge commits the signer to oppose and vote against any effort to raise the federal income tax on individuals or corporations.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  Taking the Pledge separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax and spenders," said Kerrigan.
<P>
According to SBSC, small business owners are drawn towards elected officials and candidates who support tax system reform -- changes that would encourage risk-taking, investment and job creation rather than the attributes of the current system which punish entrepreneurial activities.
<P>
"Taxes are still a hot issue despite what the political pundits say.  Pledge signers, and those who make tax reform a key issue of their campaign have a tremendous advantage over their political challengers," added Kerrigan.
<P>
SBSC is a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization.  For additional information please call <B>Renee Stikes</B> at<B> (202)-785-0238</B>.

<center><h2>TIME FOR A GROWN UP RESPONSE TO DRUGS,<br>
SAYS BAUER</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The adolescent attitude towards
drug use which ignores the life-threatening nature of the problem
must stop,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer
said Friday, as news of the HUD drug scandal began to unfold.

<p>

The <I>Washington Post</I> reported Friday that members of Congress
were questioning a Housing and Urban Development project that
did not eject people who used drugs on federal property. And,
that at least one organization, the Salvation Army, that applied
for grant money was rejected because it would not accept the provision
concerning on-site drug use.

<p>

&quot;This week we're being told by former Surgeon General Joyceln
Elders that the Clinton administration has plans outlined for
needle exchange programs in Clinton's second term. Now we learn
that drug use in a taxpayer-funded housing project was being purposefully
ignored.

<p>

&quot;It's time for a grown up response to the drug problem. It's
time we send a clear signal to our most valuable resource -- our
children -- about the danger of drugs,&quot; Bauer said.

<p>

PROGRAMS AND OTHER CURRENT DRUG ISSUES, CALL THE FRC MEDIA OFFICE

<title> How Government Wastes Your Money: Report No. 3 - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>How Government Wastes Your Money:
Report No. 3</h3>

Compiled by <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ronald D. Utt</a>, Senior Fellow, and <br>
Daniel J. Hickey, Special Assistant to the Vice President for Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 123<br>
October 15, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>

</center>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Earlier this century, H. L. Mencken, the Baltimore journalist and wit, is said to have described government as "a broker in pillage, and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods." While that may have characterized government spending in a simpler time when human motives seemed more straightforward than today, one can only wonder whether even Mencken's immense wit and cynicism would have been up to the task of trying to make sense of the bizarre collection of federal financial abuses described below. As politicians of both parties approach this election with various proposals to cut taxes, and pundits wonder how Americans can pay for them, this month's report offers more instances of waste and excess that could be used as a down payment on promised tax relief.
<p>
<b>Don't Leave Home Without It</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Smart Cards will lead to Smarter Government," a Clinton official said when promoting Vice President Albert Gore's <a href="http://www.npr.gov/index.html">National Performance Review</a> recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards to pay for employee business travel. The Vice President apparently pushed this idea without realizing that the government's bookkeeping capability has not advanced much beyond techniques available to Bob Cratchit and Bartleby the Scrivener. But government employees knew exactly how little oversight there would be, and misuse and fraud have accompanied the program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One hotbed of misuse is the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA was targeted for termination by Congress, but President Clinton successfully resisted--to the relief of the agency's traveling bureaucrats. Commerce's Inspector General reported (Audit Report No. EAD-7129-5-0001/September 1995) that NOAA exceeded its travel budget by 84 percent in 1994 and that numerous employees misused the government travel card with "excessive unpaid charges, use of the card for personal purchases, and questionable automatic teller advances." According to the IG's report, such misuse included payments for meals at Washington-area restaurants and the purchase of liquor, jewelry, flowers, books, music, computer on-line service fees, and automobile insurance. Between 5,000 and 6,000 NOAA employees have such cards. According to the Inspector General, "A primary reason for the abuse is a lack of management and oversight by the agencies."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> D. James Baker, Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmospheres, U.S. Department of Commerce, (202) 482-3436.
<p>
<b>Public Housing Sings the Blues - Again</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Department of <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development's</a> 1.3 million public housing units represent some of the worst housing in America, and the worst of the worst may well be the 13,000 units operated by the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO), the seventh-largest housing authority in the nation. Officially designated "troubled" in 1979, HANO has defied all efforts to correct its manifest deficiencies, even after the investment of a staggering $244 million in federal subsidies over the last three years. As recently as 1994, HUD's Inspector General reported that a random sample of 150 of HANO's housing units found that all 150 failed to meet HUD's housing quality standards. Typical problems included missing ceilings, holes in walls, loose and peeling paint, and roach infestation. A follow-up random survey in 1995, however, did find some improvement--only 93 percent of the sampled units failed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Why the persistent failure to improve this project? The chief reasons may well be the local housing authority's gross mismanagement and misplaced priorities. Despite a maintenance backlog estimated at 36,000 individual work orders, and despite the availability of only one pickup truck for work crews who serviced nine of HANO's ten projects, HANO's management purchased 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles for the central office staff in 1993. Also in that year, HANO's board awarded a $164,000 contract to a joint venture between HANO's former board chairman and a former management contractor who earlier had failed to make good on a $75,000 debt to the authority. Such failings make it easier to understand why the nation's public housing authorities fight so vigorously against federal proposals to replace them with housing vouchers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Kevin E. Marchman, Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, (202) 708-0950.
<p>
<b>Not Covered by Welfare Reform</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It was revealed recently that Sam Donaldson, one of the most highly paid correspondents on ABC News, received U.S. <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a> subsidies of $97,000 over the past two years to help with the mohair sheep he raised on his New Mexico ranch. Now he's back in line for a new government benefit, this time asking the federal government's Animal Damage Control program to help him eradicate the pesky coyotes that keep eating his subsidized sheep on land he leases from the state government for less than a dollar an acre. The <i>Dallas Morning News</i> quotes Mr. Donaldson as saying recently: "The government helps ranchers and farmers and businesses of all kinds. If it's in existence and I'm eligible to use it, I'll use it."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	This attitude apparently is shared by Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, which went Sam one better with its 1,600-acre farm in Georgia, described by <i>The Washington Post</i> as having "no barn, no fence, only a cinder-block shed and a double-wide trailer home that was knocked off its moorings by a tornado this spring. The land was dotted with rusted farm implements, dented fuel barrels, mangled trailers, [and] a fragile pickup truck." The farm nevertheless received a payment of $36,977 last year from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for <i>not</i> growing crops on 821 acres of its land. The Heritage Foundation estimates that last year, approximately 259 million other Americans joined Mr. Farrakhan in not growing crops, and might therefore be eligible for the same no-grow government bonus. Prospective beneficiaries may call Mr. Grant B. Buntrock at (202) 720-3467 to determine their eligibility for the payment and to receive information on how to become eligible for the no-grow bonus in the future. Buntrock is the Administrator of the Farm Service Agency, the USDA division that operates the bonus program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Daniel Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, (202) 720-3631.
<p>
<b>More Than a Million Dollars a Minute</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even with a federal subsidy of $750 million per year, equaling $47 per passenger, <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a> still loses millions. On August 10, 1996, Amtrak announced that an expected $250 million deficit forced it to eliminate three train routes and service to 42 towns and cities. But while Amtrak was shutting down its service to Boise and Dallas, it was trying to start up a costly new service between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine. Although that route is already served by a taxpaying private bus company that offers a two hour ride for $15 per trip, Amtrak proposes to spend $40 million of taxpayer money to offer competing service. According to railroad experts in Massachusetts, the new Amtrak service will take two and one-half hours to make the trip -- 30 minutes longer than the private bus that now serves the route.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's In Charge:</b> Gordon J. Linton, Administrator, Federal Transit Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, (202) 366-4040.
<p>
<b>U.S. Taxpayers Fund Egyptian Obituaries</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Each year, the United States provides Egypt with more than $815 million in foreign aid. Despite this vast financial assistance, however, Egypt remains a poor country, largely because of its commitment to failed socialist principles and the U.S. government's apparent indifference to this commitment. Egypt also maintains a huge bureaucracy whose employees are estimated to work approximately 27 minutes per day -- which may explain why they have become so dependent on U.S. welfare, why Egypt is the 48th-poorest country in the world, and why half its population is unable to read.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports reveal that substantial amounts of American aid to Egypt -- up to one-third of the total spent on some projects -- are lost through gross misuse of the money. Take for example the $3.4 million provided to, and spent by, the National Bank for Development in Cairo. According to AID's auditor, more than $1 million of what the bank spent was used for questionable purposes, with $693,000 of this amount deemed ineligible and $329,900 described as unsupported. AID heavily censored most of the dollar figures in the report provided to Heritage, but there was enough information to deduce that much of the wasted money appeared to benefit personally many of the Egyptian Bank officials directly involved in the project.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chief among the ineligible expenditures were bonuses paid to the Bank's chairman, project director, and senior officers. Although the amounts taken by members of this group were censored by AID, the auditor did note that they "appear excessive considering the loan fund has just recently reached operational break even." Bonuses also were paid to more junior bank employees and project employees. According to AID's October 1, 1995, Report No. 6-263-96-001-N, taken together these ineligible bonuses cost the U.S. taxpayer $629,000. Other ineligible expenses incurred by bank employees and officials included costs of parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, meals, entertainment, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
East of Cairo, in the Gaza Strip bordering Israel, is the headquarters of the AID-funded Society for the Care of the Handicapped in the Gaza Strip. According to the audit, $1.5 million of the Society's $9 million budget was spent on ineligible or unsupported purposes, including an apartment in Arlington, Virginia, for the Society's Palestinian chairman. According to AID audit Report No. 6-294-96-006-N, the chairman billed AID for the apartment's rent, security, "significant" telephone charges, and maid service; the cost of an automobile (including traffic fines and parking tickets); medical costs for his family; and cable TV. He also illegally billed the U.S. for travel expenses to his Virginia getaway (including airfare for his wife), other living expenses beyond those described above, and a gun for his Palestinian bodyguard. In response to the audit findings, the chairman claimed that "Cable TV was needed because only CNN produced quick and detailed accounts of what was happening in the occupied territories."

<b>Who's in Charge:</b> J. Brian Atwood, Director, U.S. International Development Cooperation Agency, (202) 647-9620.

<b>Food Stamps for Caviar</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This year, the government will spend over $26.3 billion on the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/fcs/fs.htm">Food Stamp Program</a>. More than 10 percent -- approximately $3 billion -- of this amount will be lost to fraud and abuse, according to testimony by Roger A. Viadero, Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. One reason is that "food stores" accepting food stamps can be in the program without any required preauthorization visits. Once a store is authorized to accept stamps, visits by inspectors are rare and fraud is frequent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In one instance, a South Carolina retailer redeemed over $300,000 worth of food stamps over a two-year period despite the fact that the only "store" he owned was a fleet of 12 ice cream trucks. Across the country, in Los Angeles, California, a liquor store was removed from the program after an inspection revealed that its food inventory consisted of a few containers of milk and a limited supply of canned goods with expiration dates long passed. Further north, in Alameda County, a pizza parlor was authorized to accept food stamps even though it did not sell foods for home preparation. An employee told government investigators that the store was not authorized to accept the stamps but still averaged $3,500 a month in food stamp sales.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The behavior of some of the nation's 25 million food stamp recipients accounts for the rest of the abuse, as demonstrated by a <i>New York Post</i> report that a New York couple bought over $120 worth of caviar at a grocery store using food stamps, then sold the product at a flea market for a profit. Skeptical cashiers checked the regulations on allowable purchases and found that food stamps can indeed be used to purchase caviar. It turns out that the actions of the couple were not illegal. Elsewhere, a transient was able to collect $21,000 in food stamps from 16 states over a three-and-a-half-year period by traveling from city to city by bus for a few weeks each month and applying for the stamps under an assumed name. The man would wait the required waiting period for application approval and then make a return trip to collect the stamps. While travel was inconvenient, he told investigators that "getting the stamps was easy." In Tennessee, a woman with assets valued at over $350,000 was charged in August of this year with illegally receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period. Her husband is president of a security company.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Yvette S. Jackson, Deputy Administrator, Food Stamp Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture, (703)305-2026. The public is encouraged to report violations of the food stamp program by calling 1-800-424-9121, the toll-free number for the USDA's Inspector General in Washington, D.C.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An activist labor movement may be the most significant new force in American politics, but the agenda of labor's new leaders is radically different from that of the traditional labor movement. Curiously, much of this new agenda is unconnected with workplace issues, not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and clearly outside the mainstream of American politics. In recent decades, organized labor has been transformed from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Organized labor has decided to use its billions of dollars in dues revenue to defeat conservative Members of Congress, while also encouraging the Boy Scouts to admit homosexuals and atheists, offering financial contributions to political groups that promote abortion, and opposing welfare reform and a balanced budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While political parties have moved to the center and right, union activism has shifted decisively to the left. This transformation has occurred in tandem with a historic change in union membership from private-sector, largely industrial workers toward government and service employees. Unions began organizing the public sector in the 1960s and 1970s to offset a continuing decline in membership, particularly in manufacturing. New AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, the first federation leader from a government employee-dominated union, came to power when his coalition of service and public-sector unions toppled former president Lane Kirkland and his industry-based allies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The desires of government employees, however, have proven to be in conflict with the interests of blue-collar workers, who now get billed twice for big government: Thanks to their unions' lobbying efforts, private-sector workers pay high taxes to support bloated bureaucracies in Washington and state capitals around the country. Meanwhile, union dues are used to support political causes that are irrelevant to the bread-and-butter interests of the average worker. There is no evidence that the new union leadership's radical political campaign will do anything but accelerate the exit of union members, especially in the private sector. Workers who once formed the backbone of the American labor movement now find themselves paying higher and higher fees to unions that are paying less and less attention to the real interests of their members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fairness, it should be easier than it now is for union members to opt out of radical politicking by obtaining a refund of the significant portion of their dues that is used to support such efforts. In view of organized labor's growing politicization, policymakers should re-examine the unique privileges that have been granted to unions.

<p>
<b>THE POLITICAL TRADITION OF AMERICAN LABOR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Writing over a decade ago in <i>Policy Review</i>, labor analyst Max Green decried the full-scale embrace of Walter Mondale's presidential candidacy by Lane Kirkland, the AFL-CIO's president from 1979-1995.<sup>2</sup>  Green argued that Kirkland's actions, taken at the behest of public employee unions, represented the ultimate rejection of the ideas of American Federation of Labor founder Samuel Gompers. Gompers made sure that labor kept "its distance both from socialism and from partisan politics," focusing instead on organizing and winning concessions from business through collective bargaining. In the first half of this century, the AFL even refused to support minimum-wage legislation. In those days, labor was committed to the market economy and "opted for what Gompers and his associates called `trade unionism pure and simple,' the collective-bargaining strategy on which workers of every political stripe could agree."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If labor unions did take a political stand, it was generally centrist, especially on social issues. In 1968, when the United Auto Workers threatened to leave the AFL-CIO because of AFL-CIO founder George Meany's opposition to an alliance with activist left intellectuals and students, Meany bid the UAW good riddance. In 1972, labor unions joined with the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, a group established to move the Democratic Party to the center, but abandoned the effort in 1974 in order to concentrate once again on economic issues. The colorful Alan Barkan, AFL-CIO political director in 1972, denounced the McGovernites for turning the Democratic Party into the "party of acid, amnesty, and abortion."<sup>4</sup>

<p>
<b>DECLINING MEMBERSHIP AND THE TURN TO GOVERNMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For all the media focus on upheaval in the AFL-CIO, the federation's political aggressiveness and renewed emphasis on organizing have neither stemmed declines in union membership nor markedly improved working conditions; "wage growth is at historically sluggish levels, and labor's share of the growing national income is currently at its lowest level in two decades."<sup>5</sup>  In spite of these trends, workers apparently do not see joining unions as a remedy. In the mid-1950s, 35 percent of America's workers were unionized; today, fewer than 15 percent belong to unions. Leo Troy, a labor economist at Rutgers University, notes that unions have lost 7.5 million members since 1970, largely in the shrinking industrial sector.<sup>6</sup>  In response to these declining numbers, unions have attempted to bring more public employees into the fold. Of the 16.4 million union members in America, 6.9 million work directly for federal, state, and local governments.<sup>7</sup>  Despite the aggressive efforts of numerous AFL-CIO affiliates to recruit government workers, however, Sweeney has been forced to admit failure: "We are still losing members as an absolute number, and as a percentage of the workforce."<sup>8</sup>  In fact, the number of union members fell from 16.7 million in 1994 to 16.4 million last year.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO altered its moderate political stance as it moved beyond the shrinking manufacturing sector. As the union movement has grown more dependent on the public sector, it has moved squarely into the liberal camp, forging the very alliances that Gompers and Meany had shunned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In October 1995, public employee unions such as the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and Service Employees' International Union (SEIU) spearheaded a successful rebellion to depose Lane Kirkland as president of the AFL-CIO. John Sweeney, head of the SEIU, became the first AFL-CIO president from a largely public-sector union, completing the federation's transformation from a voice for workers in negotiating with management into one of the nation's principal defenders of big government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The labor movement's efforts to organize public employees may do more for big government than for private-sector union members, who would benefit from balanced budgets, lower taxes, and less intrusive government. Although bloated bureaucracies might be in the interest of a federal employee in Washington, D.C., or a municipal employee in Cleveland, Ohio, the man or woman on the automobile assembly line in Hamtramck, Michigan, benefits directly from lower taxes. Deficit spending comes out of their paychecks. By siding disproportionately with the interests of government employees, the AFL-CIO is neglecting the millions in its ranks who work in the private sector.
<p>
<b>LURCHING LEFTWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More significant than its defense of big government is organized labor's continuing leftward lurch on a broad array of issues. Liberal activists have captured the union movement and are using its influence to move the Democratic Party to the left by "controlling the debate," as AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard Trumka puts it.10  Trumka and other AFL-CIO officials, for example, regularly denounce the so-called New Democrats who have sought to move the party away from its traditional big-government agenda. Trumka has decried the agenda of the Democratic Leadership Council, the leading organization of centrist Democrats, as "immoral ... anti-worker [and] a blueprint for political disaster."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The AFL-CIO's "Union Summer" project, originally designed to train 1,000 young people to become union organizers, also is being used for "voter education and registration" as well as to fight the California Civil Rights Initiative.<sup>12</sup>  This shift epitomizes the transformation from recruitment to politicking. It is not surprising, however, considering that Union Summer's director, Andrew Levin, boasts of having made a career of "apartheid, anti-nuclear, environment, civil rights, community organizing, union organizing, and student protest" activism.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO has become a leading funder of liberal causes, lending its rhetoric, foot soldiers, and coffers to a variety of movements. Under Sweeney, this shift to the left has accelerated, leaving organized labor outside the political mainstream on issues ranging from racial preferences to sexual preferences, tax policy, and protecting American national interests abroad:
<p><ul>
<li> The AFL-CIO has strongly opposed the $500-per-child tax credit.
<p>
<li> The National Education Association, United Auto Workers, and AFL-CIO have lobbied against legislation to make English America's official language.
<p>
<li> Several AFL-CIO unions have donated thousands of dollars to Emily's List and other pro-abortion political action committees.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1996 election cycle, as part of their drive to control the debate, the activists who have captured the AFL-CIO have not hesitated to use workers' hard-earned dues money to fund their aggressive political campaign. The AFL-CIO has pledged to spend $35 million -- seven times the amount it normally spends in an election year -- in an effort to unseat 75 conservative Members of Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The AFL-CIO's new leaders are pushing a cultural and economic agenda that does not represent the views of the federation's members. In some cases, labor leaders have taken positions directly counter to the interests of working families. Often, they have chosen to highlight issues with no relevance to collective bargaining, taking advantage of their roles and organizational resources to advance their own agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For instance, the leadership of the Detroit chapter of AFSCME passed an emergency resolution last year condemning the death sentence meted out to a man convicted of murdering a police officer in Pennsylvania.<sup>14</sup>  As leader of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney has continued this trend. In a March 1995 address to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition, for instance, Sweeney declared "that as long as I am president of our federation, the AFL-CIO will `be there' for you."<sup>15</sup>  Yet Jackson remains one of the most controversial figures in American politics; a December 1995 <i>Wall Street Journal</i>/NBC News poll showed that of 2,007 Americans polled, 46 percent viewed Jackson either somewhat negatively or very negatively, compared to just 26 percent who viewed him either very positively or somewhat positively.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider some of organized labor's recent stances on issues wholly unrelated to collective bargaining:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Homosexuality:</b> Joe Velasquez, Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO, led a 1995 campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Velasquez even lectured the Boy Scouts about the need to reexamine their views and "decide if they are living up to their mission of teaching America's children the values that made this country great."<sup>17</sup>  AFL-CIO affiliates in Colorado and Maine took leading roles in campaigns to oppose efforts in those states to outlaw ordinances that would have given homosexuals special constitutional privileges. Other unions have taken an active role in promoting homosexual rights through donations to political action committees. Since 1993, AFSCME has donated over $5,000 to the Human Rights Campaign Fund, which promotes homosexual "marriage."  The Service Employees International Union has pushed actively for spousal rights for homosexual partners.<sup>18</sup>  All of this despite the fact that over 80 percent of Americans support a law banning same-sex marriages.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<b>Abortion:</b> William Hamilton, Jr., who ran the Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Washington office for 13 years, now directs the legislative and political program of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.<sup>20</sup>  Hamilton was one of 12 members of the AFL-CIO Political Action Transition Workgroup, which decided to launch the effort to defeat 75 conservative members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996.<sup>21</sup>  Through its various political action committees, the union movement has funded several pro-abortion groups. Earlier this year, AFSCME donated $5,000 to Americans for Freedom of Choice. Over the past three years, Emily's List has received contributions of $2,500 from the AFL-CIO, $5,000 from the NEA, $10,000 from AFSCME, $5,000 from the Communications Workers of America, $7,500 from the SEIU, and $7,000 from the UAW. Voters for Choice has accepted $7,000 from AFSCME and $4,000 from the NEA. The NEA also donated $2,500 to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The Women's Campaign Fund has taken money from numerous unions, including AFSCME ($5,000), the AFL-CIO ($4,000), the CWA ($7,500), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ($15,000), the Letter Carriers ($6,000), the UAW ($15,000), and the UMW ($5,500).<sup>22</sup>  AFSCME was sued earlier this year by Edward P. Kelly, a devout Roman Catholic who objected to the use of union funds to lobby for abortion rights.<sup>23</sup>  A federal judge ruled that AFSCME had violated Mr. Kelly's religious liberties under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and allowed him to donate part of his agency fees to a charitable organization instead.
<p>
<b>Racial and Gender Preferences:</b> Polls indicate that over 80 percent of Americans -- black and white -- oppose racial preferences,<sup>24</sup> but the AFL-CIO staunchly supports these measures, using union members' dues to support programs that will discriminate against members and their families.<sup>25</sup>  The UAW lobbied against H.R. 2128, a bill to eliminate federal affirmative action programs,<sup>26</sup> and several unions are organizing to oppose the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would end racial preferences in public education, government hiring, and government contracts. The California Teachers Association, the United Farm Workers, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and local affiliates of the American Federation of Teachers, the SEIU, and the AFL-CIO all plan to publish pamphlets and man phone banks to get out the vote against the CCRI.
<p>
<b>English as Official Language:</b> Despite the fact that eight out of ten Americans support making English the official language, several national and international unions, including the UAW, the NEA, and the AFL-CIO, have opposed legislation to implement the idea.<sup>27</sup>  The AFL-CIO Executive Council declared that it was "deeply disturbed" by the U. S. House of Representatives' passage of the English as the Official Language of Government Act, claiming that the law "would weaken the federal government's ability to deal effectively with the challenges of living in a global age."<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<b>Welfare:</b> In a recent poll of 1,000 union members, 87 percent voiced support for welfare reform that both requires recipients to work and limits the amount of time someone may receive welfare checks.<sup>29</sup>  Nevertheless, labor unions have tapped into the dues of their members to assure that the indolent not have to seek employment. In its year-end report for 1995, AFSCME has bragged about its work with the American Civil Liberties Union in suing various state and local agencies concerning welfare issues.<sup>30</sup>  AFSCME has been particularly aggressive in opposing time limits on cash payments and in fighting workfare, the concept that welfare recipients should work for benefits.<sup>31</sup>  John Sweeney described the recently passed welfare reform bill as "anti-poor, anti-immigrants, anti-women and anti-children," and said that it was a "sad day" when President Clinton signed it.<sup>32</sup>  The AFL-CIO also has decried attempts to prohibit alcohol and drug addicts from receiving welfare through Supplemental Security Income (SSI).<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>The Federal Budget:</b> Some 82 percent of union members surveyed support amending the Constitution to require Congress to balance the budget.<sup>34</sup>  Yet the AFL-CIO leadership opposes a balanced budget amendment.<sup>35</sup>  The average working family pays thousands of dollars a year in taxes simply to pay the interest on the national debt, but the AFL-CIO and its allies have chosen to side with the status quo and leave working families to pay the bill. According to a February 1995 AFSCME Legislative Alert, "President McEntee and Secretary-Treasurer Lucy have announced that defeat of the Balanced Budget Amendment is our number one national legislative priority. It is urgent that you call your Senators and urge them to vote `NO' on <i>any</i> version of the balanced budget amendment."<sup>36</sup>  Moreover, says the AFL-CIO, "We strongly oppose the [$500-per-child tax credit and other] tax provisions of the `Contract with America.'"<sup>37</sup>  Given the fact that 78 percent of union members support the tax credit, one wonders just who the AFL-CIO means by "we."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
<b>Christian Conservatives and New Age Religion:</b> As part of its efforts to "build solidarity among many kinds of movements,"<sup>39</sup> organized labor gave its blessing to an April 1996 "Summit on Ethics and Meaning" organized by Michael Lerner, a 1960s radical who has emerged more recently as a sort of New Age "politics of meaning" guru to Hillary Clinton.<sup>40</sup>  AFL-CIO President Sweeney was the featured dinner speaker at the conference, which was convened by, among others, People for the American Way, the <i>Utne Reader</i>, the Institute for Policy Studies, and Planned Parenthood of America's Clergy Advisory Board. In his speech, Sweeney declared that participants in the conference were the "core of a progressive coalition that will expand the frontiers of social justice."  One of key goals of the conference was to educate the public about "the deprivation of meaning in daily life and how our hunger for meaning is used and manipulated by racist, xenophobic, nationalist, fascist and fundamentalist religious groups in ways that set people against each other."<sup>41</sup>  The AFL-CIO's bias was made even clearer by an attack in the <i>AFL-CIO News</i> on the Christian Coalition, the American Family Association, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and the National Association of Christian Educators. The <i>AFL-CIO News</i> alleged that these "religious extremists pose a significant threat to those candidates who would best represent America's working families."<sup>42</sup>  At the same time, the AFL-CIO and the Letter Carriers union have given political action committee donations to the quasi-religious Natural Law Party.<sup>43</sup>  This party, founded by adherents of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, claims that a few government-run centers for Transcendental Meditation would reduce crime, illness, terrorism, and war by reducing the global stress level.<sup>44</sup>  Professionals skilled in this meditative technique allegedly can become smarter, halt the aging process, and levitate.

Many union members do not agree with such extreme positions. AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson admitted earlier this year that "labor was all over the place [in 1994]: taking positions on gun control, on abortion. Those issues affect us, but our membership told us in surveys that they felt we were not concentrating enough on bread-and-butter issues: pay increases, job security, a better tomorrow for them and their families."<sup>45</sup>  When union members are evenly split on a controversial issue that has little to do with their standard of living, their leaders should avoid taking either a conservative or a liberal position. At the very least, members should not be forced to finance causes they oppose.

<p>
<b>SWEENEY'S FIRST YEAR: LABOR SOCIALISM IN ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The union movement is gradually adopting the tactics of European-style labor socialism. In a December 1995 speech, Sweeney offered the following insight into his thought: "I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton, and I couldn't help but be impressed with what is going on in France. In this country, when we're faced with cuts in vital services that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few parts of the government. In France, the workers shut down the country -- even though only 8 percent of the work force is organized!"<sup>46</sup>  Sweeney's admiration for the efforts of the French Communist-backed General Confederation of Labor and its stranglehold on many of France's key public-sector agencies is an ominous indication of the AFL-CIO's political agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The New Voice platform on which Sweeney ran for the AFL-CIO presidency promised to "challenge the right-wing domination of the media in politics."<sup>47</sup>  This unusual claim shows just how far out of the political mainstream Sweeney and his colleagues are. In a recent Roper Center survey of Washington print correspondents and bureau chiefs, only 2 percent described themselves as conservative, compared to 91 percent who saw themselves as liberal to moderate.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This vision of American politics is not surprising given Sweeney's political history. <i>Democratic Left</i>, a publication of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), boasts that Sweeney is a card-carrying DSA member.<sup>49</sup>  The DSA, founded by avowed socialist Michael Harrington, seeks to establish "an openly socialist presence in American communities and politics."  While running for AFL-CIO President, Sweeney worked closely with the DSA by picketing the Columbus office of House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-OH).<sup>50</sup>  The DSA, moreover, is urging youth involvement in Sweeney's Union Summer project: "single-issue progressive young activists have all found a home in unions. And through the labor movement, those activists have learned the connectedness of various forms of oppression and exploitation."<sup>51</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of George Meany and even Lane Kirkland, the AFL-CIO supported the Cold War and military intervention, if necessary, to protect American national interests. The DSA, a bastion of the very type of "blame America first" thinking that Meany, in particular, condemned, opposed U.S. foreign policy in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Although Sweeney has issued few statements on foreign policy, it is worth noting that in January 1991, when he was head of the SEIU, he and Steve Rosenthal, now the AFL-CIO's political director, spearheaded a coalition of labor leaders opposed to the Gulf War.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sweeney and the rest of the new AFL-CIO leadership have even been praised by the Communist Party, U.S.A., a virulent critic of the federation under George Meany's leadership. "Headed by President John Sweeney," writes CPUSA National Chairman Gus Hall, "the new leadership is also involved in a process of radicalization and militancy that is already evident in the activities and commitment of resources in the election campaign, organizing the unorganized and the campaign to win a higher minimum wage."<sup>52</sup>  Reflecting on various speeches at the AFL-CIO convention (including Sweeney's), Hall wrote that "The radical shift in both leadership and policy is a very positive, even historic change. We do not want to take any credit for the shift, but our Party has advocated class struggle policies throughout its 75 years."<sup>53</sup>

<p>
<b>POLITICAL EXPLOITATION OF UNION MEMBERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The shift from collective bargaining to aggressive political activism has not been limited to issuing cultural manifestos and press releases. Several unions have become heavily involved in partisan politics as well. Despite the fact that union members split their vote roughly 60-40 between the two major parties in 1994, the AFL-CIO has launched an overwhelmingly partisan $35 million "voter education project," funded mainly by mandatory union dues, to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. In the words of AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal, the 40 percent who supported Republicans simply voted "wrong."<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unions played a key role at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. NEA President Keith Geiger spoke at the convention and was preaching largely to the choir: 405 NEA members were among the approximately 5,000 delegates.<sup>55</sup>  In addition to that huge total, 889 other delegates came from 44 different international unions, according to the AFL-CIO.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO leadership's efforts to re-elect President Clinton undoubtedly will continue through the fall. Executive Vice-President Linda Chavez-Thompson proclaimed at a union rally that "we will not have a day of rest until Bill Clinton and Al Gore are back in the White House."<sup>57</sup>  Other unions, including the SEIU, plan to close their headquarters in late October and use their staff for a get-out-the-vote effort. This blatant partisanship would be illegal if undertaken by any other type of organization. Even more important, however, it does nothing to advance the economic interests of working-class families.
<p>
<b>LABOR'S LEFT WING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The nation's largest union, the National Education Association, epitomizes labor's leftward political tilt. At its 1995 annual convention, delegates passed a resolution stating that "the NEA believes that the following programs and practices are detrimental to public education and must be eliminated: privatization, performance contracting, tax credits for tuition to private and parochial schools, voucher plans... and evaluations by private, profit making groups."<sup>58</sup>  The NEA also has been outspoken in supporting multiculturalism, bilingual education, condom distribution, and abortion. With public school education in a downward spiral, the NEA should be concentrating on stopping this decline; instead, it is pursuing a partisan political agenda. The NEA employs nearly 1,500 people to organize teachers to participate in political activity.<sup>59</sup>  Clearly, though, it is the close financial ties between the NEA and the Democratic Party that should be of the greatest concern to dues-paying members. "In 1994, [the NEA] gave 99 percent of its PAC money -- about $2.27 million -- to Democrats" despite the fact that 30 percent of NEA members are Republicans.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Several unions are trying to push the AFL-CIO even farther to the left. The United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, and the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers used union dues to finance last month's founding convention of the Labor Party, a new organization which plans to compete with the Democratic Party on the left.<sup>61</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The National Labor Relations Act, the basic federal legislation governing labor unions, empowers unions to provide on-the-job representation for workers in terms of wages, benefits, and working conditions. The AFL-CIO's new leaders have shunned this role, preferring to serve as spokesmen for and financial supporters of an activist political agenda. Politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues.62  The labor movement needs to return to basics and concentrate on representing union workers in collective bargaining with management. If organized labor is unwilling to return to its chartered role as collective bargaining agent, then union privileges should be re-examined.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although unions have a right to participate in politics, they should not finance their political activities through compulsory membership dues. Simple fairness demands that union leaders not be permitted to exact dues from members and then divert union resources to political causes many of those members do not support. The U. S. Constitution itself protects workers against such abuses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a 1988 decision, <i>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.<sup>63</sup>  But these traditional union functions may represent only a small fraction of today's union spending; in a case involving the NEA and two of its affiliates, for example, the union was able to justify only 10 percent of its general treasury funds as chargeable to bargaining activities.<sup>64</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Labor unions are supposed to defend the rights of working men and women, not trample them: The law says that workers should have this money returned to them if they wish. The Luntz survey cited above showed that 78 percent of union workers were unaware that they had the right to a refund of the portion of their mandatory dues that goes to political activity. The same survey revealed that 56 percent of those union members would be likely to request a refund rather than let labor leaders use the money to advance their own political agenda.<sup>65</sup>  The number of members who would ask for refunds probably would increase substantially if members knew that labor leaders were spending their dues money to fight tax cuts for working families, welfare reform that requires recipients to work, and a balanced budget--all of which rank-and-file members support overwhelmingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tide may be starting to turn. John Joyce, head of the International Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, recently refused to join in the AFL-CIO's endorsement of President Clinton for re-election. Spurred by the President's veto of a bill that would have banned partial-birth abortions, Joyce said that while labor leaders should be taking positions on economic issues, "union members do not necessarily want or expect union leaders to take a position on issues, like abortion or gun control, where there's no obvious connection to their lives as a union member."<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While labor unions have a right to get involved in politics, they should not use compulsory membership dues to finance a specific political agenda. Labor leaders are free to associate with such groups as the Democratic Socialists of America, the Natural Law Party, or Planned Parenthood; but as the Supreme Court declared in <i>Beck</i>, they have no business trying to compel millions of union members to support this extreme political agenda with mandatory union dues.
