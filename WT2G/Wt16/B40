<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   In a speech some hailed as courageous and others said was classic Clinton, the President said July 19 that race
and gender preferences are fair, and have lived up to their purpose of removing obstacles blocking opportunities for
minorities and women. He issued a directive to federal departments and a 100-page report advocating reforms to
ensure that programs benefit those who need help the most.<p>
     The President ordered the elimination or overhaul of any program that "creates a quota, creates preferences
for unqualified individuals, creates reverse discrimination or continues even after its equal opportunity purposes
have been achieved."<P>
     Clinton also called for a new federal set-aside program to target federal contracts to businesses in poor
areas even if they are owned by whites.  Currently, set-asides are reserved for women and minorities.<P>
     The president's remarks cheered leaders of women's groups and minorities, who are an instrumental part
of his political base.  Myrlie Evers-Williams, head of the NAACP, praised Clinton for "his bold, decisive
statement."<P>
     But Rep. Gary Franks, a black Republican from Connecticut, said Clinton's proposals could only add to
"the stigma of any person of color" who must repeatedly proved his or her qualifications. Franks sought,
unsuccessfully, to attach an amendment to a defense spending bill that would wipe out race-and gender-based
preferences for future federal contracts.  The House delayed consideration of the FY96 defense appropriations
measure until after the August recess and, thus, scuttled Franks' amendment in the process.<P>
     In sharp attack at the House leadership, Franks said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) And others
indicated they supported his proposal and would back his effort to attach the measure to the defense spending bill. 
Instead, the Rules Committee did not even vote on whether to grant Franks a waiver.  It approved by unanimous
voice vote a rule government floor debate under which Franks' proposal could be easily killed.<P>
     "I was lied to for seven weeks," Franks said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, adding that
it left "a bitter taste in [his] mouth."  According to Franks, House leaders lost their nerve after members of the
Congressional Black Caucus threatened to use parliamentary tactics to tie up the House to block the Franks
amendment.<P>
     Gingrich has been criticized within his party recently for saying the GOP should go a bit slower on the
affirmative action front until the party has a positive agenda to promote to potential black voters.  The House
Speaker is wise in this regard and is on the right track, despite what some conservatives say.<P>  
     Since the party does not have a record of defending civil rights in the recent past, it lacks the moral
authority at this time to simply do away with those measures which have offered some protections to minorities and
women.  The GOP must present an alternative approach.  Simply saying society should now be color-blind, when it
is clearly not, is either naive or cynical.<P>
     Along with Gingrich, presidential candidate Lamar Alexander has perhaps made the most sensible
suggestion regarding the GOP's approach to affirmative action.  "We need to be talking about equal opportunity,"
he said on CNN's "Inside Politics" program on Aug. 2.  "When we talk about racial preferences, we need to also say
we're against racial discrimination.  We have to be very careful concerning this issue," he added.<P>
     Alexander is right.  Affirmative action is a delicate, emotionally charged issue and all politicians would do
well to handle it in a thoughtful manner.<p>
<a name="democratic"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   The Democratic Party has targeted two Congressional seats currently held by black Republicans for defeat in
1996.  Republican Rep. Gary Franks of Connecticut and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma were both listed in a directive
called "Majority  96," in which the Democrats indicated the seats by state they'd like to regain in order to have a
majority in the U.S. House and Senate.<P>
     The directive says Franks "won with only 52% of the vote in 1994.  Bush won the district, but it can be
easily claimed by the Democrats in 1996."<P>
     Regarding Watts, the edict described him as the freshman who "won seat vacated by Dave McCurdy with a
low 51% of the vote" (actually, Watts received 52%).  "This charismatic quarterback led the Oklahoma University
Sooners in the early  80s and won over his Democratic district in 1994," the document continued.  "While
consistently a Democratic area, the district nevertheless favored Bush by 9 points in 1992."<P>
     Other districts targeted included the 9th District of Texas, currently represented by Steve Stockman; the
22nd District of California, represented by freshman Andrea Seastrand who narrowly won Michael Huffington's
open seat with 49% of the vote; and the 1st District of Idaho, represented by Helen Chenoweth.<p>

<a name="memo"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
Democrats often accuse Republicans of playing the race card, but an internal memo sent to President Clinton
from his pollster, Stanley Greenberg, demonstrates that while Democrats claim to be "color-blind" in public, they
play racial politics behind the scenes.<P>
     The memo, dated July 5, 1995, is addressed to the Clintons and Gores, White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Harold Ickes and Erskine Bowles, and the President's Senior Advisor George
Stephanopoulos.  The contents were revealed in a CNN "Inside Politics" broadcast in August.<P>
     "The President is fundamentally mispositioned for 1996, and. . .white downscale voters question whether
Mr. Clinton's initiatives matter to them and whether he understands and identifies with their lives and daily
struggles," said Greenberg's memo.  The memo cites specific groups the President needs to win over or win back
next year: White working class women, union members, older working class men and rural Latinos."<p>

<a name="finance"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   A principal operative for the Alan Keyes presidential campaign has resigned and signed on with Pat Buchanan's
campaign team.<P>
     Arthur Rocker, former finance director for candidate Keyes, agreed to join Buchanan as a national co-chairman, he said in an interview.  Rocker officially accepted the position Aug. 8.<P>
     Rocker recruited Keyes to run for president last fall and played a major role in the formation of the
exploratory committee.  After helping Keyes raise more than $300,000 during the first six months of the year,
Rocker left the campaign, saying, "I'm disgusted with his [Keyes'] organizational skills and question his leadership
ability."<P>
     For its part, the Keyes campaign said Rocker had been the source of "still-unresolved discrepancies in the
finances" of the exploratory committee.  However, the Keyes organization is the only one among the Republican
presidential candidates which has failed to file a Federal Elections Commission financial disclosure report or
requested an extension.  Keyes says he was "too busy to do it," according to a Baltimore Sun report.<P>
     The fundraising specialist said that, as a Buchanan operative, he would do whatever was asked of him.  "I
admire Buchanan's commitment to conservative values.  He's been consistent in his positions over the years," said
Rocker.<p>

<a name="house"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   House Speaker Newt Gingrich dropped into unfamiliar surroundings the evening of Aug. 2 as he listened for
more than an hour to residents of Washington asking--and sometimes begging--him to help their city out of its
morass of problems.<P>
     Billed as a discussion in town-meeting style, as part of the House Republicans' effort to find solutions to
decades of urban ills, it quickly became something much more.  Nearly 1,000 people attended the forum and
hundreds more were unable to get into the packed high school auditorium.  This meeting was the first of several the
speaker has planned to address the city's budget crisis and deteriorating public schools.<P>
     But this may have been part of the problem.  There was an obvious mood filled with unrealistic
expectations as audience participants asked the speaker questions as varied as how to get parents more involved
with their children's educational process to how to get rid of the current school superintendent.<P>
     Gingrich was booed when introduced, but the questioners were, for the most part, respectful.<P>
     Sharing the stage with top local Democrats--Mayor Marion Barry and congressional delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton, plus Jesse Jackson--Gingrich acknowledged the improbable grouping.<P>
     He joked that months ago, the odds that he and Barry would be on the same platform and working together
were "probably as good as some folks would have given against my being speaker or (Barry) being mayor again."<P>
     Both Barry and Jackson sat in silence as Gingrich spoke.<P>
     Even though the previous Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat, lived on Capitol Hill during his final
years in office, he never engaged city residents in the style that Gingrich did.  The gathering is supposed to be the
first such session for Gingrich, who has said he will attend them.<P>
     "Tonight is a beginning," Gingrich told a woman who asked about the quality of Washington's public
schools now and in the future.  "I can't assure you that as a group we'll make a big difference.  I can't give you a
date or even guarantee that it will happen.  But we will reach out and do everything we can to improve resources
and safety to have a healthy Washington."<P>
     Barry, the popular four-term mayor who managed a comeback after leaving office in disgrace because of a
cocaine conviction, said he and Gingrich were putting political differences aside to collaborate on making
Washington "the finest capital anywhere in the world."<P>
     Team play was the evening's official theme and Norton warmly credited Gingrich with garnering some
$200 million in federal highway funds for city road repairs.  Norton, who has tried hard to insure that city residents
are not excluded from the exchange of ideas for saving their city, was largely responsible for the speaker's
appearance.<P>
     In the face of periodic insults, Gingrich stood at the lectern taking copious notes, nodding in agreement and
responding only occasionally to questions asked.  He won applause when he promised residents "significant" tax
relief and world-class schools.<P>
     "We do not have the right to micromanage the lives of the people who live in this city," he assured the
attendees.  Congress earlier this year established a federal board to control the city's finances.<P>
     In August, the speaker's task force on the D.C. economy recommended a federal income tax credit and
other tax breaks--totaling between $1.3 billion and $2.7 billion--to attract and keep residents and businesses in the
city.<P>
     Gingrich and Wisconsin Rep. Steve Gunderson also unveiled a plan to raise private-sector funds for
equipment, maintenance and repairs in the public schools, which opened nearly a week late last September because
of thousands of fire code violations.<P>
     A second fund-raising drive would establish a scholarship fund for low-income families who would prefer
to send their children to private schools, said Gunderson, leader of the House Republicans' task force on D.C.
schools.<P>
     Later that day, at a brief news conference, he pronounced the meeting a success.
     "What surprised me the most, and pleased me the most," he said, "was the calm intensity" of people in the
audience.  "Here were people who were frustrated, who felt Congress had dealt with them unfairly in the past.  But
they were back one more time."<P>

<title> Kicking America's Welfare Habit -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture #540</b><br>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<h3> Kicking America's Welfare Habit: Politics, Illegitimacy, and Personal Responsibility</h3><br>
<p>By The Honorable Pete Wilson, Governor of California. Governor Wilson spoke at The Heritage Foundation's Lehrman Auditorium. Wednesday, September 6, 1995. His speech was sponsored by The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/gov_for.htm">Governors' Forum</a>. 
<p> 

It's a pleasure to be back at Heritage. I've enjoyed your hospitality many times before.
Your willingness to hear from the nation's governors is just one bit of evidence that this institution has the wisdom-- all too rare in this town -- to know that Washington doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas.  
<P>  
The American people are fed up with an arrogant and out-of-touch federal government. That's what fueled  
the ballot box rebellion of 1994. 

Yet, despite the enormous success of the House Republicans in delivering on the Contract with America,  
voters remain deeply cynical about Washington's ability to make change. 
  
In fact, a poll done last week by <i>USA Today</i> showed voters' faith in Congress at an historic low. 

Why? Well, I can't think of a better example of what fuels voter cynicism about Washington than the status  
of welfare reform. 
<P>  
The American people are justifiably outraged by a federal welfare system that contradicts their values. It  
penalizes work, discourages marriage, and encourages illegitimacy. 

A foreign power bent on ruining America couldn't have designed a more destructive system than the one  
Washington has imposed on the American people. 

That's why in 1992, a candidate who promised to "end welfare as we know it" held such appeal for many  
voters. But what we've seen since has only deepened their contempt for D.C. 
<P>  
Bill Clinton has been President for almost a thousand days, three quarters of it with heavy Democratic  
majorities in Congress. 

And how far has he gotten on his pledge? 

Well he spent $33 billion of the taxpayers money on "welfare as we know it." 

Nearly a million more people have enrolled in "welfare as we know it." 

And today, 600,000 more children are living on "welfare as we know it." 
 <P> 
But Bill Clinton hasn't changed one word of federal law to "end welfare as we know it." Not one. 

Cal Ripken isn't the only guy with a streak still going strong. 

Every day Bill Clinton sits on the Oval Office, he's still not ending welfare as we know it.  He's extending  
welfare, and he knows it. 
<P>  
Voters understand that it is possible to change welfare. 

Millions of them -- in states as diverse as Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and California --  
have seen their governors do it, often with bipartisan support, often with limited resources, and often  
despite lawsuits from the welfare defenders. 

In California, I've reduced welfare grants by 20 percent, saved the taxpayers $9 billion, doubled the  
number of welfare recipients at work, and insisted that teenage parents on welfare live in their parents'  
home, that parents get the check, and the girl stay in school to learn the skills that will let her and her child  
escape welfare. 
<P>  
By contrast, the federal model of welfare simply provides a welfare check to an unwed child-mother -- who  
is too young to get a driver's license -- so she can move out to her own apartment.  How utterly  
irresponsible. 

Then she is given even more accessible prey to the next man seeking a junior-high school one-night stand  
romance. 

It doesn't have to be that way.  People can escape welfare.  But it takes work, and it happens one person at  
a time. 

A great example is Trish Molina. 
<P>  
I met Trish in California's Riverside County after she graduated from our successful welfare work program  
known as GAIN. 
 
She got an entry-level job at a small wireless cable company.  She's since been promoted three times.  
  
Today, she's the assistant to the head of the company.  She's happy. She loves her career.  She just needed  
the skills and discipline to take a job and stick with it. 

Most important, the job isn't just helping her, it's helping her children. 

They now have the example of a mother who gets up every morning and goes to work, teaching them what  
it means to accept responsibility for yourself and contribute to your community. 
 <P>
The young mother says that now that she's working she respects herself and her children respect her too. 

That's why we need welfare reform that demands personal responsibility, encourages work and discourages  
irresponsible behavior. 

Yet, President Clinton has not only failed to make significant welfare reform in Washington, he's actually  
blocked state like mine that are trying to make that change. 
<p>
At a meeting of the nation's governors, he promised to approve welfare waivers in 90 days or less, whether  
he agreed with the changes or not. 
 
In California, we sought a federal waiver for one reform we wanted to make to reduce welfare grants...and  
to make work more attractive than welfare. 
 
That was over a year ago. 

And the Clinton Administration continues to delay it at a cost to traxpayers of $3 million a week. 
<P>  
We've sought another waiver since November. 

This one would allow us to end the practice of giving larger and larger welfare checks to women who have  
more and more children while already on welfare. 

We think it's simply wrong to reward that kind of irresponsible behavior.  Working families don't get an  
automatic pay raise when they have more children, so why should women on welfare? 

And why should a young couple working and saving to have a child be taxed to subsidize that welfare  
mother's irresponsibility? 
<P>
It seems simple enough to me, but it took the Clinton Administration months to respond to our request. 
 

Then, in twisted logic that could only make sense to Washington, the Clinton Administration decided we 
could stop rewarding adults for having more and more children on welfare...but they insisted we had to 
continue rewarding teenagers for the same irresponsible behavior. 
<P>
Well, I've got news for them: Having more and more children on welfare is wrong whether you're and adult 
or a teenager. 

That's why I refuse to accept this absurd condition from President Clinton. 

Today, I'm rejecting President Clinton's half-baked waiver and insisting that he live up to his promise.

Mr. President, grant this waiver and every other waiver California has requested as you promised you 
would...with no strings attached. 
 
It's what you promised the American people.  Have the guts to keep your word. 
<P>  
Unfortunately, like a lot of voters, I'm skeptical he will. 
<P>
And his continued failure to reform welfare is why action in the Congress is so important.  Congress is our 
last best hope for real reform. 

When the House passed welfare reform in less than 100 days, a skeptical public were given a glimmer of 
hope that things might really be changing in Washington.  

But then, welfare reform landed in the Senate. 
<P>  
More and more, the Senate looks like the graveyard for the Contract with America. 

0n the balanced budget amendment.  On tax cuts.  On the crime bill.  And now, on welfare reform.

The Senate's continued delay holds states hostage to the whims of Bill Clinton's welfare bureaucrats.  We 
are compelled to wrench reform from hostile guardians of the status quo. 
 <P>
Worse yet, the compromises being cut in the Senate raise serious doubts as to whether the Senate 
Republican Leader really understands the mandate voters gave us last November to make drastic change.

There's been plenty of hot rhetoric on the Senate floor about freeing states from federal mandates.

But under the Dole welfare compromise, states would be denied the chance to make even the most basic 
decisions. 

In many cases, Senator Dole would simply leave us with watered-down version of current law. 
<P>  
For example, Senator Dole's compromise would continue to set the minimum level a state must spend on 
welfare. 

A similar, so-called "maintenance of effort requirement" in current law is what's preventing me from 
saving taxpayers $3 million a week. 

Why would a Republican committed to fundamental change support a federal mandate like that?

Congress has no business dictating terms like that to the states. 

California is a proud and sovereign state, not a colony of the federal government. 
<P>
In another concession to Senate liberals, Senator Dole has agreed to extend federal disability benefits to 
individuals whose only disability is self-inflicting drug and alcohol abuse.

Today, nearly 100,000 individuals collect such benefits.  And the number grew nearly six-fold in five years.

But why should that surprise us?

What alcoholic would pass up a chance to have the taxpayers pick up their bar tab?
<P>
That's why the House welfare bill ended this absurd practice next month.

The budget I just signed would end these benefits on the same day.  But Senator Dole's bill would force us 
to continue paying these benefits for more than a year. In California alone, that would cost taxpayers more 
than $1 million a week.

That's not only an insult to taxpayers, it's an outrage for the federal government to be subsidizing 
someone's addiction.  As the head of one homeless shelter described it, it's "suicide on the installment 
plan."
<p>
It's wrong and it's got to stop.
<P>
Yet, even as Senator Dole is imposing these indefensible mandates on the states, he's ignoring the one 
crisis that deserves national attention -- the epidemic of out-of-wedlock teen births.

Today, one in tree children is born out of wedlock. In some of America's largest cities, more children are 
born to unmarried women than into two-parent families.

And the 14-year-old girl who becomes an unwed mother is all too likely to give birth to a girl who will 
become a 14-year-old unwed mother herself, or a boy who will become a 14-year-old triggerman for a 
drug gang.
<P> 
If Senator Dole is truly concerned about the crisis of values in America, he should not be content with 
talking about the perverse values promoted by our popular media.  He should start doing something about 
the perverse values promoted by the federal welfare system.

The Contract with America included many reforms we've made in California to stem this crisis of 
illegitimacy.

It stops rewarding women with bigger welfare checks for having more and more children out-of-wedlock.

Yet, Senator Dole excluded this important change from the Senate version of the bill.  He was unwilling to 
include this fundamental reform.
<P>
It is not leadership to settle for less than the fundamental change we need by cutting deals which 
compromise our values.

We must demand nothing less than the courage and conviction to make fundamental change in policy...if 
we're to have any hope of changing a tragically permissive culture.

America deserves better, and must demand it.
<P>
If we make these changes, we'll free millions of Americans from the chains of dependency that stifle 
opportunity.

We'll renew the dream of a nation where work is respected and rewarded and where rights are balanced by 
responsibility.
<P>
The biggest mistake we can make is to be too timid in our reforms.  The task we face is great, but we dare 
not miss this opportunity.  It may not come again soon.

Thank you, very much.  Now, I'd be happy to take your questions.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

This week's Town Hall Spotlight provides you with the chance to learn a little bit about some more of the organizations that run on your hard earned money--government bureaucracies.
 More bureaucracies were featured in last week's Spotlight, and they are now labeled and linked to relevant articles.  <a href="/townhall/infotain/12-11-95/answers.html">Check it out!</a>

<A HREF="8.jpg"><IMG SRC="8.gif" ALT="PHOTO" align="left"></A><h3><a href="http://www.dot.gov">US Department of Transportation</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This department was created in 1966 to oversee the growth in urban mass transit programs, air traffic, and construction of the Interstate Highway System.
<li>Because each member of Congress tries to assure that his or her state or district recieve as much pork as possible, this department regularly funds expensive, low-priority projects over more sensible, appropriate ones.
<li>Congress earmaked 129 surface projects, at an annual cost of $250 million in FY 1995. During the same year, $1.5 billion was appropriated for airport grants-in-aid, including nearly $5 million for the Jimmy Stewart Airport in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.
<li>19% (18,000 workers) of its civilian staff was furloughed in the first government shutdown.

<ul>
<li>Made infamous in the 1980s for purchasing $12 "portable language inscribers" (a.k.a. "pencils"), $45 hammers, and $130 toilet seats, this bureaucracy has shaped up considerably in recent years.
<li>The Clinton Administration underfunded even its own Bottom-Up Review of this Department by $100 million in 1995, and neglected to budget for unexpected emergency actions, like the one to Haiti.
<li>258,000 civilian employees (31% of its overall staff), labelled non-essential, didn't show have to commute to this 5-sided building during the first shutdown.

Hall</h2>
This unassuming doorway is the entrance to the New Conservative World.  Town Hall was created in 1991 to serve as the meeting place for conservatives.  It began as a small BBS network and grew to become a CompuServe forum and the premier conservative site on the internet.  Launched on June 29th, 1995, Town Hall had 12 citizen organizations at a kickoff party attended by Speaker Newt Gingrich and then Majority Leader Bob Dole.

<p>

Heading into 1997, Town Hall has over 30 citizen organizations, over 30 columnists, and a new feature "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/thcc/"><i>The Conservative Current</i></a>" which is a subscriber service featuring 18 syndicated columnists such as Bob Novak, Tony Snow and Dan Quayle.<p>

Town Hall builds and maintains conservative organization's web sites and Town Hall's own orginal and syndicated content as a service to the conservative movement.
<p>
Located on the third
floor of <a href="http://www.heritage.org">The Heritage Foundation</a>, in Washington, DC, these offices house the nerve center of
Town Hall, including the most sophisticated computer equipment available...and some really
cool people.  Don't bother knocking, just come right in!  <p>

<FONT SIZE= "+2">T</FONT>he Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is the ninth Presidential
Library  operated by the National Archives and Records Administration. 
It is an archival collection of the permanently valuable historical materials
of the Reagan Administration. Holdings presently consist of approximately
50 million pages of documents (23,5000 feet), including records created or
received by the President and White House staff members, approximately 1.5
million still photographs, and over 75,000 gifts. Before documents can be made
available to the public, they must be reviewed by archivists according to
the provisions of the Presidential Records Act of 1978. Currently, the Library
has opened approximately 7 million pages to researchers and scholars. There is 
also available a <A HREF =

<center><h2>ON EVE OF SUMMIT, ASIAN COUNTRIES QUESTION U.S. COMMITMENT TO FREE TRADE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<P>
	<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 19, 1996</b> -- When President Clinton attends the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines next Monday, he'll have some explaining to do. Specifically, he'll have to tell America's Asian trading partners why his administration seems so much less committed to free trade than it used to be, according to a Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
<P>	"The president's actions and trade policies over the past two years have dismayed America's trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region," says Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a>. In fact, the administration's vacillation on free trade has damaged U.S. credibility so badly that one Asian leader, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, has revived the idea of an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States. 
<P>
	Open trade with the 18 APEC economies (including Canada, Mexico and Chile) is crucial to America's future, O'Quinn says. Taken together, APEC economies have a gross domestic product exceeding $13 trillion, or about one-half of the world's total output. Nearly two-thirds of America's two-way merchandise trade is with APEC countries, and exports to APEC countries provide jobs for 7.3 million American workers. 
<P>	For this reason, O'Quinn says, it is important that President Clinton take <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc144.html">specific steps</a> to reassure Asia about America's commitment to free trade with the region, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Asking Congress for "fast-track" authority to negotiate free-trade agreements without getting bogged down in contentious labor or environmental issues;
<P>
<LI> Bringing Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement by the end of 1997, which would show other APEC countries America's willingness to embrace free trade with a country not on the U.S. border;
<P>
<LI> Inviting other Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Peru, to join APEC, which would shift the balance of power within the trade group away from the "go slow" countries of China, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia; and
<P>
<LI> Asking Congress to eliminate agriculture-export subsidies and the sugar and dairy programs, which would improve relations with a number of APEC nations (and save U.S. taxpayers $10 billion a year).

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>HERITAGE CALLS FOR CONGRESSIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B> <FONT SIZE=4>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1996 --</FONT></B> The 105th
Congress should take full advantage of the revolution in telecommunications
technology to make available on the Internet all disclosable information
having to do with the laws it passes and how it conducts its business,
a pair of Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1098.html">said today</a>.
<P>
 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a>, director of Heritage's Government
Reform Project, and research assistant August Stofferahn, &quot;By
taking the initiative in placing all disclosable information on
the Internet, Congress could avoid the contentious process of
specific requests for materials as well as the necessarily more
complex freedom of information procedures established for the
executive branch.&quot;
<P>
 In addition, the analysts say, the move would provide a needed
reform. &quot;Through key institutional and procedural reforms,
the 104th Congress sought to unmask and dismantle the network
of liberal special interests that ran Capitol Hill for decades,&quot;
Weinstein and Stofferahn said. &quot;A Congressional Freedom of
Information Act (CFOIA) would complete and confirm the move toward
open access to Congress.&quot;
<P>
 In addition to areas that already have been opened to the public
through the Internet -- such as THOMAS, the Library of Congress'
on-line legislative information service, and the GPO (Goverment
Printing Office) Access system, which features 58 information
databases produced by the federal government -- the U.S. House
of Representatives' Task Force on Committee Review already has
recommended that Congress' new open-door policy be expanded. Specifically,
the task force has called for amendments to bills, committee and
subcommittee prints and reports, and oversight plans and activities
to be placed on the Internet. Similarly, the U.S. Senate has sought
to use information technology to publicize its activities more
extensively through its &quot;Operation Daylight.&quot; 
<P>
 But Weinstein and Stofferahn say Congress should go further.
Under a CFOIA, all information currently made available to the
public would become available through the Internet. In addition
to the committee documents detailed by the House task force, Congress
would add issue briefs, spending reports, voting records, the
content of mass mailings, financial and lobbying disclosure documents,
and a host of other items.
<P>
 &quot;Providing citizens outside of Washington with the means
to closely examine and actively monitor the work of their elected
representatives would do more to foster openness and prevent back
room politics than any other single reform,&quot; the analysts
say. &quot;The 30 million American families with personal computers
would be able to use the Internet to observe more closely the
activities of Congress and their particular representatives. In
addition, other citizens could take advantage of the numerous
possibilities for Internet access at work and at public and university
libraries to find timely information on current legislation that
may affect their lives.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;Overall,&quot; Weinstein and Stofferahn say, &quot;these
changes would make our democratic system stronger and more responsive
to the average citizen.&quot;

<title>Next Administration Can Restore U.S. Free-Trade Leadership in Latin America -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>
NEXT ADMINISTRATION CAN RESTORE 
U.S. FREE-TRADE LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1996 </b> -- The most important trade goal for the next administration should be the creation of a hemisphere-wide <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1092.html">free-trade area</a> linking the signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the South American Common Market (Mercosur), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and other countries into a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the collapse of the Mexican peso on Dec. 20, 1994, but the United States has not," according to Latin America and Trade Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John P. Sweeney</a>. "The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization and efforts to create an FTAA. However, the United States appears to have turned its back on Latin America, allowing U.S. relations with important trading partners to deteriorate significantly on issues such as trade, Cuba, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and allowing countries like Brazil to fill the leadership vacuum."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sweeney says U.S. reluctance to expand NAFTA to other countries such as Chile has not interrupted hemispheric trade expansion -- it has simply left the United States out. "Mexico has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Bolivia and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur), and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Mercosur also wants to sign a free-trade agreement with the European Union," Sweeney points out. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"No one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free-trade express in the Western Hemisphere," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Among the 10 steps Sweeney says the next U.S. administration should take to regain its leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America:<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track trade negotiating authority.</b> "No country will invest the time or human or financial resources necessary to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress," Sweeney points out. "Making renewal of fast track one of the first actions of a new administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the United States has re-engaged in the FTAA process," he says.
<p>
<li><b>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries.</b> "The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur," Sweeney says. Also, NAFTA has enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the United States, causing the rate of growth for apparel imports from the CBI countries into the United States to fall from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996. Apparel imports from Mexico grew by 41 percent during the same period. To redress this unforeseen imbalance, Sweeney says, the CBI countries should be included in NAFTA. 
<p>
<li><b> Launch a dialogue for integrating NAFTA and Mercosur into an FTAA by 2005.</b> "The United States has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing," Sweeney says. "Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade practices as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005."
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis, and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton administration is reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on track," Sweeney says. "If the administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline."

<title>Poor Children Would Benefit From School Choice, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> POOR CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM 
 SCHOOL CHOICE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 26, 1996</b> -- As the new school year begins, Congress will be considering legislation that would allow tax dollars to be used for special scholarships so poor children can attend the schools of their choice, private or public. According to a Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1088.html">study</a> released today, such scholarships could make a real difference in the lives of children from poor families. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The proposed legislation, called Title II, The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would allow each locality to determine the value of the special scholarships, with the maximum value no greater than the existing per-capita cost of education in the local public school district.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose schools they prefer," says <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis Doyle</a>, senior fellow in education at Heritage and author of the study. "The  reason why the Clintons and the Gores, as well as other members of the nation's social and political elite, select private schools is simple: Empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority students," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	For example, Doyle says compelling research by the late Johns Hopkins and University of Chicago scholar James Coleman points out that Catholic schools have benefitted poor and minority children in numerous ways. Coleman's research found, for example, that Catholic school sophomores scored 10 percent higher in science, 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading and vocabulary than their public-school+ counterparts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A recent study by Harvard University and the University of Houston confirmed Coleman's research, showing that elementary school students who participated in the nation's first school-voucher program in Milwaukee scored higher on math and reading tests after four years than youngsters who stayed in public schools. In Milwaukee, 99 percent of the students receiving vouchers were black or Hispanic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Unfortunately for poor children, their only current educational choice lies in selecting between failed and failing public schools. The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996 offers a good first step toward giving poor children and their parents more and better educational options," Doyle says.

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 21, 1996</b> -- A new approach to local police management emphasizing high recruitment standards, "community policing," and a high-tech focus on crime "hot spots" and repeat offenders -- coupled with a judicial system that keeps criminals behind bars -- can win the war on crime, according to a major Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">analysis</a> co-authored by former Attorney General <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III.</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
	The 33-page report, released today, proposes 21 specific actions local, state and federal officials can take to achieve the same dramatic reductions in crime that have been achieved in cities like New York, where in 1994 the murder rate declined 45 percent and major felonies dropped 12 percent (and 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995). 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident," according to Meese and co-author <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a>, Ph.D., Heritage's deputy director of domestic policy studies and the son of a Philadelphia police detective. "They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The most important lesson taught by the experience of the past several decades of rising crime, according to Meese and Moffit, is that police must be: 1) Well-paid, high-quality individuals in both achievement and character, actively recruited from the communities they patrol or from the military; 2) savvy peacekeepers, known personally by the neighborhoods they serve, able to spot troublemakers and, more often than not, quell disturbances before criminal acts occur; and 3) allowed to do their jobs, and not be constantly second-guessed by department higher-ups, nor demoralized by judges whose ideas of social justice put criminals back on the streets. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"If we're going to spend billions of dollars on combating crime," Meese and Moffit write, "we ought to use that money in the ways that have been shown to work and stop wasting them on ways that don't." For example, Meese and Moffit point out that the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which President Clinton vowed would place 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets, has increased the number of officers by just 17,000, and even these aren't necessarily in areas hardest hit by violent crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the advice Meese and Moffit offer to local police:
<p><ul>
	<b><li> Target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> "Successful police departments should focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place," according to Meese and Moffit. "Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. These areas should by the targets of short-term, unpredictable crackdowns that tell the criminal he stands a serious chance of getting caught. Police should also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime. They should be a routine target of police," they say.
<p>
<li><b> Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> "Too many metropolitan areas in the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical and character standards within police forces," Meese and Moffit say. If local police departments expect to make a dent in crime, they need to insist on high standards in both cognitive ability and personal integrity. 

<p>
"Responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits," Meese and Moffit say. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, "psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical strength and stamina requirements are also essential," they say. Most important of all, "background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, current and past associations and financial and marital stability, as well as evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse."
<P>	<li><b> Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> "Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies," Meese and Moffit say. These officers should be put "on the beat" and their administrative duties performed by clerical or other qualified personnel.  
<p>	<li><b> Aggressively recruit police officers from the ranks of the military, which would expand the number of well-qualified black and other minority applicants. </b> It is important that police departments reflect the demographic composition of their communities, especially in minority neighborhoods. This enables officers to understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit information vital to effective law enforcement, Meese and Moffit say. 

<p>
But local officials "should not be deceived by the false god of 'diversity' at the cost of excellence in the field." Instead, they say, local police departments "should aggressively seek out those members of minority groups who meet the high cognitive, physical and moral standards of the department, and offer them a pay level that will make law enforcement an attractive career option."	
<p>	The military offers a pool of personnel -- many of them minorities -- with many skills that would be useful in police work, they say. 
<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> "The most effective police officer is an insider; someone local residents know and respect. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible," say Meese and Moffit. Better still, "if the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors." For this reason, Meese and Moffit say local officials should consider offering low-cost housing loans as an incentive for police to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 
<p><li><b>Make police commanders directly accountable for results and police conduct.</b> It is absolutely essential, Meese and Moffit say, for police commanders to be held personally accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions, as well as the integrity and honest of their officers. This method, strictly followed by former NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton, resulted in "precincts that operated as miniature police departments," and managers who "rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity." </ul><p>
<b>What Washington Can Do</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Among the steps Congress can take that will truly aid state and local governments in combating crime, Meese and Moffit say, are the following: <ul>
<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety, and reform criminal procedure so it once again serves the purpose of putting criminals behind bars.</b> The Senate, which approves nominees to the federal judiciary, should refuse to give its consent to nominees who have a history of rulings that result in the release of criminals. 
<p>	In addition to what it has already done -- putting a stop the federal imposition of "prison caps," which commonly resulted in the release of thousands of dangerous criminals -- Congress should review the impact of the Miranda ruling, the so-called exclusionary rule, and reform the law to allow a good-faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations Meese and Moffit say. "As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of police," they say. 
<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those that impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> "Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities," Meese and Moffit say. "The Clinton administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more ... Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- and allow states and cities to solve their own problems."
<p><li><b>Provide more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> Meese and Moffit say this would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime," Meese and Moffit say. "In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	But success, they say, rests ultimately on intangibles as "courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community."

<h2> THINK TANK ECONOMIST IDENTIFIES
<br>THE "WORST TAX OF ALL" </h2></center>

<u>Calls for Estate-Tax Repeal</u>
<p>


	WASHINGTON, AUG. 19, 1996</b> -- It may be absent from political radar screens this election season, but a Heritage Foundation economist has identified what he considers the "worst tax of all."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It's the estate tax, and in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">new study</a> released today Heritage John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says it should be repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Consider the evidence, Beach says. The estate tax can confiscate a crushing 55 percent of an individual's lifetime assets, yet is so inefficient it may cost the government and taxpayers more in administrative and compliance costs than it raises in revenue. The estate tax slows the economy by encouraging consumption over investment and by keeping interest rates artificially high. And the estate tax punishes some of the very people "progressive taxation" is supposed to help: female and minority business owners struggling to enter the economic mainstream.<p>
<b>A Paltry Revenue Source</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Along with the gift tax, which requires payment of taxes on the value of lifetime gifts from parents to children, the estate tax brings in less than 1.7 percent of the federal government's total revenue. In 1995, for example, the tax generated just $14.7 billion in revenue -- but may have lost up to $11 billion, Beach says, as individuals shed their assets by giving them away to charities and others. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	One of the primary reasons for this paltry revenue figure is the extraordinary lengths to which individuals will go to avoid paying estate taxes, Beach says. Not only do individuals spend an inordinate amount of time and money on "estate planning," which has become a euphemism for tax avoidance, but when that proves insufficient they resort to the next defensive measure: spend as much of their money as they can. In this way, Beach says, individuals only pay tax on their wealth as income, where the top tax rate is 39.6 percent, compared to the maximum rate of 55 percent under the estate tax (which, on top of the income tax, results in a tax bite of almost 70 percent).<p>
<b>Spend It Before You Die</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It doesn't even matter what they spend the money on -- cars, boats, second homes, even presidential elections. "The fact is," says Beach, "that the estate tax encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment on which he'll pay a 55 percent tax. The thinking behind this behavior is quite rational: Since you refuse to let me pass on my assets to my children, I'll spend them."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It is this kind of behavior that also helps explain why the estate tax acts as a drag on the economy, Beach says. The more individuals spend and consume, the less they save and invest. What's more, to the degree that individuals do continue to save and invest, they demand higher returns [interest rates] to offset the steep future tax they will pay. This raises the cost of capital to businesses, Beach says, which translates into lower levels of investment in plant and equipment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Perhaps most perniciously, the estate tax also hurts small businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities. Women re-entering the work force often find starting their own business the best economic opportunity, and minorities view businesses as a way to establish economic independence and give their children a boost up the economic ladder, Beach says. But businesses also constitute estates, raising the prospect that all the financial security these small-business owners have worked to achieve will evaporate once the owner dies. In fact, a 1995 survey highlighted by Beach showed that 58 percent of minority business owners believe their business will fail or have difficulty surviving after estate taxes kick in. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All told, there are approximately 16 million non-corporate family-owned businesses nationwide that may be affected by the estate tax. California, for example, has approximately 2.2 million; New York, 950,000; Texas, 1.6 million; Florida, 835,000; Illinois, 620,000; and Alabama, 208,000. In many cases, Beach says, these businesses won't survive the estate tax. The child who inherits the business will face such a crushing tax bill that the only viable option will be to sell it.<p>
<b>Repeal Would Boost Economy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In addition to chronicling the problems with the estate tax, Beach also asks what would happen to economic growth if it were repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Using two respected computer models of the U.S. economy -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 model by the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA) -- he found that repeal would cause the economy to grow by an extra $3 billion (WEFA) to $11 billion (WUMM) per year between 1997 and 2005.  This translates into job growth over the same period of between 130,000 (WEFA) and 145,000 (WUMM). Using the WUMM model, Beach also estimates that repeal would boost household disposable income by $12 billion over the nine-year period; generate 49,000 new housing starts in its first year; and lower the cost of capital to business by at least two-tenths of a percent. "These numbers aren't huge," Beach says, "but they also are low-ball estimates. It may be that repealing the estate tax would produce much higher economic growth."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"In the end," Beach says, "the estate tax fails the cost-benefit test. Both the social and economic costs of the tax far exceed the revenue it produces for the government. If it were repealed, no one would miss it."

<title> Legislation Creating New Urban Policy Would Revive Poor Areas, Analysts Say - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> LEGISLATION CREATING NEW URBAN POLICY WOULD REVIVE POOR AREAS, ANALYSTS SAY
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 31, 1996</b> -- Congress is holding hearings this week on the American Community Renewal Act, a comprehensive bill to bring economic and moral renewal to the nation's most impoverished areas. A new <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib228.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> of the bill calls it "an excellent opportunity" to reverse 30 years of failed social policy.
<p>
	While the separate welfare reform legislation moving through Congress represents a step in the right direction, it omits many of the policy changes needed to aid the urban poor, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector. By providing tax and regulatory relief to economically depressed areas and by boosting the role religious institutions can play in addressing social ills, the American Community Renewal Act would do much more to help the poor overcome the poverty, drug abuse, family disintegration and crime that plague their communities, according to study authors Rector and Policy Analyst Christine Olson.
<p>
	Sponsored by Reps. J. C. Watts, R-Okla., and Jim Talent, R-Mo., the legislation "rejects the premise that all that is needed for our poorest communities are larger government benefit checks," the analysts say. Specifically, the bill would make the following policy changes:  <ul>
	<p><li>Reduce regulations and eliminate capital-gains taxes on assets held in 100 "renewal communities" across the nation. Research has shown that reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in impoverished areas can reduce unemployment by a third or more, the analysts say.
	<p><li>Provide poor parents with education scholarships that can be used to send their children to any school -- public, private or religious. "Giving poor parents the same choice in education enjoyed by middle- and upper-class families would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education and reduce the rate of school failure," Rector and Olson say. And by allowing parents to send their children to religious schools, "the sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is not only the most important aspect of a child's education but critical to solving social problems," they say.
	<p><li>Allow religious organizations to use federal funds to perform social-service work such as drug treatment. The social-science research shows religiously based drug-treatment programs are more effective than strictly secular programs, the analysts say. By prohibiting discrimination against religious organizations that have a proven track record of successfully treating substance abusers, Rector and Olson say, the bill would make the most of an underused solution to one of  the country's most pressing social problems.
	<p><li>Create a new charitable tax credit for donations given to charities whose primary purpose is to help the poor. "The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers are better able to decide where funds should go in their local communities than are bureaucrats in Washington," the analysts say. "The bill would encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social-service programs to help the poor."
	</ul><p>The American Community Renewal Act "gives Congress and the administration an opportunity to change the way the federal government has practiced community development for 30 years," the analysts say. "It respects the fact that low-income Americans want to help themselves, it builds on the successes of local organizations and community groups, and it harnesses the energy of the nation's churches and religious organizations in combating social ills."

<h2> TAKE GDP GROWTH NUMBERS WITH A GRAIN
OF SALT, HERITAGE ECONOMIST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 30, 1996</b> -- If history is any guide, the federal government's Aug. 1 estimate of how fast the economy grew in the second quarter of 1996 will be like most quarterly growth estimates of the past 20 years -- wrong. Probably very wrong.
<p>	According to a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi114.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the Commerce Department's regular quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP), the figures released by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) have been off by an average of 50 percent during the nearly 20-year period beginning in 1976.
<p>	In some cases, the BEA couldn't even accurately say whether the economy had grown or contracted, economist William Beach found. From 1978 to 1991, for example, the BEA had to revise its numbers for 12 percent of all quarters to show that a "shrinking" economy had actually grown or that a "growing" economy had actually shrunk.
<p>	Citing the real effect the BEA's initial GDP forecasts can have on business decisions, Beach, the former chief economist for Sprint Corp., urges that the agency delay the release of growth numbers for at least 60 days, when fuller data will yield a more accurate picture of the economy.  "The federal government is forcing businesses to make decisions about jobs and investment based on faulty estimates of the economy's strength," he says. "In this regard, the GDP forecasts do more harm than good."
	<p>Frequently, the difference between the Commerce Department initial GDP estimates and the actual performance of the economy is extraordinary. For the first quarter of 1996, for example, the BEA initially said the economy grew by 2.8 percent.  Later revisions, however, put first quarter GDP growth at only 2.2 percent, a 20 percent downward revision.  More glaring was the error for the first quarter of 1992.  The BEA initially reported 2.0 percent growth, when later revisions showed the economy had grown 4.7 percent -- a 135 percent correction. 
	<p>The Heritage Foundation analysis found that the BEA underestimated the growth rate during President Reagan's two terms 63 percent of the time, while it has overestimated the growth rate 70 percent of the time during President Clinton's presidency.
	<p>Beach, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in political economy, does not fault the BEA. After all, he says, estimating quarterly GDP for the huge and highly complex U.S. economy will inevitably require "guesswork." What he does fault is the near-obsessive focus on quarterly GDP by politicians and the media, since the numbers tell so little about the actual strength of the economy. 
	<p>To get an accurate picture of the nation's economic health, he says, it is necessary to look at longer-term economic trends.
<p>	The GDP estimate for the second quarter of 1996, for example, may look good on paper, he says, but will mask the underlying economic trend -- which is downward. Beach notes that economic growth rates increased significantly from the first quarter of 1992 to the final quarter of 1994, but have been on a decline ever since. The fact that both the expansion and the slowdown have been punctuated by "spikes" in individual quarters does nothing to change the overall trend, he says.
<p>	The lesson? "Americans shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of economic prosperity, or insecurity, based on how the economy is supposedly performing during a single quarter," Beach says. "They also shouldn't be fooled by the political posturing that surrounds economic growth numbers. What counts is the longer term direction of the economy, and right now it's down."

<title> Credit Goes To Congress For Lower Deficit, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> CREDIT GOES TO CONGRESS FOR LOWER DEFICIT, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>



	WASHINGTON, JULY 26, 1996</b> -- If Congress hadn't stopped President Clinton from passing his 1996 budget, rejected his plans for $200 billion deficits well into the next century, and pushed through substantial cuts of its own, this year's deficit would be nowhere near the $117 billion recently projected  by the Office of Management and Budget. In fact, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113.html">according to Heritage Foundation budget analyst Scott Hodge</a>, the deficit would have come in at about what the Clinton administration originally proposed for 1996: a deficit of $211 billion.
<p>
	"It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting President Clinton's proposed deficit nearly in half," Hodge says. "Furthermore, had the president not vetoed Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for fiscal year 1996, this year's deficit would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which he now claims credit."
<p>
	Hodge says the domestic discretionary spending cutbacks pushed through by Congress in the face of White House opposition have gone practically unreported in accounts of the 104th Congress' legislative record. "Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, fiscal year 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969," he points out. "More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third."
<p>
	Other reasons cited by Hodge for the lower projected 1996 deficit numbers include:<ul>
	<p><li>The savings and loan bailout, which is now generating revenue instead of adding to the deficit. "This program -- which has accounted for 10 percent of the deficit change between fiscal years 1992 and 1996 -- is expected to bring in more than $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector";
	<p><li>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum. "President Clinton is reaping a windfall from the auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry, estimated to generate more than $10 billion in new revenues for fiscal year 1996";
	<p><li>A one-time tax revenue windfall caused by "investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax";
</ul><p>	"At every turn, the Clinton administration has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the rate of spending growth," Hodge says. "Incredibly, the president now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it was Congress that kept the president from pushing through spending that would have kept deficits higher than $200 billion for the foreseeable future."

<h2> GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF PARENTAL RIGHTS
ALL TOO COMMON, HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>




WASHINGTON, JULY 23, 1996</b> -- Legislation moving through Congress would protect parents from a growing number of government attempts to prevent them from raising their children as they see fit, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib227.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	With "parental rights" under siege on all fronts -- from legislatures, courts, government agencies, even the "helping" professions -- the "Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act" would restore to parents what the Supreme Court has deemed their "fundamental right" to direct the upbringing of their children, say study authors Patrick Fagan, Heritage's William FitzGerald fellow in family and cultural studies, and Wade Horn, director of the National Fatherhood Initiative. Fagan is former deputy assistant secretary for social services policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Horn is former U.S. Commissioner for Children, Youth and Families.
<p>	To underscore the deteriorating status of parental rights -- and the need for legislation to correct the problem -- Fagan and Horn point to a number of recent abuses:<ul>
	<p><li>Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., tried in 1994 to require parents who educate their children at home to obtain state teacher certification, a step that would have all but abolished a practice already recognized as a parental right;
	<p><li>The Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1995 ruled that local school boards could deny parents the right to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distributions for their children;
	<p><li>The Michigan Supreme Court in 1993 denied "secular parents" the right to educate their children at home, even though it upheld the right of "religious parents" to do so;
	<p><li>The county of Durham, N.C., in 1995 drew up guidelines for determining the presence of child abuse in the home that could lead to investigations of parents for practices such as confining children to their rooms. The county also crafted a list of guidelines for "suitable" parenting, which included dictating such minutiae as what time parents must be home if a baby-sitter is watching their children (9 p.m. in the case of 12-14 year olds, for example);
	<p><li>A school nurse and doctor in East Stroudsburg, Penn., recently administered physical examinations -- including examination of the genitalia -- to about 60 girls aged 11 and 12, without permission from many of their parents; and
	<p><li>Even groups like school counselors and the American Library Association (ALA) have shown hostility toward parental rights; counselors by claiming they can counsel minors without parental consent, and the ALA by opposing parental efforts to prevent their children from checking out R- and X-Rated videos.
	</ul><p>Fagan and Horn say that even though the Supreme Court has ruled decisively in favor of parental rights, violations of those rights still occur with alarming frequency. To correct the problem, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.) would buttress the Court's settled opinion by clarifying parental rights to:<ul>
	<p><li>direct or provide for the education of the child;
	<p><li>make a health or mental-health decision for the child (with exceptions to "prevent an imminent risk of serious harm or remedy serious harm to the child");
	<p><li>discipline the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as defined by the Supreme Court; and 
	<p><li>direct or provide for the religious and moral formation of the child.
	</ul><p>The analysts are careful to point out that the legislation would in no way hinder states from protecting children from child abuse. Parental rights are fundamental, but they are not absolute, the analysts say. "No parent has a right to abuse a child," they say, "and the state has the duty to protect the child." The analysts say the real threat of child abuse stems not from the legislation, but from the "family preservation philosophy" of social workers who repeatedly try to reunite children with clearly abusive parents.
<p>	To those opponents of parental rights who will nevertheless raise the child-abuse issue, the analysts again cite the Supreme Court, which said in 1979 that "the statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition." 
	<p>It is this "repugnant" disregard for parental rights that must be corrected, the analysts say. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would do just that, they say, "erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights."

<title> Study Shows Wasteful Spending Still Abounds In Washington - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> STUDY SHOWS WASTEFUL SPENDING
STILL ABOUNDS IN WASHINGTON

        WASHINGTON, JULY 22, 1996</b> -- Even in an era marked by concern for how taxpayer dollars are spent, boondoggles still abound in Washington, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi112.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	In the second of a series of reports on "How Government Wastes Your Money," Heritage Senior Fellow in Economics Ronald Utt casts the spotlight on some particularly outlandish recent examples, such as:<ul>
<p><li>The 260 public housing residents, officials and employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who took an all-expenses-paid trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico -- courtesy of the taxpayers. The official purpose of the trip was to attend the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization. But HUD's inspector general said the event showed a marked "lack of programmatic content." Perhaps, says Utt, that's because the participants were too busy taking advantage of the numerous amenities offered at the Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort: gambling, snorkeling, dancing, touring, shopping and a beauty salon. The total cost of the excursion: $325,000.
<p><li>The telephones at the Department of Agriculture, which were being used to make calls to adult phone-sex lines, many to the Dominican Republic. What's more, the General Accounting Office found that during one four-month period roughly half the collect calls accepted by department employees (nearly 600 calls costing $2,600) were from inmates at 18 jails and prisons, with many of the calls rerouted illegally to the department's long-distance lines. 
<p><li>The decision by the Federal Aviation Administration to install a sophisticated new radar system at 47 airports at a cost of $373 million. The problem: The system doesn't work very well. At the 16 airports where it is already in place, the system has suffered frequent shutdowns. Since it was installed at Washington's National Airport in January 1996, for example, the system has failed nearly once every week and has proven incapable of detecting dangerous wind conditions (as it was supposed to).
	 </ul><p>"Washington would like to think these stories are isolated incidents," Utt concludes, "but they happen every day. It's just too easy to spend -- and misspend -- somebody else's money."

<title> AFL-CIO "Voter Education Project" Violates Worker Rights, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> AFL-CIO "VOTER EDUCATION PROJECT" VIOLATES WORKER RIGHTS, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1996</b> --  The AFL-CIO's $35 million "voter education project" violates the rights of union workers by using their mandatory union dues to pay for political activities aimed at defeating Republican members of the 104th Congress, two <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1087.html">Heritage Foundation analysts said today.</a>
	<p>They called on Congress to allow union workers to choose not to have their mandatory dues used for partisan political activities. A bill to accomplish this, The Worker Right to Know Act, is scheduled for a vote in Congress July 24 or soon thereafter.
	<p>According to Kenneth R. Weinstein, director of the think tank's Government Reform Project and Research Assistant Thomas M. Wielgus, union members split their vote roughly 60-to-40 between Democrats and Republicans, respectively, in 1994. Since virtually all of the AFL-CIO's effort is aimed at unseating Republicans, this means as many as 40 percent of  AFL-CIO members may be forced to finance political activities with which they disagree. 
	<p>"Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 per year per union member," Weinstein and Wielgus estimate. As things now stand, the authors note, unions are not required to account for how much of union dues are used for political versus other activities. Some unions don't even fully report the amount of their dues income to the government, they say.
<p>	What's more, Weinstein and Wielgus say "most union members may not realize that under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Communications Workers of America v. Beck they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree." 
	<p>Under the Beck decision, unions must refund to their members any dues not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration and grievance processes. Unfortunately, the Heritage analysts say, this decision remains largely unenforced. An April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members revealed that 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain such a refund, and that once they realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund. 
	<p>To rectify the situation, Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., has introduced the Worker Right To Know Act, which would require a union to obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and that used for other activities such as "voter education." It also would make it clear that if workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to political activities, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
	<p>"It is time to make workers aware of their rights under the applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely," the Heritage analysts say. "The Worker Right to Know Act would give union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes."

<h2> HISTORY SHOWS TAX CUTS BOOST ECONOMY, RAISE REVENUE, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 18, 1996</b> -- With the 1996 presidential campaign rekindling the debate over taxes, a <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1086.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says tax rate reductions historically have had none of the negative consequences ascribed to them by tax-cut opponents.
<p>
	Daniel Mitchell, Heritage's McKenna senior fellow in political economy, examined the three major periods of tax-rate reductions in U.S. history -- the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s -- and found in each case that lower taxes not only boosted economic growth, but yielded the federal government more revenue and resulted in high-income Americans bearing a larger share of the tax burden. Consider:<ul>
	<p><li>In the 1920s, tax rates fell across the board, dropping from a top rate of 71 percent to 24 percent. As a result, the economy grew by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, government revenue from personal income taxes increased from $719 million in 1921 to $1.2 billion in 1928, and the share of the tax burden borne by the rich ($50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. 
	<p><li>In the 1960s, President Kennedy again lowered tax rates across the board, reducing the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. In response, the economy experienced its longest expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, and tax collections from those making more than $50,000 climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966.
	<p><li>In the 1980s, President Reagan signed across-the-board tax cuts, paring the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. From 1982 to 1989, the economy responded with its longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew by 99.4 percent, and the share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners rose from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988</ul>.
	<p>By contrast, Mitchell says, periods of tax increases have had a damaging effect on the economy.  He notes that since Reagan left office, the top tax rate has risen from 28 percent to 42 percent. The result: The economy has suffered its worst seven-year period of economic growth since World War II, with family income $2,000 lower today than it was in 1989. 
	<p>Likewise, tax increases imposed by President Johnson, combined with the "bracket creep" of the 1970s, caused the growing economy of the Kennedy years to lapse into a period of stagflation, notorious for rampant inflation and anemic economic growth. As for the 1920s tax cuts, they were followed in the 1930s by tax increases that boosted the top rate first to 63 percent, then to 79 percent. "To put it mildly," Mitchell says, "the 1930s are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades."
	<p>"The economy is lagging, incomes are falling, and tax revenues are stagnant," Mitchell says. "History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates."

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION RAISES WHITE FLAG IN WAR ON DRUGS, NEW HERITAGE STUDY SAYS

        WASHINGTON, July 11, 1996</b> -- Dispatches from the front line of the war on drugs carry bleak news: The United States is going down to defeat, in no small part because the Clinton administration has failed to make combating drugs a high priority, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup279.html"> study released today.</a>
<p>
"After a decade of consistent progress during the Reagan and Bush administrations, almost every available indicator shows the United States is losing -- some would say surrendering -- in the prolonged struggle against illegal drugs," say study authors John Walters and James O'Gara, respectively the president and director of research for the New Citizenship Project. Walters previously served as deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
	<p>Specifically, the analysts fault the president for lackluster appointments to key anti-drug positions, from the "invisible" former drug czar Lee Brown to the "embarrassing" former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who favored outright legalization of drugs. In addition, the administration has cut staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 and allowed 227 agent positions at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to disappear from September 1992 to September 1995.
	<p>Efforts to interdict drugs before they reach U.S. shores also have lagged under the Clinton administration, Walters and O'Gara say. All told, interdiction flight hours in the "transit zone" between the United States and South America have dropped by 50 percent, and ship "steaming days" have fallen by a third. 
	<p>These actions reflect the administration's intentional shift in strategy away from drug interdiction and law enforcement toward therapeutic treatment of drug users, the analysts say. But the new policy has a price: Almost as soon as it went into effect, cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard plummeted, from 51 metric tons in fiscal 1993 to 15 metric tons in fiscal 1994. During the same period, the retail price of a gram of cocaine dropped from $123 to $104, which, ironically, coincided with increased drug use among the very hard-core addicts the administration's new policy was supposed to help.
	<p>The result: Hard-core drug users are "cycling through emergency rooms at record rates," Walters and O'Gara say. Cocaine-related emergency room admissions in the first half of 1995 were 65 percent higher than in the first half of 1991; for heroin, the figure was 120 percent higher; and for methamphetimine the figure was an astonishing 321 percent higher.
	<p>Perhaps even more distressing, the spike in drug use under the Clinton administration is not limited to addicts and "hard" drugs. Citing research from the Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Michigan, Walters and O'Gara note that the number of kids age 12 to 17 using marijuana has almost doubled since 1992, from 1.6 million to 2.9 million. Nearly one in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 12 percent of the class of 1995 had taken LSD. 
	<p>Given the administration's record, Walters and O'Gara say the appointment of Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar is a step in the right direction but that much more needs to be done if the president hopes to retake lost ground in the war on drugs. Specifically, he should:<ul>
	<p><li>Use the "bully pulpit" to send a powerful anti-drug message to the nation's youth, something he thus far has failed to do;
	<p><li>Support anti-drug efforts in Latin America. For $50 million, for example, the administration could provide new tracking aircraft to Peru, a country that has proven its commitment to fighting the drug war by shooting down or disabling 20 trafficker airplanes since March of 1995;
	<p><li>Permit the Defense Department to spend more than the currently allowed 0.3 percent of its budget on drug interdiction;
	<p><li>Block future proposals by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to ease prison sentences for crimes involving crack cocaine; and
	<p><li>Allow federal funds to flow to religiously based drug-treatment programs, which in some cases are far more effective than programs where addicts decide how long and rigorous their treatment will be. 
	</ul><p>In the end, Walters and O'Gara say the Clinton administration cannot escape at least partial responsibility for America's recent losses in the war on drugs. "President Clinton has demonstrated little leadership on the drug issue and has failed to send an unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans," they say.

<h2>New Strategy Required for Cleaner Air</h2>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation today released a white paper urging for the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.

"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled <i><a href="/pff/clean/exec.html">Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas</a></i>.  "Alternative fuel -- or non petroleum-based -- vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions strategies for meeting clean air goals."<p>

The white paper calls for an end to Federal fuel taxes that discriminate against alternative fuels.  In their place it urges incentives for states and regions to design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels in their area.  The authors also argue that alternative fuel vehicles are a lower-cost way to improve automobile efficiency than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.<p>

"By removing barriers to expanded alternative fuel vehicle use and development of other improved technologies, these proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and national energy security goals," argues the paper.<p>

Copies of the white paper are available from the Foundation by calling 202/289-8928 or on its Internet homepage:  www.pff.org.  The Progress & Freedom Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center established in 1993 to create a positive vision of the future founded in the historic principles of the American Idea.  It brings together a diverse group of thinkers and policy experts and shares their work with the American people through seminars, conferences, publications and broadcasts.<p>

<h2> AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD FACES $14,000 TAX BILL
TO KEEP MEDICARE AFLOAT, STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 18, 1996</b> -- The tax bill for every household in America will come to $14,000 to keep Medicare afloat through the year 2005, according to <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi110.html">a new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the recent Medicare Trustees' report on the program's financial condition.
	<p>As has been widely reported, the hospital insurance portion of Medicare (Part A) will run out of money in 2001, at which point it will literally be illegal for the program to pay full benefits. To keep this segment of Medicare operating until 2005 will require a $400 billion bailout, or $4,000 in new taxes on every household in America, says <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm"> Stuart Butler</a>, Heritage vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies.
	<p>The situation for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other services, is in many ways even worse. Under current law, the cost of Part B is paid partly by beneficiaries (about 30 percent) and partly by taxpayers (about 70 percent). Yet, if no changes are made to Medicare, by 2005 the taxpayer share of Part B costs is projected to rise to 84 percent. With Part B costs expected to total $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, that translates into a taxpayer share of $950 billion, or $10,000 for every family in America.
	<p>Despite this bleak forecast, the Medicare Trustees balked at proposing serious solutions to the program's terminal financial condition, Butler says.  Instead, they proposed a "national commission" to recommend solutions to Congress.  But all this will do is "allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years," the Heritage Foundation executive says. By that point, "the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic," he says.
	<p>Butler says Congress and the White House should act now to repair Medicare's finances by making three structural changes to the program.  First, turn Medicare into a "defined contribution" program, which would give seniors a specified amount of money to purchase health coverage instead of providing specific benefits.  Second, allow Medicare recipients to choose from a wide range of health plans, which would give them access to fuller coverage (prescription drug benefits, for example) and spur competition between plans to hold down costs.  And third, reduce the Part B subsidy for those who don't need it, which would correct a costly situation in which millionaire seniors get just as much help paying their doctor bills as those who rely entirely on Social Security checks to make ends meet.
	<p>Calling the Medicare Trustees report "grim reading," Butler says policy-makers have limited choices when it comes to fixing Medicare: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms. "Only the third choice makes any sense," Butler says. "The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be."

<h2> REPUBLICANS WRONG TO BELIEVE 104th CONGRESS A FAILURE, ANALYST SAYS </h2>
<p><b>Bigger Budget Cuts than Reagan's</b>
</center>
<p>

<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 14, 1996</b> -- It's one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; it's quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi109.html"> a new Heritage Foundation analysis.</a><p>
	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ron Utt</a>.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  <p>
	"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war." 
	<p>Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.
	<p>Utt's conclusion: Congress' accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agency's budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagan's goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congress' 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.
	<p>Granted, there's much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congress' performance was," Utt says, "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congress' cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the country's four "power marketing administrations."
	<p>With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congress' goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "There's no reason it can't cut spending a second time." <p>

<title>INS Considers "Dumbing Down" Standards for Citizenship, Analyst Charges - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> INS CONSIDERS "DUMBING DOWN" STANDARDS FOR CITIZENSHIP, ANALYST CHARGES </h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 13, 1996</b> -- This Fourth of July, 2,000 immigrants will swear-in as U.S. citizens at the World Trade Center in New York City, 10,000 will naturalize in Los Angeles a day earlier, and another 4,000 will swap their green cards for citizenship papers in El Paso, Texas.
	<p>Like the waves of immigrants that rolled upon America's shores on the eve of World War I, these immigrants have been immersed in the language, culture and history of their new nation, the better to help them become naturalized U.S. citizens. Now, proposals under consideration by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) would tamper with this highly successful assimilation formula, lowering naturalization standards and devaluing citizenship "like a worthless peso," according to a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/miller.html">new article</a> in The Heritage Foundation magazine <a href="/heritage/p_review/">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.</a> 
	<p>Specifically, the INS is considering making it easier -- too easy -- to become a U.S. citizen, writes John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. Not only is the INS studying whether to ease the English language requirement for citizenship, it is contemplating exempting entire classes of immigrants from the U.S. history and government tests newcomers traditionally have to pass. 
	<p>Granted, the INS has had to deal with a flood of new applications for citizenship -- 1.2 million in 1995 versus an average of just 230,000 a year in the 1980s.  But the way to cope with the volume of applications is not to lower naturalization standards to the point that immigrants begin to take citizenship for granted, Miller says.  
	<p>Yet that, he says, is what is happening. "Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates," he says.
	<p>To some organizations, this is a welcome development, because easy naturalization translates into political power. For example, Miller says, more Hispanic citizens means more Hispanic votes, which explains why the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials promotes easing naturalization standards. 
	<p>But such views not only diminish the value of citizenship, Miller says, they may also inflame the anti-immigrant sentiment that bubbles just below America's multicultural surface.  Citing a recent poll that shows 66 percent of Americans already feel America is no longer a "melting pot," Miller says a robust naturalization process is the only means the country has to "decide who is an American and who is not ... Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations." 
	<p>Fortunately, Miller says, an antidote to the INS's lackadaisical attitude toward naturalization can be found in a Seattle program that puts immigrants through an intensive, 10-week course in the basics of U.S. citizenship.  Applicants who pass an English fluency screening are grilled in preparation for the standard INS exam, and are rewarded with an INS interview at the end of 10 weeks, compared to the usual six-month wait.  Particularly encouraging to Miller is the fact that the Seattle program -- which requires immigrants to give up three hours a night, four nights a week -- has a waiting list hundreds of names long.
	<p>Miller concedes the INS lacks the resources to run such a program itself, but then he doesn't want it to. Instead, he envisions a nationwide network of private and local public institutions that "would revive the old-fashioned idea of civic instruction for immigrant adults."  In this way, he says, immigrants can become Americans, and America can remain the melting pot it was intended to be. <p>

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BEARS BRUNT
OF GOVERNMENT "DOWNSIZING"
</h2>

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 29, 1996</b> --As Congress and the White House lock horns over the fiscal 1997 budget, both sides should take note of an important fact:  Most of the government downsizing that has occurred so far has been in the Department of Defense. 
	<p>In fact, of the 200,000 government jobs eliminated to date, some 60 percent have been defense jobs. If one counts all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of fiscal year 1992, more than 89 percent  -- almost 760,000 total -- come solely from the Department of Defense, according to Heritage Foundation Senior Defense Policy Analyst Baker Spring and Policy Analyst  John S. Barry, authors of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bgup278.html">a study released today.</a>
<p>	Defense budget cuts, in turn, have led to a drop in private-sector defense industry jobs, according to Spring and Barry. By the end of fiscal year 1997, there will be 795,000 fewer such positions than in 1992. "In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. By comparison, Internal Revenue Service employment has dropped by only 6 percent, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] positions have dropped by less than 5 percent and Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] positions have increased by more than 2 percent," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>Barry and Spring recommend "restoring balance" to federal employment policy by:<ul>
<li>Freezing military personnel reductions at 2.4 million, the level recommended by the Clinton administration in its 1993 "Bottom Up Review" of U.S. military requirements
<li>Limiting further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts
<li>Increasing a defense procurement budget that has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985, severely damaging America's future military readiness. The steady stream of procurement cuts have cost 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the defense employment peak in 1987
<li>Concentrating federal work force reductions within non-defense departments by eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies.</ul>
	<p>"President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA and ATF watching their every move. They do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War," write Spring and Barry.

<title>Legal-Aid Groups Defy Ban on Lobbying and Helping Criminals, Study Says - Heritage PR</title>

LEGAL-AID GROUPS DEFY BAN ON LOBBYING
AND HELPING CRIMINALS, STUDY SAYS  </h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 21, 1996</b> -- Faced with new rules that prevent them from lobbying and defending drug dealers and illegal aliens, groups that use taxpayer dollars to provide legal assistance to the poor have devised a number of loopholes allowing them to continue these banned activities, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup276.html">according to a new report</a> from The Heritage Foundation.
	<p>Rules imposed by Congress last year bar groups that receive grants from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) from using any part of their budget -- including private funds -- to lobby against welfare reform, file class-action lawsuits, represent criminals, and engage in other politically motivated activities. The new rules were necessary, says Kenneth Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center and author of the report, because "in the past legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, their own money for prohibited activities."  
<p>	But with this loophole now closed, Boehm says, legal services groups have invented a new evasive tactic: They swear off banned activities in order to remain eligible for federal money, then set up new shadow organizations that will use the groups' non-federal money to pursue a political agenda.  
<p>	For example, the Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center was recently formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services (CLS), which receives money from the LSC. The new center, housed in the same building as CLS, will handle non-prohibited cases and receive taxpayer subsidies; CLS, meanwhile, will continue to handle prohibited political and ideological cases. "The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused," Boehm says.
<p>	Legal services lawyers also have incurred the wrath of Congress for representing drug dealers who face eviction from public housing projects. Boehm cites a case pending in New York City where representatives of the city's 500,000 public housing tenants have sided with the New York Housing Authority in support of expedited evictions of drug dealers. Defending the drug dealers is the Legal Aid Society, which is supposed to use the federal money it receives from the LSC to represent the interests of the poor. 
<p>	With Congress likely to impose a new round of tough restrictions to deal with this problem, the LSC board defensively drafted a new regulation that supposedly bans legal groups receiving federal funds from representing drug dealers facing eviction, Boehm says. The problem, once again, is that the regulation is so full of loopholes it does nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from participating in drug-eviction cases, he says.
<p>	The ability of legal services groups to flout attempts to rein in their political activities is evidence to Boehm that Congress was right last year when it decided to end all federal funding for the LSC by 1998. Besides, he notes, the LSC has been successful raising funds for its activities from other sources, blunting the charge that elimination of federal funding would deny legal services to the poor. For example, the LSC will receive $278 million from the federal government this year, down from $400 million last year, a substantial cut. Yet the LSC also collects $250 million a year from non-federal sources, Boehm says, raising the question of whether federal funding is needed in the first place.
<p>	When the bill that funds the LSC for fiscal year 1997 comes to the floor of the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership is expected to leave open the option of "zeroing out" the agency -- something Boehm says would be a wise policy decision. "The 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of legal services groups to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense," Boehm says. Now, he says, "it is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program."

Ever-Increasing "Tax Wedge" 
Between Labor Costs And Wages

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 17, 1996</b> -- Instead of increasing the minimum wage, which would only destroy jobs, lawmakers addressing worker anxiety over lower take-home pay should reduce the costs imposed by government on employers, Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi102.html">said today</a>.
<p>	"There is a huge 'wedge' between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck," according to Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, deputy director for economic policy. "These costs are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess consumes their take-home pay."
<p>	For example, the analysts point out that in 1995 private-industry employers paid an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep a worker on their payrolls. But after deducting the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes and optional benefits, workers took home an average of only $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less that the total cost of employing them. "The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation," the analysts say.
<p>	For minimum-wage workers, the "wedge" is just as bad: In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire such a worker. But after the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03 per hour) is deducted, and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, this worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total cost of their employment, and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>	These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study cited by the analysts estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 per year. "This equals somewhere between $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker," the analysts say.
<p>	"The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage," say Wilson and Antonelli. Instead, "Government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay." Such policies -- cuts in payroll and income taxes, reductions in the regulatory burden on businesses, a cut in the capital gains tax -- also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities and real earnings.	  
<p>	"Politicians who blame 'corporate greed' for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government," the Heritage analysts say.

Congress, White House
Urged to Boost Spending

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 16, 1996</b> -- The refusal of the White House to adequately fund its own national security programs is undermining America's ability to guarantee victory in defense of its freedom and global interests, a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says.
<P>	Even the passage by the House yesterday of a defense budget $12 billion higher than what President Clinton has requested for fiscal year 1997 is not enough, not when the White House has underfunded its own military strategy by $130 billion over the next six years, Heritage Senior Policy analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> calculates. The Senate, Spring says, has an opportunity to begin to correct the administration's grave funding shortfall when it considers the fiscal 1997 Defense Authorization Bill in the coming days.
<p>	Spring says the existing gap between what is needed to fund the administration's military strategy -- which calls for the United States to be able to fight two Persian Gulf-sized wars "nearly simultaneously" -- and actual spending plans will leave the United States unable to fulfill its commitment to security alliances in Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  He estimates that under the president's defense budget fighting just one Persian Gulf-sized war in the future would require 87 percent of America's army divisions and 75 percent of its aircraft-carrier battle groups, leaving little left to fight a second conflict and uphold security commitments.
<p>	While Congress has attempted to provide adequate funding for the administration's defense plan in the short term, it has failed to address the long-term implications of the budget shortfall on U.S. military strategy, Spring says.  Despite the House-approved increase in defense spending for the coming fiscal year, Congress' overall defense budget actually would spend less than what the White House proposes in 2001 and 2002, he says.  Even last year's decision by Congress to spend $7 billion more on defense than the White House, while politically costly, fell far short of the $20 billion Spring says is necessary to fully fund the administration's defense plan.
<p>	By way of example, Spring notes that Operation Desert Storm required seven active army divisions and six aircraft-carrier battle groups.  Yet the administration's defense budget, Spring estimates, provides for only eight of each.  The result: If a U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf were attacked by either Iran or Iraq, the United States could respond but could not also maintain its commitments elsewhere in the world.
<p>	Although critics claim reductions in military spending are only natural now that the Cold War is over, Spring notes that those reductions are being made without regard for the fact that U.S. security commitments to NATO, Japan and others remain intact.  "All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services," he says.  Without increased defense spending, up to the level needed to fund the administration's military strategy, "the time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments." 
<p>	The task for Congress, Spring says, is to begin a national debate over the proper role and size of America's defense forces.  To stimulate such a debate, Spring offers a draft resolution that Congress could consider, outlining in detail a global defense strategy and the specific force levels necessary to fulfill that strategy -- down to the number of troops, ships and aircraft required.  The resolution could be considered as an amendment to the Senate Defense Authorization Bill, he says.  
<p>	But the time to begin the debate is now, Spring says, for if defense spending is left at current levels it could well mean "the end of America as a global military power ... and the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort Americans have not known since the first half of this century."

<title>Foreign Aid Recipients Consistently Vote Against U.S. in U.N. - Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FOREIGN AID RECIPIENTS CONSISTENTLY VOTE AGAINST THE U.S. IN THE U.N., STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 13, 1996</b> -- Despite claims by the Clinton administration that foreign aid bolsters support for America around the globe, nearly two-thirds of the countries that received U.S. foreign aid last year voted against the United States a majority of the time in the United Nations, according to a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi101.html">new analysis</a> by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	All told, 75 of the 118 countries that received foreign aid last year voted against the United States more than half of the time, reports Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a>. "It's clear from the data," he says, "that foreign aid fails to win friends where it counts -- in supporting U.S. diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations."
<p>	The 10 countries that voted against the United States most often -- an average of 73 percent of the time -- will pocket more than $212 million in foreign aid this fiscal year. And of the 10 countries that will receive the most money, only three of them voted with the United States a majority of the time.
<p>	Some of America's biggest aid beneficiaries were consistently hostile to U.S. positions in the United Nations. Egypt, for example, receives more foreign aid ($2.1 billion) than any country except Israel, yet voted against the United States 67 percent of the time. And the country that voted against the United States the most -- India, 83 percent of the time -- is America's fifth-largest foreign aid recipient, pulling in $157 million.
<p>	Even Haiti and Mexico, two countries the United States has helped considerably, consistently opposed U.S. positions in the United Nations. On top of the $1 billion America spent on a military operation to restore democracy to Haiti, the island nation will get another $124 million this year. Haiti voted against the United States 60 percent of the time. The same holds true of Mexico, which benefited from a $40 billion economic bailout funded largely by U.S. taxpayers and is slated to get another $25 million this year, yet voted against the United States 58 percent of the time.
<p>	"Why is the United states spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?" Johnson asks. He recommends that Congress make significant cuts in the $13 billion foreign aid budget this year, even abolishing the agency that hands out most of the money.

<title>Congress Should Back White House Plan to Let Poor Move Out of Public Housing - Heritage PR</title>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 7, 1996</b> -- Congress should end antiquated housing policies that concentrate the poor in deteriorating neighborhoods and embrace a Clinton administration plan that gives tenants a choice of where to live, a Heritage Foundation analyst says in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1081.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	"To his credit, President Clinton's fiscal year 1996 budget proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from projects to tenant-based vouchers that let the poor rent the housing of their choice," says Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow at the prominent think tank.   
<p>	Yet rather than embrace what Utt calls the most innovative housing-reform proposal in 25 years, Congress drafted new legislation that largely preserves the current system of public-housing projects. While such a move is sure to please the construction and public-housing lobbies, he says, it guarantees that thousands of poor families will remain trapped in substandard government apartments.
<p>	Under the president's plan, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would end multibillion-dollar payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with vouchers going directly to tenants living in housing projects. Utt says tenants then would have a range of options: continue to rent housing from the PHA, rent better housing elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better project managers. The end result is that PHAs would be stripped of their government-sponsored monopoly and forced to compete for tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. 
<p>	But Congress is blocking the reform, Utt says, devoting much-needed funds to traditional public housing projects rather than to vouchers. For example, the $2.5 billion proposed by the Senate appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over HUD to modernize housing projects could have provided vouchers to more than 475,000 poor families. Another example: HUD plans to spend $115 million in Baltimore to construct just 338 new housing units, money that could provide a year's worth of safe, decent, privately-owned apartments to as many as 80 percent of the 25,000 poor families on the city's housing-assistance waiting list.
<p>	On average, Utt estimates, project-based assistance costs twice as much as vouchers for each family helped. Instead of empowering tenants, such an approach enriches local bureaucracies at the expense of both the poor and the taxpayers, he says.  
<P>	Vouchers, by contrast, would allow poor families to rent the housing of their choice, as long as the rent stays within established limits. "This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities," Utt says. "Families can move to safer neighborhoods with better schools, the unemployed can move where the jobs are, and the elderly can move closer to their families and shopping." 
<p>	"Congress needs to seriously reconsider its preservation of the status quo in public housing," Utt says. Project-based housing is a proven failure, he says, resulting in the warehousing of large concentrations of the poor in dismal neighborhoods marked by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect and other pathologies. Far better, he says, to switch to a voucher system giving the poor the freedom to live where they want.

<CENTER><B><h2>PHILLIPS FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES 1996 JOURNALISM FELLOWSHIPS</h2>
<h3>$50,000 GOLD AWARD AND $20,000 SILVER AWARD</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
Potomac, MD, May 7, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced the winners of its 1996 journalism fellowship awards.  Stacy Mattingly captured the $50,000 Gold Award for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi.  Daniel Richardson won the $20,000 silver award to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.  
<p>
Mattingly and Richardson were introduced during an awards dinner last night at the University Club in Washington, D.C., attended by prominent journalists.
<p>
During her one-year fellowship which commences on September 1, 1996, Stacy Mattingly will research and write a book on <I>Lisa Herdahl v. Pontotoc County</I>, a Mississippi school prayer case currently in the courts.  Last year, she wrote an extensive article on the case for <I>The Oxford American </I>magazine in Mississippi.  She has spent a great deal of time in Pontotoc County, and her article was widely praised as the most thorough and balanced reporting on the case.  She will write a book in narrative form, beginning with the Herdahl family's move 
from Wisconsin to Mississippi and ending with the trial on the school prayer case.
<p>
Mattingly, 25, is a freelance journalist based in Atlanta.  She writes articles for <I>Crisis</I> magazine and the <I>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</I>.  She served as contributing editor and writer for <I>The Oxford American</I> and as staff reporter for <I>The Oxford Eagle</I> newspaper.  She graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in English.
<p>
For his fellowship project, Daniel Richardson will focus on the Patriot movement in this country.  He believes the Patriot "subculture" is becoming too large to be ignored.  He will investigate the many groups which comprise the Patriot subculture, and he will examine the single defining thread running through all Patriot ideas:  the subversion of the Constitution by internal and external foes leading to greater government authority at the expense of individual freedoms.
<p>
Richardson, 23, is a freelance journalist in Gresham, Oregon.  He writes articles and news stories for <I>The Oregon City News</I> and <I>East County Magazine</I> in Gresham.  He graduated from the University of Puget Sound last year with a B.A. in History.  For his senior thesis, he wrote "A Military History of the Hundred Years' War."
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism.  The Foundation established its journalism fellowship program in 1994 to provide annual grants for journalism projects supportive of American culture and a free society.  The fellowship program is open to working journalists with less than five years of professional experience.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation served as judges for the competition.  The Trustees are:  Thomas L. Phillips, President of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.

Clear "Intervention Criteria" Needed
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 2, 1996</b> -- The United States has been squandering its limited military resources on "missions without a purpose" around the globe, making it difficult for American forces to keep up with their other security commitments, the Heritage Foundation's chief foreign policy spokesman said today.
<P>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a>, the think tank's vice president and director of foreign policy and defense studies, the Clinton White House desperately needs to formulate, spell out and "codify" a policy on where, when, and under what circumstances the United States will intervene militarily in the future.
<p>	Congress, meanwhile, should reassert its "oversight" responsibilities in this area, he said.
<p>
<b>Intervention Criteria</b>
<p>	Holmes made his remarks during a briefing on a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1079.html">policy paper</a> on American military intervention. Written by Defense Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a>, a decorated Gulf War veteran, the report says any U.S. decision to intervene militarily should be based on whether U.S. interests are at stake, America's ability to decisively affect the outcome, and the resources available for the task. 

<p>	Hillen proposes five criteria for determining whether and how the United States should intervene in any given situation:
<p>
<b>	1) Whether national security interests are at stake. </b>
<P>	The United States, Hillen says, must be able to distinguish between such vital interests as "protecting America's territory, borders and airspace" and other interests "that are merely important or marginal." Not all American interests are "high priority" national security interests that must be defended through military intervention, he stresses. 
<p>	The United States should always be prepared to use military force to defend its vital interests, Hillen says. But since U.S. military resources -- both tangible assets such as troops, carrier battle groups, fighter wings, and spare parts and equipment, and intangibles such as "public support" -- are available only in limited supply, the president must realize that not all interests are equally important and choose wisely where and when to dispatch U.S. troops.
<p>	America's vital interests, he says, include: protecting America's territory, borders and airspace; protecting American citizens at home and abroad; preventing a "major-power" threat to Europe, East Asia or the Persian Gulf; preventing "hostile interference by an outside power" in the Western Hemisphere; and ensuring access to foreign trade and resources.
<p><b>	2) Whether the proposed intervention will "jeopardize the ability of the United States to meet more important security commitments."</b>
<p>	There is "an enormous gap," Hillen says, between America's national commitments and objectives and the military resources available to achieve them. 
<p>	The administration's own proposed military force, (presented in the Pentagon's "Bottom-Up Review" of U.S. military readiness) is not only "inadequate" for America's stated strategy, but is underfunded by an estimated $150 billion over five years. Such a force, he says, simply can't do everything the administration expects it to do. 
<p>	"Military interventions in support of peripheral interests," he says, "should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests -- a perilous situation that many believe the United States is rapidly approaching today."
<p><b>	3) Whether the military goals are clearly defined, decisive, attainable and sustainable.</b>
<p>	Military objectives, Hillen stresses, should support political objectives. "For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from ... Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task ... the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored." 
<p>	While "working towards clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point," Hillen says, the Clinton administration has consistently done otherwise. Indeed, when U.S. troops were sent to Haiti and Bosnia, he notes, about the only goal the administration clearly articulated was "setting deadlines for troop withdrawals." This approach, he says, "is a gross misuse of American military power."
<p><b>	4) Whether Congress and the public support the action.</b>
<p>	As the Vietnam experience showed, "only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the United States hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad," Hillen cautions. In the absence of such support, the United States is forced into humiliating withdrawals like the Somalia debacle in 1994.
<p><b>	5) Whether the U.S. military can create "the conditions for their success" -- enabling U.S. forces to achieve their objectives.</b>
<p>	"This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just 'the big ones'," Hillen says. "Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli, Libya, can have a decisive effect." 
<p>	However, he warns, there is always the temptation in limited military interventions to greatly restrict the operational latitude and resources made available to the military command, "because the purpose of the intervention is to send an indeterminate political signal."
<p>	In any intervention, Hillen says, "the military must be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well trained, and that will make a difference, once attained."
<p>	"There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention," the Heritage Foundation report concludes. "However, by establishing workable criteria for military interventions, the United States can minimize those risks, or, at the very least, ensure that the risks are consistent with the costs of the intervention," Hillen says.

<head><title>1993 Tax Hike Dampening U.S. Economy - Heritage PR</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>Washington, D.C. 20002<br>(202 546-4400<br><p><hr><h2>1993 TAX HIKE DAMPENING U.S. ECONOMY,
NEW STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

		WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1996</b> -- Along with the recent news that the U.S. economy grew by only 0.5 percent during the final quarter of last year comes a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">new study</a> from The Heritage Foundation that helps explain why: the $241 billion tax hike enacted in 1993.
<p>		Employing one of the computer models of the economy used by the federal government and many leading U.S. corporations, Heritage Foundation economists found from 1993 through the end of 1996 the tax increase will cost the economy $208 billion in total output, reduce the number of new jobs by 1.2 million, and cost the typical family approximately $2,600 in higher taxes and lower earnings.
<p>		With economic security shaping up as a key issue in the 1996 elections, these findings shed light on the widely observed economic "anxiety" felt by many Americans, say study authors <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs, and <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, visiting fellow in tax analysis.  "People are right to feel they should be better off today than they are," the authors say.  "The 1993 tax increase deprived them of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth."
<p>		Heritage arrived at its findings by essentially "deleting" the tax and spending changes contained in Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) from the computer model -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM). This generates a simulation of how the economy would have performed if these factors had not been changed. No other variables were changed, and only mainstream economic assumptions were made where necessary.
<p>		In addition to slower growth and fewer new jobs, the Heritage analysis also indicated that employee wages and salaries will be reduced by $112 billion, automobile and light truck sales will fall short by 1.3 million vehicles, and businesses will invest some $42.5 billion less in durable goods.
<p>		Taking a specific year -- 1995 -- the study found that the economy would have grown by an additional $66 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were it not for the 1993 tax hike. And for the entire period between 1993 and 1996, the total loss in economic growth is an estimated $208 billion, or $2,100 for every household in America.  
<p>		As for the 1.2 million jobs not created as a result of the 1993 tax and budget changes, nearly 17 percent were the result of new businesses not formed. For every $1 billion in economic growth, roughly 195 new businesses are created.  This means the loss of $208 billion in GDP prevented nearly 40,600 businesses, and 203,000 jobs, from being created. The other 1 million missing jobs are likely the result of existing businesses hiring fewer employees due to the tax increase. Hodge and Beach say that although an otherwise healthy economy has created 8 million new jobs over the past three years, the fact remains that "1.2 million Americans who could have been working today are not because of the 1993 tax increase."
<p>		Not only are fewer Americans working than would have been, but those who are working are earning less.  Of the $112 billion in lower wages and salaries caused by OBRA-93, $46.5 billion will be lost in 1996 alone, according to the Heritage projection using the WUMM model.  That translates into roughly $465 for every household in America, more than the average U.S. household's monthly housing bill of $440.
<p>		Specific industries also are suffering from OBRA-93. In the automobile industry, for example, the loss of 368,000 vehicle sales in 1996 alone means $4.8 billion in lower revenue and 60,100 fewer jobs in auto-related fields.  And as for computers, more than one-third of the $42.5 billion shortfall in durable-goods purchases by businesses will be reflected in lost computer sales, the Heritage study indicates.
<p>		Far from being the healthiest economy in 30 years, as President Clinton has said, "the current economy is lousy compared to past recoveries and lousy compared to what it would have been without the 1993 tax increase," Beach says. "The first rules of economics should be the same as it is in medicine: First, do no harm."

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> On April 15, the day Americans' increasingly burdensome tax bill is due, The House of Representatives will vote to make it harder to increase taxes in the future.  The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.J.RES.159:">Tax Limitation Constitutional Amendment</a> would require a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise taxes rather than the fifty percent plus one currently required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"In 1950, families paid only 5 percent of their income in federal taxes," said Herger.  "In 1990, that number jumped to 24 percent and when combined with state and local taxes, families lose almost half their income to taxes.  If a two-thirds tax increase amendment had been in place since 1980, the American people would have been spared more than $660 billion in new taxes, all of which were used to pay for more government spending."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Over the past three decades, Washington has paid for wasteful and excessive federal spending by simply raising taxes on working families and small businesses," added Herger.  "These excessive taxes stifle business growth, hurt families, and hinder our nation's economy.  It shouldn't be easy to take money from families and businesses -- it's their money not Washington's."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"A two-thirds requirement to raise taxes would go a long way toward reining in runaway federal spending and putting a check on excessive taxation," said Herger.  "The requirement would also become a valued component in our efforts to reform the entire tax system."

<h2>DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN FORCES NEW U.S.-PRC-ROC STRATEGIC BALANCE, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 12, 1996</b> -- Taiwan's new democratic status will force the People's Republic of China (PRC) to treat her with much greater caution and respect, and U.S. policy-makers to take America's commitment to her safety more seriously, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a>, a policy analyst with Heritage's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies Center</a>, the new situation "forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance." For the United States, "democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking better relations with China." From now on, "U.S. policy-makers will be freer to stand up for Taiwan because they will more clearly occupy the moral high ground," Yates says, "whereas China will have to be more circumspect in its belligerence where Taiwan is concerned." In fact, he says, "Taiwanese democracy strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy." 
<p>
	"It will be increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese who elected him," Yates says. On a practical level, this means "if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative," the answer no longer can be "that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese." In fact, Yates says democracy on Taiwan "challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan."  
<p>	Meanwhile, "democracy is of great strategic importance to Taiwan -- more important than any weapon system it could acquire," Yates points out. "It makes the ROC much more likely to draw support from the United States and other developed democracies in the event of a hostile threat from mainland China."
<p>	Yates offers a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bgup272.html">game plan</a> U.S. policy-makers should follow to protect American interests in the Far East, and promote stability in the region. Among the proposals:<p>
<ul>
	<li>  Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue, so that China and Taiwan have a forum to discuss and resolve issues;<p>
<li> Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank, even if the PRC objects;<p>
<li>	  In accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, continue to sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, and assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile-defense system;<p>
	<li>  Avoid linking renewal of the PRC's most favored nation (MFN) trade status with Taiwan issues, since such linkage would be counterproductive and would probably hurt Taiwan and Hong Kong, which have manufacturing concerns on the mainland; and<p>
<li> Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement, perhaps one whereby Taiwan would pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time, and Beijing would agree to renounce the use of force during that same period.<p>
</ul>
	"The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy," Yates observes. "Despite large-scale military and rhetorical intimidation from Beijing, the election ran smoothly.  Now the United States, China and Taiwan must establish a new equilibrium that will be successful in the new strategic environment."

<h2>DESPITE VICTORIES, CONSERVATISM FACES TOUGH FIGHT, HERITAGE PRESIDENT SAYS</h2>
</center><b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 11, 1996</b> -- President Clinton's State of the Union pronouncement that "the era of big government is over" seemed to cement conservatism's position as the dominant political philosophy in America.  
<p>	Not so fast, says the president of The Heritage Foundation in his latest annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," released today. It's true conservatives have scored some important victories, but "the war is far from over," according to <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, head of the well-known conservative think tank.  
<p>	"Liberalism is not dead," Feulner says, "because it is just too much fun to spend other people's money." He notes that after President Clinton's eulogy for big government, one of his first actions was to demand $8 billion in new spending from Congress for the current fiscal year. 
<p>	What's more, he says, the Washington establishment's response to many of the proposals for conservative change has been a resounding "no": no term limits, no balanced budget, no welfare reform, no entitlement reform, no significant regulatory relief, and no end to the National Endowment for the Arts, Legal Services Corporation and numerous other non-essential programs and agencies.
<p>	While Feulner is not prepared to declare the end of liberalism as a political entity, neither does he agree with those "perpetually melancholy conservatives who subscribe to the headline 'We Lost.'" After all, he says, Congress passed both a bold, seven-year balanced budget plan and real welfare reform (both vetoed by President Clinton). And even in the face of threatened retaliation from the powerful senior-citizen lobby, Congress tried to reform Medicare -- a valiant effort that would have saved the program from impending bankruptcy.
<p>	Of course, Congress also committed its share of blunders in the past year, Feulner says. For example, lawmakers dallied on the passage of the line-item veto. "Without sounding too much like the liberal League of Women Voters or Common Cause," he says, "the line-item veto languished for 18 months because the GOP Congress didn't want to hand this weapon to President Clinton." Calling the veto central to getting control of the budget, Feulner says, "The credibility of all of us who truly believe in smaller, less intrusive government suffered while Congress dragged its feet on this promise." The legislation finally was approved this spring and signed into law on April 9.
<p>	Feulner also criticizes some of his fellow conservatives for their short-sightedness on tax reform. "Reforming the tax code to produce a flat -- or at least a flatter -- tax was to have been the driving issue in the '96 election," Feulner says. Instead, the GOP presidential hopefuls earlier this year used the issue to attack one another.  "What were these Republicans -- self-proclaimed conservatives all -- doing playing upon class warfare and class envy, positions long the domain of the left?" he asks.
<p>	Despite these short-term setbacks, the Heritage Foundation chief executive remains upbeat about the direction in which the country is moving politically. The reason: "Most Americans realize liberalism has been a failure." Citing a <I>Washington Post</I> series bemoaning the fact that many Americans have lost confidence in government, Feulner says, "Of course they have; any sane person would." After all, what other reaction can there be to stories like the one cited by Feulner on how Minnesota's Medicaid program is paying for sex-change operations?  Transsexuals may complain that they are "trapped" in the bodies of the opposite sex, he says, "but what about the average American who is trapped inside the body of a taxpayer?"
<p>	As long as such liberal excesses continue -- and there is no reason to believe they will cease -- Feulner believes the conservative case will remain as strong as ever. "I am optimistic," he says, "because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not on wishful thinking." 
<p>	"People genuinely want to get this country back on the right track," he says. "The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America."

<h2>HERITAGE FOUNDATION OFFERS BLUEPRINT FOR DISMANTLING U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Heritage Public Relations<p>

	WASHINGTON, APRIL 5, 1996</b> -- Congress should take the funds now going to the U.S. Department of Education and send them back back to states, localities and parents, Heritage Foundation analysts said in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1076.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	To assist lawmakers in this task, the study's authors, Visiting Fellow in Education Denis Doyle and Policy Analyst Christine Olson, have put together a comprehensive plan that would eliminate many federal education programs outright, transfer some programs to other government agencies, and roll others into block grants to be administered by states and localities.
<p>	Doyle and Olson recommend a host of programs for termination, including Goals 2000, President Clinton's education reform initiative, the Bilingual and Immigrant Education program (to be phased out over three years), college Work-Study, and Direct Student Loans. Programs that would be transferred to other government agencies include student financial-aid, such as Pell Grants and Federal Perkins Loans. These would go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A host of programs are recommended for either full or partial conversion into state or local block grants, including Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and Title I, the federal aid program for school districts with high concentrations of poor students.  
<p>	Doyle and Olson say the Back to Basics Education Reform Act, sponsored by Reps. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., and Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, "is an excellent vehicle to dismantle the department because it would entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the states and the people." The bill would abolish the Department of Education one year after its enactment; roll all elementary and post-secondary education programs into two separate block grants; and eliminate major portions of the federal education bureaucracy. 
<p>	According to Doyle and Olson, "Since its creation in 1979, the Department of Education has done precisely what its severest critics envisioned: It has usurped state and local control of education by slowly imposing a steady stream of bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive rules and requirements and has inserted itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts."  
<p>	The result, besides taking control away from parents, teachers and local officials, is "practically no positive impact on student performance." In fact, as the federal government's role in education increased, academic performance of the nation's students has declined. Since the Department of Education was created in 1979, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores have stagnated, the high-school dropout rate has risen from 8 percent to 12 percent, and, despite spending more money per pupil on elementary and secondary schools than any other county, math and science test scores of American 13-year-olds still lag behind those of other industrial countries. 
<p>	"Taxpayers should recognize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to 'federalize' the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of our children's education," say Doyle and Olson. The federal role in education -- currently subsidized to the tune of more than $31 billion per year -- has expanded from 100 programs in 1980 to more than 240 today.	
<p>	Yet, the federal government does have an important role to play in education, the authors say. "Washington should limit its role to doing things states and localities cannot do themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose," they say. For example, "the federal government has an overriding responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school or out." In addition, they acknowledge a federal role for "data collection, dissemination, analysis and research, and in helping poor school children get a good education (through creation of school voucher systems, for example). All of these jobs can be handled at the agency level, the analysts say. 
<p>	 "One the other hand," they say, "when it comes to such basic educational matters as management of classroom instruction, adoption of curricula, and text book selection, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice."
<p>	"It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education. States and localities are the 'laboratories of democracy'; educational reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high from a bunch of Washington bureaucrats," Doyle and Olson say.

<center><B>Executive Summary</B><P>
</center>

<b><i>Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>

The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>

Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>

In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p></b></i>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  
<b><i>The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p>

<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>

<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot;

<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
   
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
  
<b><i>The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>

<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>

Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.</i></b>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, MARCH 29, 1996</B> -- Congress approval today of legislation 
scrapping Depression-era crop programs that make U.S. farmers dependent on government and 
cost taxpayers billions of dollars was immediately praised as a &QUOT;dramatic and welcome&QUOT; step in 
the right direction.<P>
	&QUOT;For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the 
government,&QUOT; said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of the Heritage Foundations Agriculture Policy 
Project and one of the architects of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">reform plan</a>. &QUOT;Consumers win with more competitive 
prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the 
freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market.&QUOT;<P>
	The legislation, while it doesnt go as far as Frydenlund had recommended, will replace 
open-ended subsidies for crops such as corn, wheat, cotton and rice with a system of &QUOT;transition 
payments&QUOT; -- guaranteed payments that decline and eventually cease by the year 2002.<P>
	When Frydenlund first proposed the elimination of agriculture subsidy programs in an 
April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, &QUOT;Freeing Americas Farmers,&QUOT; few in Washington gave 
his recommendations much chance of passage. Yet the House-Senate conference report on 
agriculture, which is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton, pushes policy 
dramatically in the same direction -- eliminating government programs that rob American 
consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars and deny farmers the ability to profit from the 
explosive growth in the global demand for food.<P>
	Frydenlund says that although the farm bill failed to reform the costly sugar and peanut 
programs, &QUOT;it is a dramatic and welcome departure from 60 years of command-and-control 
agriculture policy.&QUOT;<P>
	The reform plan proposed by Frydenlund, had it been adopted in its entirety, would have 
phased out all crop subsidies and support payments over five years and, according to a detailed 
computer analysis, would have added $35 billion to the economy of rural America over that same 
period of time.<P>

<hr><h2>HOUSE HEALTH-CARE REFORM PLAN BETTER THAN KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY PLAN
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 27, 1996</b> -- A health-care <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bgup271.html">reform bill</a> scheduled for a 
vote in the House of Representatives this Thursday would go a long way toward solving the 
problems of availability, portability and affordability of health insurance, more so than the 
Senate measure sponsored by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.<p>
	&quot;Anxiety about todays health-insurance coverage stems from the fact that coverage is 
tied to the workplace,&quot; says Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. &quot;Workers and dependents are covered 
by an employer-based health-insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same 
employer. If a worker loses his job, he gets no tax break if he buys individual coverage, and if he 
takes another job, he may encounter difficulties getting new coverage if he has a pre-existing 
medical condition.&quot;<p> 
	The Senate bill tries to address these problems, Liu says, but it fails to treat the problems 
at their source: the fact that health insurance -- unlike other types of insurance -- is owned by 
employers, rather than individual workers. This anomaly, he notes, is encouraged by the tax 
code.<p>
	Sponsored by eight House members, the Health Coverage and Affordability Act would 
enable Americans to keep their health insurance when they change or lose their jobs, allow 
individuals to purchase health insurance outside of the workplace, and allow self-employed 
individuals to deduct 50 percent (up from the current 30 percent) of the amount paid for health 
insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House legislation is being coordinated by 
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.<p>
	Effective health-care reform, Liu says, would offer the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li> Group-to-Group portability/tax equity. The best way to achieve portability, Liu says, is 
to give Americans the ability to purchase health insurance independent of their employers, and 
still receive the tax breaks they get for employer-based insurance. This would benefit most of 
todays uninsured, especially the self-employed and those working at small firms that are  unable 
to provide health insurance, the Heritage analyst says.<p>
	<li> Limits on exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions for those who lose employer-
based coverage. Liu says Kassebaum-Kennedys guaranteed availability and renewability of 
health insurance is &quot;a welcome and long-overdue improvement in todays health insurance 
market.&quot; The House proposal would similarly limit the ability of insurance carriers to impose 
eligibility or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims 
experience or medical history.<p>
	<li> Group-purchasing arrangements to allow small employers and associations to pool their 
purchasing power and get reasonably priced coverage. Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts -- through 
creation of so-called Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs) -- to make insurance more 
affordable for small employers and the self-employed. But, Liu says, because HPPCs would 
receive more favorable treatment from certain state laws than other types of plans, they would 
have an unfair advantage. &quot;Instead of creating an uneven playing field, Congress should ensure 
that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or not, are treated equally,&quot; Liu says.<p>
</ul>
	&quot;To achieve true health-insurance reform, Kassebaum-Kennedy must incorporate key 
proposals from the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act now making its way 
through the House. Only then can Congress give working Americans what they want from 
health-insurance reform: true portability and more choice through the purchase of  individual 
policies that provide long-term protection against catastrophic illness. If Americans are allowed 
to comparison shop among a variety of health plans, costs can be controlled,&quot; Liu says.<p>

<h2>U.S. SHOULD OPPOSE CHINA'S EFFORTS TO DELAY<BR>
GLOBAL FREE TRADE WITH TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 22, 1996</b> -- In addition to threatening Taiwan militarily, the Peoples Republic of China is trying to prevent the island nation from gaining entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) before China itself does -- a move the United States <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/ascbg140.html">should oppose</a>, says an Asia analyst at The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	One of Americas largest trading partners, Taiwan is taking steps to meet the economic requirements for entry into the WTO, the organization that sets the rules for international free trade, says Heritage Asian Trade and Economics Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert OQuinn</a>. These include lifting all import bans and slashing tariffs on foreign goods, which would boost trade between Taiwan and other countries, including the United States. 
<p>
	But theres a problem. &quot;The most significant obstacle to Taiwans membership in the 
WTO is not economic, it is political,&quot; OQuinn says. &quot;China insists that Taiwan should not join 
the WTO before China does.&quot; This is true even though Taiwans economy is more advanced than 
Chinas. For China, however, the chief concern is that the world recognize its status as a global 
economic power and its primacy over Taiwan, something it feels is threatened if Taiwan gains 
entry to the WTO first.<p>
	Although the United States cannot unilaterally set the terms for WTO admittance, it 
should &quot;be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwans membership, even 
in the face of Chinas determined opposition,&quot; OQuinn says. In addition, the United States 
should work closely with the European Union and Japan -- the other key players in the trade 
organization -- to build a consensus within the WTO for admitting China only on &quot;commercially 
viable&quot; terms, not for political reasons.<p> 
	Unfortunately, OQuinn says, the Clinton administration seems willing to bow to Chinas 
demands, a position at odds with U.S. economic goals. &quot;As the worlds largest exporter, the 
United States has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO 
applicants,&quot; he says. &quot;Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTOs economic 
criteria should be free to join.&quot;<p>
	This is not to say the administration shouldnt look for ways to let both countries join the 
WTO at the same time, which would &quot;be the best outcome for all parties,&quot; OQuinn says. But 
that may not be possible. China -- with its high tariffs, strict import controls, and anti-
competitive industrial policy -- must do much more to reform its economy than Taiwan before it 
can qualify for entry.<p>  
	OQuinn says there is a way the Clinton administration might get China not only to speed 
up its economic reforms, but to drop its opposition to Taiwan-first WTO entry: Offer China 
permanent &quot;most-favored nation&quot; (MFN) trading status. This is something China values highly, 
so much so that it might be willing to make concessions. OQuinn says the administration should 
ask Congress for the authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, the 1975 
law that requires Chinas MFN status to be renewed every year.<p>
	In the meantime, OQuinn says, the administration should continue to insist that Taiwans 
entry into the WTO not be held hostage to Chinas demands. &quot;Taiwan should join the WTO 
when it is ready,&quot; he says, &quot;not when Beijing says it can.&quot;<p>

NGA Plan a Poor Model<br>
For Upcoming Legislation<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 19, 1995</b>  -- The welfare reform plan developed by the nations governors for use  as a reform model on Capitol Hill completely ignores illegitimacy -- the No. 1 problem experts have identified as perpetuating the welfare culture, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1075.html">Heritage Foundation</a> analyst said today.

<p>
According to<a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm"> Robert Rector</a>, senior analyst for welfare and family issues, &QUOT;Illegitimacy and 
family collapse are the keys that open the door not only to perpetual welfare dependency, but to a host 
of other problems such as crime, poverty, drug abuse and school failure. Yet the National Governors 
Association (NGA) not only has abandoned the goal of reducing illegitimacy, it has devised a plan that 
would  provide even more government-funded support services to an expanding population of single 
mothers.&QUOT;<P>
	Thus, the NGA plan, &QUOT;sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social 
service spending in the future,&QUOT; Rector says. A combined welfare-Medicaid reform package is expected 
to be introduced in Congress this month and taken up by the House and Senate in May. Rector says 
Congress would do well to &QUOT;just say no to the welfare reform plan offered by the NGA and pass instead 
legislation that makes reducing illegitimacy, encouraging marriage, and requiring work top priorities.&QUOT;<P>
	&QUOT;By refusing to acknowledge or even mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are 
implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. 
They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out 
of wedlock and raised in government-supported day care centers,&QUOT; Rector warns. &QUOT;This is not reform; it 
is a national disaster.&QUOT;<P> 
	Rector points out that nearly a third of all children born in America last year were born out of 
wedlock. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. The 
illegitimate birth rate among whites is nearly 25 percent, almost equaling the black rate in the 1960s 
when policy-makers -- notably Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., -- warned of the consequences 
associated with the erosion of marriages in black families. <P>
	Rector says children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those 
born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more 
likely to give birth out of wedlock themselves when compared to girls from intact families not on 
welfare. Often, they repeat the mothers pattern of having a child and applying for welfare, thus 
continuing the generational cycle of dependence. A poor boy from a single-parent home in the inner 
city is twice as likely to engage in crime compared to a similar boy living with both parents.<P>
	Not only does the NGA plan fail to address illegitimacy, it also guts the work requirements 
from the last House-Senate conference bill, according to Rector.<P>  
	&QUOT;There are so many loopholes in the NGA plan that no welfare recipients would be required to 
work,&QUOT; he says.  Just one example: Up to 20 percent of recipients counted as working can be enrolled in 
vocational education, a remedy that has proved ineffective in the past.<P>
	&QUOT;Just as it did in 1988, the NGA is offering cosmetic welfare reform,&QUOT; Rector says. &QUOT;The public 
was told that welfare would be replaced by work. Then, as now, the NGA opposed real work 
requirements. As a consequence, welfare reform resulted in an explosion of day care funding, and 
welfare caseloads grew by some 30 percent. Now, it looks like history is about to repeat itself.&QUOT;<P>

<p>

        WASHINGTON, MARCH 14, 1996</b> --  A Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">analysis</a> of the 17-
percent flat-tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., shows &quot;no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class 
Americans when compared with their current tax burden.&quot;<p>
	In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups, 
according to the report by William Beach, visiting fellow in tax analysis, and Daniel Mitchell, 
McKenna senior fellow in political economy.<p>
	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90t1.gif">table</a> provided by the Heritage analysts, based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, shows 
that under a 17 percent flat tax, households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income 
will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in their tax burden. In fact, &quot;About 24 million families 
who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented 
Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the analysts say, &quot;and nearly everyone else below $30,000 in taxable 
income will see their taxes fall.&quot;<p>
	For example, households whose taxable income ranges between $15,000 to $30,000 per 
year would see nearly a 36 percent drop in federal taxes. Those in the $30,000 to $50,000 range 
would pay almost 16 percent less; and those in the $50,000 to $75,000 taxable-income range 
would pay almost 12 percent less.<p>
	Will lower taxes mean higher deficits for the federal government? Not according to the 
Heritage analysts, who say the loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-Shelby 
plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. &quot;Corporate 
income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the Heritage analysts point out. &quot;This 
largely offsets decreases in individual income tax payments during the two years it will take to 
implement this tax reform. Taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from 
corporations will rise by $52 billion.&quot; <p>

<h2>GOVERNORS' MEDICAID-REFORM<br> 
PLAN "A DISASTER," ANALYST SAYS <br></h2></center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


                        WASHINGTON, MARCH 13, 1996</b> -- Hailed as a bold move to roll back big 
government by returning power to the states, the Medicaid-reform plan touted by the nations 
governors actually preserves some of the worst elements of the program and creates a costly new 
state entitlement to federal money, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi89.html">analysis</a>.<P>
	Unless changes are made to the plan, which forms the basis of legislation being crafted by 
the congressional leadership, it &QUOT;will be a disaster rather than a reform,&QUOT; says Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. To prevent this outcome, he says, Congress should limit the 
categories of Americans guaranteed coverage under Medicaid and cancel the open-ended state 
entitlement to federal money.<P>
	According to Liu, the governors plan claims to scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor 
of a system of block grants (or cash payments) to the states, yet preserves a long list of benefits 
that must be provided to a large, entitled population.  In fact, of the 33 million Americans on 
Medicaid in 1993, fully 71 percent would still be guaranteed benefits under the governors plan.<P>
&QUOT;The governors plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and 
costly entitlement feature of Medicaid,&QUOT; Liu says.<P>
	Since the governors decision to guarantee Medicaid coverage to so many people will 
impose heavy burdens on state budgets, Liu says, they also included an &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; 
provision that entitles states to federal money.  If states experience an unanticipated rise in the 
number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government would bear the cost, which 
almost certainly would increase the federal deficit.  &QUOT;The states have figured out a way to write 
blank checks on the federal treasury,&QUOT; Liu says.  This is hard to justify, he says, when the federal 
share of Medicaid costs is projected to reach $100 billion this fiscal year.<P>
	If Medicaid reform is to go beyond merely cosmetic changes, Liu says, Congress must fix 
these problems. First, lawmakers should sharply limit who is entitled to what under Medicaid, 
focusing benefits on the truly needy such as the homeless and mentally ill.  Second, Congress 
should turn the state entitlement to &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; into an annual appropriation with a 
fixed amount of money. This would give states needed protection from sudden increases in the 
Medicaid population, but not an open pipeline to the federal treasury.<P>
	&QUOT;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then 
Medicaid ... will require more, not less, fiscal discipline,&QUOT; Liu says.  Without changes, he says, 
the governors Medicaid reform plan &QUOT;should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of 
the open-ended entitlement status of todays program.&QUOT;  <P>

<h2>"TEAM B" ADVISES CONGRESS: WITHDRAW FROM ABM, BUILD MISSILE DEFENSES<br>
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

Administration &QUOT;More Interested In Defending<BR> 
ABM Treaty Than Defending America&QUOT;<p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 12, 1996</b> -- The United States should withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and adopt a plan for defending America from ballistic missile attack by building effective sea-based and space-based defenses, the Heritage Foundations "Team B" missile defense study team <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1074.html">said today</a>.<p>

	Top priority, the study panel said, should be given to expanding the Navys Aegis air-
defense system with a missile-defense component able to protect wide areas of the United States 
and other countries from incoming ballistic missiles by the year 1999. Ultimately, America 
should aim for cooperation among allied nations in building the kind of international anti-
ballistic missile system called for by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher this 
weekend, the panel said.<P>
	Leading Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to introduce missile-defense 
legislation on Thursday of this week, and both houses of Congress will hold hearings shortly 
thereafter, extending into April.<P> 
	The Heritage Foundation panel, led by former Strategic Defense Initiative Organization 
Director Amb. Henry Cooper, says in its report that Congress needs to face up to the fact that the 
Clinton administration has no intention of defending Americans against the threat of ballistic 
missile attack. In short, the administration considers the 1972 ABM Treaty more important than 
missile defenses -- a conclusion with which the panel sharply disagrees.<P>

ABM Treaty or ABM/TMD Treaty?<p>
	The Team B consensus is that no long-term, effective defense of the American people 
against ballistic missiles can be built within the constraints of the ABM Treaty. &QUOT; The ABM 
Treaty is stifling the development of todays most capable and effective defense systems and 
perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases and allies 
overseas,&QUOT; Team B says. &QUOT;Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations 
delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;The time has come for the United States to exercise its right under Article XV of the 
ABM Treaty to give six months notice to Russia, withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and build the 
needed defenses,&quot; the blue-ribbon panel says in the 1996 edition of &quot;Defending America: Ending 
Americas Vulnerability To Ballistic Missiles.&quot; <p>
	Yet, the Clinton administration not only exhibits &quot;a slavish adherence&quot; to a treaty signed 
with the now defunct Soviet Union, it even appears committed to expanding the treatys reach so 
it prevents the building of theater missile defenses (TMD). The administration reportedly has 
accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater missile 
defenses. It has even &quot;dumbed down&quot; the capabilities of theater defense systems rather than 
make them as capable as available technology will permit<p>. 
	In short, &quot;if the administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be 
built. The administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending 
Americans,&qupt; Team B concludes.<p>
Administration Obfuscation<p>	
	&quot;The administrations actions over the past year, characterized chiefly by the presidents 
veto of the fiscal 1996 defense authorization bill, demonstrate that the American people cannot 
depend on the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the 
common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow,&quot; the Team B report says.<p>
	&quot;While publicly claiming it is vigorously pursuing missile defenses, the administration
has quietly canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive 
missile defense programs, while supporting more expensive, less effective ones and extending 
their development time, thereby increasing costs,&quot; Team B says. &quot;It has become regrettably clear 
that the Clinton administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy.&quot;    <p>
The Threat<p>
	The United States still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic 
missiles (ICBMs). &quot;Contrary to what most Americans believe,&quot; the Team B analysts say, &quot;if  an 
ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single 
thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their 
targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possible millions, of Americans.&quot;<p>
	The Clinton administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American 
homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat 
develops. &quot;Yet, American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles,&quot; Team 
B points out. &quot;A Chinese official recently threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the United States 
interfered with Chinas feud with Taiwan. North Koreas nuclear and missile programs recently 
prompted the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea to request that theater missile defense 
development be expedited. Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last 
year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire 
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away. Rogue states could 
threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- sooner if they chose to 
accelerate their development plans,&quot; Team B analysts say. <p>
What Congress Should Do?<p>
	Team B says &quot;America should indicate clearly to the Russians that the United States 
intends to provide effective wide-area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops 
and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russias agreement.&quot; However, if Russia 
refuses to cooperate, &quot;Congress should use all available powers and prerogatives to move 
America toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months notice, which it has a 
right to do under Article XV,&quot; say the Team B analysts. <p>
	Then, Congress should &quot;press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-
term defenses technically feasible. This means a de-emphasis of ground-based defenses -- since 
they can be overcome by countermeasures, are expensive, and are difficult to deploy. Highest 
priority should be assigned to expanding and converting the Navys Aegis air-defense system to 
missile defense and deploying theater defenses based on this model by the year 1999.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;For an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 Aegis 
cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile-defense capability for the 
United States and for U.S. forces and allies overseas,&quot; the Team B analysts say. &quot;These highly 
mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile 
strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas.&quot;<p>
	In addition, the development of space-based sensors and defenses, both kinetic-energy 
interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated, the Team B analysts say. &quot;With the 
necessary funding support, deployment of such systems can begin shortly after the year 2000. 
For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 
billion and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.&quot;<p>
	&quot;The Clinton administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind 
a smokescreen of positive-sounding but meaningless policy declarations,&quot; the Team B analysts 
conclude. &quot;It is clear that the Clinton administration will remain derelict in the duties required of 
the office of the commander-in-chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress 
must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the 
improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executives dereliction of 
duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology will permit.&quot;<p>

<h2>New White House Budget Contains Big Spending, Tax Increases, Study Shows</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




                WASHINGTON, MARCH 11, 1996</b> -- Although the 1996 budget battle between 
Congress and the White House is still unresolved, President Clinton has already released a new 
1997 budget that boosts spending by $361 billion and tax revenues by $526 billion over the next 
seven years, according to a<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1071.html"> new report</a> by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	For every household in America, the new White House budget means $1,927 in higher 
taxes and $3,155 in higher spending over seven years, compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget 
Act that the president vetoed last fall, says Heritage budget specialist <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.<P>
	Moreover, the White House budget would add $119 billion more in deficits through 2002 
than Congress Balanced Budget Act, the equivalent of increasing the debt burden on the average 
household by $1,227, Hodge says.<P>
	&quot;Just weeks after telling the nation in this years State of the Union address that the era 
of big government is over, President Clinton [has] indicated that the obituary notice was 
premature,&quot; says Hodge, Heritages Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs.<p>
	He says while the White House plan would, on paper, balance the budget by 2002, it can 
only do so &quot;by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.&quot;  For 
example, the budget claims to save $596 billion over the next seven years, but fully 60 percent of 
that deficit reduction is scheduled to happen after President Clinton leaves office.<p>
	Whats more, the family tax cuts in the presidents plan come in the early years, then 
screech to a halt in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget. The result: Families depending on a 
planned $500-per-child tax credit would get hit in 2002 with a $17 billion tax increase.  Whats 
more, the president offsets the $98 billion he proposes in tax cuts with $59 billion in tax 
increases.  The resulting net tax cut of $39 billion represents just 3 cents of every $1,000 
taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years, Hodge says.<p>
	While tax relief under the White House budget is negligible, spending on entitlement 
programs such as Medicaid and Medicare steams ahead, increasing by $365 billion, or 50 
percent, over seven years.  All told, spending on mandatory programs under the White House 
budget would rise from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar 
in 2002. <p> 
	And although the president proposes to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 
billion over seven years, thats not nearly enough to save the program from impending 
bankruptcy, Hodge says.  In fact, the news that in 1995 the Medicare Hospital Insurance program 
paid out $36 million more in benefits than it took in from payroll taxes shows the program could 
face a financial crisis even sooner than the projected bankruptcy in 2002.<p>
	The situation with Medicaid is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, 
Hodge says, states probably will need to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion over seven 
years to pay for it. The White House response is to slow Medicaid spending increases by $59 
billion over the same period, which does little good when maintaining the programs entitlement 
status could cost states more than $47 billion.<p>
	There is, Hodge says, one area of the budget where the White House does propose real 
changes: spending for social programs is greatly expanded.  While short on details -- which are 
scheduled to be supplied in the administrations full budget due later this month -- the current 
White House budget &quot;outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as 
education, high technology, crime fighting and the environment,&quot; Hodge says. Compared to the 
Balanced Budget Act, the president proposes spending an extra $111 billion over seven years on 
discretionary programs.<p>
	Yet oddly, Hodge says, the White House also claims to &quot;save&quot; $297 billion in 
discretionary programs over seven years.  Of course, these savings are calculated by using the 
Congressional Budget Offices &quot;baseline,&quot; which assumes automatic spending increases every 
year.  Under this accounting system, simply freezing discretionary spending at 1995 levels would 
&quot;save&quot; $258 billion over seven years.  The extra $39 billion the president proposes to save? 
Hodge says 95 percent of these cuts come in 2001 and 2002, when President Clinton can no 
longer be in office.<p> 
	&quot;The administrations repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys ... casts doubt on 
its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress,&quot; Hodge says. &quot;The Clinton 
budget is not the end of big government,  it is the embodiment of it.&quot;<p>

<title>White House Retreat on Free Trade Bodes Ill for U.S. - Heritage PR</title>

BODES ILL FOR U.S., ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 6, 1996</b> -- Bowing to protectionist pressure, the White House is backing away from its commitment to free trade in the Western Hemisphere, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1070.html">policy shift</a> that could derail the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), damage relations with Mexico and discredit U.S. leadership on free trade, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	Opponents of free trade have accused NAFTA of causing everything from the Mexican economic crisis and declining U.S. wages to increased illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The fact that the White House has allowed such charges to go unanswered shows that "free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton administration," says Heritage Latin America Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a>.
<p>
	On the contrary, over the past year the White House has taken steps to downgrade NAFTA, first by reneging on a promise to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996 and then by violating key provisions of the trade pact such as allowing Mexican trucks to operate in U.S. border states. 
<p>	If the Clinton administration continues to shirk its obligations under NAFTA, Sweeney says, it will establish "a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada and other countries could follow in the future." Even now, Sweeney says, political leaders throughout Latin America are questioning the administration's commitment to free trade. The possible result: "If Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide," he says.
<p>	To prevent NAFTA from falling into disrepute, Sweeney says the White House must take a number of steps to strengthen the treaty. Not only should the administration respect NAFTA's provisions, it should complete the trade pact's unfinished business with Mexico, which includes forgiving Mexico's public debt and working out solutions to immigration, labor and law-enforcement problems. In addition, the White House should reverse course and speed up the process of admitting Chile to NAFTA.
<p>	Sweeney says the administration has nothing to fear from critics of NAFTA, whose charges have proven untrue. For example, the claim that NAFTA caused the Mexican economic crisis couldn't be more wrong. "The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency," he says.  "If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious."
<p>	NAFTA also remains crucial to U.S. competitiveness in the new global economy, Sweeney says. U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate two-and-a-half times faster than exports to the rest of the world. Even in 1995, when the Mexican economic crisis was at its worst, the United States still exported more to Mexico than it did before NAFTA. All told, the United States exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America every year -- more than half of that to Mexico -- supporting nearly 2 million U.S. jobs.
<p>	By backing away from free trade, and NAFTA, the White House is also threatening U.S. relations with Mexico, Sweeney says. NAFTA is crucial if Mexico is to emerge from its economic crisis. If that crisis continues, he says, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow, with conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking displacing cooperation on trade and investment. Moreover, the United States has a strong interest in seeing Mexico become a stable, capitalist democracy. But "without NAFTA, [Mexican President Ernesto] Zedillo's chance of advancing political reforms would be very poor," Sweeney says.
<p>	If American relations with Mexico deteriorate through half-hearted U.S. support for NAFTA, the Clinton administration faces the risk of forfeiting America's leadership role as the champion of free trade in the Western Hemisphere, Sweeney says. In fact, the dream of creating a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone by the year 2005, ostensibly shared by the White House, could collapse.  
<p>	"The Clinton administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere," Sweeney says. "The task for American policy-makers now is to correct the current drift in policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible."

<html><title>Architect of Free-Market Farm Bill Assesses Congress' Reform Bill -- Heritage PR</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
               214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>                     Washington, D.C. 20002<br>                              (202) 546-4400<br><hr><h2> ARCHITECT OF FREE-MARKET FARM PLAN
ASSESSES CONGRESS' REFORM BILL</h2>
</center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1996</b> -- A principal architect of the agriculture-reform plan moving through Congress praised the effort to replace America's Depression-era farm policy with a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">market-based system</a>, but said Congress' failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs would cost consumers billions of dollars per year in higher prices. 
<P>
	The House of Representatives last week passed the so-called Freedom to Farm Act, which incorporates many of the major structural changes proposed in the April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, "Freeing America's Farmers." The Senate passed similar legislation earlier this year.
<p>
	The legislation would end government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops through quotas and planting restrictions. Most dramatically, farm subsidies would be replaced by steadily decreasing "market-transition" payments that would end after seven years.  The House and Senate are expected to iron out differences between the two bills in conference this week.
<p>	"For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the government," said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project.  "Consumers win with more competitive prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market."
<p>	Published in advance of last year's congressional debate over reauthorizing America's farm programs, the Heritage farm policy blueprint also called for the elimination of the Farmer-Owned Reserve -- a surplus cache of crops the government uses to hold down commodity prices artificially by flooding the market.  This recommendation also was adopted by both the House and Senate.
<P>	While the farm bills mark a dramatic, and welcome, departure from command-and-control agriculture policy, Frydenlund says Congress should have adopted other elements of the Heritage plan as well. The failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs is one glaring omission, he says, as is leaving intact a component of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/em448.html">dairy program</a> that will force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk. "A truly free-market approach to farm policy would have ended these programs," he says.
<P>	Frydenlund also says Congress should have done more to reform the Conservation Reserve Program, an environmental program that too often pays farmers to take productive land out of use. "The least Congress should do is let farmers remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program," he says.
<p>	Another problem: Under the new system, market-transition payments will actually cost the government more in the first few years than traditional subsidies, an outcome Frydenlund warned against in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib216.html">Heritage paper</a> in September of last year. At the time, he urged Congress to set a "trigger price" for commodities that, if exceeded, would cancel or reduce transition payments for a given year. This can be easily fixed, however, in the House-Senate conference, he says.
<P>	Despite these shortcomings, Frydenlund says the farm bills go further than any piece of legislation in U.S. history to create a free market for agriculture. "Outdated farm programs are robbing American consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars a year and denying farmers the right to take advantage of explosive growth in the worldwide demand for food," he says.  "Congress has taken a huge step toward correcting these injustices."

<title>U.S. Shouldn't Rule Out Use of Force if China Attacks Taiwan - Heritage PR</title>

<b>Clinton's Weak Signals <br>
Risk Crisis In Taiwan Strait</b>

<center><h2>U.S. SHOULDN'T RULE OUT USE OF FORCE
IF CHINA ATTACKS TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<b> For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>	WASHINGTON, MARCH 4, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan in response to the island nation's first-ever presidential elections March 23 -- nor should it rule out the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc139.html">use of force</a> in case of such an attack, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>, senior analyst with Heritage's Asian Studies Center, the administration should order the U.S. Navy to hold exercises near Taiwan during the period before and after the March 23 presidential election to deter Chinese military action. Also, it should sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, including advanced air-to-air missiles, conventional submarines, and missile-defense systems.
<p>	"By failing to assure China's leaders of U.S. intentions in the event of a Chinese military attack against Taiwan, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could do incalculable damage to Taiwan, U.S.-China relations and U.S. leadership in Asia," Fisher warns.
<p>	President Clinton therefore must take "strong but measured steps" to convey to Beijing America's clear interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Fisher says that in addition to warning China that U.S. force is an option, and deploying the U.S. Navy to deter Chinese military action, the Clinton administration should:
<p><ul>
<li>	 In compliance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, inform Chinese leaders that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States";<p>
<li> Tell China it may face economic sanctions, ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo;<p>
<li> Maintain the balance of power in Asia by deploying missile defenses to protect U.S. forces stationed there, thus offsetting China's demonstrated willingness to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan; and<p>
<li> Recognize Taiwan's democratic reforms and urge China and the Republic of China (ROC) to resolve their differences peacefully.
</ul><p>
	Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway as the presidential election approaches. "China fears the emergence of Taiwan as a model for political reform on the mainland, and continues to reserve the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare independence," Fisher points out.
<p>	Fisher says President Clinton's failure to respond adequately to recent Chinese saber-rattling in the South China Sea and against Taiwan "fosters an impression of American weakness, and lends encouragement to Chinese hard-liners." He adds that "Several statements by Clinton administration officials to the effect that the United States will not defend Taiwan if it is attacked are potentially even more destabilizing."
<p>	"At stake is not only peace and security in the region, but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. Also, with a population of 21 million and trade with the United States totaling $47 billion per year, the ROC is the seventh-largest U.S. trading partner, right behind China itself," Fisher says.
<p>	"The United States cannot afford to let the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorate further without grave consequences for U.S. stature in Asia," he says. "The Clinton administration must make clear the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan."

GOVERNMENT "SLUSH FUNDS," ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MARCH 1, 1996</b> -- Congress should identify and eliminate a host of government programs that special-interest groups use to fund lobbying and political activities many taxpayers would not willingly support, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<P>	 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/griffin.html">Charles Griffin</a>, deputy director of Heritage's Government  Reform Project, Congress' 1995 effort to stop what he calls "taxpayer-funded political slush funds" fell far short of what is needed to solve the problem. "Not only are many political lobbying groups still able to draw billions of taxpayer dollars into their coffers," Griffin says, "such groups also tend to be the strongest supporters of bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation -- which guarantee them continued funding."
<p>	Griffin identifies the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1069.html">top 10 government programs</a> that give taxpayer-funded grants to hundreds of special interests, which then use the money for political purposes. For example, by law, participants in AmeriCorps, President's Clinton's national service program, are barred from engaging in partisan political activities. Yet, in one reported instance, a nonprofit group, the Cole Coalition in Cole, Colo., used AmeriCorps volunteers to draft campaign fliers attacking a local politician and distribute them door-to-door. "We realized there was something politically partisan," said 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor. "Although the Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding," Griffin says, "the AmeriCorps program lives on -- as does the potential for abuse." 
<p>	Another major violator, the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) -- funded at $400 million per year -- was originally established to provide legal services to the poor in civil and non-criminal matters. Griffin says the LSC uses its budget to funnel federal taxpayer dollars to 323 private groups around the country that use the money to fight legal battles having clear political objectives. "Through litigation, advocacy and lobbying, the LSC has helped to generate hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending and the addition of hundreds of millions of people to the welfare rolls," Griffin says. 
<p>	For example, LSC grantees have sued governments at all levels to stop welfare reform and have worked to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. "It's not that people don't have a right to engage in such activities," Griffin adds. "It's that they shouldn't be allowed to do so with the taxpayers' money."
<p>	 A third example from the top 10 list, the Department of Health and Human Services' Discretionary Aging Projects, is funded at $26 million per year. While the stated purpose of the project is to provide trained personnel and programs that improve the quality of life for the elderly, Griffin says the money in the program is often used to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest groups. 
<p>	"The National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 percent of its budget from federal funds and is one of many such groups that promote government interventionism," Griffin says.  Other grantees benefiting from the program in 1994 included groups that actively opposed Medicare reform, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
<p>	Griffin says funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests to subsidize their political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse of the public's money and the public trust. 
<p>	"If the situation were reversed and millions of taxpayer dollars were going to conservative activist groups, the response would be sheer outrage. Political orientation aside, Congress needs to put an end to this egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars," Griffin says.

TOUGHER RESPONSE TO CUBA</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 29, 1996</b> -- Calling economic sanctions against Cuba an insufficient response to the island nation's downing of two U.S. civilian aircraft, a Heritage Foundation analyst today outlined a series of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi88.html">tough measures</a> the United States should take to further isolate Fidel Castro.
<p>
	"In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force," Heritage Latin American Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a> says in a new paper.
<p>	Specifically, Sweeney says the U.S. government should:
<p><ul>
	<li> Warn Cuba that the United States will enforce international law in the region.  Any attacks by Cuba against civilian aircraft or boats outside the 12-mile territorial limit established by international law should be met with a "prompt, immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces," he says.  U.S. warplanes should patrol the waters between Florida and Cuba to enable a rapid response.
<p>
<li> Ban the flow of all cash from the United States to Cuba, which props up the Castro regime with more than $500 million a year in hard currency.
	<p><li> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by U.S. citizens -- including journalists, academics and business people -- and ban travel to the United States by all Cubans until the Castro regime extends the same travel privileges to opposition leaders as it does to communist officials.
<P><li> Impose strict controls over the activities and movements of Cuban officials in the United States.  The Castro regime bans democratic and human rights groups from meeting freely in Cuba; the U.S. government should deny Cuban officials those same freedoms in the United States, expelling all violators.
<p><li>Warn Castro that the United States will view any attempt to spark a new refugee crisis as a hostile act against the national security of the United States.
<p><li> Use Radio Marti to inform Cubans that U.S. actions are aimed at Castro, not at them, to counter Castro's anti-American propaganda.
<p><li> Publicly oppose the activation in Cuba of a nuclear reactor based on an unsafe East German design, which would present a security threat to the Southeast United States.

<h2>AS BIG GOVERNMENT WITHERS, LEADING
THINKERS PONDER A REPLACEMENT</h2>
</center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 12, 1996</b> --  If the era of big government is over, as 
President Clinton proclaims, what will replace it? 
<p>
	Lots of things. In the <a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/toc.html">latest issue</a> of 
<I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>, 20 prominent thinkers and 
reformers describe private institutions they would like to see emerge over the next two decades 
to rebuild American community and culture in the wake of the welfare state. 
<p>	<a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/symp.html"> Their suggestions</a> run the gamut 
from police-training programs for kids (proposed by New York City Police Commissioner 
William Bratton) to structured group homes for welfare mothers and their children (Myron 
Magnet, editor of the <I>City Journal</I>, New York City, and author of  "<I>The Dream and the 
Nightmare.</I>" Uniting the proposals is a common belief that reliance on Washington to solve 
society's problems has done more harm than good. American culture and society must be 
renewed the old-fashioned way: by private citizens working hands-on in their own communities.
<P>Not surprisingly, many of the suggestions concern improving America's government-run 
education system. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman wants all parents to have the 
right -- and the financial ability -- to send their children to any school, public or private. William 
Galston, a former adviser to President Clinton who now teaches at the University of Maryland's 
School of Public Affairs, proposes a new funding system for charter schools, which are quasi-
public but free of much of the stifling bureaucracy that plagues the broader government school 
system.  
<p>	Two participants -- New York Lt. Gov. Elizabeth McCaughey Ross and Jim Pinkerton, 
former Bush administration official and author of "<I>What Comes Next: The End of Big 
Government - And the New Paradigm Ahead</I>" -- even proposed the same idea: a rating 
system for schools (Pinkerton envisions a <I>Consumer Reports</I> for education) that would 
empower parents with information on how money is being spent and how well students are 
performing on standardized tests.
<p>	But education reform is not enough. Bratton, for example, believes many kids need to 
learn respect for the law and law-enforcement officers. His dream of a structured police career 
path for kids -- summer "youth academies" and a police-oriented version of the Boy Scouts 
called Law Enforcement Explorers -- would give young people positive interactions with the 
police, deepen their respect for the law, and even guide some into police careers themselves.
<p>	Myron Magnet envisions group homes for welfare mothers and children where the focus 
is not on the job prospects of young women but on providing structured, caring environments for 
kids. He believes that by the time today's underclass children reach school, it's too late to give 
them the foundation in cognitive and moral skills they will need to succeed. That's what the 
group homes could do.
<p>	Higher education is ripe for some new ideas as well. Harvey Mansfield, professor of 
government at Harvard, longs for a "great books junior college" to give students the education 
they didn't receive in high school and won't receive in politically correct four-year institutions.  
And Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and author of "<I>Hollywood vs. 
America</I>," would go even further, creating an "elite" private university that would go back to 
teaching a classic liberals arts education and compete with the politically correct Ivy League 
schools. 
<p>	Other innovative ideas rounding out the list include: private science funding (perhaps by 
corporations) to reduce the scientific community's dependence on the federal government; 
private, non-profit job-training programs; effective homeless programs run by representatives 
from the religious and business communities; and even new television shows devoted to 
exposing government violations of citizens' rights and celebrating individuals who have 
overcome personal hardships.

<h2> FLAT TAX REDUCES TAX BILLS
IN EVERY STATE, STUDY SHOWS</h2></center>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 9, 1996</b> -- Taxpayers in every state would send less of their income to Washington under a 17 percent flat tax, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a>.
<p>	The average annual savings would range from a high of $1,856 per taxpaying household in Connecticut to a low of $318 in California, the study showed. And in 33 states, the average household would see its income-tax bill drop by more than $1,000 per year.
<p>	Nationwide, the 17 percent flat tax would reduce the average household's yearly federal tax bill by more than $1,100, a savings of 25 percent compared to the current system, said Heritage economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>. Taxpayers in many states would save even more. In addition to Connecticut, the top 10 include: New Jersey ($1,521), Illinois ($1,511), North Dakota ($1,506), Virginia ($1,463), Indiana ($1,415), Rhode Island ($1,406), Washington ($1,385), Michigan ($1,372) and Florida ($1,335).
<p>
	With the campaign of GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes built around the flat tax, tax reform has already emerged as a key 1996 election issue. House Majority Leader Richard Armey,  R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., both have introduced bills that would replace the current tax code with a flat rate that taxes income only once. 
<p>	Contrary to claims that a flat tax might increase the tax burden on middle-income taxpayers, Beach and Mitchell found that "a properly designed flat tax would provide much-needed tax relief" for the average filer.  
<P>	Their analysis of the impact on taxpayers under the Armey-Shelby plan found that households in every state would see their tax bills drop not only in dollar terms, but in percentage terms as well. South Dakota taxpayers would benefit the most, with an average tax decrease of 38 percent. Other states would see big drops too, including North Dakota (33 percent), Indiana (31 percent) and Florida (30 percent).  
<p>	All told, a 17 percent tax rate on individual income would decrease federal tax payments by $125 billion, with the largest savings going to individual taxpayers in New York ($10 billion), Texas ($8 billion), Illinois ($8 billion) and Florida ($8 billion).
<p>	The Heritage analysts also examined the impact on taxpayers of a flat tax rate of 20 percent. At the higher rate, they found, the average tax bill would rise in two states. In California the average increase would be $417; in Montana: $9. In the rest of the states, even a 20 percent rate would result in a tax decrease for the average taxpayer; nationwide it would yield the average household a tax cut of more than $500. 
<p>	In addition, a flat tax of 20 percent -- which is the initial rate under the Armey-Shelby plan -- would be revenue neutral, adding nothing to the deficit. According to Beach and Mitchell, reductions in individual income taxes would be offset by increases in corporate taxes (in the belief that business income should be taxed only once, at the corporate rather than individual level).
<p>	To ensure accuracy, the Heritage analysis was based on actual tax records contained in the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the latest year for which data are available. The Public Use File is a statistically accurate sample (155,000 returns) of all individual income-tax returns for a given year.
<p>	"The evidence shows that those who say a flat tax would make Americans pay more haven't looked at the numbers," Beach says.

<h2> NATO MUST REFOCUS OR RISK
DEMISE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>

	WASHINGTON, FEB. 6, 1996</b> -- The NATO security alliance that protected Europe from Soviet attack during the Cold War is veering so far from its original mission that it may not survive, according to a defense expert at The Heritage Foundation.
<P>
	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1067.html">paper</a> released today, Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen says NATO's recent foray into "peacekeeping" in Bosnia -- a country not even part of the alliance -- is just the latest example of how NATO is losing sight of its original reason for existence: protecting Europe against domination by a hostile power or bloc of powers.
<P>
	"Who is to say whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe 10 or 20 years from now?" he asks. "It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest in the basic security of Europe."
<p>	To ensure NATO remains a bulwark against threats to Europe's security, Hillen recommends that Congress consider a "NATO Revitalization Act" that would do four things: explain to the American people why U.S. involvement in NATO is vital; define the U.S. role in the alliance as limited to deterring aggression; clarify when U.S. military force should be used; and call for the quick expansion of NATO to include the newly democratized Central European countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.	
<p>	The fact that Europe faces no immediate threat is no argument for expanding the alliance's role, Hillen says. After all, NATO is an insurance policy, designed to protect against catastrophe no matter how remote the threat might be. "It is far better to have 100,000 troops deployed peaceably now than have to commit a million troops later to fight a war," he says.
<p>	Besides, Hillen says, the United States is already involved in an organization designed to handle lower-level security tasks such as peacekeeping, and it is not NATO. The 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors sanctions and leads observer missions in the former Yugoslavia and other countries. And while it is true that the OSCE has proven incompetent at dealing with problems like Bosnia, NATO nevertheless should not be thrust into missions for which it is poorly suited.
<p>	But once NATO decides to act, Hillen says, the U.S. role must be clearly defined to promote a sensible "division of labor" with America's allies. He says U.S. forces should be deployed only when they can make a unique contribution -- one no other country is able to make -- and when they can produce a decisive victory. In this way, America can ensure that its military role is limited to serving NATO's core mission of "collective defense" (protecting Europe against hostile domination) and not "collective security" (peacekeeping, nation-building and other humanitarian missions).
<p>	To drift from this core mission in search of new roles for NATO would not only create rifts between NATO members over whose troops should serve in peacekeeping operations, but would diminish support for NATO from an American public that questions why the United States should be the world's policeman.
<p>	By contrast, expanding NATO to include new democracies in Central Europe would strengthen the alliance and "bring a level of stability and security ... that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history." The only obstacle to such expansion, he says, is the Clinton administration, which fears Russia opposition. 
<p>	"NATO needs to get back to basics," Hillen concludes. "In the absence of a clear and present danger to Europe it has lost its focus. ... A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe."

<h2>U.S. PEACEKEEPING MISSION TO GOLAN
HEIGHTS ILL-CONSIDERED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<P>


	WASHINGTON, JAN. 30, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration's plan to launch a "peacekeeping" mission to the Golan Heights once Israel and Syria reach a peace agreement would place both U.S. troops and Israel itself at considerable risk, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1066.html">new paper</a> by foreign-policy experts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>. 
<p>	A U.S. presence in the strategic buffer zone between Israel and Syria would be a double-edged sword, say Heritage Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies Thomas Moore and Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a>.  Not only would U.S. troops face possible attacks from terrorist groups in the area, but Israel's ability to defend itself could be diminished. 
<p>	The analysts urge Congress to hold hearings immediately on the costs and benefits of embroiling the United States in a Golan peacekeeping mission.  They say U.S. negotiators trying to broker an agreement between the two countries should not promise foreign aid to Syria as an enticement to reach peace.  And even if a deal is reached, under no circumstances should American troops participate in a peacekeeping force.  "The United States cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit," they say.  
<p>	Moore and Phillips argue U.S. troops in the Golan Heights would be prime targets for terrorist groups based in nearby Lebanon, such as Hezbollah.  Just as Syria's strongman Hafez al-Assad supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against U.S. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon (the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut), so too might he pursue a similar strategy in the Golan to drive U.S. troops from the area. And even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, the analysts say, nothing would prevent Iran, Iraq or Libya from sponsoring terrorism against U.S. troops on their own.
<p>	In addition, a U.S. presence on the Golan would effectively halt Israel's ability to respond with force to attacks from Lebanon-based terrorists or from Syria itself.  "Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria," the analysts say.  Since American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked, "the real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the United States will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts," they say.
<P>	Moore and Phillips also say a U.S. presence in a Golan peacekeeping mission is not needed.  "Other countries are willing and able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces," they note. Peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland and Poland have been stationed on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement, making U.S. participation in any future peacekeeping force unnecessary, they say.
<p>	But if U.S. troops are dispatched to the Golan, their situation would be far more precarious than that of the U.S. peacekeepers stationed along the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula.  In the Sinai, where U.S. troops have been since 1982, a broad desert separates two sides that are allies of the United States and at peace with each other.  In the Golan, U.S. troops would be confined to a much smaller area flanked by the large armored forces of two avowed enemies.
<p>	Any peacekeeping mission to the Golan also would divert critically needed  U.S. forces, the analysts say. A credible long-term Golan peacekeeping mission would likely require three brigades, or roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength.  That is a "prohibitively high" burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission, one that could place the United States in jeopardy if conflict arises in Korea, the Persian Gulf or any other place where vital U.S. national interests are at stake, Moore and Phillips say.
<p>	Citing these and other concerns, the analysts say congressional hearings are imperative. They note in both Haiti and Bosnia, swift action by the Clinton administration to send troops stifled congressional debate.  This time, Congress must address the peacekeeping issue before the negotiators reach a deal, or risk receiving another "diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>" from the White House.
<p>	"The United States should not jeopardize important national security interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic," the analysts conclude.

<h2>RELIGIOUS PRACTICE CAN BE EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST AMERICA'S SOCIAL ILLS, STUDY FINDS</h2></center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 25, 1996</b> -- As Washington policy-makers struggle to find solutions to America's major social problems, they should consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving them, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html">paper</a> released today, <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, an expert in family and social issues at Heritage, says nearly every major study on the impact of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social problems. Religion, the majority of studies conclude, "is the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation," according to Fagan, the William H. G. FitzGerald fellow.
<p>	Fagan presents a summary of the social science literature, which reveals that religious practice strengthens the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal moral judgment; and inoculates individuals against such social problems such as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime and divorce. 
<p>	"Renowned historians and philosophers have always known that the character of a social order is, in large part, determined by its religious roots. Social science cannot prove that religion, or religion in any varying expressions, is true. But the professional literature of the modern social sciences has shown religious practice to have positive social consequences," Fagan says.
<p>	He cites "Middletown," a classic sociological research project that studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and then again in the 1980s. The study  found that "church-going members were more likely to be married, remain married, and to be highly satisfied with their marriages." 
<p>	Another important study of strong families, conducted in the 1970s and 1980s by a pair of University of Nebraska professors, found that "84 percent of these families identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families." The same study also indicated that "parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidance."
<p>	Ongoing studies by Arizona State University West demonstrate that  religious belief and practice  encourage optimism among socially at-risk children. Among the findings: Students who attend church weekly or more frequently are more optimistic about their futures; have better relationships with their parents; are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals; and are more likely to see themselves in control of their own futures, not as victims of oppression. 
<p>	Armed with such evidence about the positive benefits of religious practice, Fagan says it is time for policy-makers to stop ignoring the role religion plays in the welfare of the nation. "Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births and their resultant effects, such as huge social and economic costs, this research should be of major interest to policy-makers," he says.
<p>	Fagan offers several steps that both Congress and the president can take to encourage religious practice. Among them:
<p><ul>
	<li> Congress should initiate a national discussion on the need to restore the  role of religion in American life. "The Senate used to be the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It should take up that role again and discuss the relationship between the practice of religion and the health of the nation,"  Fagan says. 
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that census data on the extent of religious practice can also help inform the public debate on America's most difficult social problems.  Such a resolution would also remove the excuse that it is not permissible to fund research on the  religious aspect of American life. 
	<p>
<li> The president should appoint judges who are at least more sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Fagan says it weakens society and makes no sense to crowd religion out of every activity in which government is involved. "All future candidates for federal court appointments  should be asked to clarify their views regarding both the role of religion in politics and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue," Fagan says.  
</ul><p>	While the study discusses  the role the nation's policy-makers should play in encouraging religious practice, it also spells out actions that America's religious leaders and individual citizens can take.
<p>	Fagan says religious leaders must draw attention to the foundational role religion plays in supporting families and schools. He says religious individuals need to emphasize the need for religious training in adolescents who are most at risk of losing their anchoring in the community and turning to crime, drugs or other social ills.
<P>	"Social research demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It offers a powerful answer to many of the nation's most serious social problems. The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation," Fagan says.

<title>Russian Control of Oil-Rich Regions key to Chechen Conflict, Analyst Says -- Heritage PR</title>

<hr><h2>RUSSIAN CONTROL OF OIL-RICH REGIONS KEY
TO CHECHEN CONFLICT, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 23, 1996</b> -- Overlooked in the current conflict between Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya is the larger Russian goal of dominating the oil-rich states of the former Soviet Union, according to a new <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1065.html">Heritage Foundation paper</a>.  
<p>	The Chechen conflict is just one of many efforts by Russia to create a sphere of influence in the strategic regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a>.  If Russia succeeds, he says, it could establish a monopoly over the region's vast oil supply (estimated at 25 million barrels, larger than reserves in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined) and drive up energy prices across the globe.
<p>	The U.S. response, Cohen says, must be to ensure that all interested parties, including American oil companies, have free and fair access to the region's oil fields.  The United States can do this in a number of ways, principally by working to preserve the economic independence of former Soviet republics in the region -- such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Georgia -- and by opposing any efforts of the Russian military to control the oil fields and pipelines through force.
<p>	In a worst-case scenario, Cohen says, Moscow would grab full control of the oil fields, increasing Western energy dependence on a country that has not always been friendly toward the West.  Disturbingly, Russia is already setting up military bases in the region -- four in Georgia and three in Armenia -- to cement its control over all future oil pipelines built in the region.  Such a strategy has support in Russia not only from ultra-nationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky, but from the powerful military and "security services."  Cohen describes the intent of these factions bluntly: "The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control."  If Russia dominates this vital region, Cohen even sees the possibility of a Russian alliance with anti-Western regimes Iran, Iraq and Lybia to drive up the price of oil.  
<p>	Cohen says the challenge for the United States is to convince Russia that its national interest lies not in a confrontation with the West over oil, but in cooperation with the West to develop the economic potential of the oil-rich region.  The United States should reassure Moscow that Russian companies, which currently lack the resources to tap the oil, will nevertheless be included in any future ventures.  In this way, Cohen says, Russia will get the economic help it needs from the West, and the West will get the assurance of stability in the region.

<h2>POLICY REVIEW MAGAZINE WILL GREET 1996 
WITH NEW MISSION, FORMAT, FREQUENCY</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<P>

	<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 1, 1995</b> -- As Americans debate how to rebuild their communities in the wake of a receding federal government, one of conservatism's most influential voices is charting a new course for reinvigorating private-sector and local government alternatives to the centralized welfare state. The Heritage Foundation's flagship magazine, <i>Policy Review</i>, is redefining its mission to articulate and advance the conservative vision of "civil society."
<p>
	Beginning with the <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html">January/February 1996</a> issue, the magazine, renamed <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, will feature new departments with a new design and appear six rather than four times a year. <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, the magazine's editor for 12 years, plans to make <i>Policy Review</i> a clearinghouse of information and analysis about civic leaders who are solving America's most pressing social and cultural problems without relying on the federal government. "The central challenge for conservatives over the next 20 years is to restore the tradition of American citizenship by rebuilding the institutions of civil society -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, schools, civic associations, businesses, and local governments," Meyerson explains. 
<p>	The new format builds on one of the current magazine strengths: its long-time focus on stories that show the failures of big-government liberalism and illustrate the successes of private and local government initiative. "By becoming Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship, we are simply clarifying our mission, improving our product by building on what we already do best," says Heritage Foundation President and Policy Review Publisher <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner Jr</a>.
<p>	The magazine seeks to make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of society. "Unlike liberals who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives see religious fervor as one of the most important engines of civil society," says Deputy Editor Joe Loconte. The new Policy Review will feature a regular department, "One Nation Under God," which will show the involvement of religious institutions in repairing America's social fabric.
<p>	Unlike liberals, conservatives also see business as an essential part of the citizenship movement. Frequently the most creative answers to social problems come from businesses that can profit by solving them. Another new department, called "The Blessings of Liberty," will show how economic freedom and marketplace competition contribute to civil society.
<p>	The new Policy Review will feature several other regular departments as well. "Home Front" will identify character-building organizations that promote responsible parenthood. "We the People" will tell about remarkable acts of generosity by ordinary people and community institutions. "Abuses and Usurpations" will show how federal and state executive agencies, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions. <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/tsquare.html">"Town Square"</a> will provide news about the best books, papers, and seminars that promote citizenship. And "Profiles in Citizenship" will look at Americans who have built great civic institutions in the past.
<p>	The January/February issue features a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html">symposium with presidential candidates</a> Robert Dole, Phil Gramm, Richard Lugar, Lamar Alexander, and Robert Dornan. Candidates respond to the question, "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" The answers are as varied as the candidates themselves: Dole on "The Establishment Clause"; Gramm on "The Takings Clause"; Lugar on "Enumerated Powers"; Alexander on "Presidential Powers"; and Dornan on "Government by Judiciary."
<p>	Also in this issue, former Attorney General and Heritage Ronald Reagan Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III</a> and special counsel Rhett DeHart show "How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff" in their article about the bipartisan assault on local law enforcement. Meese and DeHart urge national lawmakers to resist the temptation to make ordinary crime a federal issue. They argue that nationalizing crime contradicts constitutional principles, incurs unnecessary expense, and does not allow for states to experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention of crime.
<p>	"Can Congress Revive Civil Society?" Yes, says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. Along with William J. Bennett, Coats has introduced the "Project for American Renewal" -- comprised of 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. In this article, Coats details his plan and Gertrude Himmelfarb, Don Eberly, and David Boaz offer their comments.
<p>	In "Clinton's AmeriCorps Values," John Walters of The New Citizenship Project says President Clinton's citizenship is defined  "with subsidies, centralized government, and self-esteem." While Clinton incorporates a message of personal responsibility and citizenship into his rhetoric, his vision is "deeply flawed," says Walters. The president has sought justify his efforts to expand the welfare state and to reinvigorate civic life by trying to re-legitimize government. Walters points to Clinton's AmeriCorps program, which uses federal resources to promote voluntarism and "contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Walters asserts that Americans should revitalize citizenship by getting the federal government out of the areas of public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. 
<p>	Articles by Florida's Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, and others appear in the January/February issue as well.
<p>	 Policy Review began publishing in 1977 and now has a paid circulation of 30,000. It is indexed by the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, the Public Affairs Information Service, and the Social Sciences Index. The full text of the magazine is available on NEXIS and on the "Internet" at <a href="/heritage/">http://www.heritage.org</a>.
<p>	A one-year <a href="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html">subscription</a> to the magazine costs $19.95; two-years costs $34.95. To subscribe, call 1-800-304-0056.

<P>
<I>&quot;The 'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an important
benchmark for evaluating Hong Kong's future success after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 1995</B> -- Hong Kong's economy has been
rated as the freest in the world by the prestigious American research
institute The Heritage Foundation. 
<P>
 The economies of just 10 other countries -- three from the Asia-Pacific
region -- also were rated as &quot;free&quot; in the Washington-based
think tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 Singapore was judged to have the second-freest economy in the
world. New Zealand tied for fourth place. And the Republic of
China on Taiwan tied for eighth. Japan, whose economy was in the
&quot;mostly free&quot; category, was 15th (tied with Austria).

<P>
 The economies of Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines also earned ratings
of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 The People's Republic of China (PRC), on the other hand, ranked
near the bottom, tied with Mauritania and the Congo for 121st
place. India's score was only slightly better, and earned India
a tie (with Armenia, Sierra Leone and Yemen) for 117th place.
 
<P>
<I><B>Government House Presentation</B></I>
<P>
 Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner Jr. will present
a copy of the book-length report, &quot;The Index of Economic
Freedom,&quot; to The Honorable Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor,
at ceremonies at Government House today.
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph.D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; would provide &quot;an important benchmark for evaluating
Hong Kong's future success after it reverts to Chinese control
in 1997.&quot;
<P>
 Hong Kong was characterized in the report as &quot;one of the
most accessible markets in the world,&quot; with &quot;very few&quot;
barriers to imports and &quot;virtually no barriers to foreign
investors.&quot; In addition, the authors wrote, &quot;The government
does not interfere in the marketplace; taxes are low and predictable;
government spending increases are closely linked to economic growth&quot;;
and regulations are &quot;applied uniformly and consistently.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
in the think tank's annual survey of economic freedom, while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told,
the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or
&quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of
&quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; In all, 142
countries were rated in the new 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; up from
101 in the previous edition.
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States stood in seventh place in the new 1996 edition
of the &quot;Index.&quot; Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among
former communist countries, the Czech Republic did the best by
far, and was ranked 12th in the world.
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of
Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, vice president of The Heritage Foundation, said,
&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces
economic prosperity. No amount of American aid can alter this
basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>

<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul>

 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- Just 10 other countries around
the world provide businesses and individuals with a degree of
economic freedom similar to America's, The Heritage Foundation
reported today in its annual survey of global economic freedom.
The economies of 142 countries were rated, up from 101 countries
a year ago.
<P>
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the

to five in each category, one being the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Japan ranked 15th, tied with Austria. The
Czech Republic, in 12th place, remained far ahead of any other
former communist country. Estonia, which came the closest to the
Czech Republic, ranked 26th. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.

<P>
 First published last year to provide Congress with guidance on
foreign-aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international investment
community. Washington Post economics columnist James T. Glassman
 (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful clues for
investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide which
countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I> </I>magazine
(June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some surprising
insights on why some markets may be chained to the ground while
others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of Commerce Publisher
Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson to be drawn from
this survey is clear. The more economic freedom people are allowed,
the less interference there is from government, the faster the
nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors --
including political stability, market size, external debt, infrastructure,
currency convertibility, and domestic savings -- to those countries
whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot; had improved most
during the past year. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Foreign-Aid Reform</B></I>
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when Congress debated foreign-aid reform. The House and Senate
both included language in the &quot;foreign operations&quot; appropriations
bill requiring the Agency for International Development (AID)
to report to Congress annually on the relative economic freedom
and prosperity of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid.  
<P>

<P>
<I>&quot;Economic assistance  is wasted when it is given to
countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary for countries with free economies.&quot;-- </i>Co-authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy
<P>
<P>
Johnson and Sheehy, co-authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic assistance is wasted when
it is given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of economic aid alike, such
'assistance' is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided an estimated $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. The recipients of the largest
amounts of aid, in addition to Israel and Egypt -- which, for
geopolitical reasons, receive a combined $5 billion per year --
are almost all countries with unfree economies.
<P>
 &quot;Most economic development aid is wasted; it is money down
the drain. It doesn't help the recipient country and it certainly
doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; Holmes said.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, Cuba and Ukraine
are not poor because the people in the West don't share their
riches. They are poor because their governments pursue destructive
economic policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation
of wealth. 
<P>
 &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom
of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free
market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president said, &quot;will
true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything
short of this is not only economically unwise, but is cynically
cruel.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment projects and continued reliance
on price controls.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.

<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolished its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
&quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries
in sub-Saharan Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland,
Benin and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.

&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity. No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</I>

<P><P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of 13 countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today.
<P>
 Just 11 countries in the world received ratings of &quot;free,&quot;
none in Central America, South America, or the Caribbean.
<P>
 The Bahamas, Panama, Chile, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago
received the best ratings in the region on the influential think
tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; Haiti and
Cuba received the worst ratings, the only two economies in the
region characterized as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told, the
economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Among the former communist countries, the
Czech Republic received the best score and was ranked 12th overall
(tied with the Bahamas and Canada). 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Regional Data</B></I>
<P>
 The Bahamas' economy earned a score of 2.0, putting it just over
the line separating the countries with totally free (a score of
1.0 to 1.99) and &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99).
Panama earned a score of 2.4. Chile and El Salvador scored 2.45.
And Trinidad and Tobago scored 2.5. 
<P>
 Other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean whose economies
were rated as &quot;mostly free&quot; were Argentina (2.65), Paraguay
(2.65), Belize (2.7), Jamaica (2.7), Bolivia (2.75), Costa Rica
(2.8), Uruguay (2.8), and Guatemala (2.85). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were Barbados (3.0), Colombia (3.0), Peru (3.0),
Ecuador (3.15), Honduras (3.15), Mexico (3.35), Guyana (3.4),
Brazil (3.45), Dominican Republic (3.45), Venezuela (3.5), and
Nicaragua (3.6). Haiti (4.2) and Cuba (5.0) were the only two
countries in the region whose economies were characterized as
&quot;repressed.&quot;

 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of just five
countries in sub-Saharan Africa received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today. Of the 11 countries in the
world with ratings of &quot;free,&quot; none was in sub-Saharan
Africa.
<P>
 Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin and Zambia received the best
ratings in the region on the influential think tank's annual &quot;Index
of Economic Freedom.&quot; Mozambique, Sudan, Zaire, Angola and
Somalia received the worst ratings, with their economies characterized
as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of its economic-liberalization policies, Botswana
was identified as one of a handful of countries around the world
that stood out as a possible future investment prospect.
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. 
<P>
 All told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 In sub-Saharan Africa, five countries received &quot;mostly free&quot;
ratings, 23 received ratings of &quot;mostly unfree,&quot; and
five received ratings of &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United Kingdom, which tied
for eighth place. 
<P>
 Among the former communist countries, the Czech Republic received
the best score and was ranked 12th overall, tied with the Bahamas
and Canada. Like the Bahamas, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
also received ratings of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
 Sub-Saharan Africa 
<P>
 The economy of Botswana earned a score of 2.8, the best in the
region and 47th overall (tied with Costa Rica). Other African
countries with &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99)
included Uganda (2.83), Swaziland (2.9), Benin (2.95) and Zambia
(2.95). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were South Africa (3.0), Kenya (3.05), Gabon (3.06),
Mali (3.1), Ghana (3.2), Ivory Coast (3.25), Nigeria (3.25), Guinea
(3.35), Madagascar (3.35), Malawai (3.4), Senegal (3.4), Cape
Verde (3.44), Tanzania (3.45), Cameroon (3.6), Ethiopia (3.6),
Lesotho (3.65), Burkina Faso (3.7), Niger (3.7), Zimbabwe (3.7),
Sierra Leone (3.75), Congo (3.8), Mauritania (3.8) and Suriname
(3.9).  
<P>
 Points to Hong Kong 
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a Nov. 27 speech in Hong Kong, Holmes pointed out that 30
years ago Hong Kong and Gabon were equally poor countries, with
per-capita incomes of $2,279 per year and $2,770 respectively.
Hong Kong then pursued a bold economic liberalization program,
while Gabon's government pursued the opposite course. Today, the
average per capita income in Hong Kong is $10,223. The average
in Gabon: just $3,502.
<P>
 &quot;Hong Kong's economic miracle should provide a lesson to
the less-developed world,&quot; Holmes said. &quot;You don't need
gold and silver deposits, or oil wells, or rich, arable land,
or American foreign aid to create wealth and prosperity. All you
need is a climate of economic freedom.&quot;
<P>
 Resource for Investors 
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;
as an investment tool, the authors applied nine additional investment
factors to those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored the best. While some of the 24 countries are
rated as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 Foreign-Aid Reform 
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when the United States Congress considered changes in the
U.S. foreign-aid program. One major change will require the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to report annually
to Congress on the relative economic freedom of countries receiving
U.S. foreign aid.
 <i>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic 
freedom produces economic prosperity. No 
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</i> 
-- Kim Holmes, Vice President, The Heritage Foundation 
<P>
Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic aid is wasted when it is
given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of foreign aid alike, economic
aid is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided some $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. &quot;Most economic development
assistance is wasted. It doesn't help the recipient country and
it certainly doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; said Holmes, a
highly regarded foreign-policy specialist.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti and Cuba  are not
poor because the people in the West don't share their riches.
They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic
policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation of wealth,&quot;
Holmes said. &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic
freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of
the free market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president
said, &quot;will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the
world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise,
but is cynically cruel.&quot;
<P>
 Highlights 
<P>
 The authors of the Heritage Foundation  report made a number
of important observations. They found, for example:
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide, however; its
overall average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that
Panama's improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized
its money supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve
system and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency.
As a result, the Panamanian government can no longer print money
for political purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in the Latin America/Caribbean region and one of the
three most repressed in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against foreign investment and its continued reliance on
price controls.

<h2>CLINTON'S FAMILY TAX CUT DENIES TAX RELIEF TO 23 MILLION CHILDREN</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>


<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 11, 1995 --</b> President Clinton's budget plan,
released last week, would give much less tax relief to low-income
working families than the congressional plan he recently vetoed,
according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation. This finding
directly contradicts the president's claim that his budget would
be better for these families.         
<P>
Overall, Clinton's tax credit denies any tax relief to 10.4 million
working families that would receive relief under the plan he vetoed,
according to Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal
budgetary affairs. In other families, some children wouldn't qualify
for tax relief under Clinton's plan, but would qualify under Congress'
plan. 
<P>
Taken together, the Clinton plan would deny $15 billion in tax
relief to 23 million children who would qualify for it under Congress'
$500-per-child tax-credit plan.
<P>
Particularly hard hit are lower-income working families. In order
to claim the  Clinton tax cut, low-income families must first
reduce their tax bills by the amount of their Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) subsidy. Thus, 5.4 million families earning less
than $30,000 would be denied tax relief under Clinton's plan;
they would get $2.3 billion in tax relief under the plan he vetoed.
A typical single parent with one child, earning below $30,000,
would receive almost $200 less in tax relief each year under the
Clinton plan.
<P>
In addition, Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit does not apply
to children more than 12 years of age. Since roughly 25 percent
of all children are more than age 12, millions of families will
be denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising a child becomes
most expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to families
of at least 2.8 million children earning less than $30,000 per
year. In fact, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton
plan is $442, the average tax cut under Congress' plan is $856
per family.
<P>
&quot;This is bait-and-switch tax policy,&quot; says Hodge. &quot;Clinton
says he is helping lower-wage families with children more than
Congress is, but that is absolutely untrue. The fine print in
his plan denies tax relief to millions of families who are being
told by the White House that they qualify.&quot;

<h2>CAPITAL
GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BENEFIT LOWER, MIDDLE CLASS MOST, HERITAGE
STUDY FINDS</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 6, 1995 --</b> Contrary to what opponents
say, the benefits of cutting the capital gains tax rate -- as
proposed in Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995 --would go mostly
to lower- and middle-income taxpayers, a Heritage Foundation analyst
said today. 
<P>&quot;The typical household declaring a capital gain
had income from sources other than capital gains of $58,729 and
realized a gain of about $973,&quot; according to William Beach,
a visiting fellow in tax analysis at Heritage. &quot;This is hardly
what anyone would consider 'rich,'&quot; he says. In fact, Beach
says, more than 50 percent of the benefits from cutting the capital
gains tax would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income
taxpayers. 
<P>Beach's findings are based on an analysis of 1991 tax
returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal
Revenue Service. 
<P>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would permit
individual taxpayers to exclude 50 percent of their capital gains
from taxation. That exclusion effectively cuts the tax rate on
capital gains in half. 
<P>For corporations, the act decreases the
capital gains rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent.
  Furthermore, Beach says when critics claim that capital gains
go mainly to the wealthy, they often mislead the public by including
the gain as part of a person's income. For example, a retiree
living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000
capital gain one year from selling his house is classified &quot;as
a person with a $42,000 income who received a capital gain.&quot;
&quot;This sleight of hand allows opponents to 'fudge' the number
of rich in their favor,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>According to Beach,
a balanced budget and a lower capital gains tax rate will stimulate
economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code and increase
federal revenue by encouraging individuals to take gains they
might not otherwise take because of a high tax rate. He points
to the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model -- one  of the
nation's most independent and respected models of the U.S. economy
-- which found that balancing the budget with tax cuts would produce
immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing
in long-term economic activity. 
<P>Other leading private economic
firms (Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, DRI/McGraw-Hill
and others) predicted that balancing the budget and cutting taxes
would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more
spendable household income. &quot;This, more than any other factor,
helps poor and middle-class Americans,&quot; Beach points out.
<P>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model
developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer and Associates to
analyze the impact of a balanced budget plan. The model found
that over a seven-year period (1996-2002), most of the economic
benefits of the plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
The model predicted a loss of more than $80.2 billion in potential
gross domestic product, higher unemployment rates and slower household
income growth if the capital gains tax rate remains the same.
<P> Finally, Beach says that experience over the past 25 years shows
that rate decreases lead to more declarations of capital gains
and therefore more revenue from capital gains taxes. &quot;Owners
of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on
to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the
rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up,&quot; he
says. &quot;In other words, you can lower the rate and increase
revenue,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>Economists estimate that Americans
are holding trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains.
&quot;Lowering the capital gains rate could produce substantial
economic benefits and create  revenue windfalls for federal and
state governments as well as average Americans,&quot; Beach says.

<h2>SINGAPORE ONE OF JUST 11 COUNTRIES WITH FREE ECONOMIES, SAYS 1996 &quot;INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM&quot;</h2>
<i>Ranks Second Overall, Ahead of U.S., Britain, Japan</i>
</center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<P>




 <B>SINGAPORE, DEC. 4, 1995</B> -- Singapore has the second-freest
economy in the world, the prestigious American research institute,
The Heritage Foundation, reported today in its annual survey of
global economic freedom.
<P>
 Singapore &quot;has made remarkable [economic] progress by maintaining
an open trade and investment environment; a corruption-free, pro-business
regulatory system; political stability; an efficient, strike-free
labor force and tax incentives for foreign investors,&quot; the
report said. Singapore's &quot;average tariff rate is nearly nonexistent,&quot;
it maintains &quot;no import quotas and non-tariff barriers to
foreign trade&quot; and investment laws &quot;are clear and fair
and pose few problems for businesses.&quot; 
<P>
 Just 10 other countries around the world provide businesses and
individuals with a degree of economic freedom similar to Singapore's,
the Washington-based think tank said in its 1996 &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 The report was released Nov. 27 in Hong Kong. It was presented
to leaders of Singapore's business community at a luncheon today
at Traders Hotel. 
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. The economies
of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind Switzerland, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. 
<P>
 Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among former communist countries,
the Czech Republic scored the best: in 12th place (tied with the
Bahamas and Canada).
<P>
 In addition to Japan, other Asian and Pacific Basin countries
whose economies received ratings of &quot;mostly free&quot; were
 Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia and the Philippines.
<P>
 In all, 142 countries were rated in the new 1996 edition, compared
to 101 countries in the previous edition. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Resource for Investors</B></I>
<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And New York Journal
of Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries are rated
as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds of
destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the &quot;free&quot;
to &quot;mostly free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased
banking regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul><P>
 Heritage Foundation Vice President Kim Holmes said that &quot;The
'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an especially important benchmark
for evaluating the future success of Hong Kong after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997. Any backsliding will obviously be
noted.&quot;
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With better banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; six were in Africa.</ul><p>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1995</b> -- The U.S. delegation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting this weekend in Japan should work to revive the group's commitment to free trade in the region, which is being seriously undermined by the protectionist policies of Japan and China, according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	Leaders from Asia and the Americas will meet under the auspices of APEC, an organization of Asia and Pacific Rim countries that have pledged to create free trade in the Asia and Pacific Rim by 2020.  President Clinton is expected to attend the meeting if  the budget battle with Congress does not keep him in Washington.<P>
	According to Heritage Foundation Policy Analyst Robert O'Quinn, author of the study, 	 Japan's proposal to allow APEC nations to exempt "sensitive economic sectors" like agriculture from free trade is an ominous sign for the future of APEC. "The proposal has become a flash point, dividing APEC into two warring camps. On one side are Japan and China, who want exemptions; on the other side are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United States, who oppose exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization," O'Quinn says.<P>   
	At the meeting, the U.S. delegation should:<P>

<ul><li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama that selective exemptions to trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national interests. "Once one member is permitted to exempt a sensitive sector of their economy, other members will follow suit with their own protectionist demands," O'Quinn warns.
	<P><LI> Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia and New Zealand to block Japan's protectionist proposal. O'Quinn says the United States has some leverage here because most other APEC members disagree with Japan's protectionist approach. "The key will be to forge a consensus," says O'Quinn.   
	<P><li>Stress that blocking or delaying comprehensive trade liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. "Backsliding on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization," O'Quinn warns.</ul>
	<P>The importance of APEC to the U.S. economy is illustrated in a related paper by Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Dori. For example, Dori says, "in 1994, U.S. exports to East Asia and the Pacific Rim totaled more than $150 billion. More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans." He says that in 1994, more than three million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.<P>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 13, 1995</b> -- Families would gain $32 billion in real disposable income over seven years, wages would increase faster and first-time home buyers would spend less on new mortgages if the congressional plan to cut taxes and balance the federal budget is approved, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/beach.html">Heritage Foundation computer model study</a>.
	<P>"Over the next seven years, Congress's budget plan would lead to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth," Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says in the study, which is based on one of the same econometric models of the U.S. economy used by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve Board and other government bodies. Beach testified about the study today before a House Republican Policy Committee hearing on how the congressional budget reconciliation bill will affect the economy.
	<P>"Critics of balancing the budget by 2002 and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession," Beach says. "But this study shows that not only does no recession result at any time during the seven-year period, but the economy grows faster with these proposed budget changes than it would without them."
	<P> Beach says when lower federal taxes and a balanced federal budget are fed through the econometric model, developed by Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates, the result is higher household spending, lower interest rates, increased productivity, greater capital investment, and less inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).<P>
	Housing starts and investment in new business machinery would increase by 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, the study says. The computer segment of business durable equipment purchases would increase 2.9 percent, compared to current policy.
	<P>The study projects a slightly higher unemployment rate under the balanced-budget plan, due chiefly to a loss of public-sector jobs and lowered government demand for goods and services. The study notes, however, that its assumptions do not include action by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy and thus create additional private-sector employment growth to absorb former public-sector workers.
<P>	Beach says the study's results may surprise both supporters and opponents of the congressional reconciliation package. "Supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately, but the study indicates that the primary effect of balancing the budget is a steady, long-term improvement in the economy, not a short-term boost. Congress also would need to enact major reforms of the tax code to spur the very large level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict."
	<P>Opponents of the reconciliation bill "should take comfort in the likelihood that the plan will not undermine economic growth, and will lower interest rates and inflation," Beach says.<P>

<P>
<br>
Jack Kemp currently is on leave
of absence as co-director of Empower America, a public policy
and advocacy organization he co-founded in 1993 with William Bennett,
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. Empower America is
dedicated to three founding principles: expanding freedom and
democratic capitalism; promoting policies to expand economic growth
and entrepreneurship for our nation; and advancing social policies
which empower people, not government bureaucracies.<BR>
<P>
Prior to founding Empower America,
Mr. Kemp served for four years as Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, and proved to be one of our nation's most innovative
leaders in that role. He was the first and strongest advocate
of Enterprise Zones to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation
in urban America and of expanding homeownership among the poor
through resident management and ownership of public housing.<BR>
<P>
 In March, 1995, Senator Bob Dole
and Speaker Newt Gingrich put Jack Kemp at the center of the tax
and economic debate for the `96 campaign by naming him chairman
of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to
study how major restructuring of our tax code can help unleash
the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, grow the economy without
inflation and create opportunity for people to escape poverty.
<BR>
<P>
 Before his appointment to the Cabinet,
Mr. Kemp represented the Buffalo area and Western New York for
18 years in the United States House of Representatives from 1971
to 1989.  He served for seven years in the Republican Leadership
as Chairman of the House Republican Leadership Conference.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
 Jack Kemp came to Congress after
13 years as a professional football quarterback.  He was captain
of the San Diego Chargers from 1960 to 1962 and also of the Buffalo
Bills, the team he helped lead to the American Football League
championship in 1964 and 1965 when he was named the league's most
valuable player. He also co-founded the AFL Players Association
and was five times elected president.<BR>
<P>
 Mr. Kemp, born and raised in Los
Angeles, is married to the former Joanne Main of Fillmore, California.
 Both Jack and Joanne are graduates of Occidental College. They
have four children, Jeffrey, Jennifer, Judith and James, eleven
grandchildren, and reside in Bethesda, Maryland.<BR>

WASHINGTON, DC -- With a warning that trashy daytime talk-shows on television are debasing our aulture and harming America's children, <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joe Lieberman today launched a campaign to rid the airwaves of <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">sordid programs</a>.  Bennett, co-director of Empower America, and Lieberman, Democrat from Connecticut, say they will work together and with other concerned citizens to put pressure on those who produce and own daytime television talk shows to get rid of the licentious material that characterizes many of such programs today. To illustrate their point about the condition of daytime television talk shows, Bennett and Lieberman aired a series of clips culled only from shows that aired Monday and Tuesday of this week.
<P>Bennett and Lieberman are not calling for legislation or any govemment censorship of daytime television talk shows. They are calling on the producers and owners of the programs to recognize their responsibility to Amencan society and children by setting higher standards for the programs' content. They are also calling on parents to exercise their respons bllity to simply turn the programs off. Bennett and Lieberman said that hundreds of thousands of young children, and up to a million or more teenagers watch daytime television talk shows on a daily basis.
<P><a href="pr1026a.html">Bennett</a> and <a href="pr1026b.html">Lieberman</a> said the number of trashy talk shows has increased in recent
months, while the behavior exhibited on the shows has sharply declined. They argue that
exposing children, teenagers and even adults to hours of such programming on a daily basis has, over time, a deteriorating effect on the civility of American society, and becomes one

<h2>U.S.-Led Missile Defense System Urged for Asia</h2>
<h4>U.S. Critical To Shielding
Asian Allies From China</h4></center><P>


<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>


	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 24, 1995</b> --  America can best protect itself and its Asian allies against growing nuclear threats from China and North Korea by deploying as soon as possible both a national missile defense system for the continental United States, and theater missile defenses to protect U.S. naval and ground forces throughout the Pacific region, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	Congress is currently considering alternative deployment schedules for missile defense systems as part of the 1996 military spending measure. A national missile defense system would intercept enemy missiles aimed at targets within the continental United States, while a theater missile defense system would knock down enemy missiles targeted against American militiary forces operating overseas or against U.S. allies.
<P>	Japan, South Korea and Australia should also be encouraged to buy and field their own American-made theater missile defense systems, while U.S. officials also should pressure China to limit its offensive nuclear missiles in exchange for sharing U.S. missile defense data, says the study's author, Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>.
<p>	"A national missile defense system is needed not only to defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail," says Fisher. "The administration can enhance security in Asia by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile attack and extends that umbrella to protect America's allies and friends throughout the region."
<p>	Failure to take these actions risks allowing The People's Republic of China or North Korea to use their own growing offensive missile capabilities to checkmate U.S. military strength in the Pacific region, and to intimidate U.S. allies throughout Asia, as occurred earlier this year when China "in a blatant act of intimidation" tested several of its weapons barely 100 miles from The Republic of China on Taiwan, Fisher says.
<p>	"Armed with nuclear warheads, these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases or naval formations in Asia," Fisher points out. "China is believed to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. By the year 2010, according to one estimate, China could have 50 to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States from bases in China," notes Fisher.	China also is developing two new mobile missiles capable of hitting the western United States, and may have hired Russian technicians to aid in producing cruise missiles similar to the U.S. Tomahawk. China has even bought 60 Russian-made missile interceptors similar to the U.S. Patriot.
<p>	At the same time, North Korea is proceeding with work on its Taepo Dong missiles, which, Fisher says, "would give Pyongyang the capability to target U.S. forces in Guam, and possibly the western half of the continental United States, plus Europe, East Asia and Australia."
<p>	Fisher believes a national missile defense system would protect America's heartland against these emerging Chinese and North Korean  threats,  while theater defenses would provide a shield for U.S. forces stationed throughout the Pacific region and the U.S. allies they are defending. Without a credible U.S. response, America's Asian allies will be forced to seek their own deterrents to such intimidation.
<p>	Both houses of Congress have approved 1996 defense authorization bills that devote more than $3.5 billion to both national and theater missile defense systems, including the "Brilliant Eyes" space-based sensor system used to identify and track enemy missiles. That amount is about $1 billion more than requested by the Clinton administration.
<p>	The bills now in House-Senate conference would accelerate deployment of the two major theater systems -- the Navy's "Upper Tier" system and the Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system -- to 1997. By contrast, the Clinton administration has set no official date to begin THAAD deployment, and sought only minimal Upper Tier funding.
<p>	Fisher says U.S. officials should urge U.S. allies in Asia to purchase American theater missile defense systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. "By cooperating with Washington to develop and fund missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries from nuclear missile threats," Fisher says.
<p>	Finally, Fisher recommends that the United States inform China that it must live up to its commitments under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and should join the Missile Technology Control Regime backed by the United States that limits the export of offensive missile technology. "Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsensal, the United States will make available to China early warning data from U.S.theater missile defense systems," Fisher says.
<p>	These actions must be taken by the United States because it is the only nation with "the technical capability and the moral vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation," Fisher says.

<h4>DOL Responsibilities Should

	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 23, 1995</b>  -- To reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations while maintaining employment protections and workplace safety, Congress should abolish the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and shift its legitimate functions to the states, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1058.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> released today.
<p>	"The proliferation of DOL regulations, while failing to make things significantly better for American workers, present a serious barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs," says <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Heritage's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy. "Closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department and shifting virtually all of its functions to the states could save as much as $10.5 billion during the next five years," he says.
<p>	In his comprehensive plan for abolishing the Labor Department, Wilson points out that about 75 percent of the department's current $38.8 billion budget is made up of funding for unemployment insurance and for employment services to the states, with job training constituting another 20 percent. "By turning over responsibility for these programs to the states, Congress could take 95 percent of what the DOL does away from far-away Washington bureaucrats and place responsibility for these tasks in the hands of state governments, which are closer to the real problems," Wilson says. This would enable states "to limit the duration of unemployment benefits, reduce payroll taxes, increase jobs, and try new ways to privatize many of DOL's functions," says Wilson.
<p>	Among the job-training programs for the economically disadvantaged that Wilson says should be consolidated into a single block grant to the states are the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, and Indian and Native American Employment and Training. Wilson says states should be required to focus resources for these programs on job placement and to objectively measure the effectiveness of each.
<p>	All other present DOL-funded job-training programs, he says, could be folded into another block grant, which would include programs for dislocated workers, the School-to-Work and Adult Technology Learning programs, Wilson says. "Even DOL itself has acknowledged that making block grants of these programs would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars," he says.
<p>	Wilson says Congress, as part of the process of dismantling DOL, should repeal outdated labor laws, executive orders and regulations, reform the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. It should repeal the executive order for affirmative action and related regulations governing federal contractors and subcontractors, he says.
<p>	Under Wilson's plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau would be shifted to a newly-created sub-Cabinet agency called the Bureau of National Statistics, as proposed earlier this year by The Heritage Foundation in a proposal for reorganizing the federal government and balancing the federal budget.
<p>	At the same time, DOL's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration should be combined, Wilson says, and the newly formed agency made subject to an independent workplace standards-setting board. The new board would "redefine the role of the federal government in workplace safety from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner with the private sector," Wilson says. 
<p>	"Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed dramatically since the days when most of America's labor laws were written and the Labor Department that enforces them was created," says Wilson. "Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions and compensation packages than current law and regulations allow. This means a fundamental rethinking of DOL and federal labor policy is needed."
<p>	"Congress should move aggressively to abolish DOL and reform federal labor law to insure that excessive regulatory burdens are removed, labor market flexibility is increased for workers and businesses alike, and basic workplace safety protections are made more effective," Wilson says.<p><p>

<h2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION
 SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, OCT. 17, 1995</b> -- The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) should be abolished because it routinely engages in political advocacy and frequently lobbies at taxpayer expense for expanded welfare spending, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1057.html">study</a>  released today.
<p>	Among the causes LSC supports with taxpayer funds are adoption rights for homosexuals, preventing drug dealers' evictions from public housing, racial quotas in higher education and protecting welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, according to the study's authors, Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty, who are, respectively, chairman and president of the Vienna, Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center.
<p>	Reforming LSC is not feasible, say Boehm and Flaherty, because it is virtually unaccountable to taxpayers who fund it and beyond effective oversight by either Congress or the president.
<p>	"For the past 30 years, LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through its litigation, advocacy and lobbying, LSC has caused hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending, and helped add millions of people to the welfare rolls," say Boehm and Flaherty. "LSC cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. It should be abolished," they say of the federal corporation that is supposed to help poor people who can't afford to hire an attorney.
	<p>LSC-supported groups have successfully sought countless federal and state court decisions to nullify "moral" conditions connected to welfare benefits such as identifying fathers of illegitimate children, the authors say. Too often, such cases are pursued by LSC-funded groups at the expense of genuine problems facing poor people such as bankruptcy, child-support, custody and guardianship proceedings, landlord controversies, and employment issues, Boehm and Flaherty say.
<p>	At the root of the problem is LSC's legal structure and the unaccountability that structure fosters. Chartered by Congress in 1974 as a independent, private, non-profit corporation,  LSC receives about $400 million in federal funds annually. The way the corporation distributes its money "makes it immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending," say Boehm and Flaherty. 
<p>	The LSC distributes the money it gets from Congress in the form of grants to 323 private lawyers' groups across the country. At the same time, these groups also receive funds (about $225 million annually) from state and local governments, lawyers groups, and other private sources.
<p>	Even though Congress gives LSC millions of federal dollars every year, LSC employees are not considered federal employees under the corporation's federal charter. As a result, LSC's "status as a private corporation exempts it from provisions of the federal criminal code, including the Anti-Deficiency Act that makes it a felony for government workers to misappropriate public money," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Further removing LSC from even minimal scrutiny is the fact that nobody outside of the corporation knows how it spends public funds, since its attorneys keep no time sheets, and it is impossible to judge how well LSC attorneys represent clients because all case records are kept secret under a claim of attorney-client privilege.
<p>	"Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of LSC lawyers, and there are no provisions for waiving the attorney-client privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Taken together, these factors mean "it makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress or on the LSC's governing board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a political agenda that serves the interests of the welfare state and its allies against those of productive taxpayers," contend Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	"Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds given LSC. For the sake of the American taxpayer and for the sake of America's poor, it is time to abolish LSC," Boehm and Flaherty say.

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 16, 1995</b> -- If Medicare is not reformed,  industry and government will have to pass on additional yearly costs of at least $7.4 billion to investors, consumers and taxpayers and $115.7 billion in direct taxes and reduced wages to workers, according to a Heritage Foundation analysis released today.
<p>	The authors of the study, senior fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a> and domestic policy research analysts Christine Olson and Rea Hederman, have included an industry-by-industry analysis showing how much businesses, employees and consumers will have to pay each year as a result of an additional 3.52 percent Medicare payroll tax the program's trustees say will be necessary to finance the current system without reform. 
<P>	Topping the industry list are retail trade, educational services and public administration, which together will shoulder nearly $15 billion, or 25 percent of the yearly cost of the additional tax before passing it on to employees, customers and investors. "Businesses and employees in the retail trade industry alone will pay more than $13.3 billion in extra payroll taxes each year -- with employees picking up more than $12.5 billion of that tab -- if Medicare is not reformed," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	"The reason the burden is so heavy on employees is that an increase in payroll taxes technically is shared by both the employer and the employee. Experience shows that about 88 percent of the cost of additional employer taxes is passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation," according to the study. 
<p>	"Without significant reform of the system or increases in the current payroll tax to maintain the level of benefits and spending, Medicare will go bankrupt," the analysts say. "For Medicare to remain financially solvent and able to pay for hospital care for today's 'baby boomers' when they retire, Congress needs to either find additional money or slow down its rate of spending."

<title>Flat Tax Earns High Marks -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FLAT TAX EARNS HIGH MARKS 
IN STUDY OF TAX REFORM PLANS</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b><br>
<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 26, 1995</b> -- Of all the tax-reform proposals ready to be considered by Congress, the flat tax proposal sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Selby, R-Ala., received the highest marks in a Heritage Foundation study released today. <p>
	The study, conducted by Heritage economist <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>, McKenna senior fellow in political economy, is aimed at assisting lawmakers, who must decide which of the major tax-reform proposals is best for taxpayers and the U.S. economy. 
<p>	"Tax reform is gaining momentum. The existing income-tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul," Mitchell says. "Of all the plans currently being considered in Congress, the Armey flat tax addresses the most serious problems in the simplest, most straight-forward way."
<p>	The Armey plan would ensure fairness by taxing individuals and businesses with a 17 percent flat rate on all income. The plan, which is based on the model developed by Stanford Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka, would ensure simplicity by allowing taxes to be filed using a postcard-sized return. By contrast, the current income-tax system has more than 400 different forms.
<p>	Mitchell says the flat tax's low rate would encourage economic growth by increasing the value of income-producing assets, such as rental property and investments of all kinds. On the other hand, he says, the flat tax would reduce the incentive to invest in tax shelters, a practice that keeps huge amounts of capital from circulating and producing wealth in the U.S. economy. "With these extra billions in circulation, all Americans will benefit," Mitchell says. 
<p>	The flat tax also would end the practice of using the tax system for social engineering. Mitchell says by removing the progressive component from America's tax structure, the flat tax would stop penalizing economic success. It would encourage savings and investment by taxing income only once, and would significantly reduce the number of preferences and deductions now available under the existing income tax code.
<p>	Another version of the flat tax, sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also received high marks from Mitchell. But the Specter proposal seeks a slightly higher rate (20 percent) and would allow for some limited deductions for charitable contributions, including the full deduction for home mortgages. Mitchell says the Specter flat-tax plan is less attractive because it would still allow for government micromanagement of the economy.
<p>	But either way, Mitchell says the time is ripe for reform of the current tax system. "Its complexity forces even the most sophisticated Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms; one study put annual compliance costs at nearly $200 billion." The current system subjects some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, to as many as four different levels of taxation. "For example, under the current tax system, a single dollar of income can be subject to the corporate income tax, the personal income tax, the capital gains tax, and estate taxes," he says. 
<P>	"Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties and deductions," Mitchell says. Such complexity is inevitable in a system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy. Mitchell says the system will never change as long as politicians are able to collect large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code. 
<p>	"While other reform proposals, such as the value added (VAT) tax and the national sales tax, have some advantages, they contained features that more closely resembled the current system, offering little or no improvement over the status quo," he says.

<title>Federal Health Program Success Lesson for Medicare Reform -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FEDERAL HEALTH PROGRAM SUCCESS IS LESSON
 FOR MEDICARE REFORMERS, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center><hr>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>

	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1995</b> -- Medicare reformers in Congress should heed important lessons on consumer choice and health insurance cost controls demonstrated by the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"The FEHBP has shown a remarkable success in controlling costs. While average premium increases next year will be only four-tenths of one percent, FEHBP enrollees last year experienced an average annual decrease of 3.3 percent," says Heritage Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a> in a study released today. FEHBP contrasts sharply with the current  Medicare system's 10.5 percent per year average increase. Annual private-sector price increases have averaged 6 percent per year during a comparable period, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers FEHBP.<p>
	House Republicans recently proposed a package of Medicare reforms that "take some modest steps" in directions suggested by Heritage health care experts. But the FEHBP experience ought to provide further policy direction for congressional reformers, Moffit says.
<p>	The vivid contrast between Medicare's spiralling costs and FEHBP's successful cost controls is due to the fact that FEHBP -- which covers nine million members of Congress and their staffs, federal employees, retirees and their families -- holds down premium costs by depending primarily upon consumer choice and competition among about 400 coverage providers, says Moffit.
<p>	Significantly, FEHBP's ability to hold costs down is achieved despite covering what is far from an ideal insurance pool, he says. "Older workers and retirees cost significantly more to cover than younger, more active employees. The federal workforce is older than the private-sector workforce: the average federal worker is almost 44 years of age, while the average private-sector worker is about 38 years of age. Moreover, the ratio of retirees to active workers has increased steadily during the past several years, so that nearly 40 percent of all FEHBP subscribers are retirees," according to Moffit.
   <p>	 By comparison to Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach, "FEHBP shows that giving enrollees the right to choose plans in a comprehensive market forces insurers to improve value for money, not simply to cut costs," Moffit says.
<p>	Government workers and retirees would have fared even better in FEHBP in recent years if Congress had changed the program to a defined contribution that is indexed to inflation, rather than retaining the current complex formula, Moffit says. The formula is based on the average premiums for the six largest FEHBP insurance providers, with a statutory ceiling of the government's share of premium costs set at 75 percent.
<p>	Converting FEHBP to a defined contribution consisting of "a clearly defined annual dollar amount" with future increases tied to the Consumer Price Index "would give private insurers a powerful incentive for offering attractive packages of benefits at a price equal to or even less than the amount of the government's contribution. This would reduce the out-of-pocket costs to workers and retirees and increase their savings even more," says Moffit.
<p> 	In a related study released today, Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> says Congress is now considering Medicare reforms that would set up a system somewhat like FEHBP.  But further reforms are needed to complete the task of creating "a Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs, while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care."
<p>	The most important provision of the House Medicare reform plan, for example, is the Medicare Plus option, which allows seniors to choose a private-sector health plan paid with a government contribution based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors, Butler says.
<p>	But other features of the House plan "raise concerns," according to Butler, including a provision "to use the failed approach of price controls" to limit government Medicare spending. The House plan also makes the "serious mistake" of making Medicare Plus plans cap their deductibles and co-payments at the same level required by the traditional Medicare plan.
<p>	Butler also faults the House plan for requiring Medicare Plus plans to match the benefits offered by the traditional Medicare program. Congress should instead follow FEHBP's statuatory language requiring insurers to provide a basic core of benefits, but otherwise leave them free to group benefits, medical procedures, treatments, and costs in packages as they see fit.
<p>	"These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement," says Butler.

<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 22, 1995</b> To end the nation's vulnerability to ballistic-missile attack as quickly as possible, congressional conferees should reject the House version of the defense authorization bill and endorse the Senate bill's "clear, concise and detailed instructions" for deployment of a national missile-defense system in the year 2003, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"Without a specific deployment date and a detailed plan, nothing will be deployed because the Clinton administration -- since it is against erecting missile defenses in the first place -- will use the lack of a timetable to put off deployment indefinitely," according to Heritage Senior Defense Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a>. Because of this factor, Spring says "Congress cannot afford to give the administration much leeway, and the Senate bill doesn't give it."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill includes detailed instructions that are much needed but lacking in the House bill. For example, he says in addition to instructions for National Missile Defenses (NMD), the Senate measure fixes the same starting date for deployment of Theater Missile Defenses (TMD), to protect U.S. allies and forces stationed overseas, and defines the core programs the Pentagon will need to erect both systems.   
<p>	For the NMD system, Spring says, the Senate bill includes instructions for "deploying interceptors at more than one site, establishing both interim and initial deployment dates, and setting forth specific options for upgrading existing radars and streamlining acquisition procedures." For TMD systems, the Senate bill designates as core programs "an upgraded Patriot Missile, the Navy Lower and Upper Tier defense systems and the Army's Theater High-Altitude-Area Defense system." The House version, by contrast, contains no instructions for TMD deployment or requirements.
<p>	"Further, the Senate bill would insure that TMD systems are capable of working together so several systems could be used against the same missile attack," Spring points out. Also, the Senate measure lets TMD systems use data from external sensors, including those based in space, to identify and track targets, and "requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress next year on the options available for augmenting ground-, sea- and space-based defenses." This last requirement, Spring says, "will force the Pentagon to examine the advantages of sea- and space-based over more expensive ground-based defenses."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill takes the proper approach toward the future of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. "By requiring a comprehensive review of the pact to determine its continuing value and validity," the Senate bill creates an opening for eventually doing away with the ABM treaty, since it was signed with the former Soviet Union, and is often used to make a case against missile defenses.
<p>	On all of these issues, Spring says congressional conferees should "move as quickly as possible; otherwise the nation will remain needlessly vulnerable to ballistic-missile attack."

	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 20, 1995</B> -- The combined general and payroll tax hike that will be needed to save Medicare -- if Congress doesn't restructure the system -- will increase the tax burden by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years, according to analysts at The Heritage Foundation. The other alternative would be a steep cutback in services.
<P>	The options before Congress are limited, say Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu and David Winston in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">report</a> released today. Congress must either restructure and reform the program along the lines of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which allows consumer choice and market competition to keep health-care prices down, dramatically increase payroll and general taxes on American families and businesses, or drastically cut back on services for the elderly.
<P>	"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) already projects that during the next five years Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in general taxes," the Heritage analysts say. On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right now, when you look at the  combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."	
<P>	Yet, the Heritage analysts say transforming Medicare into a health-care program that would work like FEHBP, the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers, "would allow Medicare users to pick government-certified private insurance plans and receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. What Heritage proposes is a far more attractive alternative than strangling American workers and businesses with enormous new taxes," the analysts say.
<P>  	They also warn of the possible effects of such taxation. "Any new payroll tax assessed to shore up Medicare ultimately will be felt by America's working families in the form of reduced wages or compensation and in some cases, even the loss of jobs."
<P>	The Heritage analysts point out that while Congress is focusing mainly on fixing Medicare Part A, it must also deal with Part B in order to come up with a permanent solution for Medicare's financial plight. Again, without a major restructuring of the entire Medicare system, CBO projections indicate that the taxes needed to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.
<P>	The Heritage analysts used 1993 earnings data to compute the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/wel-62mp.html">state-by-state impact</a> of a 3.5 percent payroll tax increase -- the estimated figure needed to achieve long-term actuarial balance for the Medicare system -- on workers throughout the country. They found that if such a payroll tax increase had been in effect in 1993, employees and employers would have faced more than $123 billion in new taxes that year. Under this scenario, wage earners in Wyoming would have faced a total of $101.2 million in additional taxes, the low range, while California wage earners would have paid an additional $7.7 billion.
<P>	Even worse, employees would have suffered more than $115 billion in lost earnings. On average, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would have ranged from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. Similar significant losses were projected throughout the country.
<P>	"No one wants to drastically cut back Medicare services or impose yet another biggest-in-history tax hike on the American people," the Heritage analysts warn. "That's why it's so important that Congress take a serious look at the only viable alternative: restructuring of Medicare along the lines of  market competition and consumer choice."

<H2> FREEING FARMERS WOULD PRODUCE
$135 BILLION BOOST, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>
<h3>State-by-State Analysis
Reveals Billion-Dollar Winners</h3>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 19, 1995</b> -- Freeing America's farmers by ending New Deal-era crop subsidies, price supports and land reserves would generate $135 billion in new income distributed throughout all 50 states during the next decade, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	The study  -- based on a computer model of the nation's economy developed by Heritage to measure the impact of ending the federal farm program -- comes as Congress considers reforms of a wide range of agriculture programs.
<p>	"Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use, and generate a $135 billion expansion of the nation's economy," say Heritage Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, co-authors of the Heritage study. "Every state would share in the economic expansion -- even those that are not agriculture producers -- because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products."
<p>	Increased farm production would fuel demand for seed, fertilizer and equipment such as tractors, as well as generate expansion of the food processing, packaging, transportation and shipping industries, the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	Earlier this year, Frydenlund wrote Heritage's comprehensive proposal for agriculture reform, called "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." The Heritage proposal suggests ending the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that keeps more than 36 million acres of farm land idle. This government attempt to control farm prices limits the supply of a wide variety of crops and products, including wheat, corn, cotton, rice, sugar, peanuts and milk.
<p>	The Heritage plan would phase out CRP over a five-year period, thus freeing U.S. farmers to return the now-idled acres to production to meet worldwide food demand that experts say will triple in coming years.
<p>	"If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict their output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account," Frydenlund and Winston say. In the first year alone, more than $2 billion net additional farm income would result, with the annual total reaching $4 billion by the year 2001, and more than $18 billion annually thereafter.
<p>	In Kansas, for example, farmers (primarily wheat producers) would enjoy a $1 billion boost in the first year, while in Iowa, a leading corn producer, the first-year increase would exceed $800 million. For Texas, a major producer of most farm products, the increase would exceed $1 billion, Frydenlund and Winston say.
<p>	Non-farm states like Rhode Island "would reap large benefits" as a result of increased demand for shipping and transportation services, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they would gain through increased agricultural production," observe Frydenlund and Winston. A state-by-state analysis is included with the study.
<p>	 In a related study to be released later this week, Frydenlund says the sugar, peanut and dairy programs are perfect examples of why reform is needed. All three programs are "beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can fix them," says Frydenlund, because each uses complex systems of quotas and allotments to limit who can produce how much for sale at what price, as well as where it can be grown and where it can be sold.
<p>	The sugar program, for example, "is big government and corporate welfare at its worst. Almost half of the estimated $1.4 billion in federal benefits created by the program go to 1 percent of the sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and a Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone," says Frydenlund.
<p>	"Incremental changes in these programs will not be reform. Instead, Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs by either eliminating or gradually phasing out the quotas and allotments that benefit so few at the expense of consumers," the Heritage analysts say.<p>

<h2><center> HOUSE SPENDING BILLS FALL FAR SHORT OF PROMISED  GOVERNMENT OVERHAUL, ANALYSTS SAY</h2> </center>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>





	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 15, 1995</b> -- Instead of  carrying out the voters' mandate for a radical overhaul of the federal government, the new House spending bills "merely downsize the status quo, leaving the door open to return to bloated, wasteful spending in a few short years," according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	The study focuses on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills approved by the House since May when the chamber approved a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years. While savings achieved by those bills total about $24 billion, many more billions could be saved if the House terminated obsolete programs, as suggested by Heritage earlier this year in a detailed study showing how to reduce the number of Cabinet-level departments from the current 14 to five.
<p>	Rather than terminating obsolete programs, however, the House imposed relatively equal across-the-board spending cuts that otherwise leave the programs alive and well, according to the study by Heritage's Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> and budget analyst John Barry.
<p>	"Congress is leaving in place hundreds of obsolete federal programs that ought to be shut down, but that will instead continue to waste taxpayer dollars, just at reduced spending levels," say Hodge and Barry. "This leaves the door open for government to return to the path of increasing deficits and burdensome taxes, as happened when Reagan-era spending cuts were restored by the Bush and Clinton administrations."
<p>	In May, Hodge and Barry point out, Republicans "promised to downsize the government by terminating programs that do not work, eliminating those that have become obsolete or outmoded, consolidating programs that duplicate others, ending corporate welfare, and transferring to state and local governments programs more appropriately carried out by them."
<p>	But instead, appropriations bills adopted since May show the House merely shaved relatively equal amounts from all programs in order to achieve the savings required to balance the budget on schedule, say the Heritage analysts.
<p>	The House agriculture spending bill, for example, "merely trims perennial sources of pork-barrel outlays by 4.3 percent overall," but triples funding for the office of the Agriculture Secretary, boosts by 33 percent the obsolete Rural Electrification Administration's budget, and adds 8 percent to Natural Resources Conservation Service spending.
<p>	Similarly, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriation includes only "modest trims" averaging  4.5 percent, but the Maritime Administration's budget is hiked 23 percent, and programs that ought to be terminated outright like the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration are kept alive.
<p>	The Energy and Water Development appropriation imposes a "mild 5.5 percent cut on the Army Corps of Engineers, another favorite source of pork-barrel projects," say Hodge and Barry. But the measure pours more tax dollars into other needless spending projects -- like $4.2 million for maintenance of the Sam Rayburn Dam and Lake in Texas -- and puts another $3.3 billion in the Energy Supply, Research and Development program that has received more than $70 billion since 1977 with little or nothing to show for it.
<p>	If Congress is truly serious about restructuring government, Hodge and Barry say, it will use the upcoming conferences on the appropriations bills to terminate such outmoded and obsolete programs as: Job Corps ($1.2 billion); Amtrak subsidies ($628 million);  Appalachian Regional Commission ($142 million),  and Legal Services Corporation ($278 million).
<p>	Corporate welfare programs Congress should cut include: Rural Electrification Administration ($122 million); Export-Import Bank ($786.5 million); Public Broadcasting Facilities Grants ($19 million); Manufacturing Extension Partnership Programs ($81 million),  Small Business Administration ($590 million), and Federal Transit Administration ($3.9 billion).
<p>	If Congress fails to terminate such programs, Hodge and Barry say, there will be a replay of events during the Reagan administration when 94 federal programs were recommended for termination. According to a congressional study, only 12 were actually shut down, and some of them were later replaced by larger, more expensive programs.
<p>	The Small Business Administration (SBA), for instance, was slashed starting in 1981 during Reagan's first term from more than $2 billion to $557 million by 1986. But SBA rebounded during the Bush and Clinton administrations to a budget of nearly $1 billion. Merely trimming agency budgets leaves in place a federal bureaucracy that works hand-in-hand with special-interest groups to pressure Congress to restore funding to previous levels, say Hodge and Barry. This is what they believe may happen if the current House budget passes.
<p>	The Heritage budget analysts praise only two of the House-passed appropriations bills:  Education, Labor and Health and Human Resources, which eliminates 170 programs, and the Interior Department, which eliminates six agencies and 49 programs.

<h2><center>U.S.-ASIAN COMMERCE ON THE RISE  <br>
DESPITE TRADE WAR FEARS<br><br></h2></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 8, 1995</b> --  America's exports to Asia totaled $153 billion and sustained 3.1 million American jobs in 1994, according to the 1995 edition of the U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook, compiled by analysts at The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center (ASC). The just-released Handbook shows a 12 percent increase in exports over the previous year, and the number of Asia-related jobs grew by 500,000.<p>
	ASC analysts caution that this positive trend will be reversed unless the Clinton administration adopts a more non-threatening trans-Pacific free-trade policy. "The confrontational approach to Japan is an example of brinkmanship," says James Przystup, ASC director, "which, were it not for last-minute compromise, almost led to a full-scale trade war."<p>
	
Such a trade war would quickly spread from one Pacific rim nation to another, ASC analysts believe. The resulting bitterness and economic tension would inevitably pit America against its allies - - just at a time when U.S.-Asia multilateral cooperation on security issues is most needed. This is because many countries are concerned about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) growing military strength and the assertive way in which it challenged the Philippines' claims over the Spratly Islands. In addition, the PRC's recent long-range missile exercises near the Republic of China on Taiwan have reinforced Asia's anxiety about Chinese intentions. <p>
	The PRC's muscle-flexing is not the only challenge to existing regional security alliances. "The administration's response to North Korea's nuclear-weapons program has caused consternation among our Asian allies," says ASC Senior Policy Analyst and Handbook Editor Richard D. Fisher. "Throughout 1995," says Fisher, "the administration acted as if its managed-trade agenda held precedence over regional security." <p>
	Fisher says the U.S. policy of trade confrontation - - combined with frequent administration flip-flops on diplomatic issues - - has left Asians confused about the firmness of America's commitment to the goal of open markets. This, in turn, jeopardizes U. S. leadership on global trade, crucial to forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization. Leaders of the major Asian economic powers already are preparing for the scheduled November APEC summit at Osaka, Japan. <p>
	Most governments and businesses in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region at last agree that free-trade is the cornerstone of continued economic growth. "There is opportunity presented by this victory over Asia's long-held protectionist policies," says Fisher, "but we might lose that opportunity because of the administration's seeming abandonment of free trade."<p>
	Handbook data demonstrate how Asia's initial round of market-opening reforms are benefiting  American businesses. A country-by-country analysis reveals that sales of "Made In USA" goods and services are growing in the region's increasingly affluent countries: Malaysia's imports reached $7 billion, an increase of 17 percent over the 1993 level. The level of South Korea's imports from the United States was $18 billion, a 22 percent increase. Singapore's $13 billion represented an 11 percent increase. American exports to Thailand reached $4.9 billion, an increase of 30 percent over 1993.<p>
	Handbook statistics show several states are reaping substantial economic benefits from this explosion of commerce. More than 828,000 California jobs are dependent on Asia-bound exports - -  which rose by 20 percent in 1994 and reached $41.4 billion. In Texas, 247,000 jobs were sustained as exports rose 19 percent above 1993 levels, reaching $12.4 billion. Illinois' $6.6 billion worth of exports - - supporting 131,000 statewide jobs - - represents a 23 percent increase.<p>
	Pacific-bound commerce accounts for a significant share of jobs and income in other states. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oregon, and New York all witnessed at least 10 percent growth in the value of their Asian exports. Furthermore, the Handbook shows many smaller states are also gaining from this boom. For example, Maryland's $3 billion worth of exports reaching Asian consumers represented a 40 percent increase over the level in 1993, and supported 28,000 jobs.<p>
	Key social, political, military, and economic statistics on all Asia-Pacific nations are included in the Handbook. This year's edition also contains data on 19 Asia-Pacific countries adapted from the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.<p>
	According to Przystup, "the data show that free-trade is a driving force for the economic growth that leads to democratization and security. America dares not lose historic diplomatic and economic opportunities through lack of a coherent policy towards Asia."<p>

<h2><center>BENEFITS "CAP" DECREASES<br>
OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br>
<h3>Abortions Didn't Increase <br>
Under New Jersey Program<br><br></h3></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 7, 1995 </b>-- New Jersey's "family cap" policy -- which denies increases in cash welfare benefits to single mothers who have additional children while already receiving welfare -- has resulted in a significant decline in out-of-wedlock births with no corresponding increase in abortions.<p>
	According to Heritage Foundation welfare analyst Robert Rector, the evidence from New Jersey indicates that in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, there was an average decrease in out-of-wedlock births of 10 percent. This, even though the average decrease in benefits came to just 4 percent of the monthly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits received by the typical welfare mother. There was no statistically significant corresponding increase in abortions, according to Rector, who obtained his information from New Jersey's Department of Human Services in Trenton.<p>
	"The New Jersey data show why Congress should consider imposing a similar cap on benefits to welfare mothers who have additional children as part of an overall welfare-reform strategy for reducing illegitimacy," says Rector, Heritage's senior analyst for welfare and family issues.<p>
	The family cap went into effect in October of 1992, and gave affected mothers -- those already enrolled in AFDC -- a 10-month grace period, meaning the limit on benefits applied only those who bore children after July 1993.    <p>     
	"In the year before the cap, the average monthly number of births was 1,331; in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, average monthly births among AFDC mothers fell to 1,197. The cap appears to have caused an average decrease of 134 births per month, or 10 percent," Rector concludes.<p>	
	"Critics claim that the family cap has not caused an actual decrease in the number of illegitimate births, but merely a delay in welfare mothers reporting births to the welfare office," Rector says. "But mothers on AFDC in New Jersey still have a huge economic incentive -- in the form of an increase in food stamp and Medicaid benefits for each additional child born -- to notify the welfare department of a childbirth." Moreover, Rector says the official data from New Jersey are adjusted to include births reported late, and still show a decline in illegitimacy.<p>
	Rector says previously reported data leaked to the press by scholars at Rutgers University -- data that supposedly showed no decrease in out-of-wedlock births as a result of New Jersey's policy -- were not conclusive. Rector points out that the Rutgers scholars have yet to finish their evaluation, have yet to issue an official report, and that their study did not, in fact, show zero effect on out-of-wedlock births. "In fact, the Rutgers analysis shows a lower rate of out-of-wedlock births after the cap went into effect," says Rector.<p>

<center><h2>HOUSE FARM BILL A "GOOD FIRST STEP"<br>
 BUT MORE NEEDED, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br></center><br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<h4>Study Projects $135 Billion Economic
Boost From  Phasing Out Farm Programs</h4><br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>	<br><br>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 6, 1995 </b>-- House Agriculture Committee Chairman Rep. Pat Roberts' farm reform bill is "a good first step" but the Kansas Republican's proposal needs major changes to achieve real benefits for American farmers and consumers, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.<p>
	In a paper released today, John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agricultural Policy Project, says the bill -- which is scheduled for markup by the House Agriculture Committee September 13-15 -- needs a definite date when current farm programs and payments will end. The termination date should be in five years, Frydenlund says, not the seven suggested by the Roberts bill.<p>
	Nevertheless, he says, the Roberts bill, if implemented, would "significantly enhance the opportunity for farmers to meet the growing demands of the world marketplace." By extricating America's farmers from bureaucratic planting requirements, the bill would "allow farmers to produce to meet domestic consumer demand rather than to satisfy the dictates of the federal government," says Frydenlund.<p>
	Roberts' "Freedom to Farm Act" eliminates supply-control programs such as the Acreage Reduction Program, ends the Farmer-Owned Reserve for excess crop production, and replaces current target and deficiency payments with a new seven-year system of declining transitional payments, Frydenlund says.<p>
	But he believes the bill can work only if it locks in a deadline for phasing out these programs. "While Roberts' bill locks in fixed declining payments to farmers for the next seven years, there is no guarantee that these payments will cease at the end of the seven years," Frydenlund says. "The result could be buying a few years of time under the guise of real reform, only to slip back to the status quo when reducing the federal budget is no longer a top priority in Congress. In future years, supporters of centrally planned agriculture could point to any slight downturn in prices or land values as justification for a return to the current system of government controls," he says.<p>
	 The Roberts bill also should be changed to cap the transition payments for particular crops to prevent their "becoming an exorbitant windfall" if prices soar before the end of the phaseout period, and to "eliminate or at least drastically reduce" the Conservation Reserve Program, which keeps up to 36 million acres of otherwise productive land idled, Frydenlund says.<p>
	Finally, Frydenlund believes Congress should impose a spending cap on the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program and limit its borrowing authority. Under the current CCC,  there is little to constrain the Secretary of Agriculture's ability to "spend whatever is necessary regardless of what has been provided by Congress in budget authority" on deficiency payments to wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice producers.<p>
	"Not only does open-ended borrowing authority mean there is no real limit to potential farm program spending at present, but this nearly unlimited source of funds also allows the Secretary to raid CCC to cover mismanagement of other farm programs," Frydenlund says.<p>
	In a related Heritage study to be released later this week, Frydenlund and Heritage Senior Fellow for Statistical Policy Analysis David Winston conclude that the nation's economy would expand by nearly $135 billion within a decade as a result of ending the current farm program.<p>
	The study measures the "multiplier effect" on the economy that would result as farmers increase production, earn higher incomes through expanded exports, and generate new economic activity in farm-related industries such as equipment manufacturing, fertilizer, seed, livestock feed, food processing, transportation and shipping.<p>
	"In a 10-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state contributing to the expanded economy. Every single state will win under this plan," Frydenlund and Winston say.<p>
	Their conclusion was based on data generated by an econometric computer model developed by Heritage for the think tank's report, "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." That plan -- which proposed phasing out all federal farm programs by the year 2001 -- was made public earlier this year.<p>
	"In fact, the nation's economy would expand by $10.9 billion just in the first year, and this is a conservative estimate," according to Frydenlund and Winston.<p>

<title>The Salviatori Leadership Speakers Bureau</title>
</head>

<body>
<center>
<img alt="The Salvitori Leadership Speakers Bureau" src="sb-logo.gif">
</center>
<p>
The mission of the Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau is to promote on campus America's first principles and to defend the values of the Founding Fathers: the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, strong national defense and traditional family values.<p>

Although these speakers would not agree on all issues, each of them represents aspects of the winning conservative coalition in the United States, values and ideas which are over looked on most campuses.<p>
<p>
Currently, we are in the process of updating
our Salvatori Leadership Speakers Bureau web page. All of the speaker descriptions are being updated and new speakers are being added. The new web page will be
posted as soon as the updates are finished. If you would like information on
this Leadership Institute program please <a href="mailto:lead@lead-inst.org"><img src="email2.gif" ALT="email" BORDER=0 ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE></a> or call Ken Weary at

<i><a href="/lead-inst/epsclips.ram">Listen</a> to real-audio file of recommendations by Tim McConville of the National Right to Work Defense Foundation and Stefan Gleason who found his job though EPS.
</i>
<P>
Founded by Morton C. Blackwell in 1979, the Leadership Institute (LI) actively identifies,
recruits, trains and places principled conservatives in the public policy process.<p>

The Leadership Institute's Free Employment Placement Service is one of the oldest, longest
running, and most successful conservative job banks in Washington. LI's program has placed hundreds of conservatives
in all levels of the public policy process. In addition, its counseling service and educational programs
provide countless other conservatives with the leads, advice and training necessary to succeed in
public policy.<p>

Currently, LI's free Employment Placement Service offers three main placement options.<p>

The main Employment Placement Service program helps conservatives secure full and part-time
work in the public policy, government and private sectors.  A heavy emphasis is placed on filling
positions in Capitol Hill offices, special-interest groups and trade associations. After the 1994 fall election
cycle, special attention was given to Congressional placements and training of prospective Capitol Hill staff.

<p>The Broadcast Media Placement program helps conservatives locate and secure positions in
broadcast and print journalism, as well as public and media relations.<p>

The Intern Placement program helps interested individuals gain experience though
quality internships, volunteer work or temporary positions.<p>

Two full-time placement directors offer career counseling, tips on resume writing, job-hunting,
interviewing techniques, and networking advice to job-seekers.  To set-up an appointment, contact Emily Kertz at (703) 247-2000.<p>

In addition, LI offers a variety of one-day, two-day, three-day, and week-long professional
training programs to help conservatives become effective in the public policy process.<p>

Specialized schools such as the <a href="sc-ch.html">Capitol Hill Staff Training School</a>, the <a href="sc-cd.html">Candidate Development
School</a>, the Foreign Service Opportunity School, and the <a href="sc-brj.html">Broadcast Journalism School</a> teach job-
seekers how to land and succeed in positions within these professions.<p>


Technology-oriented schools including <!--the <a href="sc-yl.html">Youth Leadership School,--></a> the <a href="sc-pr.html">Public Relations

School,</a> the Rhetoric & Campaign Communications School, and
the <a href="sc-sp.html">Student Publications School</a> help conservatives enhance their public policy skills.<p>

<dd>Here are some testimonies:
<blockquote><blockquote>
<center>
<i>"Your program of finding jobs for conservatives is the most effective I have seen. I have recommended the Institute to my friends."</i><br>
-- Joseph Cramer
<p>
<i>"Thank you very much for all the time and effort you put into helping me find a job in public policy."</i><br>
-- John Lill
<p>
<i>"Although I had been told by three separate individuals that the Leadership Institute is a good place to go when looking for a job, I never expected to see results so quickly. I would not have known where to start without your help. It was great to be on the receiving end of the  phone line for a change."</i><br>

The Predictable Perversities of Bureaucratic Behavior

<a href="/townhall/columnists/baden.html">

John Baden

<p>
There is a strong tendency for such organizations to be run for the benefit
of those in charge. This has profound implications for those in the agency
and for those they are to serve.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial
portion of its budget from transfers. When the bureaucracy is a government
agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent. I do
not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize
clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest. It impairs my viewshed, silts
my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities,
and lowers the value of my property. Unfortunately, we have no choice but
to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of
what is right.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt. Its programs pay off
too many politicians and special interests to prevent this economically
rational and environmentally preferable outcome. Unlike Apple Computer,
the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist. So long as
their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can
mix good deeds with genuine plunder.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization. Most
corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers within the
company, e.g. public affairs departments. These units, however, are rarely
if ever dominant. Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that
generate income by selling products to willing buyers. While research and
public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies
are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's
mission than that of government agencies. Deviations are constrained by
those who watch the bottom line.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however
noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the
benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.
There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.
Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced
sense of purpose. Few organizations have it.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies'
self-serving tendencies to become more pronounced. For instance, although
both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be
more corrupt than the BIA. Fortunately for their leaders, we will never
know.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university
parking with that of shopping malls. In malls, employees, including
managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way,
inconvenient location. The decision-makers who determine parking rules find
it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government
agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots
marked with titles if not names. Even a former university president, driven
from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his
preferential parking privileges. The perfidious president preserved his
privileges.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and
control over resources. This logic trumps the purpose justifying their
creation. What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual
teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the
dark and slog through seven months of Montana slush if those who
make the rules are spared these costs? A mall based on such privilege would
soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such
pressures.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
None of this is surprising. And it would be as naive to rail against as to
protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by
politicians. That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale
and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate. By
then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix. Ration the
parking spaces by price. People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in
a cheap or free area. Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or
dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to
preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries. Truly
handicapped individuals can have reserved parking. I've yet to hear a
reasonable objection to this.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land? Such a
reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little
cost to pay for their privilege. It was indeed an aberration when Congress
made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live. This
too will erode. For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that
bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.
To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of Montana State
University in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner
party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus
parking.

<h2>
Fostering a new west that respects old values
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/baden.html">     
John Baden     
</a>     
<p>
New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.
Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives.
They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and
bring with them an utterly different value system for the land. A value
system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that
matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation. They
demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values. Many
locals are resentful.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation
and cooperation. Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard
labor that traditional Western jobs require. And long-time residents need
to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers. Both must
recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and
values that have long defined the West. Here's a story from a recent trip
to Oregon State University, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames
the debate for me. I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new
West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I used to work in the woods. Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and
Idaho. I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific
Northwest, and in 1977, I finally got the chance. On sabbatical leave from
my regular university post, I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State
University. This left plenty of time to work in the woods.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly 20 years later I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a
few days of meetings. Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks
and other signs of fundamental change. While Ramona worked with her fellow
academics, I rode my bike. One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to
Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber. I
wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and
maintained. In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner. Also, I
needed a new saw.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.
I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop. It spent its declining years on
our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood. That's an easy
life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront
more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy. It's hard-core, a good
place to find recipes for spotted owl. My Lycra was on trespass in
corked-boot territory. Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust
was the same. The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking
old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter. He looked
up from his work as I entered.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hi, Ken," I said. "Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around
1977? Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days
a week? You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd
known he was professor." I took off my Bolles.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Damn! Hi, John." He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand. We exchanged
news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong
reasons. "With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every
farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees," he
said. "Less wood more saws. Not many pros in the woods anymore." He is
looking towards the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut
his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years. The changing values of the
new West aren't for Ken.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out. Will you send me a new
one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me," I said,
"but I have a Visa card."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hell, don't bother. Just send me a check when you get home."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an
extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:
<br>
<center>LEBANON
<center>Saw Shop Lebanon,
<center>Oregon
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I put it on to finish writing this essay. And I thought about trust-about
how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust. Twenty years and
a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work
honorably done.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old. Trust
that comes from working together is high on my list. Its presence in my own
life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of
stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.

<p>
<p>
<b>Editor-at-Large, National Review</b>
<p>
<p>
William Buckley, the founder of National Review and its 
editor-in-chief until 1990, covers a wide range of political, 
cultural, and economic issues in his syndicated columns, 
which appear in NR, and in articles and reviews written 
specifically for the magazine.  Although he has handed over 
the editorial reins to John OSullivan, he continues as the 
magazines president and editor-at-large, and he produces 
his "Notes & Asides" column each issue.
<p>
Buckley served in the Army during World War II before 
matriculating at Yale University, from which he graduated 
in 1950.  He had published his first two books, "God and 
Man at Yale" and (with L. Brent Bozell) "McCarthy and 
His Enemies," before founding National Review in 1955.  
He began his syndicated column, "On the Right," in 1962, 
and launched his weekly television show, Firing Line, in 
1966; in between, he ran for mayor of New York City in 
1965, and received 13.4% of the vote on the Conservative 
Party ticket.  He has served on the Advisory Commission of 
the United States Information Agency (1969-72), and as 
Public Member of the U.S. Delegation to the UN General 
Assembly (1973).  His 31 books include political analyses, 
sailing books, and the Blackford Oakes spy novels.  He is 
the recipient of numerous awards, including Best Columnist 
of the Year (1967), a Television Emmy for Program 
Achievement (1969), the American Book Award for Best 
Mystery (paperback) for Stained Glass (1980), and the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom (1991).<p>

<h2>
You Figure It Out
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The most recent objection to the Communications Decency Act was filed 
on Monday by Microsoft, the American Library Association, and the 
Society for Professional Journalists. Their arguments are much the 
same as those of the American Civil Liberties Union filed about eight 
minutes after the bill was signed by President Clinton. And days after 
that, the District Court in Philadelphia estopped enforcement of the 
Act on the grounds that the word &quot;decency&quot; was insufficiently defined. 
Argument will proceed. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here are points to consider in this rerun of the People v. Obscenity, 
in which Obscenity regularly wins.
<ol>
<li>The vote in the House was 414 to 16 in favor of the Act. In the 
Senate, 91 to 5. And of course, President Clinton signed it. That's 
506 out of 527 human beings all of whom swore to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States. Yet learned and experienced men and 
women who oppose the Act merely laugh at any suggestion that they 
actually did believe the Act to be constitutional. Specifically, Ira 
Glasser, the Executive Director of the ACLU, and Susan Estrich, 
Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, who eight 
years ago managed the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. What's 
going on here?

<li>By way of background, what sometimes is lumped in under obscenity 
is three categories of material. One is erotica: Literature or art 
intended to arouse sexual desire (American Heritage Dictionary). A 
second is pornography: Pictures, writing, or other material that is 
sexually explicit (AHD). A third is perversity. This is the stuff of 
the Marquis de Sade. 

<li>Perversity is every now and then stopped. A few weeks ago, the 
felony conviction of Robert and Carleen Thomas was upheld. Their gig 
was something called Amateur Action, a computer bulletin board that 
advertised itself as The Nastiest Place on Earth, and featured graphic 
images of children raped by their parents, and other stuff the fingers 
balk at even typing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the ACLU takes the position that the First Amendment protects any 
&quot;speech.&quot; And indeed it does, but the great swindle of the century has 
been the transmutation of obscenity into &quot;speech.&quot; The absolutists go 
a long way: burning the American flag is a form of speech, they tell 
you. This would be understandable if the person protesting American 
policy were blind and dumb and had available to him to express himself 
on Capitol Hill only a box of matches and a few American flags. This 
is not to say that the lines between erotica and pornography or 
pornography and perversion are clearly drawn, but neither is the line 
clearly drawn that demands &quot;reasonable&quot; compliance with various 
provisions of the law. 

<li>Perspectives change, and they have changed during the past fifty 
years in the direction of promiscuity. In the early Sixties reasonable 
people differed on whether Fanny Hill was obscene (Answer: Of course 
it's obscene, and it's a delight). During the Sixties, Simone de 
Beauvoir was pleading the &quot;right&quot; to read the Marquis de Sade (&quot;Must 
We Burn de Sade?&quot;). So that the question became muddled: Ought works 
of obscenity and even perversion be permitted to exist (i.e., should 
they not be burned?); or, as was the case in France for 175 years, is 
the work of de Sade something that should be kept in the libraries for 
the edification of those whose business it is to probe the forlorn 
atolls of twisted minds?

<li>Leaving us with the Internet. There are obscenity laws that apply 
to television broadcasting, though they are lax; and to radio; and, as 
a matter of fact, to telephone lines. The philosophical postulate here 
is that the air is public property and government has custodial 
responsibilities over that which belongs to the people, who can 
through their representatives define toxicity as more merely than 
particulates emitted by asbestos, or whatever. The Communications 
Decency Act is aimed at protecting children, and prosecutions under it 
are supposed to bear the burden of proving that the smut-merchants had 
every reason to believe that children would be tapping in on their 
product. The lawyers call this scienter, knowingly. But the ACLU is 
correct here that whatever one's hopes for Internet-style V-chips that 
would block out noxious web sites, there can't be any assurance that 
the horny 16-year-old isn't going to succeed in tapping in on that 
stuff.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In which event you may have a law that is unenforceable, but does that 
make it unconstitutional?

Black Conservatives</CENTER>

<P><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
	Question : What do Anthony Lowe, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney of King
County, Washington who is running for State Insurance Commissioner, Teresa
Doggett, the international banker running for Congress from Austin, Texas
and Danny Covington of Vicksburg, Mississippi, another Congressional hopeful,
have in common?<BR>
<BR>
	 Answer: they all are  conservative black Republicans who are likely to
seek support from BAMPAC--&quot;Black America's Political Action Committee.&quot;
 Expecting to raise over $1 million this year from a membership list of
37,000, BAMPAC is cited by Hill Magazine in Washington, D.C. as the fastest
growing new political action committee in the country. Its founder was the
principled and charismatic former Reagan Administration Ambassador, Alan
Keyes, who ran for president in the GOP primaries last spring.<BR>
<BR>
	A few years ago, black Republican candidates were  rarities, especially
in predominantly white districts. They did run in black districts, but were
considered little more than sacrificial lambs. Therefore, when 11 blacks
ran for Congress on the GOP line in 1990, most observers considered the
development significant. Six years later there are at least 24 black GOP
Congressional candidates--now including two incumbents, Gary A.Franks of
Connecticut and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. As happened to blacks on the Democratic
ticket in the '70's, there suddenly are black Republicans showing up in
state offices, such as Secretary of State Victoria Buckley of Colorado and
Ohio State Treasurer J. Kenneth Blackwell. <BR>
<BR>
	Moreover, more Republican blacks are contesting Democrats in predominately
black areas. Mississippi's Danny Covington, a former parole officer and
Congressional aide with a  conservative social message, is the first black
to win a Republican primary in that state since Reconstruction days, over
a century ago. The state's US Senators, both Republicans, strongly supported
Covington against a white primary challenger.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, the Repbublican party could only go up in terms of  black support.
Just 10 percent identify today with the party of Lincoln. But there are
ocassional races where GOP candidates receive up to 40 percent black support,
and that edge often proves decisive.<BR>
<BR>
	The first black US Senator since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts
in the 1970's, was a Repbublican--one of the rarities. But Brooke was a
liberal Republican, as were many of the appointed officials advanced by
Republican presidents until Reagan. They not only backed the civil rights
gains of the '60's--as did most Republican then, and almost all by the next
decade--but also the more controversial programs, such as racial set-asides
and quotas. Their closest prominent counterpart today would be Gen. Colin
Powell, who supports &quot;affirmative action,&quot; while opposing &quot;preferences,&quot;
a fine distinction.<BR>
<BR>
	In any case, most newer black Republican elective officials are more conservative.
In this they are closest to the top black legal official in the land, Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas. They like to point out that while the Republican
party, as such, is not popular among blacks, there are strong conservative
currents running in the overall black electorate.<BR>
<BR>
	A 1992 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a
generally liberal think tank, confirms that more blacks call themselves
conservative than liberal (33 percent to 29 percent). A more recent poll
by the center provides a fascinating breakdown of these averages, showing
that younger black voters, 18-25, were nearly twice as likely to identify
with the Republicans as were older ones (18 percent versus 8 percent) and
to call themselves conservatives (34 percent versus 22 percent). <BR>
<BR>
	Overall, black voters supported the death penalty 58 percent to 42 percent,
backed a two year limit on welfare by 58 percent also, by nearly 75 percent
backed mandatory sentences for drug dealers, and by 61 percent agreed that
black leaders were too quick to cite racism as an excuse for black crime.<BR>
<BR>
	The Gallup survey, similarly, found 53 percent disapproval of mandatory
busing among black voters, 48 percent pro-life sentiment and 77 percent
opposition to preferential treatment to make up for past discrimination.
Some 92 percent of blacks believe in God, a figure higher than for the population
as a whole (about 85 percent).<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, these surveys do not predict voter behavior and, moreover, wording
(for example, &quot;affirmative action&quot; versus &quot;preferential treatment&quot;)
can change poll outcomes for all groups in society. Just as Southern whites
agreed with Republicans in such polls for many years and still voted overwhelmingly
Democratic, there is little sign yet of political reallignment among black
voters nationally.<BR>
<BR>
	Yet it could come; and even a rise to 20  or 30 percent Republican support
would  transform the political landscape. Likewise, an increase of black
Republicans in Congress from two to, say, six, effectively would end the
monolithic Democratic support the media and other observers expect of black
Americans. It also might end the recent tendency of the Democratic party
to take black voters for granted. <BR>
<BR>
	However, white Republicans, too, should pay close attention to what black
members of their party are telling them. The old government solutions to
social and economic problems have failed, but, as General Powell stated
at the GOP convention, there is still a demand for solutions of some kind.
Economic opportunity is crucial. Within the party, personal or political
slights are as unwelcome as ever. Unconscious white discrimination burns
the hearts of  conservative as well as liberal blacks.<BR>
<BR>
	It's just that black conservatives, stressing family, entrepreneurism and
community self-help, believe they have found a better way of moving forward.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Bob Dole's &quot;Vision&quot; May Soon Clear Up</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>The campaign of 1996 will get out of the summer Doledrums when the prospective
GOP standard-bearer announces his economic program. If that program is ambitious
in scope, joining a growth package of and tax reductions and spending controls
with a long term rescue of Social Security through private sector investments,
Bob Dole's supposed lack of a &quot;vision&quot; suddenly will disappear
as a political concern. A program simple in concept and profound in social
and economic implications, it would unite in common interest otherwise contending
generations and economic groups.<BR>
<BR>
The young, the working poor and much of the middle class, for whom high
payroll taxes and today's low-growth prosperity make saving exceedingly
difficult, would see the bulk of their Social Security tax finally put to
work as a genuine instrument for investment. Simultaneously, the effect
upon the nation's overall savings rate would give the United States the
higher growth rates that encourage real national and personal financial
progress.<BR>
<BR>
The risk in the package, of course, is raising the Social Security issue
in a politically charged atmosphere. The Clinton White House will be tempted
irresistibly to rouse the elderly against any change. Never mind that in
almost any reform plan Dole might endorse, protection of the elderly will
be guaranteed. The politics of misinformation that worked so well with Medicare
reform--where millions of dollars of Democratic and labor union TV ads persuaded
voters that a proposed reduction in the rate of growth of this entitlement
constituted a &quot;cut&quot;--will be used again to stigmatize reform of
Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
But several developments are pushing a cautious Dole to take up the challenge,
anyhow.<BR>
First, he desperately needs some new ideas. As is, his campaign is running
like a Kansas creek in a July drought. But something more than old-time
Republican deficit reductions is indicated. An economic plan that offers
ordinary workers a way to gain a share in national wealth-creation will
have broad and deep appeal. Without a forward-looking national agenda, on
the other hand, Dole's only hope is that the Clinton presidency self-destructs
in scandal. But even if it did, a victorious Dole would go into office without
a mandate for any particular program. <BR>
<BR>
Second, former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm's entry into the suddenly real
&quot;race&quot; for the Reform Party nomination puts the Social Security
issue on the table, in any case. He has met with key backers of the idea,
including Jose Pinera, the Chilean who successfully introduced it in his
country, and the proposal is now part of Lamm's avowed program. So the issue
will be debated nationally, regardless of what Dole or Clinton want or fear,
or, of course, how the more likely Reform Party nominee, Ross Perot, chooses
to characterize it. <BR>
<BR>
Lamm knows he is on to something. Young voters are especially excited about
the idea. When Steve Forbes proposed it in a debate at the University of
Arizona last spring he got a standing ovation from the largely youthful
audience and won that state's primary.<BR>
<BR>
The third development promoting a Dole decision to adopt broad reform as
an issue is the imminence of a report by the Clinton Administration's own
bi-partisan Social Security advisory commission. Having labored in obscurity
for two years, the panel is about to conclude that the best solution to
the Social Security system's problems is reform that takes advantage of
the power of the free market. (The worst solution, of course, is to raise
the already high payroll taxes and to cut benefits.)<BR>
<BR>
The 13 member commission is divided as to which of several specific approaches
is desirable. The main issues are whether all or only part of a worker's
12.4 percent Social Security tax should be invested in a savings and investment
account for him personally and how best to handle the transition from the
present system to an entirely new one.<BR>
<BR>
These are not minor questions. Without some of a taxpayers' payment going
to fund the transition costs of a new system, that transition becomes problematical.
On the other hand, unless a worker gets something close to full personal
advantage from the investment of his savings, the bright potential for him
and for the economy is reduced.<BR>
<BR>
These differences can be composed, but they need not be resolved in this
fall's campaign. Even if Dole (or Clinton, for that matter) were to embrace
a specific detailed plan, Congress would want to hold hearings and make
changes next spring. In fact, there are so many variations of the private
sector plan around now that endorsing one completely would assure criticism
from backers of other approaches. The same goes for a flat tax proposal
and a spending control plan.<BR>
<BR>
What matters is a general outline that combines the benefits of a flat or
flatter income tax with the conversion of Social Security from a fund whose
current (and temporary) surplus is used to subsidize the general budget
to one that helps individual workers invest. A flat tax without Social Security
reform could be seen as tilting toward the upper middle class and wealthy,
while Social Security reform by itself will not maximize economic growth.
The two together, along with spending controls, would help every worker
and family in the country. If Dole advocates such a package he will have
a central and unifying theme for his campaign. No more Bob Dull.<BR>
<BR>
As it happens, the last Kansan to be nominated for President, Dwight Eisenhower
in 1952, also was criticized in late summer for a campaign that was &quot;running
like a dry creek.&quot; But he managed to turn that campaign around with
a breakthrough international policy idea---&quot;I will go to Korea.&quot;
Economic reform to help average Americans could do the same for Bob Dole.

How do you Play Cards with China?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
	Washington Sen. Slade Gorton received headline attention recently  when
he announced that he would not oppose extension of &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot;
(MFN) trading status for China this year. He thereby helped avoid an embarrassing
vote in the Senate at a time when Boeing has major Chinese contracts pending
and Microsoft has just reached a new agreement  on intellectual property
rights.<BR>
 <BR>
	Less noticed, however, was the angry nature of the criticism Gorton heaped
on the Chinese and their apologists here in the United States.  Throwing
down a marker on trade complaints, the Republican senior senator declared
that unless significantly fairer treatment of American companies takes place
in the next year,  he will &quot;lead the fight&quot; against awarding China
MFN status next year.  Coming from a representative of the nation's most
trade dependent state, the pledge is considered reckless swagger by some
observers and political courage by others. Regardless, Gorton, when aroused
by a large principle, is a resourceful legislative foe.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Gorton's Democratic colleague, Sen. Patty Murray, is heading
in what seems to be the opposite direction, arguing at a recent conference
of the Washington Council for International Trade that the US should make
MFN status permanent for all nations with whom we have relations (which
is all but the likes of Iraq, Cuba and North Korea). This, she believes
would avoid the annual pain and embarrassment of the MFN debate. Many China-hands
in business and academia agree.<BR>
<BR>
	It seems unlikely that under present circumstances either option will prevail,
however. On one hand, America is too entangled with the China trade and
too smitten with the future of an economy growing by 9% a year to lift anchor
and sail away. Before long, there will be a wholesale turnover in Chinese
leadership as the aged Long Marchers finally retire or die, so US traders
are reluctant to surrender their position now to the Japanese and Europeans.
Slade Gorton is articulate as well as indignant in his cataloguing of Chinese
trade perfidies, but the very businesses he might be expected to have on
his side--software, wheat and fruit growers, for example--are unwilling
to sign up against MFN.<BR>
<BR>
	On the other hand, Sen. Murray's dream of a permanent MFN will make a easy
target for political opponents of the present annual endorsement. This year
the human rights and consumer groups who normally get involved in the MFN
fight decided to stand aside, but they certainly would not do so if a permanent
grant was being considered. Until China-US trade and other relations are
substantially improved, MFN will be retained as a handy weapon.<BR>
<BR>
	Better relations are by no means impossible, of course. Whoever wins the
Presidency in November will want to organize a US/China summit, and maybe
Bill Clinton will attempt one before then, if some attractive agreement
can be sculpted. In recent weeks, the Chinese reversed the hostile rhetoric
of the late winter and promised yet again to crack down on factories that
pirate software and other intellectual property. There are pledges also
to stop trading missile technology with Pakistan and there even are soothing
words from Beijing about the future of Hong Kong, which China will absorb
in one year.<BR>
<BR>
	But there also are trouble signs ahead. American officials, including even
 such critics as Sen. Gorton, agree that trade issues should be separated
from human rights and military issues. But, as a practical matter, China's
human rights abuses in Tibet, the military pressures on Taiwan, government-directed
abortions, prison labor camps, secret shipments of guns into the US, and
threats to democracy in Hong Kong all play as discordant background music
that cannot be ignored and could disrupt the trade dance. <BR>
<BR>
	Hong Kong is an especially tense subject, since the Chinese takeover next
July will occur just after MFN arrives once again before Congress. If the
new Chinese authorities end up arresting Hong Kong's elected political leaders,
censoring the press and exposing the economy to the corruption that too
often characterizes the Chinese version of &quot;free markets,&quot; the
resulting turmoil will not be ignored by either public or official opinion
in the West. The chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, Martin Lee,
in a whirlwind North American tour two months ago (60 speeches in 13 days)
was an effective proponent of MFN for China as well as a critic of Chinese
threats against Hong Kong. Lee in jail, however, would be a powerful symbol
against an attempt to adopt MFN, let alone make it permanent.<BR>
<BR>
	This confusion on the horizon of 1997 actually makes Sen. Gorton's Cassandra-like
warnings potentially very useful. Forgoing sentimentality, he demands that
Americans look with realism at the trade picture, not as it might be, but
as experience has shown it.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Five years ago our trade deficit with China,&quot; he reports, &quot;was
$12.7 billion. Now it is $33.8 billion....Will we never learn?...What has
the 'engagement' of the past five years accomplished to cause us to parrot
today the very arguments that have so signally failed in the past?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Will his fellow members of Congress and the Clinton Administration simply
ignore this warning? Perhaps. But if they do so, the present opposition
to China, which is found only in minorities of the two political parties,
some human rights groups and a fraction of the business community, will
grow. Under that pressure, our relations with China may muddle through,
as they have, but they will not flourish. Already the US is less evident
in investment in China than are our western trade rivals and Japan.<BR>
<BR>
	The constructive alternative is for Congress and the White House to use
the months ahead to examine and update the full range of trade and foreign
policy tools--other than denying MFN--that can be used to influence China.
Expanding current agreements on intellectual property offers one example.
Finding ways to get China to adhere to international trade standards as
a price for admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is another.
Yet another is helping the Chinese to see that their current rapid economic
growth cannot be sustained much longer without large private investment
from the west, and that such loans absolutely require a more predictable
legal system. <BR>
<BR>
	In time, it may indeed become possible to abandon the demeaning annual
MFN drill. Meanwhile, the challenge of China policy fairly cries out for
more consultation and creative diplomacy in the councils of the West. The
year ahead is crucial to that purpose.<BR>

The Issues Behind Filegate; It's Not Just a &quot;Bureaucratic Snafu&quot;</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="21" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </CENTER>
</H3>
If illegal use of confidential FBI files is proven, Filegate will most resemble
that part of Watergate wherein White House zeal to dig up dirt on others
led to dirty practices--and genuine scandal.<BR>
<BR>
No one familiar with the White House pass system could believe that &quot;Project
Update&quot; was merely concerned with reviewing 407 FBI files of former
presidents' aides to see if they still merited passes. That transparently
false explanation is even more suggestive of a cover-up than the reluctance
of the White House to provide Congress with evidence of the affair. <BR>
<BR>
Who among former employees ordinarily would be entitled to a White House
pass? The answer is simple: no one. As a Deputy Assistant to President Reagan
in the mid-'80's I knew very well that the day after I left the payroll
I would merit clearance only on a visit-by-visit basis, and only then with
a current pass holding staffer to vouch for me. It did not matter if I still
knew the Secret Service guards or they remembered me. It didn't matter if
I was still in the same Administration, serving in a departmental position.
I had no right to a White House pass. If there were a few exceptions to
this rule, they were close family members and personal advisers of the incumbent
president.<BR>
<BR>
So how could Craig Livingstone, director of security for President Clinton,
pretend that he wanted to check the FBI files of employees of former Administrations
to see which ones should be given passes? Again the answer is simple, he
couldn't. His explanation is bogus. (Can't you just see old Reagan and Bush
aides given free rein to roam the West Wing, parking their wingtips in the
Roosevelt Room and schmoozing George Stephanopolous in the Mess?) Coming
from a security chief who at the time had given passes to many of his own
White House colleagues without ever putting them through an FBI clearance--a
record of delay and laxity unmatched by any previous Administration--the
whole story is offensive as well as ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
It is far more plausible that the former employees whose private files were
ordered from the FBI were improper targets of White House opposition research.
Out of curiosity, I sent for a copy of the list to see if I was on it. I
wasn't. But there was the name of my deputy in the White House, Tony Blankley.
Why would the file of the deputy director of the Office of Planning and
Evaluation be sought and not his superior's? Could it possibly be because
Mr. Blankley had become Press Secretary to Newt Gingrich, an Administration
critic? Other people on the list are now leaders of Congressional staffs
with direct oversight on White House activities. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the names on the list, it is true, are hard to assign any obvious
purpose. Former Chief of Staff (and later Secretary of State) Jim Baker
is often cited as such a case. Yet, think: in 1993, when the list was first
collected, Baker's name was a lot more interesting, for at that time he
was talking about running for President in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
So the White House assertion that the file acquisitions was just a &quot;bureaucratic
snafu&quot; does not meet the laugh test. <BR>
<BR>
The next line of defense for Administration apologists is, &quot;So what?&quot;
After all, why should former officials worry about their past being known
unless they have something to hide?<BR>
<BR>
In truth, they have a lot to worry about, starting with the danger of anonymous
and false accusations being promoted by people in official positions. In
most arenas of life, malicious rumors can be confronted in the public forum.
We see it all the time in lawsuits and political campaigns. But compilation
of an FBI file does not take place in the open. <BR>
<BR>
An FBI background security check routinely is ordered for people under consideration
for service in the White House or for appointment to a department post that
requires confirmation by the Senate. Some lesser positions also require
FBI checks. By law, the information collected in the resulting FBI file
is confidential and meant only for review by the President, his personnel
staff and, in the case of a Senate confirmation, a few relevant senators
and their top committee aides.<BR>
<BR>
However, it is a popular misconception that FBI files necessarily are objective
and represent the FBI's own considered judgment. FBI agents seek out opinions
as well as facts, and often more from one's critics than from one's friends.
If someone accuses you of something, you don't have the right to know his
name, or, as a practical matter, the nature of the accusation. The agents
roll the whole pile--fact and possible fiction--into something that is meant
to be evaluated by the authorities making (or confirming) the appointment.
These authorities almost always behave with responsibility and common sense.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, misuse of FBI files occurs. From 1959, when President Eisenhower's
nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Admiral Lewis Strauss, was defeated on
trumped up charges, through every administration since, we have seen instances
where something that sounds like a conclusive evaluation, but isn't--&quot;an
FBI file&quot;--is leaked, and a nominee or office-holder is smeared.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine that you were under consideration for a presidential appointment
and you knew that your views might incite foes to say false or distorted
things about you to the FBI, and that you ran at least a small risk that
your file might be misued by persons unknown to prevent your appointment.
It would be a disincentive to serve, wouldn't it?<BR>
<BR>
Grim as that prospect looms, now imagine you also learned that years later,
staffers in some future White House could get a hold of your unprocessed
FBI file and make whatever public or private use of it they wanted--without
your approval or knowledge and without connection to any legitimate official
purpose. That suggests why so-called &quot;Project Update&quot; was such
a stark perversion of security procedures. <BR>
<BR>
There are, indeed, &quot;bureaucratic snafus&quot; that mitigate government
&quot;mistakes.&quot; This doesn't seem to be one of them. It looks more
like an assault on privacy and due process, and more broadly, on the trust
that supports representative democracy. It fully warrants the investigation
it is getting.<BR>

Congress Should Seek Out Sources of Worsening Military Morale</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>	Turf  battles and budget cuts always stir anxieties in the military,
 but recent signs of damaged morale in the officer corps  suggest worrisome
trouble from more unusual sources. At some point the fighting ability of
the military--its reason for existence--may be impaired. Before that happens,
Congress should investigate the causes of the recent spate of  firings,
resignations, lawsuits, charges of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and top officer
suicides that are afflicting the armed services.<BR>
<BR>
	A Congressional investigation almost surely would cast a light on the results
of President Clinton's political correctness policies and micro management,
 but it also would call into question the attitudes of some members of Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	For several years now the military has been treated as some kind of social
laboratory. A Tailhook Convention of Navy aviators five years ago included
a notorious party that provided the pretext for the puritanical reaction
that followed. Somehow, few of the guilty parties at  that event were found
and punished, but people who merely attended the same convention and were
involved in no misconduct have been permanently tarnished. So were superiors
and people tagged by remarks or actions in other situations that would have
had little or no consequences in a less hysterical atmosphere.  In all,
14 admirals have been relieved or retired. Literally dozens of other officers'
promotions have been held up by the Senate. This week, Secretary of Defense
William Perry himself finally called for an end to the Tailhook witch hunt.
<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, however, the Navy, and the services generally, are pinned down
by an arch-feminist fusillade of charges and policy demands. For example,
we now have reached a point, literally, where even unattributed and unsubstantiated
accusations of political incorrectness can wreck officers' careers, and
where failure of superiors to punish those so accused can bring them down,
too. This truly is McCarthyism.<BR>
<BR>
	According to the Center for Military Readiness, a Defense Department Instruction
(DoDI 1320.4) was issued last year that allows &quot;alleged adverse information&quot;
and &quot;unsubstantiated allegations&quot; to be placed in the files of
officers after they have been selected for promotion and before their confirmation.
Without the officers being informed, the possibly false charges can be circulated
to Pentagon brass, the White House and Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	If something similar happens to short-term political appointees, they,
at least, can use publicity and political connections to fight back. Military
officers, sworn to serve civilian leadership, are nearly immobilized. They
may  be subjected to unwarranted and devastating shame.<BR>
<BR>
	The recent suicide of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jeremy Boorda,
is almost by itself worthy of a Congressional investigation. Far more apparently
was involved than an approaching Newsweek article examining his right to
wear two &quot;V&quot; (for valor) devices on his  Vietnam campaign ribbons.
Boorda had been under pressure on one hand to push the Clinton political
correctness policies, while on the other he was incurring increasing  criticism
for failing to defend the honor of his officers and the effectiveness of
the service.<BR>
<BR>
	Among the critics was combat hero, author and former Navy Secretary Jim
Webb, who, in a speech at Annapolis revealed the &quot;disturbing statistic&quot;
that in the past year &quot;53 percent of the post-command Commanders in
naval aviation left the Navy rather than continue their careers...These
were the cream, the very future of the Navy, officers who had performed
for two decades in a manner that marked them as potential Admirals.&quot;
Rather than continue on a nominally  successful track, they are quitting,
Webb noted. <BR>
<BR>
	It's not just the Navy. A Coast Guard Captain, Ernie Blanchard, made a
speech at the Coast Guard Academy that included some weak humor that offended
some female cadets. Example: he said that his friend, the Commandant, was
so unsexy that on his wedding night, when he told his wife they could do
anything she wanted, she said she'd like to go to sleep. Was it funny? No.
Was it offensive? Well, it seemingly was so offensive that Capt. Blanchard
was forced to make a public apology. But that didn't end it. Feminists demanded
a court-martial, and the top brass went along. Blanchard, a life-time veteran
with a wife and two teen-aged daughters, was led to believe that he might
well be found guilty, and lose not only his job, but also his pension. Ruined--by
a joke--he, too, committed suicide. <BR>
<BR>
	In the Army, a recent  critical internal report on morale has not been
released to the media, but it has been described in the journal Military
Review as an assessment of &quot;anecdotal accounts&quot; indicating a growing
culture of mistrust and stifled initiative.<BR>
<BR>
	The Army report echoes a former Air Force pilot who  quit because of the
backbiting and division. &quot;It's a one-mistake military now,&quot; he
says, &quot;and the mistake doesn't even have to amount to anything much
or even be true.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	It cannot help morale, in this context, that the very President who has
visited many of the new rules upon the military is the same one who has
used his  status as Commander-in-Chief as a claim against prosecution in
a lawsuit for, of all things,  sexual harassment in the Paula Jones case.<BR>
<BR>
	Some service tension, as noted, would be expected anyway in an era of military
downsizing. The armed forces are now 1.4 million, compared to 13 million
at the height of World War II; yet we have just as many generals and admirals
as then. We are top-heavy. But demoralizing your officer class so that many
of your best people quit and many of the others live in quiet fear is  a
strange way to address the leadership issue. <BR>
<BR>
	Are these problems as serious as the news stories and &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot;
suggest? Why doesn't the Congress find out?<BR>

    <TITLE>A Clear US Foreign Policy</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H3><I>From the Friday, May 31 Seattle Post Intelligencer</I></H3>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
Converging Trends Demand a Clear US Foreign Policy</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P>Incrreasingly, it appears that the United States of America lacks a coherent
foreign policy.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, there are exceptions. We do have a clear (and bi-partisan) policy on
foreign trade, consisting primarily of promotion of free trade agreements
and pursuit of violators of those agreements. But what is American policy
on preventing nuclear non-proliferation? A recently published Defense Department
report on the topic is long on analysis, but blurred on policy ideas.<BR>
<BR>
What about international narcotics trafficking? The U.S. has been de-emphasizing
eradication and interdiction of drug supplies, without expressing any rationale
for this change beyond a desire to concentrate on domestic use, as if the
two concerns were mutually exclusive.<BR>
<BR>
What, in the current U.S. view, is the proper role of the United Nations?
Our policy is completely reactive, with the U.S. failing either to lead
reform or to pay our $1.5 billion bill. We cannot even come up with a candidate
for Secretary General.<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the massive issue of economic development in the less advanced
countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia, a key to peace and stability
in the 21st century. Are we for more government to government aid, or something
else, and if something else, what? <BR>
<BR>
Seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, one still must ask, what
kind of life do we see for the former communist states--and what role do
we see ourselves playing in helping them to achieve it? <BR>
<BR>
Not for six decades--since 1936--has a presidential election year played
out with so little attention to international affairs. Regrettably, the
national Administration takes its leadership cues from polls and focus groups,
which, like the weather before a hurricane, give no sign of disturbance.
For the Clinton White House the significance of foreign policy pertains
mainly to domestic voter groups. If there is an American strategy anymore
it is a well-kept secret.<BR>
<BR>
In 1936, history shows, the United States courted disaster by ignoring war
threats in Europe and Asia. In 1996 we tempt fate again by not supporting
development of an anti-missile weapons system and by turning our military
into a social agency instead of a fighting force. On the day that an adversary
shows a capacity to infiltrate our defensive perimeter or to intimidate
one of our overseas bases--in Korea, for example--or simply starts a regional
nuclear war, it no longer will count for much here at home that the U.S.
military has been vigorous in implementing sensitivity training.<BR>
<BR>
But even if we could assume a benign world for American interests and the
cause of peace--and who will own up to such naivet&eacute;?--we still could
not avoid the reality that global opportunities, if not necessities, are
being slighted.<BR>
<BR>
Luck and past foreign policy successes have combined to bring the world
to a point of converging trends that Richard Judy, of the Hudson Institute,
identifies and which offer great potential benefits to this generation of
Americans. The most obvious is the globalization of the world's markets
for goods and services, a trend in which the U.S. is both an actor and acted
upon. To put this trend in perspective, exported goods and services in 1960
amounted to only 4.9 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. But last year
they came to 11 percent of GDP; and by 2010, they are expected to reach
35 percent. This trend alone is transforming our relative stake in international
relations.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps even more important is the globalization of capital markets, a trend
seemingly still unappreciated by many governments. &quot;Investors worldwide
are increasingly determined and able to seek the highest risk-adjusted returns
on their investments,&quot; Judy observes, and this freedom is coupled with
a staggering growth of private investments--through pension funds and other
sources--into economies world wide. Public investments in developing countries
now represent only a third of the total, having been surpassed in recent
years by private investments. Among the likely results are a closing range
of interest rates worldwide, international funding of more innovations in
products and services and a growing inability of national governments to
thwart the discipline of the free market.<BR>
<BR>
Coincident with these primarily economic trends are four others, according
to Judy:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of institutions,&quot; including law, representative
democracy as a normative goal and acceptance in principle that &quot;private
property (will prevail) as the basic form of asset ownership.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of technologies,&quot; whether in transportation,
materials science, medicine, or such softer fields as marketing and management.
<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of information,&quot; which proceeds in part
from the technological trend. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of culture.&quot; To a staggering degree, the
other trends of convergence support a long term change in value systems,
permitting gratified expectations of common commercial practices, language
(English), and even food availability and environmental standards. This
is also the trend with the most dangerous and explosive potential downside,
for most of the world--including even the USA--does not want to be homogenized
into some one-world culture-glob. In revolt against this trend come myriad
forms of paranoia and rebellion.<BR>
<BR>
These global trends, therefore, may be inevitable, but our success in shaping
them is not. It is folly for American officials to let public ignorance
of these developments determine government policy toward them. Whether from
peril or opportunity, foreign affairs is unavoidably domestic policy these
days and must be recognized as a higher priority in the national debate.
Where, we should be asking, do our political candidates stand?<BR>

<P><BR>
	This summer the Congress is expected, finally, to take up the subject of
campaign finance reform. If you believe the interpretation put upon this
issue by most of the media and the permanent, self-designated &quot;reform&quot;
lobby, the only reason to oppose the proposals being made is the self-interest
of politicians and their major backers. But this simplistic view increasingly
is contradicted by the actual results of the reform measures we already
have adopted in the past 25 years.  In few other areas does the &quot;law
of unintended consequences&quot; operate so fiercely. <BR>
<BR>
	Most, though not all, campaign reform proposals in Washington, D.C., would
result in just the opposite of what reformers claim. They would reduce accountability
of politicians, increase the power of rich candidates and special interests,
decrease electoral competition and stifle the very free political speech
that the American Founders cared about most when they enshrined it  in the
First Amendment.<BR>
<BR>
	Arguably, we need more money in politics, not less, and more people giving,
not fewer, and that to protect free political speech, we need less government
regulation, not more.<BR>
<BR>
	Look at the Alice in Wonderland situation that has developed recently in
this year's presidential race. For the past couple of months, Bob Dole,
his poll numbers sagging, must have wondered why he ever agreed to accept
public matching money for his  presidential campaign. Under the law, a &quot;reform&quot;
measure of its time, Dole received federal matching grants from revenue
raised by the check-off account to which about 20 percent of the taxpayers
contribute on their income tax forms; but in return, he had to agree to
limit his campaign spending during the primary season. Now,  effectively
having secured the Republican nomination, he is only about $150,000 away
from his legal limit and the GOP convention is still months away. He cannot
legally raise and spend campaign dollars until after the Republican convention.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Bill Clinton, who had no primary opposition, was able to husband
most of his millions in federal matching money and can campaign to his heart's
delight. In fact, as an incumbent president he already enjoys enormous advantages,
garnering campaign-like publicity while simply performing as president.
At the same time, his allies in the AFL-CIO, who are able to operate outside
the campaign laws, are spending $35 million to defeat Dole and the Republicans.
The Democratic Party has been similarly focused all spring, placing TV ads
in crucial election states. The cumulative effect on Dole's numbers could
not have been good.<BR>
<BR>
	Dole is left now with the option of using the resources of the Republican
party, but even there he has to be careful. The Republican National Committee
plans to spend $20 million to boost its cause before the party convention,
but the White House and the Democratic party's lawyers are watching to see
if, for example, Dole or other Republicans at party-sponsored events target
Bill Clinton by name in a way that will allow a campaign ethics charge to
be lodged with the Federal Elections Commission. Both parties at this point
can talk about &quot;issues,&quot; the law appears to say, but cannot explicitly
support their candidate's election. On either this ground or the likelihood
of &quot;overspending,&quot; Dole could find himself in another of our country's
synthetic &quot;scandals,&quot; and a defendant before the Federal Elections
Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	Thus we see in this one situation, the potential for absurdity in modern
campaign &quot;reform&quot; legislation. One of the major party candidates
is nearly incapacitated and tempted to technical error by the rigidity of
federal law--in a dilemma not anticipated years ago by reformers. The parties
themselves can campaign, but only if they pretend otherwise. The special
interests, however, including besides the AFL-CIO,  a host of powers, such
as the National Rifle Association, the National Chamber of Commerce, the
trial lawyers and the pro-and anti-abortion groups, can spend unlimited
funds free of public scrutiny--so long as they don't use explicit words
urging a vote for their preferred candidates. And billionaire Ross Perot
(who claims to be a reformer, of all things) can spend as much as he likes,
and say whatever he likes, so long as he spends his own money.  Ralph Nader,
another potential third party presidential candidate who  claims &quot;reform&quot;
credentials, indicates that he may not release his income tax return, since
where he gets his money  is nobody's business.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Reform,&quot; you see, is for other people. For oneself it increasingly
is mostly a dandy way to get the tactical upper hand over one's ideological
foes. Specifically, it is a means to handicap accountable political parties
to the benefit of unaccountable special interests, to handicap challengers
to the benefit of incumbents, and to enable personally rich candidates to
place their competition at a disadvantage. At least, that is the way it
is working out.<BR>
<BR>
	Twenty five years ago, when the post-Watergate Federal Elections Campaign
Act was adopted, the Supreme Court  (in Buckley v. Valeo) allowed the law's
limits on contributions (a $1000 amount in federal elections that has never
been adjusted for inflation), but cited First Amendment free speech objections
to permit limits on spending for wealthy candidates, special interest groups
or candidates who decline to accept federal matching money in presidential
races. <BR>
<BR>
	On their own terms, therefore, the reformers wound up with  a lopsided
system that is shot through with unfair exceptions and contradictions. And
the results show it. Though reformers sought lower cost campaigns, campaign
spending levels, in constant dollars, have gone up threefold. The incumbency
advantage actually increased after the post-Watergate reforms were enacted;
even in 1994, 91.4 percent of incumbents who sought re-election were successful.
Where reformers wanted to reduce the influence of special interests, they
failed spectacularly. The best example is the creation of political action
committees (PACs) that collect voluntary contributions in a given industry
or civic organization. This was originally a  reform meant to replace straightforward
corporate support of candidates. Now the PACs themselves are under attack.
<BR>
<BR>
	Even if the Supreme Court had accepted the full dose of reform medicine
first advanced in law--controlling expenditures as well as contributions--we
probably would have been disappointed by the consequences. As Larry J. Sabato,
a campaign finance expert at the University of Virginia, has written, &quot;One
cannot dam the flow of political money in a society as free as ours. If
it's blocked in one area, it will simply find other channels...These alternative
means of influence are often obscured and unaccountable, eliminating visible
disclosure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, Sabato's reality check runs directly contrary to what reformers
and much of the public believe to be the case. They always imagine that
good clean election campaigns are right around the corner, if only we pass
a few more regulations. What we forget is the &quot;law of unintended consequences.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Take the &quot;Bi-partisan Clean Congress Act&quot; introduced in the U.S.
House by Republican Rep. Linda Smith of southwest Washington,  and several
other legislators--Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) and Rep. Chris Shays, (R-Conn.)--with
strong support from the permanent reform lobby, including Common Cause,
the League of Women Voters, Ross Perot and most of the liberal media (the
latter have lionized Rep. Smith, though they oppose nearly every other political
view she holds). This bill would ban PACs, curb out-of-state contributions
to Congressional candidates, and further limit spending by the political
parties. A companion measure in the Senate, sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.), John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-Minn.), would seek to
convince candidates to limit spending voluntarily by offering them free
or reduced TV advertising time and government-financed mailings, and penalizing
those who do not go along by giving their opponents even more government
campaign support. The Senate bill also would expand further the regulatory
powers of the Federal Elections Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	You can't blame them for trying. But how would it work out? Linda Smith
ran last time against an incumbent, Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, who received a
lot of out-of-state money and outspent Mrs. Smith, then the challenger,
two to one. But Linda Smith, a leading power among segments of the religious
right, had a well-organized power base that raised enough money to enable
her to get her message out. It would make political sense for her now, as
an incumbent, to entrench this advantage by limiting out-of-state contributions
and providing overall spending caps.<BR>
<BR>
	But consider the case of Rep. George Nethercutt of Spokane. As a challenger
in 1994 and facing mighty Speaker of the House Tom Foley, he found initial
fundraising very difficult. Even local Republicans were afraid of offending
a powerful incumbent Democrat. Nethercutt was a challenger who required
out-of-state support to get enough traction to make his race credible. <BR>
<BR>
	Thus, whether out-of-state contributions hurt or help incumbents depends
a great deal on the circumstances of a particular race. And the same goes
for efforts to keep a lid on personal spending. A challenger's only hope
against a well-known incumbent, especially if that officeholder enjoys media
 support, is to raise a large enough war chest to get his message out on
his own.  Says Bradley A. Smith, who teaches election law at Capital University
in Ohio, &quot;What is important is not who outspends whom, but that the
challenger spends enough to stimulate voter interest in the race...Efforts
to cap spending help entrench incumbents and so foster public frustration
with the system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
	The same also is true of contribution limits.  Little-known challengers
need to  raise large sums early if they  hope to win, and they usually cannot
raise such sums without getting large contributions from a few family members
and close friends. Contribution limits like those in the Smith and McCain
bills mainly help incumbents, people (like Smith) with an already organized
donor base, and the personally wealthy, who can contribute all they want.
One person's &quot;reform&quot; is thus another's restraint on fair competition
and voter choice.<BR>
<BR>
	A major flaw with the thinking of most reformers is the idea that there
is too much money in political campaigns now.  As Bradley Smith points out,
the total spent on all Congressional races in 1994, including primaries,
was $600 million, less than half the annual advertising budget of General
Motors, or about $3 per eligible voter--the amount of a video rental. It
is also false to think that the amount of money spent on campaigns is responsible
for  &quot;negative&quot; campaigning and attack ads on TV. There is no
evidence for this, nor for the conventional impression that expensive campaigns
always prevail. If the complaint is based on false assumptions, therefore,
it is not surprising that that it has bad consequences.<BR>
<BR>
	If we can all agree that we want ample political competition to assure
the voters choices, adequate airing of issues to provide voter's information
for making those choices and prevention of hidden influences, then a better
kind of reform might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
	First, raise the limit on personal contributions. In truth, there probably
should be no limit, so long as the money is disclosed. Personal donations
are far more disinterested than those of PACs, let alone the soft money
spending of special interests, that goes unreported.  Contribution limits
for individual donors have tilted the playing field to millionaires and
billionaires, who by court ruling, are burdened with no such restrictions.
As a compromise, at least raise the present contribution limit enough to
take account of 25 years of inflation; i.e., to $5,000.<BR>
<BR>
	Second, don't weaken the political parties, strengthen them. It is ridiculous
to try to limit or curtail their spending . They are the proper and historical
home of politics and the institutions of democracy that are most regulated
by political disclosure laws--in contrast to the court-protected  unions,
industry associations and special interest advocacy groups. Fortunately,
a Colorado case is about to be decided which could determine that money
parties spend on their candidates constitute an &quot;expenditure&quot;
under the law, not a &quot;contribution,&quot; and therefore, they, too,
are covered by the First Amendment's free speech clause. <BR>
<BR>
	Indeed, in Washington State, as a result of Initiative 134, we already
have reached a similar conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
	Third, if we are going to have strict disclosure laws, they should be applied
to special interest groups--including the reformer's own organizations--that
lobby the public on political issues.<BR>
<BR>
	Fourth, instead of trying to shrink spending on politics, which is wrongheaded,
and futile in any case, stimulate the ordinary citizen to participate more.
Nothing would go farther to liberate citizen politicians than expanded support
in the form of citizen campaign contributions. We can do this by offering
a tax deduction for all contributions up to the legal limit and a tax credit
for all those below a set figure; say, $50. Parties should be included,
as well as candidates.<BR>
<BR>
	Fifth, if the above is accomplished, it then would not hurt to limit PACs
further, and it will not be necessary to turn eventually to direct public
finance of political reform.<BR>
<BR>
	This kind of program suggestion is not unique. Variations of it recently
have been embraced by groups and individuals as diverse as the libertarian
CATO Institute and the liberal Center for the Study of the American Electorate,
Speaker Newt Gingrich and liberal columnist David Broder, the conservative
Wall Street Journal and the liberal Roll Call. They all have seen that what
we need now is not another round of reform, but, if you will, a reform of
the reforms already in place.<BR>
<BR>
	 Political freedom, after all,  is really an analog to economic freedom,
as well as its natural companion. Just as over-regulation can stifle the
economy and lead to government control, so too can over-regulation of politics.
Our object, therefore, should be to increase competition and free speech
in the political process.<BR>

A Cheaper, Surer Way to Fund and Build Public Projects</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<IMG SRC="barrwb.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="7" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>How are we going to pay for it all?</B> Isn't there any way to lower
the costs? These are the plaintive cries of taxpayers around the country
as their local and state elected officials try to cajole them into supporting
a growing list of infrastructure projects.<BR>
<BR>
But even as the list grows, taxpayer tolerance for big ticket public works
is declining. In Seattle, for example, where voters this week passed (turned
down) a $50 million bond measure to help build the &quot;Commons&quot;park
near the downtown, wary but resolute city officials are expected to ask
soon for a new central library, expansion of the waterfront aquarium, improvements
to parks and roads, new courts and police stations. With previously approved
bond issues and City Council votes, Seattle expects to lay out $660 million
for capital projects in the next six years, a figure that doesn't include
projects by school districts, the separately financed, and largely self-supporting
water and light departments, or the port authority. The Port of Seattle
alone, for example, has $1.6 billion of projects scheduled for the next
six years.<BR>
<BR>
King County and its neighboring counties in Puget Sound, and the State of
Washington, meanwhile, have even bigger capital plans--some slated for action,
some just a fond wish-- including a convention center expansion, two sports
stadia, a several billion dollar rapid transit system (headed for a vote
in the fall), an environmental greenway between Seattle and the Cascade
mountains to the East, and literally untold billions in freeway and bridge
construction. Statewide, transportation infrastructure needs alone have
been estimated at $20.8 billion in the next quarter century.<BR>
<BR>
It would be an exaggeration to say that voters are either fed up or exhausted
by the large construction agenda ahead, perhaps because they are only dimly
aware of how big it is. But, if voters have not shown themselves angry,
they clearly are impatient and highly selective. Part of their reluctance
is probably based on a sense that taxes at all levels are too high. Another
part is surely due to a concern that they can see no strategy or priority
evident in all this capital planning, and too little coordination among
governmental units.<BR>
<BR>
But there also could well be some frustration that the costs of these projects
are simply too high--that taxpayers are not getting their money's worth.
Past legislation meant to prevent corruption and to assure environmental
protection has contributed to delays and higher overhead costs. However,
also contributing has been the very nature of government, where typically
the group that spends the money is different from that which plans how to
spend it and is always different from those whose money is spent.<BR>
<BR>
The usual pattern (to oversimplify for the sake of brevity) is that government
decides to build, say, a prison, then hires a design team to plan it, and
then lets it out for competitive construction bids. Once the low bidder
is selected, the construction project gets underway. Soon enough, it seems,
cost over-runs are noted. More money must be found. Even some projects that
come in nominally under budget were unnecessarily expensive in the first
place. The design team, having no responsibility for balancing all elements,
including likely operating and maintenance costs, may &quot;gold plate,&quot;
or over-engineer, the design and make high price tags inevitable.<BR>
<BR>
At least, that is the charge laid against the present system by advocates
of various alternative approaches. Some are promoting privatization of construction,
wherein, say, a jail or prison will be built and managed by a private company.
Nationally, there were 88 of these secure adult facilities under construction
by the end of 1994, according the National Center for Policy Analysis. A
1991 study in Texas that found that costs for four prisons were reduced
14.4 percent by private building and management. An Australian report in
1994 found a 20 percent saving in a similar situation.<BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;design/build&quot; is used for some such projects, and &quot;design/build/operate&quot;
for ones that take the private theme still further. In the latter category
is a new project by the City of Seattle to develop a water filtration plant
along the Tolt River. But the money is still the public's and so is the
ownership. <BR>
<BR>
This brings us to a visionary approach to public projects that has been
pioneered in England, the so-called Private Initiative Project (PFI). The
PFI has changed the very concept of government's role from providing services
as an owner to procuring them as a customer. An entire project--say, a prison,
to go back to the example used before--is designed, financed, built, operated
and owned by a private concern which then, per agreement, sells its services--correctional
services, per inmate, in this case--to the government. The private concern
technically owns the project and sells services to the government, which
is spared any cash expenditure up front and pays fixed operating expenses
over a long period, such as 30 years. The government's short term role is
to decide what correctional services it wants in the first place--technically,
the values and performance standards it expects of a well-run prison, and
the risks it wants to insure against--and then to ask for worldwide bids
to design the project on that basis.<BR>
<BR>
It is in the design process that the English have found that the most money
can be saved; not because that process represents much expense itself, but
because the quality of the design determines the ultimate costs of the project
as a whole. With the full range of private sector expertise available to
companies -- and consortia of companies -- involved in bidding the project,
various cost controls, revenue streams and financing are offered to a public
authority. Then the winning team bids out the construction, also worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
The result in Britain over the past few years has been a steep increase
in Public Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, which now amount to $28 billion,
for roads, transit, prisons, hospitals, schools, libraries, government offices,
and much else. Thanks to the wide expertise available to private consortia,
their ability to integrate their work, and the freedom they enjoy as owners
to create innovative solutions, they are able to bring in projects at an
expense 20 to 30 percent lower than those of comparable public projects.<BR>
<BR>
In the past couple of months, Douglas Hogg, who heads the PFI, and Jonathan
Hugget, an associate from Vancouver, B.C. where this idea presently is being
aired, have visited Seattle to meet with a few local business and governmental
leaders who have expressed interest in the concept. The hope on all sides
is that we might be able to learn from their experiences. Britain, Canada
and the US all have differences in the way public development is governed
today. In particular, we enjoy the benefits of tax exempt bonds for public
works, which gives our public approach an advantage over almost any private
one. Nonetheless, the advantage may not be conclusive and, in any event,
the PFI concept may be adaptable to our particular circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
When a half dozen Seattle bond attorneys and public finance analysts vetted
the Public Finance Initiative idea last week, they concluded that potential
benefits definitely warrant further investigation. <BR>
<BR>
They noted that the English also might have something to teach us about
handling the politics of this form of privatization. In the UK, the Conservative
Party initiated the Public Finance Initiative and are especially pleased
that it saves money, while the Labor Party backs it because its savings
in overhead costs result in more money available for construction jobs.
The tough job initially was persuading the bureaucracy. The Brits were courageous
enough to take on that daunting challenge. Are we?<BR>

    <TITLE>A new social contract</TITLE>

<H1><CENTER>A New Social Contract for America</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
	We probably all know that costs  of entitlements are the main source of
federal budget deficits, and the problem is destined to get dangerously
worse as the Baby Boom generation ages. We all know, too, that ordinary
families--especially the young--are having a hard time saving independently
for their old age. And, we all know that elderly voters, as a group, are
easily convinced that any perceived reductions in these programs are unfair.
Less widely recognized is that younger voters are waking up to this issue;
witness recent university student council resolutions protesting the grim
future of Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
	The solutions we hear from government usually involve little more than
reduced benefits and raised taxes. But the futility of this approach, especially
for Social Security,  is evident from just one statistic. In 1945 there
were 20 American workers to support each Social Security recipient. Today
the figure is 3.1 workers per recipient. By 2030, as today's children reach
middle age, there will be fewer than two workers for each beneficiary. <BR>
<BR>
	Sharp benefit cutbacks of roughly 40 percent and payroll tax hikes from
15.3 percent to 15.7 percent will be needed in a few years to maintain the
solvency of Social Security, but they will devastate workers and retirees
alike. The entitlement programs themselves are thus becoming a source of
poverty and social insecurity  in this country.<BR>
<BR>
	Fortunately,  there is an exciting, win/win strategy for solving the Social
Security problem, at least, and it is beginning to attract broad, bi-partisan
support. The most responsible thing the two presidential candidates can
do about it this political campaign year is to agree to consider it seriously
next January, when there will be less temptation to demagogue.<BR>
<BR>
	But the public needs to start discussing the idea right away, because this
solution--using the private sector to rescue Social Security--no longer
will  be possible in a few years, once the Baby Boomers themselves have
retired. Action is needed in the next couple of years.<BR>
<BR>
	There are now several plans out to use capitalism and the &quot;miracle
of compound interest&quot; to provide a brighter future for American workers.
The libertarian Cato Institute has one, and so does Martin Feldstein, Harvard
professor and former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisers. Republicans, naturally, tend to like the idea.  Steve Forbes elicited
cheers when he embraced the idea at the University of Arizona debate during
the presidential primary season. A similar program, many point out, already
works spectacularly in Chile.<BR>
<BR>
	But one of the first and most carefully researched American plans is that
of a former Democratic candidate for Senate from Delaware, Sam Beard, founder
of the National Development Council that has helped create inner-city jobs
under four presidents of both parties, organizer of the Jefferson Awards
for community service, a fellow of the Discovery Institute in Seattle--and,
most importantly, author of a new book, &quot;Restoring Hope in America:
The Social Security Solution&quot; (ICS Press, San Francisco).  Beard's
first post-publication address will be  in Seattle next Tuesday, May 14,
at 7 p.m. in the University of Washington's Kane Hall Room 220, co-sponsored
by Discovery Institute, The Seattle P.I. and the UW Graduate School of Public
Affairs.<BR>
<BR>
	I was introduced to Sam Beard about a year and a half ago by the P.I's
publisher, J.D. Alexander, and immediately saw in him the classic example
of the enterprising generalist seized with a life-changing big idea.<BR>
<BR>
	Under Beard's plan, present Social Security recipients would receive exactly
what they have been promised, and those approaching retirement also would
stay part of the plan we have now--guaranteed. But young people just starting
out in the workforce would be given the opportunity to put their Social
Security taxes to work in investment funds in the private market, much as
regular mutual funds and annuity programs operate. The government's role
would be to allocate each taxpayer's money to the fund he or she selected
and to make certain that the funds are organized in a sound manner. Workers
in the middle-age brackets (such as Baby Boomers) could mix their forms
of participation, partially paying into the present system and partially
investing in the new Social Security investment funds. <BR>
<BR>
	The plan works because the private sector is so much more productive than
the public sector, which, in any case, does not invest its Social Security
funds, but spends them as they come in on other government priorities. (What
we have today is a great chain letter scheme that would be illegal in the
private sector.) The Beard plan also will work because the huge Baby Boom
generation presently--and for the next few years--is pumping into the government
far more than the older generation of recipients is taking out. Under the
&quot;Restoring Hope&quot; plan, that surplus will be invested rather than
squandered on other programs. A one-time, long term and, of course, voluntary,
bond program for better-off taxpayers will cover the budgetary shortfall
caused by the government's shift of Social Security money that it is &quot;borrowing&quot;
now back into the Social Security program for which it was intended.<BR>
<BR>
	What this plan offers the elderly is just what they have, without danger
of later cutbacks. What it offers the young is hope for a secure old age:
roughly 50 percent more money annually than from the present system, or
twice as much if they choose to treat the program as an annuity. For a $30,000
a year wage-earner,  after 45 years, this would come to $18, 424 a year,
versus $13,710 under Social Security (all of this is in constant dollars).
Capital of roughly $368,486 could be passed along to heirs. Alternatively,
the recipient could use his accumulation as an annuity, raising his annual
receipt to $29,256. <BR>
<BR>
	Knowing that they are accumulating real savings and that these funds are
working away in the private sector will give all wage earners an investment
in the future of the overall economy, a stake most presently lack.  What
it offers the country as a whole is a huge increase in the savings rate
and a brake on inflation and interest rates. No wonder it has won praise
from  sources as varied as William F. Buckley and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,
and from both Democratic Sen. Robert Kerry of Nebraska and Republican Sen.
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, co-chairmen of the Social Security Commission.
<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Restoring Hope in America&quot; is nothing less than a new social
contract, a chance to unite rather than divide us, to heal generational
and class differences rather than increase them. It is the program of shared
economic growth and security that we badly need.<BR>

The PR Man Who Made Seattle a Great City</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
	When you get a copy of the Seattle Arts Commission's Directory of Public
Art, you will see listings of statues to Christopher Columbus, Leif Erikson
and Dr. Jose Rizal, the hero of the Philippines. But we barely manage one
statue and a copper bust of Chief Seattle and a mere artistic &quot;silhouette&quot;
for the local pioneers Arthur Denny and David &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard (at
the Pioneer Square Metro stop).  And even as we prepare for next year's
100th anniversary of the Klondike Gold Rush, you will see no mention of
a statue--neither silhouette nor bas relief  --to honor the person who did
the most to establish Seattle as a world class city, Erastus Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	He is not in school history books (how would they know what to make of
him?), but he surely was one of the world's greatest public relations men,
and the first of a long line of such conjurers in Seattle. The very fact
that Seattle has reason to celebrate the Klondike Gold Rush at all, and
enjoys the excellent gold rush museum operated by the U. S. Park Service
across from Occidental Park, is due largely to the talents and gall of Erastus
Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd, above all, who saw what the arrival in Seattle of a &quot;ton
of gold&quot; on the S.S. Portland in the summer of 1897 could mean for
its happenstance destination. The newly discovered gold fields in Dawson
City were some 1600 miles away in the Yukon Territory of Canada, but you
had to get there from somewhere on the West Coast. Vancouver and Victoria
were actually closer than Seattle. Tacoma and Portland were nearly as handy,
and San Francisco was bigger and better known. But Brainerd and his committee
 at the Chamber of Commerce persuaded the world that Seattle was the gateway
to the Yukon, and later Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
	The miners came here, it was said, and we mined the miners. Outfitting
stores were built, the ancestors of today's recreation equipment businesses,
shipping lines were founded, food distributors set up. A federal Assay Office
was established so that gold could be turned into U.S. currency. By 1911
Seattle had grown from a population of 65,000 to over 250,000 and was organizing
another public relations success, the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Brainerd's
public relations engineered a self-fulfilling boom and truly put Seattle
on the world map.<BR>
<BR>
	It would be nice to imagine that Brainerd achieved all this simply by sending
out a few new-fangled telegrams. But the campaign was far more extensive,
aggressive, and wily, if not deceitful. The historian Murray Morgan describes
how Brainerd &quot;wrote articles for national magazines, planted quotes
from the articles with the wire services, then used extracts from the wire
stories in advertisements which proclaimed Seattle the Emporium to the Klondike.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Other northwest cities tried to use the wire services, too, but Brainerd
sent corrections to the papers, which got printed, and provided form letters
for newcomers to Seattle to write  letters to the editors of their former
hometown papers. He used State of Washington stationery to write to mayors
and governors around the country, and to foreigners, asking how many prospectors
they expected to be heading to Seattle en route to the gold fields. Ostensibly,
Seattle wanted to prepare for all the visitors, but the effort was just
another way of leaving  the impression that Seattle was, indeed, the gateway
to the Klondike.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd took out ads in The New York Journal, Cosmopolitan, Century, McClure's
and other magazines of the day, had the state Secretary of State print a
guide to Klondike prospectors that, naturally, routed them through Seattle,
and sent the folders to libraries all over the world. It also was Brainerd
who went around the Director of the U.S. Mint to get the assay office opened;
he did it by  enlisting a Pennsylvania Congressman--the brother of a Seattle
businessman--in getting a special law passed.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd himself deserves, but lacks, a biography. We know he was born
in Connecticut in 1855, graduated from Harvard College, married and had
two children,  and was a practicing journalist in the East until 1890. At
the start of the gold rush he was, of all thing, Paraguayan Consul in Seattle.
For a while after his successful gold rush publicity campaign he tried his
own luck in the Klondike, as a mining consultant--a mistake. Returning to
Seattle in 1904 he became editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  He
was active in the Republican Party and later wrote a five volume history
of great artists, and another book on &quot;Alaska and the Klondyke.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Over the decades, Brainerd has been followed by a fabulous string of civic
leaders and PR promoters--from the people who organized the early civic
&quot;Potlatch&quot; events to those who started Seafair, from the creators
of the Century 21 World's Fair to those trying now to bring the  Olympic
Games to Seattle in 2008. <BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd who made Seattle big and rich and confident, but he himself
never cashed in. The final years of his life were spent in a mental hospital,
where he died Christmas Day, 1922, at age 67. <BR>
	We ought to put up a statue to Erastus Brainerd.<BR>

<h2>Clinton should skip GOP, Arkansans and diversity</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>Administration officials are departing their jobs so rapidly since the election that you'd think the Republicans had won. 

Stepping down so far are the White House chief of staff and secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Energy and Transportation, plus the heads of the president's Council of Economic Advisers and the civil rights division in the Justice Department, to name only the most prominent. 
<dd>Second terms always produce turnover, often because the president wants it, but this mad rush for the door barely two weeks after the president won re-election is a bit unseemly. 
<dd>Whether motivated by fear that the administration will be bogged down in Whitewater and related investigations over the next couple of years or hamstrung in directing policy by the Republican Congress, the Clinton team started to bolt as soon as the ballots were counted. 
<dd>Now the president must spend the next few months trying to reassemble his players. 
<dd>Here are some tips for the president as he makes his picks: 
<ul>
<li>Forget bipartisanship. President Clinton has already announced he'd like to appoint a Republican to his Cabinet, but it's a bad idea for the president and any Republican who might be chosen.<p>Giving a post to a Republican would only further alienate congressional Democrats, and unless the president is thinking of switching parties himself, he'll need to hold his Democratic votes in the next Congress.<p>Besides, the public isn't really fooled when a president of one party picks political appointees of the other. Look at Ronald Reagan's most famous Democratic appointees: U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Education Secretary William Bennett.<p>Neither remained in the Democratic Party, and Kirkpatrick became most famous in political circles for referring to Democrats as the "blame-America-first" crowd. (I lasted almost two years as a Reagan Democrat while director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights but switched parties when I moved to the White House.)<p>
<li>Stop bean-counting. The president's obsession in 1993 with choosing a Cabinet that "looks like America" produced a series of embarrassing nominations that he had to abandon. Nonetheless, he's likely to repeat his mistakes if he listens to groups representing women and blacks, who have already been whining that the announced departures will leave the administration less diverse.<p>A coalition of women's organizations complained to Vice President Gore last week that although women gave the Clinton-Gore team a 17-point advantage in their votes, few women were being mentioned for top posts in the next term.<p>They were particularly exercised over remarks attributed to an "unnamed administration source" discounting Clinton U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright as a likely contender for Secretary of State.<p>But Albright probably isn't a good choice for State - and it has nothing to do with her sex. She's been a chief proponent of making U.N. peacekeeping/ peacemaking operations a priority for the Pentagon, as well as of expanding our efforts to include nation-building in places like Somalia and Haiti. With U.S. troops staying in Bosnia for at least another 18 months to promote more political stability, despite Clinton's original promises to have them out before the end of this year, the president would be well advised to avoid promoting to a senior foreign policy post someone who will focus attention on the mission creep in Bosnia. <p>
<li>Avoid naming anyone from Arkansas. Some of the president's most disastrous choices in his first term were political cronies and friends from Arkansas. Several of these left the administration in disgrace, including Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell (now serving time in federal prison for bilking clients) and William Kennedy. 
</ul>
<p>
The president can't afford any more scrutiny of his past dealings and relationships in Arkansas. He already has to worry about the likelihood of more indictments being handed down by the independent counsel investigating Whitewater, the pending Supreme Court hearing on Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit from his time as Arkansas governor, and new investigations into his Arkansas buddy John Huang, whose fund-raising efforts for the president may result in the appointment of yet another independent counsel. 
<dd>Good luck, Mr. President. You'll need it. So may the fools who rush into an administration where angels fear to tread.

<h2>Editors, reporters should disclose votes</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>BETHESDA, Md. - Whether Tuesday's election results make you mad or glad, there's one thing that should make you worry. 
<dd>One small but immensely powerful group of Americans influenced this election more than all the contributors to all political parties and candidates combined, but they don't have to disclose their influence or make public their political preferences. 
<dd>They are the linchpin of every election, the very source of nearly all the public's information. 
<dd>They are the newspaper, magazine, TV and radio reporters, editors and producers who bring you "the news." They are also arguably the most politically homogenous and biased group in American politics today. 
<dd>If past behavior is any indication, 9 out of 10 reporters and editors probably cast their votes for Bill Clinton and other Democratic candidates Tuesday. 
<dd>At least that's what most studies of voting behavior among the national media suggest, including one by the Freedom Forum last year that showed 89% of national correspondents, editors and writers voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. 
<dd>But voting bias doesn't necessarily prove reporting bias. It's at least theoretically possible that liberal reporters and editors were scrupulous in preventing their own personal bias from affecting their coverage of political issues and candidates during the election. 
<dd>Unfortunately, recent content analysis of TV news coverage indicates otherwise. 
<dd>A study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan Washington research group, shows that TV coverage overwhelmingly favored President Clinton this election season. 
<dd>In September, Clinton received 54% positive coverage on the networks' evening news programs, compared with only 30% for Bob Dole. 
<dd>The networks criticized Dole's economic views 81% of the time, his social policies 78%, and his conduct as a candidate 81%, according to the center. 
<dd>Ironically, Clinton's worst press in the early fall came when he signed the overwhelmingly popular welfare-reform bill, which the newscasts criticized in 90% of their stories, demonstrating that the media's liberal slant is even worse than their partisan prejudice. 
<dd>Perhaps that is one reason why, although voters think of the media as more liberal than conservative, they don't think the media are partisan Democrats. 
<dd>Can anything be done to curb such bias? 
<dd>Why not insist on full disclosure of the media's voting behavior? 
<dd>The public has a right to know how reporters, editors and others in positions to influence coverage actually vote, just as they already have the right to know who owns media outlets. 
<dd>It's possible to protect reporters' privacy while still informing the public by gathering the information and publishing it anonymously, much the way all survey data are reported. 
<dd>It could work like this: After each election, news organizations would voluntarily distribute surveys to their own staff asking them to identify their party affiliation and if and how they voted in the election. (Measures to protect individual privacy would be necessary, much as they are in mail-ballot elections.) The information then would be published or aired, allowing the public to make up its own mind about whether journalists' views may have influenced their coverage. 
<dd>Some voters might even clip and save the information, the better to judge the media's coverage during subsequent elections. 
<dd>Of course, some journalists would choose not to reveal party affiliation or voter preference, but that, too, could be measured and reported along with the overall results. Readers and viewers would be left to conclude for themselves why some news media staff did not want their political views known. 
<dd>I suspect some editors and producers might even be embarrassed by the political imbalance on their own staffs. A few might even try harder for more balanced coverage as a result. 
<dd>Who knows, a handful of editors and producers might be inspired to hire a conservative or two other than as commentators, the role to which most conservatives are now consigned. 
<dd>Is it really too much to expect members of the press to live up to the same standards of full disclosure they insist on for everyone else? 
<dd>Disclosure wouldn't necessarily eliminate media bias, but at least it would expose it so the public could be more discerning news consumers.

<h2>The clueless voter ought to stay home</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Next week's election is predicted to have one
of the lowest voter turnouts in modern history, which is good news for democracy in America. Oh,
I know it's my civic duty to bemoan voter apathy and urge everyone to vote. But many nonvoters
don't know or care enough about the democratic process to cast intelligent - that is, informed
- votes. Sadly, even some actual voters probably don't know enough about
the candidates or issues to be casting their votes astutely, either. And uninformed voters going
to the polls is even more dangerous than apathetic nonvoters staying home. 
<p>
Who are these uninformed Americans? Nearly half of all adults
can't answer basic questions about U.S. government, much less specifics about issues and officeholders
or candidates, according to a recent study conducted for The Washington Post by Harvard University
and the Kaiser Foundation. The survey, taken about a year ago, found that 40%
of adults couldn't name the vice president, and almost half failed to identify the speaker of the
House. I suspect fewer Americans would flunk these basic questions at the height of a national
election, but ignorance about government itself and policy issues no doubt is just as high.
<p>
For example, nearly half of those surveyed didn't know the U.S. Supreme Court can decide whether
a law is constitutional, and nearly 60% believe that the government spends more on foreign aid than
on Medicare. Although foreign aid is less than 2% of the budget, most Americans believe it accounts
for fully one-quarter of all federal spending. According to the survey, Republicans are better informed than
Democrats, but no group is exempt from ignorance. Traveling around the country, I've certainly encountered
my share of clueless citizens, including one likely Dole voter who probably shouldn't
be voting at all. Although the woman was pleasant, hard working and college educated, she literally
had no idea why she was voting. She told me she really &quot;liked&quot; President Bush and had voted
for him in '92, but she didn't have much of an opinion about either Bob Dole or Bill Clinton. She didn't seem
to know about Dole's tax proposals or where Clinton stood on anything. &quot;I'll probably
vote for Dole because Clinton beat Bush. And I really liked George Bush,&quot; she gushed. 
I've heard other would-be voters say they support Clinton because they like his looks, or the way he
hugs Chelsea, or because it's his generation's turn to govern.
<p>
And they are quite serious. Women seem more disposed to such nonsense than men in my own informal
surveys. And the Harvard/Kaiser study confirms that women - including college-educated
young women - know less about politics than men, but they are more likely to vote. Is
it really healthy for a democracy to encourage poorly informed persons to vote? I don't think so, but
mine seems to be a minority opinion - or at least so impolitic a view that few in public life
are willing to own up to it. Everywhere the next few days we will see and hear indiscriminate
pleas from politicians, the media and civic groups to &quot;get out and vote.&quot; These high-minded
folks would do a greater service by insisting that citizens not vote unless they learn something about
the issues. Democracy entails more than a willing electorate.
<p>
Those who do vote have a responsibility to understand the political process and know something about the issues and candidates before they enter the polling booth. Those who can't be bothered to educate themselves jeopardize democracy with
their ignorance. All of us would be better off if the ill-informed stayed home on Election Day.

<h2>Belgian outrage, our silence</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - What would happen in this country if the next
time a child were starved to death or raped or murdered, we decided we weren't ever again going
to allow such a thing to occur without punishing every person who bore some responsibility? 
What if we were to stop working and take to the streets the next time a repeat offender snuffed out
some innocent life? What if hundreds of us were to descend on our local police stations, thousands
of us were to surround our courthouses, hundreds of thousands of us to march to our state capitols
demanding justice? It's hard to imagine, I know. But no harder than envisioning what's happened in
Belgium the past two weeks. 
<P>
In a population less than 5% our own, hundreds of thousands have
filled the streets of cities throughout the country to protest the handling of an investigation
into a child pornography ring that kidnapped, tortured and murdered young Belgian girls. 
In Liege, local firefighters turned their hoses on the courthouse when the Belgian Supreme Court removed the chief investigative magistrate in the case because he attended a dinner for the victims' families. 
Unions staged wildcat strikes throughout the tiny nation. Students occupied the Palace of Justice in Brussels, unfurling signs reading &quot;Justice for Sale.&quot; Even 2,000 rough-looking bikers blocked traffic with their motorcycles, demanding a reinstatement of the death penalty.  And this weekend, 300,000 Belgians gathered in peaceful protest of a justice system gone terribly wrong.  
<p>
What happened in Belgium to spark this massive civil disobedience was the murder of four young girls, two of whom were barely 8 years old, and the disappearance of at least seven more children. 
The man charged with the murders, Marc Dutroux, is a convicted child rapist who served only half
his previous 13-year sentence. He was let go in 1992 when prison social workers and psychiatrists
determined he was no longer a danger. Within one year, little girls started disappearing. Even Dutroux's own mother twice tried to turn him into the police, but he was not arrested until August when police rescued two young women who were being held in his cellar. Now, a dozen others have been arrested for their involvement in the child pornography ring, suspected of videotaping the girls' sexual abuse and torture. 
<p>
These revelations have been enough to bring Belgium to a standstill.
But can we Americans imagine any crime so heinous that we would respond similarly, with genuine
moral indignation at the failure of the U.S. justice system to punish criminals and protect the innocent?
Each year it seems some sadistic lunatic out on parole slaughters a child somewhere in
the United States. 
<p>
The list of recent atrocities is long; still, a few stand out: Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old
kidnapped, raped and murdered by an already convicted rapist. A 6-year-old boy in Washington
state kidnapped, sodomized and sexually mutilated by another demon let loose days earlier. Seven-year-old
Megan Kanka murdered by a convicted child molester who lived on her street. 
<p>
We have become inured to the kinds of horrors that have rallied
the Belgians. But who is to say whether we might put an end to such outrages here if we were to
follow the Belgians' example? Belgium's King Albert II said in a rare public speech last week
that the tragedy of the young girls' murders &quot;must become an occasion for moral renewal and for
profound change in the country.&quot; If only we would do the same. Yet we sit passively by as each new abomination unfolds. In New York, one child is starved, another beaten to death - both by their own mothers' hands. Social workers, obliged to visit these welfare mothers once a year, had failed in their duty, and twice
in barely one year babies died. Still others are murdered by their mothers' boyfriends, sometimes after years of sexual and physical abuse. 
<p>
The best we can muster by way of national examination is a Nightline episode. Most of the
time it's just an afternoon talk show.  
<p>
If tiny Belgium can turn out 300,000 people to mourn the deaths
of a dozen innocent children, why aren't there an equivalent 6 million Americans who would do the
same for the hundreds of children who die in similar circumstances here?

   BETHESDA, Md. -- A year ago, it looked like affirmative action
would be the hot topic of the '96 campaign. Today the issue has
disappeared from the radar screen, except in California where
voters will decide whether to ban state-sponsored preferences
in a ballot initiative known as Proposition 209. The pro-quota
side is nervous enough about the outcome to be running one of
the most dishonest campaigns in recent history, employing a bag
of dirty tricks more suited to an old Soviet KGB disinformation
operation than a democratic election.

<p>
In the most recent outrage, the anti-209 forces invited Klansman
David Duke to argue for the measure in a public debate today at
California State University in Northridge. The organizers said
they couldn't find anyone else to take the pro-209 position. The
real story is that once organizers had secured Duke's participation,
no reputable person would appear with him.
<p>
   Inviting Duke was a clever ploy meant to intimidate Proposition
209 supporters. Debate organizers want voters to believe anyone
who opposes race-based preferences must be a KKK sympathizer.
That's a lie, and they know it.
<p>
   But lies appear to be the stock in trade of the anti-209 campaign.
On Friday someone sent a fake "letter of appreciation" supposedly
from Duke to Ward Connerly, a businessman who chairs the group
that put Proposition 209 on the ballot. The letter thanks Connerly
for his "financial contribution" to Duke's losing Senate race
(he came in fifth in Saturday's primary in Louisiana). No doubt
the creeps who forged the phony Duke letter thought it was particularly
clever to send it to Connerly, who is black. Of course Connerly,
who abhors everything Duke stands for, has never made any political
contribution to Duke. In fact, the real money going to Duke comes
from Cal State Northridge, which is paying him $ 4,000 to participate
in today's debate.
<p>
   Another highlight of the anti-209 campaign is a graphic appearing
in fliers and some publications showing a burning cross with the
caption "Unidentified CCRI supporters celebrate the recent advances
in their struggle for civil rights."
<p>
   Why are the anti-209 groups using such dirty tactics? Because
they are desperate to deflect attention from the real issue of
preferences, which are overwhelmingly unpopular. Most polls show
more than two-thirds of Americans oppose racial quotas, set-asides
and preferences. Even with the nasty and well-funded campaign
against Proposition 209, the measure still holds a 17-point lead
among likely California voters.
<P>
   It's no wonder Proposition 209 remains popular. The measure bans
both discrimination and preferences on the basis of race, sex
or national origin in state employment, education and contracting.
What could be more fair?
<p>
It's too bad Republicans abandoned efforts to make race and gender
preferences a campaign issue nationwide. Barely more than a year
ago, Bob Dole was leading the fight to ban preferences in federal
programs, and even President Clinton was promising to "mend"
affirmative action. But Republicans got cold feet and have since
dropped their legislative efforts to ban preferences. And Clinton
has actually extended affirmative action programs, not "mended"
them as he pledged.
<P>
But perhaps politicians' reticence to take on preferences is understandable, 
given the tenor of the debate in California.
<p>
It's more difficult to intimidate millions of voters, however.
I'm betting that when Californians go to the polls Nov. 5, they
will remember the David Duke incident. We'll see then why such
chicanery rarely pays off in an election.<P><P>

<h2>Where's our moral outrage?

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - The Spanish have a phrase for it: sin verguenza. It means without shame, and
it's no compliment. It could become the motto of our age, exemplified most recently by Dick Morris,
the president's strategist who resigned after a tabloid published pictures of him at a hotel with a
prostitute. <P>

Instead of retreating from the media spotlight when his antics with a $200-an-hour call girl became
public, Morris is actually looking for new ways to expose himself. And he's snared a breathless
media eager to help. Time magazine has already turned over its cover (for the second week in a
row) to a shameless Morris, pictured with his betrayed wife hovering grim-faced behind him. Inside,
Morris exploits the opportunity to take credit for Bill Clinton's political comeback. And Random
House has given Morris a $2.5 million book deal for more of the same. 
<P>
Expect no apology from Dick Morris. But then, why should he bother? Not even his wife seems to
expect one. After the story broke, the president called Morris to commiserate with his friend and
image maker, as did Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. A little moral outrage would have been more
appropriate - if not for Morris' indecent conduct, then for jeopardizing the Clinton campaign by
entertaining a prostitute in a hotel room paid for by campaign funds. 
<P>
But moral outrage is unfashionable today, reserved only for those who commit the last universally
recognized sin in our culture: hypocrisy. And Morris is no hypocrite, which requires at least a
semblance of adherence to some moral or ethical code. The lesson is you can get away with
anything, becoming richer and more famous in the process, so long as you are completely amoral to
begin with. 
<P>
It wasn't always so. There was a time when anyone in Morris' position would have been deeply
mortified at being caught in such a sordid liaison. And even if the miscreant felt no inward remorse,
he would still have been shunned by his peers. 
<P>
No such punishment awaits Morris, whose hubris reflects more than his own arrogance. As a
society, we've become inured to shame. Nothing shocks us. Millions tune in to an endless parade of
vice and weirdness on daytime television. The more salacious the details, the greater the celebrity.
We glorify violence in music and films. We idolize foul-mouthed entertainers and transvestite sports
figures. We re-elect public officials caught smoking crack cocaine and seducing boys. 
<P>
Is it any wonder so many social institutions are disintegrating and our streets are unsafe? Without a
sense of what is shameful in our own lives and others', we deny ourselves the capacity to make
social judgments. Deviancy has no meaning unless we can measure behavior against some common
standard. 
<P>
A few years ago, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote a brilliant essay in The Public
Interest which described the social deterioration occurring, from rising out-of-wedlock births to
skyrocketing crime. Much of the problem stemmed, he said, from a phenomenon he dubbed
"defining deviancy down." In other words, so lowering our standards about what is proper that what
once would have been considered deviant behavior has become merely individual choice. 
<P>
In fact, the situation is worse than Moynihan described. We've not only done away with concepts of
right and wrong, but we've also begun to heap huge rewards on those whose actions would once
have made them pariahs. Why should Dick Morris be ashamed of himself when so many of us are
eager to shower him with fame and fortune?<P><P>

<title>Linda Chavez: Promises Don't Help Kids Read -- September 5, 1996</title>
</head>

<h2>Promises Don't Help Kids Read</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Four years ago when running for president the first 
time, Bill Clinton promised to overhaul the nation's education system 
from kindergarten through 12th grade in his campaign manifesto, 
Putting People First. Given his disastrous attempt at overhauling the 
country's health-care system, perhaps we can be thankful he didn't 
manage to come up with an education plan once he assumed office. But 
it's re-election time, and once again candidate Clinton is an 
education reformer. <p>

Last week, the president promised an assault on illiteracy, pledging 
$1.75 billion for new programs to ensure that every American child can 
read by third grade. Sounds great, but aren't public schools supposed 
to teach kids to read already? The United States spends more on public 
education than almost any other nation - more than $240 billion a year 
for elementary and secondary schools in 1994. That's $5,300 per 
student. If schools have failed to teach kids how to read by third 
grade, how will adding less than 1% more money solve the problem? <p>

By the president's own admission, 40% of fourth-grade students fail to 
meet basic reading standards. And money isn't the problem. In 1980, 
the U.S. was spending less than $3,900 per student. Yet the reading 
proficiency of average 9-year-olds was actually higher than it is now, 
according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. <p>

What happened? Bob Dole blames the teachers unions, and they certainly 
share a good deal of blame. The 2.2 million-member National Education 
Association has supported every education fad that has come down the 
pike, so long as it was sufficiently multicultural and politically 
correct. The much smaller American Federation of Teachers, with only 
about 900,000 members, has a far better record on education issues, 
and its president, Albert Shanker, has been a thoughtful exponent of 
education reform. <p>

Nonetheless, both the NEA and the AFT have become well-financed 
political lobbies for liberal causes. The NEA alone raised $6.5 
million in 1992 and spent $2.3 million on congressional candidates, 
almost all Democrats. The only thing that really matters to the 
teachers unions is whether candidates support increased spending on 
education. <p>

Much of that money doesn't even go to teachers' salaries, much less 
directly into the classroom. American public education has become a 
giant, bloated bureaucracy, with school systems top-heavy with 
administrative staff who never set foot in a classroom. <p>

By contrast, Catholic schools, which educate 2.6 million students a 
year, produce better results with a fraction of the money. Catholic 
schools spend about $2,800 per pupil, around half what public schools 
do, but Catholic students outperform their public school peers, 
especially in comparisons between poor minority students from both 
groups. <p>

If Clinton were really interested in improving reading levels of 
America's poor children, he'd give them the same opportunity he gives 
his own: the chance to go to the school of her choice, in Chelsea's 
case the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. The 
Clintons can afford Sidwell Friends' pricey tuition, but most middle-
class, much less poor, parents can't pay private-school tuition and 
pay taxes for public school, too. <p>

During the last election, Peter Brimelow reported in Forbes, candidate 
Clinton told the NEA, "If I become president, you'll be my partners. I 
won't forget who brought me to the White House." That's one promise 
President Clinton has kept, but it won't help kids learn how to read. <p>

<title>Linda Chavez: Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces -- August 28, 1996</title>

<h2>Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>

BETHESDA, Md. - The Democrats are using the "e-word" a lot this week, 
trying to paint Bob Dole and the Republican Congress as extremists. 
But a close look at the Democrats' platform and the delegates 
themselves suggests it's the Democratic Party that represents some 
political extremes. From a balanced-budget amendment to welfare 
reform, the Democrats in Chicago are out of step with the American 
public. <p>

According to a Washington Post/ABC poll, 82% of registered voters 
favor a balanced-budget amendment, but only 32% of Democratic 
delegates agree. Perhaps that's why the Democratic platform is silent 
on the issue. After all, it might be embarrassing to mention a measure 
that 162 Democrats in Congress voted against in 1995, dooming the 
amendment in the 104th Congress. <p>

The survey also showed that 82% of Democratic delegates favor 
affirmative action programs that give preferences to minorities and 
women. But most other Americans oppose race or gender preferences. The 
Washington Post/ABC poll showed registered voters as a whole oppose 
race and gender preferences by a margin of 52% to 45%, but polls of 
the general public show even greater opposition. A 1995 poll by the 
Los Angeles Times showed 73% of Americans favor legislation to outlaw 
preferential hiring by race or sex. <p>

But it's not surprising the Democratic delegates favor preferences and 
quotas, since they were chosen under party rules that set strict 
racial and gender quotas. Each state delegation must reflect the 
racial and ethnic breakdown of Democratic voters in the last election 
and include equal numbers of men and women. <p>

President Clinton just signed the Republican welfare-reform bill last 
week, but his own delegates don't think much of "ending welfare as we 
know it." The Washington Post/ABC poll shows only 38% of delegates 
support a five-year limit on welfare benefits, something 73% of all 
registered voters favor. The Democratic platform doesn't mention 
specific time limits, except to say who should be exempted from them. <p>

Speaking of exemptions, apparently the Clinton administration has a 
lot of welfare-reform exemptions up its sleeve if Clinton is re-
elected. Vice President Gore suggested Sunday on This Week with David 
Brinkley that the president doesn't really intend to implement the 
bill he just signed. Gore said the president will use whatever means 
available - including the line-item veto - to excise parts of the 
welfare-reform bill he doesn't like. So much for democratic process. <p>

Even on abortion, an issue that seems to plague Republicans every four 
years, the Democrats are hardly in the mainstream of public opinion - 
though you won't hear the media talk much about it this week. Democrat 
delegates are overwhelmingly pro-choice, and the party platform spells 
out an unrestricted "right of every woman to choose, consistent with 
Roe vs. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay." <p>

But Americans favor a much more limited right to choose abortion than 
the Democrats' position. Most Americans favor some legal restrictions 
on abortion: 74% favor mandatory 24-hour waiting periods, and 74% 
support parental consent and 70% spousal notification laws. Although 
the president recently vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth abortions 
except to save a mother's life, 71% of Americans oppose the procedure, 
which involves partially delivering a 20- to 26-week fetus feet first 
and inserting a surgical scissors into the skull to remove the brain. 
One of the most comprehensive surveys of American opinion on abortion 
and moral beliefs, done by the Gallup organization in 1991, showed 
that 73% of Americans support a prohibition of abortion after the 
first three months of pregnancy for any reason except to save the life 
of the mother. And more than 80% oppose government funding of 
abortion. <p>

The Democrats will continue to try to paint themselves as moderates 
and the Republicans as extremists through the election. They think if 
they say it often enough, maybe the country will believe them. I'm 
betting Americans are a lot smarter than that.<p>

<title>Linda Chavez: Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice -- August 21, 1996</title>

<h2>Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>


BETHESDA, Md. - Despite his quirkiness, Ross Perot has done some 
pretty impressive things in his lifetime, not the least winning nearly 
20 million votes in the 1992 presidential election. But if he persists 
in his quixotic quest for the White House this year, he may well be 
remembered only as the man responsible for twice electing Bill Clinton 
president. <p>

Polls suggest Perot won't garner nearly as many votes this time 
around. But if Perot pulls even 2% or 3% of the vote, his role could 
be decisive in a close election, as this one promises to be. White 
House aides claim they believe Perot hurts President Clinton as much 
as he does Bob Dole. (And if you believe that one, they have some land 
parcels on the Whitewater River they'd like to sell you.) <p>

In fact, Perot draws his support mostly from independent and 
Republican voters. In 1992, Perot won only 13% of Democrats' votes but 
30% of independents' and 17% of Republicans' votes. And 20% of his 
1992 voters had voted for George Bush in 1988. Maybe it's time Ross 
Perot - and his remaining supporters - rethink what they want to 
accomplish in 1996. <p>

Here are a few questions they should ask themselves. <p>

Do you really want to balance the budget? Republicans have already 
proved they can balance the budget - they passed a five-year balanced 
budget last December. But President Clinton vetoed it. And Clinton 
still can't decide when he'll produce a balanced budget. One day it's 
nine years, another day it's seven, and still another he says maybe he 
can do it in five. <p>

Do you believe the country needs to rein in entitlements? The 
Republicans offered genuine entitlement reform last year, but the 
Democrats did their best to nix it. First, Democrats - including the 
president - demagogued Medicare reform, needlessly and recklessly 
trying to scare the elderly. Then the president twice vetoed welfare 
reform despite having promised "to end welfare as we know it." The 
president is expected to sign a Republican-passed welfare-reform bill 
this week, but only because he knows he can't possibly be re-elected 
if he doesn't. <p>

lDo you still care about reforming government? Republicans in the 
104th Congress passed the most sweeping government-reform legislation 
since the civil service reforms 100 years ago. For the first time, 
laws that apply to ordinary citizens and employers now apply to 
members of Congress. The Democrats controlled Congress for more than 
40 years, exempting themselves from all the employment laws they were 
happy to inflict on others. The Republicans quickly ended that 
practice once they gained control of both houses of Congress in 1994. <p>

Which is the real reform party in America? The Democrats have said 
"no" to Medicare reform, Medicaid reform, welfare reform, lawsuit 
reform, and term limits. Meanwhile, the Reform Party can't even get 
its own members to participate in choosing the party's presidential 
nominee. Fewer than 5% cast ballots either in the nominating process 
or in selecting the candidate. Perhaps the Reform Party ought to get 
its own house in order before it tries tackling the whole government. <p>

That leaves one party and one presidential nominee for reform-minded 
voters: Republican Bob Dole. If Ross Perot and his supporters truly 
want change this year, they'll stop playing spoilers. Last time 
around, Perot spent $60 million on his campaign. This time he's not 
even willing to risk his own money, asking his supporters to pony up 
so he can receive $30 million in federal campaign funds instead. <p>

Re-electing Bill Clinton won't change politics as usual, won't end 
gridlock, won't make government work more efficiently - all reasons 
Perot says he's running. But the numbers just aren't there. Perot 
can't win, and surely even he knows it this time. It's hard to believe 
Perot wants his legacy to be a second term for Bill Clinton. But if he 
insists on staying in the race until November, he may succeed in 
ensuring just that.<p>

GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"

<p>
SAN DIEGO - Here's a political quiz: Which political party has 
suffered from a "gender gap" in voting during the last several 
presidential elections? If you answered "the Republicans," you get an 
"A" for reading the newspapers and watching the evening news -- but 
you flunk the test.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, in three out of the last four elections, it has been the 
Democrats who have actually been hurt by the gender gap. Democrats 
lost those elections because they did so poorly among male voters. In 
1984, Democrat Walter Mondale trailed Republican President Ronald 
Reagan by 25 points among men. And in 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis 
got 16% fewer male votes than Republican George Bush. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Their losses had little to do with female voters. But the media have 
been relatively uninterested over the years in why men are less likely 
to vote Democratic, while they've been obsessed with the supposed GOP 
gender gap among women.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year is no different. Expect to read countless stories and hear 
endless explanations this election season why Bob Dole can't win 
women's votes. And most of it will be hogwash -- or wishful thinking 
on the part of reporters and pundits, most of whom w ill probably be 
voting Democratic themselves in November. (In 1992, 89% of Washington-
based reporters and editors voted for Bill Clinton, according to a 
poll by the Freedom Forum, a media think tank.)
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the favorite explanations of why women won't vote Republican 
this year is the party's position on abortion. The Republican Party's 
strong anti-abortion stance is supposed to be a huge barrier to 
winning women's votes. But, in fact, polls show that  abortion has 
little to do with how women cast their votes.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll showed only 1 in 5 female voters 
say the candidate they support must share exactly their own position 
on abortion. And of these women, slightly more than half are actually 
pro-life, so at best it's a wash. Abortion ranke d 10th out of the top 
12 most important issues to women in this poll, and about one-third 
said abortion was not at all important in determining how they would 
vote.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like men, women care most about the economy when it comes time to pick 
a president. Which is good news for Bob Dole. He has certainly shown 
this past week that he intends to make the economy his No. 1 issue -- 
first with his tax-cut proposal and then with  his selection of Jack 
Kemp to be his running mate.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both actions should have real appeal for female voters. Kemp's brand 
of compassionate conservatism and his exuberant political style will 
resonate with women who may be turned off by doom-and-gloom talk of 
budget deficits and harsh rhetoric about slashing government spending.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most importantly, Dole's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, 
coupled with an extra $500 tax deduction for each child under 18, will 
mean real savings to families. Many middle-income voters with young 
children would see their federal income-tax bill red uced by half if 
Dole has his way. Most opinion polls show that working mothers would 
prefer to work fewer hours outside the home. Allowing families to keep 
more of their earnings could give many mothers the option to work less 
or to use their tax savings  to buy a home, put toward their 
children's college education, or save for their own retirement. Dole 
is proposing real choice for women -- the choice to determine their 
own economic futures. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the Democrats who want to limit women's choices. The Democrats 
would rather let government decide how to spend working women's money 
than allow women to choose how to spend it themselves.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time Americans got a tax break -- when President Reagan twice 
reduced tax rates, in 1981 and 1986 -- the economy boomed. Growth 
averaged about 4% a year during Reagan's tenure, resulting in the 
longest period of economic expansion since World War  II. What's more, 
women's earnings grew faster during the 1980s than at any time in 
recent history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't expect the media to remind voters of these economic facts 
between now and Election Day. They'll be too busy reporting the so-
called GOP gender gap.

<h2>
We're Becoming A Nation Of Crybabies
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- Working for the federal government, which has never 
been a barrel of laughs, is about to get even less humorous. Last 
month, a Social Security Administration official told a sexist joke at 
an agency conference, and now charges are flying that the agency is 
riddled with sex discrimination. The only twist in this increasingly 
familiar charge is that the joke-teller was a woman and the butt of 
the joke was men. Now several men at the agency are claiming that a 
"hostile work environment" exists -- code words for sexual harassment 
-- which could signal discrimination complaints, lawsuits and wasted 
taxpayer dollars ahead.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many charges involving sexual harassment, the facts of this 
case aren't in dispute. Ruth Pierce, deputy commissioner for human 
resources and director of equal employment opportunity at the Social 
Security Administration, told the joke to participants in a diversity 
workshop in Miami.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to The Washington Post, which reported the story on its 
front page, the joke involved a mermaid and a fisherman whose wish was 
to become five times smarter. The mermaid granted the fisherman's wish 
by turning him into a woman. Not exactly a knee slapper as jokes go, 
but it elicited enough laughs from the mostly female listeners to send 
audience member John Boyer into quite a snit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer heads an informal group called Government Men for Equality Now 
(GMEN) and alleges the Social Security Administration is dominated by 
women and rife with anti-male prejudice. Now he's hoping to turn 
Pierce's joke into a federal case, demanding that Pierce apologize to 
all 65,000 agency employees and be demoted from her current post.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer's complaint itself might be laughable if the federal government 
weren't such a bastion of the double standard. If Pierce were a man 
telling a predominantly male audience a joke poking fun at women's 
intelligence, the government's political-correctness squad would 
already be on the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar circumstances at a Coast Guard dinner in 1995 led not only to 
months of investigation, but also to enormous human suffering. Capt. 
Ernie Blanchard, a career veteran of the Coast Guard with an 
impeccable record, told a few barely off-color jokes at a dinner 
honoring cadets and became the focus of an official investigation that 
ultimately resulted in an 800-page report. Informed that his career 
was in jeopardy and that he might lose his pension, spelling financial 
ruin for his family, Blanchard killed himself before the investigation 
was complete.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the Coast Guard incident had not ended so tragically with 
Blanchard's death, it would still be a travesty. No government career 
should be extinguished for a one-time lapse in taste before an adult 
audience.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But ever since the courts started interpreting a "hostile work 
environment" to constitute sexual harassment, bad taste has become a 
federal offense. With men so often the targets of such witch hunts, 
it's no surprise a few, like John Boyer, strike back.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the answer to this nonsense is not for more men to claim that 
they, too, are victims of sexual harassment because someone tells a 
meaningless joke. We are becoming a nation of crybabies who can 
respond to others' ridiculous behavior only by engaging in more of the 
same.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the last year for which figures are available, federal 
workers filed nearly 12,000 harassment complaints -- more than in any 
other single category of alleged discrimination.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With warm-up jokes and after-dinner entertainment now fair game for 
such charges, that number will no doubt climb. American taxpayers, who 
foot the bill for such silliness, surely aren't laughing.

<p>
SAPELLO, N.M. -- The night is cool atop Star Hill, east of the Sangre 
de Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. Nearby a herd of longhorn 
cattle and a few scattered buffalo have settled in for the night. 
Earlier in the day, I observed a coyote stalking the cattle from the 
crest of a hill, and a Swainson's hawk perched on the barbed-wire 
fence.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the thrill of seeing these creatures will soon pale as Phil Mahon, 
our host at Star Hill resort, introduces my husband and me to his 
celestial delights.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until now, neither of us has anything but a passing interest in 
astronomy. As lifelong city residents, we rarely enjoy star-studded 
nights apart from an occasional country get-away where we can escape 
both the city lights that obscure the stars from view and the 
preoccupations that cause us not to look. Now, on an impulse we're 
here at this amateur astronomers' retreat, hoping to expand our 
horizons.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mahon, a somewhat taciturn guide, types instructions into a laptop 
computer attached to a 14-inch Compustar telescope, and the machine 
whirs into action, rotating on its pedestal until it comes to rest 
pointed at the Southern sky. Through the lens we see not only Jupiter 
and its red bands, but also four of its 16 moons. For the next hour, 
Mahon treats us to stars, pulsars, nebulae and galaxies, objects as 
close as 21/2 or as distant as 150 million light years away.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly all of the dozen sites we view have been familiar territory to 
astronomers for more than 200 years, since the French astronomer 
Charles Messier (1730-1817) first cataloged 68 celestial objects, 
including our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. Still, the experience is 
awe-inspiring, putting daily obsessions into perspective. For a while 
at least, public policy, the culture wars, the federal deficit and 
politics fade.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not for long. As I look through the telescope, I wonder whether as 
a nation we will continue to explore this vast universe. Even as our 
knowledge increases at almost exponential rates, it seems our national 
desire and will to learn more are on the wane. NASA's budget is $ 14 
billion this year but will drop to a projected $ 11 billion by 2000.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1990s have seen dramatic swings in our space commitments. The 
decade was ushered in with great fanfare in 1991 with the announcement 
of Project Columbus, a $ 100 million joint venture between NASA and a 
private astronomy institute to search for intelligent life in the 
universe. One year later, the Senate canceled funding with derisive 
comments about little green men.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, funding for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or 
SETI as it is known, has been fickle throughout the history of the 
program. Since 1960, SETI has involved some 50 separate programs, 
initially with federal backing but more recently privately funded.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year, interest is up again with the discovery in January by 
astronomers Paul Butler and Geoffrey Marcy of the first two planets 
outside our solar system. Announced earlier this year, NASA's new 
Origins project will build powerful new telescopes over the next 30 
years capable of actually seeing planets such as those discovered by 
Butler and Marcy. They could only infer the planets' existence from 
complex measurements of light emissions of the stars 47 Ursae and 70 
Virginis, around which the planets orbit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least that's NASA's hope, if the project receives full federal 
backing. It's a big if. With so many earthly demands on the federal 
budget, the exploration of our universe sometimes seems a luxury we 
can't afford.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This starry night, from my vantage point in New Mexico's hills, the 
investment is worth it.

<h2>
New Citizens Getting Off Too Easily
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- This July Fourth, 1.2 million more new citizens will 
be celebrating Independence Day than last year. Naturalization was way 
up in 1995, more than double the 1994 rate and five times the rate 
experienced throughout the 1980s.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As an unabashed admirer of immigrants' initiative and grit, I'd 
normally welcome this surge in new citizenship. But unfortunately, 
politics -- not patriotism -- may explain this sudden spurt in 
naturalization. The Clinton administration has been quietly moving to 
water down citizenship requirements in ways that could ultimately 
damage the Americanization process.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many nations that jealously guard access to citizenship, the 
United States makes it relatively easy. Permanent residents must wait 
five years before they apply for naturalization. By law, they must 
demonstrate they can speak, read and write simple words and phrases in 
English and that they know basics about American history and 
government. They must also be law-abiding and of good character.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the modest commitments are hardly onerous, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service is considering exempting whole classes of 
immigrants from them. Among the proposals the INS is reportedly 
weighing is one to exempt immigrants who've completed high school in 
the U.S. from being tested on American history and government or from 
having to demonstrate knowledge of English.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, a high school degree today is no guarantee that a 
student knows much U.S. history or government. It isn't even an 
assurance that a student knows English. Foreign-born high school 
students in New York, for example, can take state graduation exams in 
their native language if they entered American public school after 
eighth grade. And many public school systems across the country seem 
more concerned about preserving immigrants' native language and 
culture than about helping them learn English or American history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's behind the administration's efforts to weaken naturalization 
requirements? Some critics suspect politics. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., 
has pointedly asked INS Commissioner Doris Meissner whether the 
administration is trying to increase the number of potential 
Democratic voters before the November presidential election.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But partisan politics isn't the most serious concern. The real threat 
is weakening national identity. As John J. Miller points out in a 
recent article in Policy Review, "Naturalization is the only legal 
instrument that allows the United States -- a 'nation of immigrants' -
- to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the 
cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers understood the potential for mischief if 
citizenship were obtained too easily, Miller notes. Alexander Hamilton 
urged that immigrants be drawn gradually into American civil society 
"to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American 
attachments." Indeed, the oath of citizenship pledges the naturalized 
citizen to "renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any 
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty" and to "support and 
defend the Constitution and the laws o
f the United States of America."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Miller suggests what's needed now is a modern-day Americanization 
Movement. During the last great wave of immigration, from 1900 to 
1924, both public schools and private philanthropic organizations, 
such as Jane Addams' famous settlement houses, helped acculturate 
millions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This commitment is sorely lacking today. Immigrant advocacy groups 
focus almost exclusively on immigrant rights, with little attention to 
immigrant responsibilities. If America is to continue to be an 
immigrant nation, there must be a covenant between America and its 
newcomers. Learning the national language and the nation's history and 
form of government are the least we should require from those who wish 
to become Americans.

FBI Files: Look What I Found in Mine

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Wonder what all the fuss over the Clinton White House 
requisitioning FBI files on former Republican officials is about? As 
someone who has seen my own FBI file, I can tell you there's plenty of 
cause for alarm. FBI files contain not only private and sometimes 
embarrassing information, but also some things that are downright 
false.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1983, President Reagan appointed me staff director of the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, a post that required what's called a full-
field investigation in preparation for Senate confirmation. The 
investigation took many weeks to complete and included interviews with 
my employers, colleagues, friends, neighbors, schoolmates and 
virtually anyone else who might have known me over the years. Most of 
the information the FBI obtained was innocuous and accurate. But not 
everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Years later, when I obtained my file through a Freedom of Information 
request, I was surprised to learn the document contained not only an 
occasional unflattering description but also outright misinformation 
about me and my family. In one case, a former neighbor said she 
couldn't say whether I might be a national security risk, an answer 
bound to provoke greater scrutiny. The FBI had no way of knowing I had 
reported this woman for leaving her young child locked out of the 
house alone and unfed until 1 a.m., which no doubt accounted for her 
opinion of my trustworthiness.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another interview, a former supervisor claimed to have fired me 
from a Democratic National Committee (DNC) job I held in my early 20s. 
Being fired from the DNC could be considered a badge of honor for a 
Republican nominee, but the charge was untrue. My supervisor, a 
political rival, may have wanted to fire me, but she actually left her 
job slightly before I quit mine.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most outrageous material in my file, however, had nothing to do 
with me.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the name itself was blacked out to protect the person's 
identity, one series of entries contained information that appeared 
from their context to be about my father. I nearly fainted when I read 
the entry, which referred to an arrest for a violent crime. Then I 
noticed the date of arrest was after my father's death, and shock 
turned into anger. Derogatory information about someone who happened 
to share my father's name found its way into my FBI file, violating 
that person's privacy and besmirching my father's reputation.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As far as I know, my file was not among those the Clinton White House 
requested. Nonetheless, I'm outraged to learn that friends, colleagues 
and at least one person who worked for me in the Reagan White House 
are among those whose files were obtained.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton operatives -- no one yet knows exactly how many - procured and 
read at least 408 Republican appointees' files. How many of these 
files had egregious errors in them? How many more had malicious 
gossip? How many simply contained embarrassing private
 information that should remain secret? And what did these Clinton 
appointees do with that information?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton has dismissed this incredible invasion of privacy as 
a "bureaucratic snafu" and has declined to punish the known 
perpetrators. Craig Livingstone, the former director of White House 
security under whose direction the FBI files were obtained, remains on 
the White House payroll. Anthony Marceca, whom Livingstone recruited 
to read the files, is on paid leave from the Pentagon. Marceca may be 
protected from immediate firing by civil service laws -- but 
Livingstone, a presidential appointee, is not. Even Democrats have 
asked Clinton to fire Livingstone, but the president refuses.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such total arrogance of power should give Americans pause.

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Want proof we've abandoned all pretense of a civil 
society? Forget name-calling politicians and rancorous talk radio -- 
take a look inside sports arenas and in the city streets after 
championship games. It's not just boorish megalomaniacs like Bulls 
forward Dennis Rodman turning games into a Roman spectacle. Some fans 
are worse. Chicago police and the National Guard are bracing for 
widespread lawlessness during the Bulls' victory celebration.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And the crowd can be a real factor in the final score. Bulls star 
Michael Jordan acknowledged as much. "We wanted to come out and take 
their crowd out of the game," Jordan told reporters, describing his 
team's aggressive start in Sunday night's game with the Seattle 
Supersonics. By racking up a big lead early, the Bulls hoped to 
depress the Seattle fans' notorious fervor.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not content to cheer their team to victory, fans everywhere shout 
insults, throw things and do their best to distract opposing players. 
During the Sonics' own victory game over the Utah Jazz for the Western 
Conference Finals, Seattle spectators showed just how nasty they could 
be. With seconds left and the Jazz down by three points, power forward 
Karl Malone endured a deafening countdown before he took his foul 
shots. Between the verbal taunts and the sea of undulating white 
balloons, Malone -- who makes 70% of his free throws -- missed both, 
ending any chance for a Jazz win.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those annoying white balloons wielded by fans are deployed to throw 
off a player's aim in the free throw. The balloons wiggle like maggots 
behind the basket. But some fans have gotten even more creative. 
Boosters at Florida Panther hockey games throw rubber rats on the ice 
after their team scores a goal. Detroit Red Wings fans throw 
octopuses. The ice is beginning to look like a bouillabaisse of 
rubbery critters.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the action is more than offensive -- it's downright 
dangerous. Last year, fans pelted the field at Dodger Stadium with so 
many baseballs that the game had to be halted, and the Dodgers 
forfeited a game they were winning.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was a time when sportsmanship was synonymous with gentlemanly 
behavior. Being called "unsportsmanlike" used to be a real insult, and 
unsportsmanlike conduct actually carried penalties on the field and 
off.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
My most vivid memory of a high school game is not of some last-second 
victory but of Sister Jean Patrice, my high school principal, down on 
the basketball court scolding those of us in the stands for booing our 
opponents. "Another outburst like that and we'll forfeit the game," 
she warned -- no idle threat. She was an enthusiastic team supporter 
and a tough competitor, but she believed winning wasn't everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In today's billion-dollar sports business, winning is the only thing. 
If players act like freaks or worse on the court or off, no one seems 
to care. Least of all those in the stands whose own behavior emulates 
their idols'. Fans are supposed to boost the morale of the players, 
not become sideline guerrillas.
<BR>

<h2> 
Get Political, GOP
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Democratic threats have thrown Republicans into a panic. A
plan to add an amendment increasing the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15, has now derailed a second major bill in the Senate. Fifteen
moderate Republicans promptly followed and introduced their own
even higher minimum wage increase bill in the House, leading the
GOP leadership to predict 40 eventual disaffections from their
ranks and passage of a minimum wage bill this year. So far have
things deteriorated in the bastion of the 1994 revolution that the
House will pass a New Deal law that Bill Clinton was afraid even to
introduce before the Republican took control of Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Happened? A cynic might note that the news of the AFL-CIO
ad campaign supporting a minimum wage increase broke just before
the Democrats hit the floor of the Senate with their plan. The fact
that big labor was willing to spend $35 million above its normal
$42 million to target vulnerable Republicans got the attention of
Republicans in districts with high union membership and among the
vulnerable, especially the freshmen. This is about politics, not
economics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, every economist knows that minimum wage laws cost
jobs. It is not necessary to repeat the facts because they are not
at issue. As reported here by Bruce Bartlett, as recently as
January 14, 1987, the New York Times ran an editorial headed, "The
Right Minimum Wage: $0.00."  Two years later they still were
correctly saying minimum wages help middle income families because
most people who get the increase are second or third income
earners, not the poor, and because employers hire fewer low wage
workers when their wage costs go up. Somehow, in a Democratic
Administration, the Times decided it was fine to increase the
minimum wage; but that does not repeal the law of supply and
demand. Fewer jobs will exist at an artificially higher wage, even
if it is only a small number--and even economists with President
Clinton know it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On "This Week With David Brinkley" columnist George Will asked
Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich why, if an increase in the
minimum to $5.15 was good, why not raise it to $10? Reich admitted
$10 would have a "negative effect" but $5.15 would have only a
"negligible effect on jobs." A "negligible effect" is an effect. It
is critical to note that even the minimum wage's number one
supporter admits a higher minimum wage will cost some people their
jobs. Only he does not care. Too bad for them. It's only
politics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why cannot the Republicans learn to play politics? It has been
the constant, sad refrain of this space for a year of bungled
activity, trying to rule from Congress when the President holds the
veto. It is not too late to begin learning. The Democrats are
clearly playing politics on the minimum wage legislation. The
Republicans should accept the challenge and offer an amendment to
increase the minimum wage to $100 per hour. If increasing rates by
law works, why be pikers? Ten dollars is too little. Increase it to
100 an hour and make everyone rich. Get on record supporting a
minimum higher than the Democrats would approve.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If that is too high, how about $66.66 an hour. That would make
all Americans as rich as Congressmen. But that brings up a sore
subject, so $100 is better. At that rate, all workers would be at
a high enough income to be under President Clinton's surtax. That
is the right message. It would also be possible to balance the
Budget if everyone could earn that rate. Of course, they will not
because supply and demand work. But that is the point the GOP
should want to make. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am serious. All Republicans should vote to support "a real
increase in the minimum wage" and let the President and the
Democrats sort it all out (or clean it up in a conference committee
after the point is made). Politics must be played by two or it just
is not fair, nor even interesting. There is nothing wrong with
playing politics in government, certainly not when the other side
is having all of the fun.

<title>Devine: Real  Campaign Reform -- 5/9/96 - ACU
</title>

<h2> 
Real  Campaign Reform
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Common Cause has spent a quarter-century of campaign reform  
zeal on the passion that money is evil; and the job of reform is to  
chase its specter out of politics. Yet, the fruit of their reform  
fetish has been ever greater dominance of campaigns by  
millionaires, business sharpies and union bosses, and ever less  
public confidence in the political process. Still, their only  
answer is, more laws to wipe out filthy lucre.  
  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Finally, someone is saying stop. Curtis Gans of the Committee  
for the Study of the American Electorate has organized 30  
organizations from across the ideological and political spectrum  
under the "unifying principle" that the "approaches that have been  
pushed by Common Cause and Public Citizen are wrong." Finally. From  
the American Conservative Union to the National Women's Political  
Caucus, the AFL-CIO to the National Association of Business  
Political Action Committees, the other side is stirring. Although  
ACU and former liberal senator Gene McCarthy did fight the original  
court test, the field has generally been conceded since the "get  
money out" school prevailed in the Supreme Court.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
A Republican Congressional "reformer" welcomed the debate by  
calling the response "a deceitful campaign to protect their raw  
power and personal profit, garnered in a corrupt system of money."  
The unions and business are hardly altruistic but the inclusion of  
think tanks suggests name-calling will not be enough. The counter  
argument begins with the unfortunate fact that everything costs  
money and, without it, there can be no free speech or right to  
association. The only other goo-goo idea is to have the government  
fund the whole process. Yet--partially as a result of reform--the  
people simply do not trust government to do it.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Because the whole idea of reform was to eliminate the  
corrupting effects of filthy lucre, the Supreme Court reasonably  
ruled that one could not corrupt oneself--so it is an  
unconstitutional limit of speech to limit what a candidate can  
spend on his own election. Voila, we have Ross Perot, Steve Forbes,  
the rise of the multi-millionaire Senate, and even the Michael  
Huffingtons buying House seats with their small change in the  
millions. The one certainty in the uncertain future of Common Cause  
political "reform," is more Richy Rich candidates. After the yacht,  
the airplane, the football club and the young spouse, what else is  
there to do?  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
All the $1,000 individual contribution limit has done is  
replace the sometimes-altruistic, big contributor Henry Salvatori's  
and Stuart Mott's with the always-investing sharpies who bundle  
$1,000 contributions into large batches. As the value of a thousand  
declines from inflation, the number of payers needed multiplies.  
Today, the only people who can round-up big sums are those with  
wide contacts among likeminded self-interested fellow seekers of  
influence. All of the onerous reporting only hides who is the real  
influence peddler among the scores and more of thousand dollar  
givers. Meanwhile, the Congressman is constantly on the phone  
"dialing for dollars" to call the larger number of contributors now  
needed, leaving little time for average citizens or simple  
reflection on issues or even reading about issues.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It took great courage for Speaker Newt Gingrich to question  
the central Common Cause assumption by arguing that we do not spend  
enough on politics--we actually spend less debating than on soap  
advertising. Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman John Doolittle  
have spoken out too. The fact is, if all money comes from the  
government bureaucrats who run it, the lawyers who write the laws,  
the media who sensationalize it and the sharpies who hustle it, the  
people will be frozen out. Not everyone can participate equally,  
but there must be some citizen participation. In the real world,  
that means relying upon the political parties and citizen groups  
that allow people indirect participation and influence.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
David Broder is correct that the Ralph Nader-Common Cause plan  
to limit so-called soft money for party-building and volunteer  
activities would further erode the role of parties to represent  
citizens and control interests. But Broder does not go far enough.  
If political parties are the only means for effective influence,  
they will multiply. In a free society, groups always multiply.  
Either political action groups will proliferate or parties will. As  
political action committees become more hedged by law, it is no  
coincidence that Ross Perot organizes a third party.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Real reform would: (1) eliminate limits on contributions to  
citizen-ideological political action committees (PACs) and extend  
the third-class mailing rates now granted to political parties to  
them, so they can compete in representing citizens within a two-  
party system; (2) end individual or corporate limits on  
contributions to a political party as a limit upon free speech; (3)  
continue the current $5,000 limit on contributions to candidates by  
corporate or union PACs, so they do not dominate the field; (4)  
void the $25,000 yearly total and $1,000 per candidate contribution  
limit for individuals, to allow a Steve Forbes to contribute to a  
Jack Kemp rather than force the rich to run themselves, placing  
others on a more equal footing with the Richys; (5) continue record  
keeping and reporting requirements but, to save average people from  
paperwork, only require reporting of significant amounts; (6), if  
one cannot corrupt oneself, immediately remove all limits and  
restrictions for contributions by spouses, parents, children, and  
first degree blood relatives and in-laws of candidates; (7) index  
for inflation any dollar limits; and, (9) increase the penalty for  
failing to source any unidentified campaign communication (such as  
in so-called push polls defaming opposing candidates).  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It may be pie-in-the-sky to wish for real reform with  
demagogues like Perot and Nader exploiting public anxiety; but it  
should not be an impossible case to make. If Mr. Perot gets rid of  
all other money, he will be the only person who can compete for  
President.

<title>Devine: The Right's Confused by the Left is Dead -- 5/7/96

<h2> 
The Right's Confused But the Left is Dead
</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the media are busting with pleasure that Pat Buchanan is
sundering conservatism, the leading intellectual of the left is
forced to publish a book on progressives titled, "They Only Look
Dead." In fact, he proves they are moribund. Still, a book by the
man who invented the New Democrat and called forth Bill Clinton
obviously is an expert on levitation.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
E.J. Dionne, Jr. of the Washington Post follows his award-
winning <i>Why Americans Hate Politics</i> by shedding his earlier cover
of ideological neutrality to brag that he is a progressive
dedicated to its restoration as the ruling philosophy in the United
States. In the earlier volume, Dionne granted that liberalism had
failed and that conservatives were the ones providing answers.
Traditionalists had answers on value questions and libertarians had
them on economic ones. He even recognized the "fusionist" attempt
to harmonize both, although he ultimately said the contradictions
between the two wings would lead to failure. He proposed a vaguely-
defined New Democrat alternative to liberalism that would fill the
void, and Bill Clinton appeared to claim its mantle.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With the disappearance of the New Democrat, the world has
changed for Dionne. Now he calls the conservative formula that
places liberty as the highest value in the political sphere and
virtue as the highest in the social realm, "ingenious"--making one
wonder whether he understood conservatism as well as it seemed in
the earlier book. In any case, he ignores it and invents a New
Conservatism this time. Both "new's" are misleading. We now
discover that a New Democrat really is an old progressive, both
from Bill Clinton's performance--with constant cheering from Dionne
in the Post--and from the author's present forthrightness. New
Conservatism is more mischievous. It is a caricature. Since the
thesis of his book is that the new progressivism will arise from
opposition to the New Conservatism, it would seem to follow that
the later cannot rise from what does not exist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given Newt Gingrich's present standing in the polls, it should
not surprise that New Conservatism is identified with him. But this
is not a Gingrichism that the Speaker would recognize. It "harks
back not to Ronald Reagan but to the Gilded Age of the 1890's." It
is created by collecting some ideas Gingrich does have about the
future and the communications revolution and transforming them to
his entire philosophy. New Conservatism simply means "accelerating
the economic transition" and embracing the dog-eats-dog social
Darwinism of William Graham Sumner and the Gilded Age.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not only is this an outrageous simplification but it borders
on the dishonest. This is most easily seen in the author's
treatment of Marvin Olasky. He is pictured both as part of the
"ingenious" (but failed) new fusionism and as part of the Gilded
Age because he says 1890's volunteer charity should be the model
for modern reform. Now reflect on that for a moment. A man who
advocates more reliance upon private charity is deemed a social
Darwinist, a philosophy that disapproves of social work because it
helps the less fit to survive--quite a slight-of-hand!
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne even has the gaul to resurrect old Robert McCloskey's
xenophobic simplification of the period as objective proof. He
admits that Gingrich does "bow" to traditional values, institutions
and to Olasky but shrugs it off. He will not make the obvious
conclusion that Gingrich is following the traditional formula, if
in somewhat idiosyncratic terms. Rather, Dionne needs a strawman to
demonstrate that where there is a Gilded Age, there must follow a
Progressive one. After all, that is how it all progressed once
before. So has historical determinism degenerated for the modern
liberal.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The contortion of progressivism is just as bizarre. After
doting on John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Croly and the rest of
the progressive pantheon, he does admit that "Progressivism's
critics have identified critical flaws in Progressive thought that
have haunted the liberal project through to the Great Society and
the present day," especially the problem that its elitist-experts
manipulate central bureaucracies rather than trust ordinary people.
The solution to Dionne is a more reasonable progressive power that
will be more sensitive to the needs of private organizations. Yet,
of his seventeen proposals, only one is not straight old-time
centralized government bureaucracy. Two of Dionne's major proposals
are a national health system and improved pensions. He ignores that
the existing national health programs of Medicare and Medicaid and
the Social Security pension programs are at the center of the
crisis even he must admit now is facing liberalism. After all,
these were the ultimate progressive creations and now they are in
absolute bankruptcy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne admits that conservatives have been correct to
emphasize private mediating institutions like family, church and
associations as superior to expert bureaucrats for many social
tasks. But he still requires that the experts must direct them.
Besides, he says, they do not operate under the "logic" of the
market. But it is Dionne who identifies the market with social
Darwinism, not understanding that the real logic of both business
and private welfare institutions is freedom to operate without too
many restrictions from experts wielding government power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No, the only way to give the private, voluntary organizations
vitality is to get the centralized bureaucracy's experts off their
backs. Send the programs back to the states and the people, which
is the real new and old conservative program. Dionne cannot
resurrect progressivism on these grounds. He contrasts a strawman
conservatism to what progressivism would be if everything worked
perfectly, as if there were no fruits of its ideals. But the show
is over as the progressive programs fall one-by-one, recognized
bankruptcies one and all. Conservatism may have its Buchanan schism
but, if Dionne is the best and the brightest, progressivism not
"only looks dead;" it is.<p><br><p>

<center><h2>Pete Du Pont</h2></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Pete du Pont has served as a state legislator, U.S. Congressman, Governor, and in l988 was a 
Republican candidate for President of the United States.  He writes a weekly column and is a featured 
columnist for CEO Magazine.  He hosts a weekly television program entitled FocusPoint for National 
Empowerment Television (NET) and various broadcast stations.
<p>
	Pete du Pont chairs the Strategic Advisory Committee, which advises Speaker Newt Gingrich on 
key strategic issues, and was appointed to the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, 
known as the Kemp Commission.  du Pont is currently Policy Chairman of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis and Chairman of the National Review Institute, public policy analysis organizations 
promoting free enterprise and conservative governmental policies.   He has served as Chairman of the 
Hudson Institute and was the founder of GOPAC, the Republican political action committee.
<p>
	Pete du Pont began his political career in l968 with his election to the Delaware General 
Assembly.  In l970, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for six years.
<p>
	In l976, Pete du Pont won the race for Delaware Governor against the Democratic incumbent 
and was re-elected in l980 to a second term, winning a record 7l% of the vote.  During his tenure as 
Delaware's Governor, du Pont restored financial integrity to the state government.  Known for his fiscal 
conservatism, he signed into law two income tax reduction measures and a constitutional amendment that 
restrained future tax increases and limited government spending.  He balanced his state budget eight out of 
eight years.
<p>
	Throughout his public policy career, Pete du Pont has addressed a wide range of critical issues 
and has developed a reputation for taking on the toughest challenges and successfully meeting them.  In his 
campaign for the Presidency, his focus upon the central issues facing our country -- drugs, education, 
retirement income, poverty, defense and our relationship with the Soviet Union -- earned him a reputation 
as a man with a long-range vision and the courage to speak the truth about tomorrow.
<p>
	Columnist George Will said about du Pont's l988 campaign:<p>  "du Pont has the highest 
substance-to-blather ratio among candidates, even on subjects as sensitive as agriculture policy and Social 
Security."
<p>
	Upon his withdrawal from the 1988 race, Scripps Howard News Service noted, "More than any 
rival in either party, du Pont had the courage to tell specific interest groups what they least wanted to hear.
<p>
	Rush Limbaugh recently stated Pete du Pont...[is one of the] people who have paved the way 
for me to succeed.<p>

<title>Pete Du Pont--GOP CONVENTION--08/08/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Thursday, August 8, 1996</i><p>


<h2>GOP Convention</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

For the past year, the Republicans have been a fractious lot.  The 
Gingrich conservatives have argued with the liberal Senate 
Republicans.  The presidential primaries were nasty.  Abortion is an 
issue that splits the party into warring factions on a weekly basis.<p>

So it is none too soon that Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole 
has centered his campaign on an issue nearly all Republicans can agree 
on - tax cuts.<p>

Given the continuing debate between the party's supply-siders and 
deficit hawks, that may seem a strange statement.  But who better to 
preside over a tax-cutting administration than Bob Dole, the deficit 
hawk?  <p>

Supply-siders can be pleased with the prospect of new economic growth 
stimulated by the Dole tax cuts.  The deficit hawks can be pleased 
because Dole's own credentials offer them assurance that he will give 
equal attention to curbing government spending.  <p>

And the entire Republican party - supply-siders and deficit hawks 
alike - can stand on a plan for running government in the years ahead 
that combines the two most important elements of a stronger economy, 
lower taxes and the reduced growth of government spending.<p>

Both of those elements are also vital to another Republican goal:  a 
balanced budget by the year 2002.<p>

The Dole plan includes a 15% across-the-board personal income tax rate 
cut over three years, halving the capital gains tax rate, repealing 
the 1993 Social Security benefits tax increase, expanding the 
availability of Individual Retirement Accounts and giving families a 
$500 per child tax credit.  Altogether the cuts are projected to 
reduce government tax revenue by $548 billion over six years.<p>

Tax cuts are more than simply politically popular.  Dole doesn't have 
to be a supply-sider to be aware of what scholarly studies conclude 
and recent history confirms - that the right kinds of tax cuts 
stimulate economic growth.  The longest periods of sustained economic 
growth in the United States have followed tax cuts.  After the Kennedy 
tax cuts in the 1960s, the economy grew by 42% over seven years.  
After the Reagan cuts of the 1980s, the economy grew by 33% over seven 
years.<p>

Economist Gerald Scully, a Senior Fellow at the National Center for 
Policy Analysis who has done extensive analysis of taxes, has 
concluded that maximum economic growth occurs when government at all 
levels takes between 21.5% and 22.9 % of the nation's output of goods 
and services in taxes.  Currently, the federal government alone takes 
20.5 % - and the Congressional Budget Office expects the economy to 
grow by only 2.2% this year.  Real gross domestic product grew only 
1.3 % last year.<p>

President Clinton may see that kind of economy as "the soundest it's 
been in a generation," but it is not growing rapidly enough to provide 
Americans with economic opportunity.  <p>

Dole projects that the stimulation of enacting his tax cuts will push 
annual  economic growth to 3.5%, generating millions of jobs, a 
lasting expansion and more opportunities.  But the Dole proposal needs 
only a third of that increase to succeed.<p>

Clinton officials will likely jump on the bandwagon, arguing that they 
will now enact the middle class tax cut they promised four years ago.  
But for the moment, they are pushing the familiar theme of economic 
class-warfare.  Those who pay the most taxes will benefit the most 
from the tax cuts, they say.  True, of course, but that argument may 
not resonate so well with taxpayers who conclude that everybody is 
getting a fair share of the reductions.  Dole will touch some 
responsive chords with the theme he sounded last weekend when he said, 
"I was thinking of the husband and wife who both work, who have little 
money to save for their children's education after they pay their 
bills."<p>

Maybe Dole decided on tax cuts simply as a political tactic.  If so, 
this is one time when good politics is also good policy.  And a 
President Dole would be unlikely to lose sight for a moment of his 
goal of a balanced budget by 2002.  Given the tax cuts, this deficit 
hawk would of necessity have to go after government spending with a 
zeal that hasn't been seen in the White House since ... well, ever.<p>

<h2>
The Information Warriors
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<P>
The American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Heritage 
Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute, and the 
National Center for Policy Analysis.  Who are they?  Some of America's 
"think tanks."  What are they?  In the battle of public policy ideas, 
they are the information warriors, and they are changing the way 
America thinks.
<P>
In times past legislators often relied on academics and industry-
supported researchers to supply them with information and answers 
about some of the leading public policy questions.  But increasingly 
both liberal and conservative legislators are turning to private, non-
profit research institutes, commonly known as think tanks, for the 
information they need to carry on the public policy debates.
<P>
Most of the public policy debates in Congress and in the state 
legislatures begin as ideas about what the "good society" should be 
like.  For example, should the government ensure that everyone has a 
right to health care, free education, and a good job?  Or should we be 
a society of limited government?  Should the government, through its 
economic policies, try to create an egalitarian society?  Or should it 
be indifferent as to who the winners and losers are, and just ensure 
that everyone plays by the rules?
<P>
The founders of most think tanks had some vision of that good society 
when they formed their organizations, and that vision usually pervades 
the institutes' policy recommendations.  So the analyses they produce 
have been well thought through.
<P>
As a result, the ideas behind public policy proposals and the debate 
over the social or economic impact of those proposals are increasingly 
being fought between these new centers of influence.
<P>
For example, the Clinton health care plan.  The legislative defeat of 
the Clinton health care plan came in September and October of 1994, 
but the ideological battle was fought for the two preceding years 
between liberal think tanks that supported the plan and free-market 
think tanks that opposed socializing the American health care system. 
<P>
On this issue, the free-market think tanks won a clear and decisive 
victory.  But for the longest time, they were the only troops in the 
field.  The media were absolutely convinced that some version of the 
Clinton plan would pass, and even some conservative Republicans 
thought they saw the handwriting on the wall.  National organizations 
such as the American Medical Association and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, which should have vehemently opposed the plan, cozied up to 
the administration in order to get a "seat at the table."
<P>
By contrast, the National Center for Policy Analysis (with which I am 
associated), the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and several 
other research institutes immediately raised questions about the plan 
and began to provide in-depth analysis of the economic problems that 
would arise if the Clinton plan were implemented.  Those educational 
efforts laid the groundwork for the American people's utter rejection 
of the Clinton plan.
<P>
Currently, Medical Savings Accounts are the most controversial  health 
care  issue before Congress.  MSAs are tax-free personal savings 
accounts used to pay for small and routine medical care, while a 
catastrophic health care policy pays for major expenses.  
<P>
While the battle rages today, the idea is not new.  As far back as 
1984, the National Center for Policy Analysis was promoting a 
variation of this idea, which was eventually endorsed by a number of 
think tanks across the country and passed into law by nearly 20 
states.  
<P>
In addition, the educational efforts about MSAs has resulted in 
perhaps 2,000 businesses adopting some version of an MSA plan.  As a 
result, a whole new market for health insurance has arisen, spurring 
the industry, especially the small-and medium-size insurance 
companies, to consider innovative ways to meet the demand. 
<P>
But these battles were small compared to what is coming.  Both 
liberal- and conservative-oriented think tanks are gearing up for two 
of the biggest public policy battles yet - privatizing Social Security 
before it becomes insolvent and reforming the income tax system to 
make it fairer, less complex, and more conducive to economic growth.
<P>
Both battles will make the past debates look mild by comparison.  It 
may be years before we are able to reform either system, but the 
debate is beginning now as the think tanks prepare their arguments.
<P>
In the '60s and '70s, the liberal think tanks were winning the public 
policy battles.  In the '80s and '90s, the conservative institutes 
have had the upper hand.
<P>
Now, more than ever, think tanks matter.  They are influencing our 
economy and our society as they develop the ideas behind the policies 
<P>
that drive the politics of America.

Good Intentions and Bad Policy
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No matter what your sixth grade teacher or My Weekly Reader said, 
America is not running out of space to put its garbage, recycling is 
not always good, and the world is not running out of resources.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The well-financed cultural mantra that recycling is both desirable and 
environmentally necessary has nearly become as much a truth beyond 
critical examination as that murder is wrong and that the earth is 
round.  Our schools have been full of it.  Mothers didn't even want 
juice boxes in school lunches because of fears that they couldn't be 
recycled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, it has become harder over the years to ignore the fact that 
sometimes simply throwing garbage away is more environmentally 
friendly, financially prudent - and safer for human health.  Now comes 
confirmation from an unlikely source - the New York Times Magazine.  
"Recycling is Garbage," writes John Tierney of the Times.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among other failings of recycling, it is frequently uneconomical. 
Tierney calculates that it costs more than $3,000 to recycle a ton of 
scrap metal, glass and plastic in New York City.  "For that price," he 
writes, "you could find a one-ton collection of those materials at a 
used-car lot - a Toyota Tercel, for instance - and drive home in it."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And, all things considered, you would need to use your ceramic coffee 
cup 1,000 times before it would be less environmentally expensive than 
a throw-away polystyrene cup.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For some materials, recycling is good, and businesses have long known 
this.  For instance, recycling aluminum cans requires 10% less energy 
than making them from virgin materials.   And more than 10 million 
automobile tires are recycled for retreads each year, reducing the 
energy used to produce tires by 30%.  But such success stories are not 
usually transferable to other forms of waste.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now, it would not matter if the true believers in recycling recycled 
away to their heart's content - except that they have been able all 
too often to make their beliefs public policy.  In 1986, about 10% of 
solid waste was recycled at little cost to consumers or taxpayers.  
Today, with  statutory mandates  in many  communities, about 25% is 
recycled.  But achieving that level has been costly and the programs 
lose money.  Most states  initially  set even  higher  goals, such as  
50%  in  New York  and California,  60% in New Jersey, and 70% in 
Rhode Island - but none achieved them.  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
recently declared New York's legislated goals "absurd" and 
"impossible."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At today's prices, curbside recycling programs typically add 15% to 
the cost of waste disposal.  One should remember that every dollar 
spent on inefficient recycling and waste reduction efforts is 
unavailable for other important social programs, including other 
environmental protection efforts.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the zeal to mandate recycling and the use of recycled 
products has created worse environmental and health hazards than the 
problems they were meant to solve.  For instance, government mandated 
recycling of newsprint requires de-inking - involving the use of 
toxics that create worse disposal problems.   In February, the 
Associated Press reported that a county road in Washington state was 
closed because smoke and fire kept bursting through its surface.  The 
roadway had been built with recycled tires that began to rust as rain 
seeped beneath the road's surface, causing heat, impenetrable clouds 
of steam and eventually fire.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By anointing recycling as the preferred method of disposal, 
environmentalists ignored technological, geographic, economic, and 
social limits to its usefulness.  In Wyoming, where transportation 
costs are high and land is cheap, it may make less sense to buy and 
use recycled paper than it does in New York.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Legislated mandates for the use and purchase of recycled products have 
wasted taxpayers' money, cost consumers both at the point of purchase 
and by limiting product options, dampened the development of resource-
saving technological innovations, and on occasion harmed the 
environment.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't we need to recycle because we're running out of scarce 
resources?  Hardly.  Technology makes it possible to use resources 
without exhausting them, which is why the prices of most natural 
resources, as well as food, have been falling for decades.  One 
example:  A fiberglass cable made with 25 kilograms of sand (about 55 
pounds) can carry 1,000 times as many messages today as a wire made 
with a ton of copper.  So copper prices are down, and its supply in no 
danger of depletion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And if throwing something away is the best choice, there is room to do 
that, too.  If we keep generating garbage at current rates for 1,000 
years, how big would a landfill 100 yards deep need to be to hold it?  
Just 35 miles square.

<h2>
The Best Campaign Finance Law: Repeal Spending and Contribution Limits
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Memo to true believers in campaign finance reform:  The only way to 
ensure fairer, freer elections is to get rid of the campaign spending 
laws.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Completely.  Require full disclosure of all contributors, but nothing 
else.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our present campaign finance laws are ridiculous.  As a case in point, 
Ross Perot, who spent $60 million of his own money running for 
president in 1992, can get $32 million of taxpayers' money for a race 
this year if he'll hold his personal spending to less than $50,000.  
But if Perot's Reform Party picks somebody else to run, that candidate 
may not get any taxpayers' money.  Or maybe he or she will get $32 
million after all.  The Federal Election Commission hasn't decided.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or look at publisher Steve Forbes.  He can spend a million dollars of 
his own money to run himself, but is not allowed to contribute it to a 
candidate he believes in - like Jack Kemp.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Barbra Streisand or Whoopi Goldberg can make appearances worth tens of 
thousands of dollars to candidates, but a successful CEO cannot give 
the same amount to candidates of his or her choice.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The AFL-CIO can spend $35 million on advertising against incumbent 
Congressmen, but to defend themselves those candidates must raise 
money in $1,000 or $5,000 bites.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our current campaign laws are a failed idea; complex, ineffective, and 
manipulated by a political bureaucracy called the Federal Elections 
Commission.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The reforms currently being touted include banning political action 
committees (PACs), restricting "bundling" (where individuals have one 
person deliver their contribution checks on behalf of a group), 
requiring Senatorial candidates to raise 60% of their funds inside 
their state, and outlawing "soft money."  Proponents recognize that 
banning PACs almost certainly is unconstitutional, so there's a 
fallback provision limiting their contribution to a candidate to 
$1,000.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The goal of all these proposals is to limit the influence of people 
and groups with money on the electoral process.  It might work if 
campaigns were conducted in a vacuum.  But they aren't.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Limiting the size of contributions works to the benefit of incumbents, 
or organization or party candidates, who already have in place the 
database and the organization for mass solicitation.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As Bradley A. Smith wrote in the January issue of the Yale Law 
Journal, "Reform proposals inherently favor certain political elites, 
support the status quo, and discourage grassroots political activity.  
Even if these proposals worked as intended, they would have an 
undemocratic effect on American elections."  To put it differently, 
campaign spending laws protect incumbents and special interests.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Besides, there really is no evidence that small contributions from 
large numbers lead to more representative government with less 
corruption, or that the numbers of small donors are an indication of 
the sentiment of the general electorate.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Eugene McCarthy would have found it difficult at best to conduct his 
antiwar campaign in 1968 without the six-figure individual 
contributions from backers Jack Dreyfus Jr. and Stewart Mott.  The two 
presidential candidates who have been most successful at raising money 
from small contributors were Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George 
McGovern in 1972.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Abolishing PACs may win cheers from reformers, but Francis Wilkinson, 
communications director for Democrat Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful 
Senate campaign, noted in a New York Times op-ed article "the impact 
on the 28,000 nurses who contribute an average of $46 a year to the 
American Nurses Association PAC to have a voice on issues like health 
care. ...For them, a PAC affords a convenient avenue of participation 
and a chance to exercise power they could not wield as individuals."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Campaign finance restrictions are a relatively recent development in 
American politics.  Is it coincidental that their growth parallels a 
decline in public confidence in government?  Maybe not, but certainly 
the campaign finance laws haven't done anything to raise confidence.  
And there is no evidence that we are better off because of them.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead of trying to fix campaign spending limitations, let's get rid 
of them.  Let people know how much money a candidate has received and 
who the big contributors are, and let them make up their  own minds 
about whether the candidate should get their vote.  One thing for 
sure, that approach would be an improvement over what we have now.

<h2>
Chicken Little Lives
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Chicken Littles who had the last word on the International Panel 
on Climate Change tell us that the sky is falling again.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The panel of scientists comprising the IPCC recently reported on the 
state of, and potential outlook for, earth's climate.  Doubts, 
disagreements and contradictory data can be found in the body of the 
report.  But the group who wrote the executive summary, the only part 
that will be widely read, pretty flatly assert that humans are causing 
global warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Based on the executive summary and the policy options presented in it, 
environmentalists say the world's governments must take drastic action 
now to halt the cataclysmic consequences of such a change.  Analysts 
at the World Watch Institute, for example, call for an overhaul of our 
energy and transportation systems, ending the fossil fuel economy.  
Such policies would cost our nation billions of dollars.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before we head for cover, let's consider whether the sky really is 
falling, or whether some Chicken Littles in the ranks of scientists 
have been led down the garden path by a figurative acorn, in the form 
of computer climate model data, falling on their heads.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proponents of the theory of global warming, or, as is now fashionable, 
"global climate change," depend on two bits of evidence and computer 
models.  First,  ground-level measurements of global mean temperature 
indicate that earth has warmed between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees Celsius in 
the last century.  Second, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a primary 
greenhouse gas (those gases without which most animal and plant life 
would not exist), has increased by approximately 25 percent in the 
last century and a half.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you put these facts in the computer models, global climate change 
theory says that the earth's current warming is due to the increase of 
CO2 in the atmosphere, caused primarily by the use of fossil fuel.  
According to the models, absent a severe and immediate reduction in 
the level of CO2 put into the atmosphere, the earth will warm further, 
causing all manner of calamities from melting polar ice caps which 
would raise ocean levels, flooding small islands and coastal regions, 
to increased hurricane activity and severe droughts, which would cause 
massive crop failure.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IPCC report's executive summary predicts that if no further action 
is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect an increase 
in temperature somewhere  between 0.8 and 3.5 degrees Celsius over 
the next 100 years.  Interestingly, this figure is well below the amount 
of warming forecast just four years ago.  In fact, with every new report, 
the range of warming falls.  At this pace, in a few years scientific 
doomsayers will be talking about the next ice age again.  (We haven't 
forgotten that that was this same group's doom and gloom scenario in 
the 1970s.)
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the current figure is correct, the increase is well within the 
natural range of known temperature variation over the last 15,000 
years.  Most of the earth's plant life evolved in a much warmer, CO2-
filled atmosphere.  In fact, the predicted warming would affect 
primarily night-time temperatures, lessening the number of frosty 
nights and extending the growing season.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, there is little evidence that increased CO2 has had more than 
a small part to play in this century's temperature increase.  Most of 
the warming occurred before the 1940s, before the widespread use of 
automobiles.  In fact, from 1938 to the present, we have actually 
experienced a cooling trend.  Indeed, satellite data, the most 
reliable climate evidence that we have, show no evidence of warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why do scientists agree that we must take drastic action now?  
Well, they don't.  Some scientists are proclaiming impending disaster, 
but others of at least equal repute say the evidence of global warming 
is questionable at best.  So this is not a question of proven science 
versus a bunch of know-nothings.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And why do they agree, as the executive summary says, that we should 
take drastic action now to curb fossil fuel use, limit economic growth 
in established countries, and condemn less-developed countries to 
continue in their less-developed circumstances, and increase 
unemployment and misery all around?  They don't agree with that 
either. Even some of climate change theory's foremost scientific 
advocates acknowledge that there is nothing we can do now to prevent 
global climate change that we won't be able to do 10 years from now.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A far better course of action is to keep studying, keep learning, and 
keep improving our data until we understand what, if anything, is 
really happening.  Then we can take action that will allow economic 
growth and a higher standard of living and keep our planet livable.  
Both must be accomplished together; we must not sacrifice one to 
achieve the other.

<h2>
Cut Taxes, Help the Economy, Win the Presidency
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
As Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.  And sometimes 
very quickly.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Barely a month ago, on April 29th, Bruce Bartlett, formerly at the 
Treasury Department and now a Senior Fellow with the National Center 
for Policy Analysis,  put forth a simple idea:  cut personal income 
taxes 15% across the board.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Why a 15% cut?  Because that would bring the government's share of the 
nation's gross domestic product back to about what it was in 1992, 
before President Clinton took office.  In Bartlett's words, "In the 
first three years of the Clinton administration, Americans have paid 
$151.1 billion more in taxes than if federal receipts had remained at 
their 1992 level as a share of gross domestic product."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett had the inspiration after he saw recent Commerce Department 
figures that showed that more than one out of every three dollars 
produced by the American economy last year went to government.  At the 
federal, state and local levels combined, government consumed 31.3% of 
all national output - the largest share of GDP ever taken by 
government.  Even in 1945, with the country fighting and paying for 
World War II, total taxes only amounted to 30% of GDP.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett calculated that since Bill Clinton took office, personal 
income taxes have increased 1.6 times faster than the country's 
economic growth, as measured by GDP, and corporate taxes have 
increased 3.5 times faster.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Three weeks later, on May 20th, Bartlett could report that Bob Dole, 
soon to be the Republican nominee for president, was giving his idea 
serious consideration.  Dole has been a deficit hawk during his 
career, but history, politics and economic theory are all on the side 
of a tax cut - and that may be enough to sway him.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is historical justification for a tax cut now.  The increasing 
government share of output caused by bracket creep during the high 
inflation 1970s led to the Reagan tax cut.  For that matter, the high 
percentage of state output that was being taken by taxes in California 
was what prompted Proposition 13 in California in 1978 and the 
beginning of a nationwide revolt against state and local tax levels.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Political justification?   Well, there's the Reagan proposal in 1980 
for a 30% across-the-board reduction that helped him beat Jimmy 
Carter.   More recently, Christie Whitman came from behind to win 
election as governor of New Jersey in 1993 after she too pledged a 30% 
tax cut.  Further, that 15% figure represents a repeal of President 
Clinton's tax increases, so it should have some symbolic importance to 
Dole and the Republican Party.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The magic of a tax cut pledge is that it gives a campaign a focal 
point.  (After 1988, it's pretty safe to say that just pledging "no 
new taxes" is not going to be a vote-getter.)  For Republicans, whose 
agenda is less regulation, smaller government, and increased personal 
responsibility, a tax reduction proposal provides philosophical 
underpinning for all their policies.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Perhaps the most compelling justification, however, is economics.  
Because personal and corporate income taxes are graduated - the more 
money one makes, the higher tax percentage one pays - the tax burden 
increases as the economy grows.  To hold it steady as a percentage of 
the national economy requires periodic tax cuts.  Further, reducing 
marginal tax rates provides an incentive to earn more money, freeing 
up more dollars for saving and investment and stimulating economic 
growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"But," as the liberals (and moderate Republicans) are fond of saying, 
"what about the deficit?"  That argument was dealt a body blow  by 
Democrat Felix Rohatyn in the April 11th Wall Street Journal:  After 
listing our most serious economic and social problems, Rohatyn wrote:  
"Even though all of these require different approaches, the single 
most important requirement to deal with all of them is the wealth and 
revenues generated by a higher rate of economic growth.  John Kennedy 
was right:  A rising tide lifts all boats.  Although it may not lift 
all of them at the same time and at the same rate, without more growth 
we are simply redistributing the same pie." 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So how can Dole, as a deficit hawk, rationalize a tax cut? A 
successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing the 
growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic growth 
is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases take home 
pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax receipts. 
There aren't many problems that a 15% tax cut can cause that a 3.5% 
economic growth rate can't solve if you keep a handle on spending.  
Ideas do have consequences.  And Bob Dole's election could be the 
consequence of a proposal to cut taxes 15% across-the-board.

Whatever Happened to Environmental Policy Reform?
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the

<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The new Republican Congress roared into Washington and set out to 
change the rules of environmental policy.  Environmental reforms were 
going to be based on risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis, less 
business regulation and smaller environmental agencies.  Congress was 
going to prune back the oppressive bureaucracy and get the government 
off our backs.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Two years later, what has happened?  Not much.  The budgets of the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department are little 
changed from previous years.  The EPA's 1996 budget is only 1.5% less 
than its 1995 budget.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The flawed Endangered Species Act continues in force unchanged even 
though authorization for it has long since lapsed.  The Safe Drinking 
Water Act, among the least controversial of the nation's environmental 
laws, has not been re-authorized.  Wetlands reforms are still nothing 
but a promise.  Commitments to improve individual property rights 
protections and to give more control over environmental matters to the 
states have largely gone unfulfilled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has even been unable to reform the one law widely cited by 
both Democrats and Republicans as perhaps the most flawed 
environmental program:  Superfund.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So why have the reformers failed? First, there was an image problem.  
Republicans focused on the cost to business of environmental 
regulation.  They talked about dollars and cents, efficiency, and 
decreased regulation, thus providing Democrats the opportunity to 
seize the moral high ground.  Defenders of the status quo frightened 
the public by painting reforms as the abandonment of basic 
environmental protection.  Talk about decreased business costs was no 
match for talk about threats to "children's health."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then there were election year politics. The President and 
Congressional Democrats calculated that it would be better for their 
election prospects to bash Republicans for their lack of compassion 
than to support positive bipartisan environmental reforms.  Democrats 
even refused to vote for environmental policies that they themselves 
had proposed and supported when they controlled the Congress.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then came the pollsters.  Republican pollsters found that the vast 
majority of voters consider themselves to be environmentalists. They 
also found that even Republican voters trust Democrats more than their 
own party on environmental issues. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But people who vote based on environmental issues generally think 
either that environmental laws need basic reforms that balance human 
needs with environmental protection, or that we must protect the 
environment regardless of the costs.  The former group has largely 
supported reform efforts.  Backing off environmental reforms threatens 
to alienate them.  Voters in the latter group don't trust Republican 
efforts and attempting to gain their support is a losing proposition.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But the main reason for the failure of Republican environmental reform 
goes much deeper.  It rests on the first rule of successful politics:  
you must present a positive vision for the outcome of your policies. 
While the reformers correctly pointed out the excesses associated with 
current environmental laws, they neither discussed environmentally 
appropriate goals nor provided a blueprint for attaining a better 
environment.  Simply put, they ignored the "vision thing."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
A positive environmental vision for the future is centered upon the 
solution to the tragedy of the Commons.  You remember the tale:  all 
the village cattle graze upon a jointly owned common.  It is in the 
interest of each villager to add more cattle to his herd, since he 
pays no price to use the common. Soon there is no grass left on the 
common, the cattle die, and the village economy fails.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The solution?  Give each villager an ownership stake in his portion of 
the common and he will graze only so many cattle as it will support.  
The village economy then prospers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Instead of the government regulating the trout stream, let the trout 
fisherman manage the lands and trout will flourish.  Let nature 
conservancies manage the bird sanctuaries and reap the profits of 
drilling for oil beneath them, and oil and fowl will peacefully co-
exist.  When the government bans the killing of elephants, poachers 
take them and the herds dwindle.  Let the natives own the elephants, 
and hunters are permitted a share, but the herds will grow under the 
watchful eye of people who have a stake in their growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Free markets produce more wealth, and free people are the best 
environmental stewards.  Wealthier societies have healthier 
populations and commit more resources to environmental protection than 
do poorer nations.  Freedom of people and markets is not only 
compatible with environmental health, it is essential to it. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
What the Republicans forgot is that beating up on regulators - no 
matter how well deserved - is no substitute for an environmental 
vision for the future.

<h2>
Eastern Europe and the Western Alliance
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil," Edmund Burke 
observed, "is for good men to do nothing."  While what has happened in 
Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is hardly evil - 
communism was the evil - the fact is that good men have done very 
little to nourish the seeds of Western values in the freed nations of 
Eastern Europe.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
At a recent gathering of several hundred pro-democracy ministers and 
MPs from western and central European nations in Prague, Czech 
Republic President Vaclev Havel put it more bluntly:  "Six years have 
passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain.  It seems to me that little 
has happened during those six years and time is working against the 
Democrats.  Against those who want peace and peaceful cooperation.  
Unless Democrats proceed with greater vigor to build the European 
order, others will start to do so and we know who the 'others' 
are....The story of the former Yugoslavia should be a clear warning 
for  Europe and for the whole wor as to what can happen if there is 
too much hesitation."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The Congress of Prague, as the meeting was called, stressed the 
urgency of bringing Eastern European nations into the western 
alliance.  Its mission was "to reunite the family of western 
civilization, and so to ensure its future."  Lest this seem too 
pessimistic, consider that for 50 years, from 1939 to 1989, Central 
Europe was the battleground of our century's epic battle of freedom 
against tyranny.  With the flush of the victory of the west over 
communism, all seemed possible, and the integration of Russia's former 
satellites into the European community and its commerce seemed 
probable.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But it has not come to pass.  Instead, "Market reforms in the former 
communist countries are being slowed down or reversed.  Post-
communists now govern in all the former satellites except the  Czech 
Republic.  A former communist has replaced Lech Walesa as president of 
Poland.  The communists won 45 percent of the Russian Duma in the 
recent elections.  And Central Europe has seen its membership of both 
NATO and the EU postponed."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So what to do?  First, the economic base of western Europe must be 
expanded eastward.  The current strategy of European Union (EU) 
advocates - principally the French and Germans - is flawed.  A single, 
common-currency, Brussels-regulated European monolith, hard to join 
and with limited economic growth potential once admitted (the EU 
annual growth targets are the same anemic 2.5% as the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's), offers less hope for the future than a tariff-free trading 
group with harmonized procedures.  All the former European Soviet 
satellites should quickly become a part of such a group.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Second, NATO must be expanded eastward as well.  The Czech Republic 
and Hungary should be admitted now; Poland and the Baltic nations 
should follow.  The Russians, of course, are opposed, and have been 
saber-rattling against it ("Moscow plans pact with Belorussia if NATO 
expands" - May 15, 1996).  But as the London Times editorialized on 
May 14th, "The case for enlargement is one of principle:  that 
independent nations have the right to choose their own foreign and 
defense policies and allies."  Especially independent nations once 
enslaved by the very nation now objecting to their increased freedoms.  
Or in President Havel's words, we cannot allow "someone else [to] 
decide which countries should be allowed to join the Alliance and 
which should not."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Third, the United States and the newly enlarged memberships of the EU 
must move promptly to increase trade across the Atlantic.  A Trans-
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) must be put on the agenda of the 
World Trading Organization.  If it does not receive favorable 
attention, the EU and NAFTA should begin direct discussions to further 
liberalize trade agreements.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
For seven years there has been a window of opportunity to bring 
stability to an area of the world that has spawned a century of wars.  
But it is closing rapidly; in fact, there is a chance that it may be  
slammed shut by the June elections in Russia.  The fears of central 
European nations of instability to the East are not groundless.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Lady Thatcher's address to the Congress of Prague provided a practical 
program:  "...to merge the North American Free Trade Area with the 
European community, including the countries of Central and perhaps in 
time Eastern Europe."  And a corresponding vision:  "We in the West 
won a great victory  the Cold War.  Let us not now forget why we 
fought.  The mission of this Congress is to recapture that sense of 
purpose and clothe it with practical action."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is an opportunity to bring the victims of this century the 
opportunities of the next one.  It must be seized before it slips 
away.

</i>  <h2>  Unfunded Mandates:<br>
 Congress Is Targeting Business Instead of Governments 
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has made it illegal for the federal government to impose 
unfunded mandates - requirements to take certain actions or provide 
certain services without providing the federal funds to pay for those 
mandates - on state and local governments.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfunded mandates have been a real burden in the past, forcing state 
and local governments to spend millions and even billions of dollars 
while members of Congress took the political credit for good deeds.  
For example, Columbus, Ohio, complained in 1991 that Congress was 
forcing it to spend $62 million to fulfill environmental mandates.  
The National Association of Towns and Townships estimated that 
unfunded federal mandates cost local taxpayers about $6.5 billion in 
fiscal year 1993.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The new Republican Congress with great fanfare put a stop to it.  Or 
so it claimed.  But the fact is that Congress hasn't really repented 
of its past sins, it has just changed its focus - from local 
governments to private businesses.  Congress' new mandate addiction 
can best be seen with regard to the issue of health care reform.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; People without health insurance sometimes develop a medical condition 
and then have difficulty finding an insurer to provide health 
coverage.  Although this is a relatively small problem for the U.S. 
health care system - surveys show that less than 1 percent of the 
population has been denied health insurance because of an preexisting 
medical condition - it is nevertheless real.  And its solution - 
Congressional mandates to help the poor and the ill - has irresistible 
political appeal.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But Congress does not have the money to solve the problem of the 
uninsurable, and under its new rule against unfunded mandates, it 
cannot tell the states to handle it.   So it has decided, through the 
Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act,  to tell health 
insurance companies - primarily those that write health insurance 
policies for individuals - that they must accept and pay the costs of 
medical care for the uninsurable.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While everyone agrees this bill will increase the cost of health 
insurance - the difference of opinion is only how much - Congress is 
not required to provide the funds to businesses.  It just tells health 
insurers what to do, takes the credit for solving the problem of the 
uninsurable, and passes the costs of the unfunded mandate on to 
business, and ultimately consumers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A second example concerns mental health.  Health insurance companies 
often treat mental health problems differently than they do physical 
health care problems, primarily because mental health science is much 
more complex and less understood than physical health science, and 
mental health illnesses less specific.  It can also be much more 
difficult to tell when a patient is "cured" of a mental health problem 
than of a physical ailment.  A broken limb can be seen to mend.  
Mental uneasiness has no obvious limits and can linger indefinitely.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result, insurers have been reluctant to give mental health care 
the blank check it has provided for traditional health care and 
insurance coverage for mental health services is much more limited.  
Some in Congress would like to solve that problem by telling insurers 
that their policies must cover mental health care needs to the same 
extent their  policies  cover other medical conditions. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once again, Congress praises itself for its compassion and passes the 
unfunded mandate - the costs along with the economic chaos  - on to 
private-sector businesses.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfortunately, health insurance isn't the only place Congress is 
considering imposing unfunded mandates on business.  Consider the 
recent struggle over increasing the minimum wage.  Congress wants to 
raise the cost of labor to both state and local governments and 
private employers, requiring them to pay the cost.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is a perfect example of members of Congress appealing to the 
American public, explaining how concerned and compassionate they are 
about the plight of the low-income employee, and how Congress is going 
to solve the problem by raising their wages.  What they don't make so 
clear is that they intend to require business to pay for their 
compassion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Worse, the 23 Republican Congressmen pressing the Republican 
leadership to increase the minimum wage all voted for the unfunded 
mandates prohibition.  Most of them even voted against an amendment 
exempting the minimum wage from the unfunded mandate prohibition.  So 
much for candor in government. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Perhaps what we need is a Contract With America II, with a provision 
that would protect private companies from unfunded mandates the way 
the first Contract protected state and local governments.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Simply put, if Congress isn't willing to pay for something, it ought 
not require someone else to buy it.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of

 <i>September 3, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. I </h2><p>

<i>We're told that the era of big government is over, but what about the era of judicial activism? When will that end?</i><p>



Constitutional law expert Richard Morgan predicts that the era of judicial activism is almost over -- and that, when the end comes, it will come rapidly. He likens this imminent, swift demise of an outworn orthodoxy to the sudden fall of the Soviet empire. "Just as political and social institutions that appear as durable as the mountains can collapse almost overnight," Morgan explains, "so, too, seemingly impregnable intellectual orthodoxies can suddenly stand revealed as so flawed that we're abashed at having accepted them for so long." Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, the Bowdoin College professor contends that "America is on the edge of such a collapse of orthodoxy in our thinking about the proper role of judges and judge-made law in our governmental process. Central to this change," he says, "is the demythologizing of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education."<p>

Before we can lay judicial activism to rest, we must first acknowledge the flawed nature of the Brown decision. "The collapse of Brown as a model for judicial behavior will resonate through many of the most contentious areas of American public policy," says Morgan, "from criminal justice and affirmative action to education and welfare reform: for Brown is the mother of contemporary judicial activism -- policy making by judges acting essentially as legislators, without any real justification from such ordinary legal authorities as statutory and constitutional texts, history, and precedent." Morgan charges that the Supreme Court decision that "overruled the people of Colorado in May with respect to homosexual rights, without any serious attempt to offer a constitutional reason for doing so, is only the latest example of the Brown style of judging."<p>

Morgan notes that "arguments undermining the authority of Brown as a model for judging have long been piling up. Right from the beginning, some of the country's most distinguished constitutional lawyers criticized Brown -and especially Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion, which relied on essentially sociological reasoning to brush aside 70 years of precedent and settled understanding as to the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment." The Chief Justice relied "neither on text, nor history, nor precedent," says Morgan, and "was, in effect, claiming for the Court the authority to revise the meaning of the Constitution."<p>

Richard Morgan maintains that the Court "attempted to dismantle segregation (a profoundly important end) by means that were profoundly wrong. Not only did this judicial fiat traduce democracy, substituting the will of the judges for decision by the people and their representatives; it disregarded fundamental constitutional forms (federalism, separation of powers, and the procedures for amending the Constitution prescribed by Article V)." The Brown decision "launched the modern era of judicial 'reform,' in which purportedly noble ends can justify even the most constitutionally suspect means." It's time, says Morgan, to admit the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Duplantier: NAFTA & Narcotics  -- 9/02/96</title> 
</head> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<b>Behind the Headlines</b><br> 
<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.</i><br> 
<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F. R. Duplantier</a><br> 
 <i>September 2, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NAFTA & Narcotics </h2><p>

<i>"The impact of NAFTA on the sale and distribution of narcotics within the U.S. was felt immediately. In the very first month after the treaty took effect in January l 994, there was a sharp rise in marijuana, cocaine, and crack in the streets and schoolyards of our towns and cities. "</i><p>

Former Mexican president Carlos Salinas "joined Bill Clinton in bulldozing NAFTA through," recalls William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade. NAFTA made perfect sense to Salinas, who with his family was "deeply involved in the drug trade and other criminal activities. Salinas is now hiding in exile," reports Gill; "his brother, Raul Salinas, is in prison, and Raul's wife was arrested in Switzerland for attempting to withdraw some of their laundered money from a Swiss bank." In addition, "several of Mexico's most prominent businessmen were linked to the Salinas family's crime ring."<p>

Gill charges that "the lucrative narcotics industry" has corrupted public officials south -- and north -- of the border. "Three former high U.S. Justice Department lawyers were indicted last year for helping the Cali drug cartel ship literally tons of cocaine into our country, most of it via Mexico," he reports. High officials in both the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service were "allegedly involved in drug and immigrant smuggling from Mexico." Drug trafficking generates an estimated "$30 billion in income for our neighbors to the south," says Gill. "Drug money is financing all kinds of businesses in Mexico and, no doubt, in the United States as well."<p>

The crime explosion NAFTA caused in Mexico is spilling over into the U.S. "Last year, there were 1000 slayings in the larger cities on the Mexican side of the border, most of them drug-related and unsolved," says Gill. "No one could possibly know how many murders in the United States are caused by the NAFTA-spurred increase in the drug trade. But they are bound to be in the hundreds, if not thousands, by now. Indeed, there is deep and growing interaction between the drug gangs in Los Angeles and other American cities and the drug lords and gangs in Mexico and Central America."<p>

Gill argues that "free trade is the primary driving force behind the crime wave that is sweeping the globe." Calling this crime wave "a crisis that threatens the very foundations of all civilization," he predicts that "the chaos emanating from Mexico now will sweep in stronger from China tomorrow. Already we are getting a foretaste of what Communist China and others in the East have in store for the U.S.A.," says Gill. "In May, Customs officers seized 2000 AK-47 assault rifles in California." Chinese agents had sought to sell these weapons to L.A. street gangs.<p>

"China is also exporting thousands of illegal aliens to this country," Williarn Gill reports. "Many come into Central American mini-states and are smuggled into the U.S. via Mexico." Gill warns that "the invasion from China could easily surpass the present 1 million or so Mexican illegals entering each year."<p>

<h2> SPECIAL ED: KIDS GO IN, DON'T COME OUT</h2><p>                           


     The budget for special education in New York City schools exceeds
     $2 billion, for just 135,000 students!<p>

     There's a lesson to be learned when "a school system that has
     made a fetish out of testing, counting, and record-keeping
     ignores the most important tests and statistics of them all: the
     ordinary measures of whether children are learning anything." So
     observes Kay Hymowitz in a distressing article entitled "Special
     Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," in the Summer issue of
     the Manhattan Institute's City Journal. "Two-thirds of special-ed
     students officially exiting in 1995," she observes, "dropped out
     instead of graduating."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that "only 5 percent of special-ed kids are ever
     'decertified' into general education." In other words, from the
     perspective of the students, the program is a colossal failure.
     It has, however, created enormous opportunity for the bureaucrats
     and attorneys responsible for complying with "a mammoth federal
     mandate and a 17-year-old consent decree." It has succeeded in
     "providing employment for members of the United Federation of
     Teachers." It has given poor parents an incentive for having
     their children misdiagnosed in order to obtain Supplemental
     Security Income. It has furnished a way for conniving
     middle-class parents to provide their children with "a private
     education at public expense." It's also proven to be a boon for
     those private agencies that "evaluate potential special-ed
     preschool students, and then, in 75 to 80 percent of cases . . .
     refer them to their own schools."<p>

     Hymowitz argues that "both the federal law and the apparatus
     dedicated to its enforcement rest on a largely worthless
     scientific model. The federal law asserts that such great
     progress in 'diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods'
     has taken place that, given enough money, all handicapped
     children can be educated effectively. Like a team of doctors,
     experts are supposed to 'diagnose' a child's malady and then
     recommend the proper course of treatment." Hymowitz reports that
     "the criteria for referrals and placement in New York City
     schools were far from uniform." There is no telling how many
     students have been misclassified. "A child might be called
     learning disabled in one school, emotionally disturbed in
     another, or not be referred at all in a third."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that learning-disabled, or L.D., kids "are
     overwhelmingly minority, poor achievers, and often behaviorally
     disruptive. Many have moved and changed schools often; many are
     chronically late for school. All this suggests chaotic home lives
     that clash with the ordered processes of learning," says
     Hymowitz. "Though both state and federal law clearly specify that
     the category 'learning disabled' should 'not include children who
     have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . .
     environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage,' those are
     precisely the children who are included."<p>

     Kay Hymowitz concedes that "we must do something for these
     children," but insists that special education "does almost no
     noticeable good for perhaps half the pupils it serves . . . and
     is forbidden by law to include them in the first place."<p>

<h2> FDA IS STIFLING MEDICAL INNOVATION</h2><p>                    





     Society offers numerous safeguards against unsafe medical
     devices, including: consumer awareness, free competition, private
     testing laboratories, and tort law.<P>

     "Today, in what used to be the Land of the Free, someone with an
     idea for a new medical device that might help alleviate a human
     health problem can't just test the device and market it (and
     accept responsibility for any adverse effects)," observes Dr.
     Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American
     Physicians and Surgeons. "First the people with the idea have to
     invest tens of millions of dollars . . . in government paperwork.
     Then they have to submit their idea to a Czar. A few years later
     their dream may lie in ruins because of the Czar's arbitrary
     decision. If they complain, the Czar might also impound other
     products they happen to have on the market."<p>

     Why isn't there more of a public outcry over this tragic abuse of
     government power? "The people who might benefit from the proposed
     new device will never hear about it," explains Dr. Orient. "The
     public might learn about an FDA error in approving something, but
     it's almost always safe for a bureaucrat to disapprove
     something."?<p>

     Writing in a recent issue of Priorities, a publication of the
     American Council on Science and Health, Dr. Orient notes that
     "devices subjected to this maddening approval system could save
     lives . . . or could mitigate serious disability." Nevertheless,
     the FDA denies access to them "for months, for years, or
     forever." There were roughly 5,000 such devices waiting to be
     approved in 1994, and there's no telling how many ideas were
     never even submitted "because their inventors were deterred,
     perhaps for lack of money, from even trying for approval. Often
     inventors just take their ideas abroad," says Dr. Orient. "The
     American lead in medicine," she concludes from this ominous
     trend, "may soon be a distant memory."<p>

     The FDA was originally established "to assure that drugs were
     properly labeled and not adulterated," recalls Dr. Orient. "Then
     its role expanded into proving the safety, and then the efficacy,
     of drugs. Now the FDA is into medical devices. Soon it will be
     dictating the practice of medicine."<p>

     The U.S. Constitution, needless to say, makes no provision for
     the FDA. "As with most of the ever-expanding powers of the
     federal leviathan, the pretext lies in the constitutionally
     mandated power of Congress to 'regulate commerce,'" observes Dr.
     Jane Orient. "This is surely not what the Founders had in mind.
     They thought of government as a necessary evil, a system needed
     to restrain evildoers; they definitely did not envision
     government as a do-gooder." Well-intentioned or not, governmental
     intervention has inevitable consequences. "As the power of
     government agencies grows, other protections wither or are choked
     off," Dr. Orient explains. "Consumers don't bother to think for
     themselves; they just trust the government to look out for them."<p><br>

<title>Duplantier: Treaty Threatens American Security -- 8/26/96</title>

<h2> TREATY THREATENS AMERICAN SECURITY</h2><p>                    

                  




     Why would anyone object to the banning of chemical weapons? Good
     question! Here's the answer.<p>

     The United States Senate is scheduled to vote soon on
     ratification of a treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention.
     This Treaty purports to ban the production and stockpiling of
     chemical weapons, which would seem to be a laudable goal. A good
     case can be made, however, that the Treaty will not achieve its
     expressed objective and that certain unintended effects could
     undermine our nation's security and threaten the personal liberty
     of American citizens. Analyst Baker Spring of the Heritage
     Foundation charges that the Treaty "contains serious
     shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable.
     But the potential damage," says Spring, "is not limited merely to
     national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden
     on American businesses and thus harm America's economy."<p>

     The Treaty would require American businesses to "prove to the
     U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not
     producing or stockpiling chemical weapons," Spring explains.
     "Failure to comply with these regulations could result in
     companies being fined as much as $50,000 per incident." But
     following the rules isn't cheap either. Complying with the terms
     of the Treaty could cost American businesses as much as $200
     million a year, says Spring. That doesn't include "potential
     indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the
     loss of confidential information." Spring stresses that the
     Treaty would apply not just to chemical companies, but to almost
     any business that uses chemicals, including "food processors,
     brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies,
     petroleum companies, and rubber companies."<p>

     "If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security
     interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American
     businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the
     inspection regime," concedes Baker Spring. "But to ask American
     businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by
     implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security
     makes neither economic nor security sense."<p>

     Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy agrees that the
     Chemical Weapons Convention will "seriously damage United States
     national security interests and impose a massive, new regulatory
     burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses." The Treaty, he says,
     "will do nothing to reduce the arsenals of terrorist countries
     and other nations hostile to the United States." Several such
     countries "have neither signed nor ratified" the treaty, observes
     Gaffney, citing Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea as examples.
     China has not yet ratified the Treaty; nor has Russia, "the
     country with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world."<p>

     Gaffney also consider the Treaty unverifiable. He worries that it
     "will forbid United States commanders from using tear gas and
     other riot-control agents to protect our soldiers in the field
     and minimize civilian casualties." And he argues that it "will
     create yet another international bureaucracy costing millions of
     U.S. taxpayer dollars every year to impose costly new regulatory
     burdens on thousands of U.S. companies."<p>

<title>Duplantier: SCHOOL ABUSE -- 8/16/96</title>

 <i>August 16, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>SCHOOL ABUSE</h2><p> 

[On March 19th of this year, 59 sixth-grade girls at a middle school in  
East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania were subjected to gynecological exams  
against their will and without the permission of their parents.]<p> 
 
"This whole unsavory incident provides us with one more reason why  
parents ought not to put their children in public schools, and another  
reason why the government ought to be kicked out of the education  
business," concludes education expert Samuel Blumenfeld in the June  
issue of his Blumenfeld Education Letter. "This is probably the worst  
case of public educators violating the privacy rights of students and  
parents that we have seen to date."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld warns that "the totalitarians among the education  
establishment are becoming bolder and bolder in their assertion that they  
own the children." Heretofore, it was "unheard of in this country for  
perfectly healthy individuals to be forcibly herded into a nurse's room,  
and told to strip and lie down on a table for an examination." Blurnenfeld  
associates such practices with Nazi Germany. "During World War II,  
when the Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps," he  
recalls, "the first thing their captors forced them to do was strip. The  
purpose of the stripping was to deprive these captives of any notion of  
privacy or personal dignity. The stripping meant that they were now the  
property of their captors, who could do anything they wanted to them."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that the 59 grade-school girls in East Stroudsberg  
were similarly dehumanized. "The psychological damage done to these  
girls by the government of Pennsylvania cannot be undone," he contends.  
"They shall have to live with the traumatic consequences for the rest of  
their lives." Some good may come of the incident, however, if parents  
learn "that the educators cannot be trusted and that they will continue to  
deceive the public. The cavalier manner in which the school authorities  
say that parents were supposedly 'informed' of the planned exam, and the  
fact that the school cannot provide any evidence that such prior  
notification was indeed given, is an example of the contempt that school  
authorities now have for parents," says Blumenfeld. "It's as if they were  
telling them, 'We own your kids and we don't need your approval for  
anything we want to do with them."'<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that "this trend toward totalitarian enslavement will  
continue until such time as the American people put a stop to it. They can  
do so tomorrow by simply withdrawing their children from the  
government's national socialist schools and educating them at home or in  
private schools they can trust." He warns that public school officials now  
"feel so confident of their power to impose their will" on schoolchildren  
that they think they no longer have to obtain parental permission for  
anything. Samuel Blumenfeld urges all Americans to assert their parental  
rights before they lose their children entirely to the totalitarian state.<p>

<title>Duplantier:  FREON -- 08/15/96</title>

 <i>August 15, 1996</i><p>

<h2>FREON</h2><p>
 
[Twenty million American drivers will pay four times as much for air  
conditioning repairs this summer, and it won't make any difference to the  
ozone layer.]<p> 
 
"Federal law has banned production of Freon, the refrigerant used in  
more than 100 million automotive air-conditioners, in response to  
concerns about depletion of the ozone layer," says Ben Lieberman of the  
Competitive Enterprise Institute in a recent Washington Times  
commentary. "America's first post-phaseout summer is now upon us,"  
notes Lieberman, "and the news for consumers is not good. The price of  
existing Freon stocks is rising, and with it the cost of auto A/C repairs.  
Millions of car owners who will need A/C service are going to get very  
angry, especially when they realize that the excessive costs are both  
unnecessary and unfair."<p> 
 
The wholesale price of Freon was less than a dollar a pound five years  
ago, Lieberman recalls. Nowadays, that same pound of refreshing Freon  
costs upwards of $20. That's wholesale, too. The retail price is roughly  
double, and you'll probably need three pounds to fill your car's A/C.  
"Nearly all pre-1994 vehicles use Freon," Lieberman observes. "In  
addition to higher Freon costs, EPA regulations on the handling of  
refrigerants are time-consuming and require expensive equipment, adding  
to labor costs. In total, the bill for a typical automobile A/C repair has  
gone up by $100 or more."<p> 
 
Ironically, none of this extra cost or effort will have any real impact on  
the ozone layer. Most scientists have concluded that "ozone depletion is  
not nearly as serious nor immediate a threat as once predicted," observes  
Lieberman. "In fact, virtually every scary sounding prediction about the  
consequences of ozone depletion . . . has been qualified or abandoned by  
scientists." According to Lieberman, "The abrupt phaseout does not make  
sense. A few more years of limited Freon production to meet the needs of  
the existing fleet of Freon-using vehicles would have made little  
difference to the ozone layer, but a big difference to consumers."<p> 
 
Banning an efficient coolant may be a mania in America, but very few  
foreign countries are suffering from Freon phobia. "Although more than  
100 nations have signed an international treaty banning the production of  
Freon and other compounds," observes Lieberman, "developing nations  
have been given a 10-year extension, and few other developed countries  
are taking the phaseout as seriously as the United States. For example,  
illegal Freon is readily available throughout much of Europe, at a fraction  
of the U.S. price. Further, most countries have nothing like our  
Environmental Protection Agency's costly Freon-handling regulations."<p> 
 
But facts won't phase the phaseout. "Rather than trying to reduce the  
ban's costs, the EPA is loudly denying their existence," says Lieberman.  
"Most car owners have no idea how expensive their next A/C breakdown  
will be -- until it happens," he adds. The Freon phaseout is an  
unnecessary and unfair tax on everyone with a car made before 1994.<p>

<h2> CORPORATE WELFARE</h2><p>

"When it comes to attacking the federal deficit," says Stephen Moore of 
the Cato Institute, "there is one area of the budget that both parties have 
come to regard as politically untouchable: corporate welfare." Moore 
reports that a recent Cato study "shows that Uncle Sam currently spends 
$75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Eliminating those 
subsidies would cut the budget deficit in half," he contends. "If Congress 
were willing to stop the giveaways, the feds would save enough money to 
make up for the complete elimination of the capital gains tax and the 
estate tax. Reducing the deficit or eliminating the anti-growth taxes 
would do far more to benefit American industry and U.S. global 
competitiveness than asking Congress to pick industrial winners and 
losers."<p>

Moore tells us who the lucky "winners" are. "About $10 billion to $15 
billion a year is spent on agriculture subsidies -- not to small family 
farmers, but to large agribusinesses, such as Archer Daniels Midland. The 
federal sugar program provides the owners ofthe 33 largest sugar 
plantations in America more than $1 million each per year and doubles 
the price of sugar to U.S. consumers." Who else is on the gravy train? 
"Another $8 billion to $10 billion a year subsidizes U.S. exporters," says 
Moore, "including such impoverished companies as Boeing, General 
Electric, and Westinghouse." And that's just a sampling.<p>

Moore chides the Congress for failing to make any significant reductions 
in corporate welfare, then takes the executive branch to task. "With few 
exceptions, the administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest 
corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress," he observes. "In fact, 
the administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in 
spending on business subsidies." Noting that "Republicans made a valiant 
effort to close down the Commerce Department, but the Clinton 
administration allied itself with lobbyists to fend off the budget cutters," 
Moore concludes that "the Clinton administration has proved itself to be 
corporate welfare's best friend."<p>

Moore contends that corporate welfare "corrupts both our free market 
system and our representative form of government. Corporate welfare 
converts the industrialist into a statist businessman, whose market is the 
political arena in DC, not consumers." Corporate welfare also "creates a 
bidding war for preferential treatment among businesses and industries," 
a process not conducive to high ethical standards among lawmakers. 
Corporate welfare appears to be counterproductive no matter how you 
look at it. "There is no evidence that business subsidies and industrial 
policy programs are at all successful in creating jobs or wealth," says 
Moore. "Even if they did, those benefits would almost never offset the 
efficiency loss from large tax burdens imposed on workers and 
businesses to fund the programs."<p>

Successful businesses do not require the financial assistance of American 
taxpayers. One of these days we're going to have to dismantle the welfare 
system, and we might as well start with the least needy.<p>

<h2>
Trade Revolution 1996
</h2>

<i>"Most Americans are still living and laboring under the illusion of 
freedom. But more and more of us know that our freedom has been sold 
out from under us by a totally corrupt government. "</i>
<P>
"America is frittering away the last shreds of its once inviolable and 
cherished sovereignty," says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. The mechanisms for ceding our nation's sovereignty 
to a global authority were established in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as 
NAFTA and GATT) "and a host of subsidiary actions via the UN and 
other international agencies," says Gill. "The list of actual and potential 
infringements -- and worse -- upon U.S. laws and the rights of our 
citizens ," he warns, "is literally endless."
<P>
Gill laments the ease with which a foreign country can "invade the United 
States with its exports and agents, with its products and services -- even 
with its own plants and equipment -- and skim off American capital and 
technology with the help of its American wage slaves." Under the 
circumstances, the United States can no longer "call itself a free and 
independent nation," he concludes. "Any nation that permits foreign 
interests to take over its plants and production, its farmland, and even its 
banks is no longer truly independent. Any nation that sacrifices the jobs 
and livelihood of millions of its citizens in order to absorb billions upon 
billions of dollars in imported goods from Third World countries . . . has 
already surrendered its claim to nationhood. Any nation that has already 
openly acknowledged that its own laws are subject to interpretation -- and 
even cancellation -- by an international tribunal such as the World Trade 
Organization or the United Nations . . . is no longer free."
<P>
Gill points out that our Founding Fathers did not labor under illusions as 
we do today. "In 1776 all Americans knew that King George III and his 
Parliament were the rulers of this country," he observes. "Today we are 
not even permitted to know who the real rulers of the supposedly 
independent USA are, let alone what they are up to in leading us toward 
world government. Along the way toward this goal, they have already 
surrendered our sovereignty in the unholy name of 'free trade.' They have 
also surrendered millions of our best-paying and most secure jobs -no 
less than nine million in the downsizings since 1990." Gill charges that 
our nation's self-destructive trade policy "has been fostered by such 
esoteric groups as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateralists, and 
the super-secret Bilderbergers."
<P>
If we want to save our country, William Gill advises, we must "stop the 
New World Order now -- before the Bilderbergers and other plotters have 
transferred the last vestiges of our sovereignty and independence to the 
United Nations via its subsidiary World Trade Organization." To protect 
American sovereignty, Gill's group, the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade, will soon file lawsuits seeking to nullify NAFTA and 
GATT.

August 2, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>
Good Business
</h2>

<i>The revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the 
everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century are rarely 
recognized.</i>
<p>
"Most businesses exist to make or sell things, not to engage in political or 
social commentary, act as a philanthropic foundation, or even . . . to 
employ people," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Focusing solely on the means by which businesses carry out their basic 
mission -- such as their employment practices, their participation in 
community or cultural life, or their waste management -- distracts us 
from the benefits that businesses confer on society." Writing in the 
August issue of Policy Review, Hood explains that businesses benefit 
society by inventing "new products, new services, new ways of doing 
business more efficiently. This they do better than other social 
institutions, such as governments or charities. And the impact of such 
innovations on our society is massive, often far exceeding the benefits of 
governmental or charitable action."
<p>
Why do so many Americans fail to recognize the enormous contribution 
that businesses make to our individual and general welfare? The 
prejudice of the press and the demagoguery of Democrats deserve much 
of the blame. Hood argues that "journalists and politicians thrive on bad 
news. They continue, for example, to decry the inequality of men and 
women in the workplace, and blast American companies for unfair hiring 
and compensation practices." In doing so, says Hood, they consciously or 
unconsciously ignore the fact that "business innovation historically has 
helped liberate American women. Technological advances have 
promoted greater equity in pay by reducing the value of physical strength 
and increasing the value of mental acuity and social skills, which are 
distributed more evenly between men and women. At the same time, 
labor-saving devices in the home have given married women more 
freedom to pursue education and employment."
<p>
Technological advances have also made the workplace safer, for both 
sexes. Hood notes that "automation and computers have improved 
workplace safety far more than has government regulation or union 
activists. Computers allow employers to track accidents carefully and 
devise solutions to systemic problems."
<p>
For reasons of their own, professional agitators "spend a lot of time 
talking about what they perceive to be the wasteful or destructive 
properties of goods and services, while ignoring their value to 
consumers," Hood charges. He cites one of the more telling examples of 
anti-business bias. "Critics of free enterprise denigrate plastic for being 
nonbiodegradable and polluting," he observes. "Yet, plastic is the 
essential ingredient of many of the products and services that make our 
standard of living possible, such as medical devices, telecommunications, 
wastewater treatment, transportation, safe and tasty food, and computers."
<p>
John Hood laments the fact that, "with few exceptions, those who create 
the amenities we enjoy and the innovations that make our lives safer, 
healthier, and happier toil in relative obscurity." He argues that "the real 
heroes of our age are the innovators who raise our standard of living and 
overcome the fundamental problems of humanity."

August 1, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>
Positives Of Pesticides
</h2>

<i>As usual, the mass media have gotten the story completely backwards. 
Far from threatening our health, the pesticides that control bugs, rodents, 
and plant disease have proven to be a boon to mankind.</i>
<p>
"Pesticides are not scary; they're wonderful. They rank equal to 
pharmaceuticals in saving and extending life. They save the environment, 
they save wildlife, they give the American housewife a roach- and rat-
free home," contends Pat Tigges of the Pacific Northwest Aerial 
Application Education Foundation. Tigges says she is "sick and tired of 
agriculture being on the defensive. We don't have to defend; we should 
be on the offensive," she insists. "Crop production technology has made 
our quality of life the envy of the world."
<p>
Radical environmentalists are winning the propaganda war, however, 
primarily because they've been the only ones waging battle. "The focused 
concerns of a few will take precedence over the unfocused concerns of 
the majority," Tigges warns, unless farmers -- and the American 
consumers whose larders they fill with inexpensive, unspoiled food -- 
fight back. Of particular concern, she says, is "new EPA-recommended 
legislation that would phase out consideration of benefits when 
establishing food-use pesticide tolerances." The net effect would be to 
raise the cost of the food we eat, while lowering its quality.
<p>
"The 'pesticide scare' is not about pesticides," Tigges insists, "it's about 
fear and control." She charges that radical environmentalists "use 
pesticide misinformation to create fear, from which they create a crisis, 
and a crisis generates funds. These funds are not spent saving anything. 
They are spent furthering a political and social agenda. The pseudo-
environmentalist leaders don't want to solve problems. They love 
problems. Problems give them more press, create more fear, and gain 
them credibility and money."
<p>
Fear mongers capitalize on the agricultural ignorance of the average 
American, but that ignorance can be overcome. "We can fight fear in 
children with education," says Tigges. "Children are afraid of the 
unknown. Farm pesticides are an unknown," she observes, "but 
household pesticides are not." Tigges fights fear in children by showing 
them that farm chemicals are similar to "things they touch and use every 
day in their homes. They aren't afraid of mom's shower cleaner; they just 
don't know it's a fungicide. They aren't afraid of pool chlorine; they just 
don't know it's a bactericide."
<p>
It's not just children who are afraid, but their teachers too. That's where 
Pat Tigges and the Pacific Northwest Aerial Application Education 
Foundation come in. "We teach teachers the truth," she explains. "We 
refute all the lies and misinformation that, for the past 30 years, have 
been repeated so often they are taken as truth." The foundation offers 
"continuing education classes, teacher conferences, in-service workshops, 
and structured farm fairs." Tigges and her colleagues come prepared to 
discuss "the history of the environmental movement, man-made vs. 
'natural' biochemistry, organic farming, Alar, and anything else a class 
wants to talk about." They know that minds, like farmland, need to be 
cultivated.

<title> Why It's So Hard To Save -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>Why It's So Hard To Save</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As any economist can tell you, when you subsidize something, you get more of it. Give welfare checks to people who don't work, for example, and the number of people who don't work increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The flip side is equally clear: If you tax something, you get less of it. For example, a few years back the government slapped a "luxury" tax on cabin cruisers and yachts costing more than $100,000. The result: Boat buyers decided not to buy new boats, and several U.S. boat builders went belly up --  throwing their workers into the unemployment line. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Which brings me to the point: Just as taxes on new boats kill demand for new boats, taxes on savings lead Americans to save less. Go ahead, try to squirrel away a few dollars for a rainy day (or a sunny day in Florida or Arizona when you retire). The government will thwart you at every turn, taxing your savings more heavily than just about anything else in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Think about it: Assume you take $1,000 and put it in a certificate of deposit earning 5 percent. After one year, you've earned $50. Now, you already paid steep federal income taxes on that original $1,000 (between 15 percent and 39 percent) when you earned it. But that's not enough. The government taxes your modest $50 gain too, leaving only $30.50 in your pocket if you're in the highest tax bracket.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Welcome to the tax code: You're taxed when you work for your money, and you're taxed again when your money works for you. It's one of the worst features of our tax system, taxing people twice on money they're trying to save.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	About the only way to get some relief from this double tax burden is through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which let you sock away a few dollars and have the money earn interest tax-free.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But IRAs have their limits, the worst being that the government only lets you contribute $2,000 per year. The government also slaps you with a steep penalty if you withdraw the money before Uncle Sam says you can (currently age 59-and-a-half), so forget about using the money to buy a home or cope with a financial emergency. And don't think you can pass the money in your IRA on to your children without going another few rounds with the tax man. The government forces you to start withdrawing the money at age 70-and-a-half so it can collect income taxes again. Then when you die, the money falls prey to estate taxes and, when your children finally receive what's leftover, inheritance taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, that's Washington: It takes a good idea like saving money -- which provides the capital to grow the economy and create jobs -- and piles on so many regulations, penalties, and layers of taxation that saving hardly becomes worth the effort. If there's so little reward for thriftiness, why not spend, spend, spend?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's a better way. A proposal by Tom Kelly, president of the <a href="http://www.savers.org">Savers & Investors League</a> of Villanova, Pa., would eliminate the red tape and double taxation that makes saving so hard. IRAs? In Kelly's view, they're at best a good start. He proposes Individual Investment Accounts, a more muscular savings tool that would let you deposit as much of your money as you want tax free (no $2,000 limit), withdraw it for any purpose (hello new house), withdraw it at any age (early retirement anyone?), and let you pass it on to your children with no inheritance or estate taxes (sorry Uncle Sam, my kids come first).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's not a hard concept to grasp: If you want people to save more, you have to tax their savings less. So no more preaching from politicians about our low national savings rate until they do for savers what they've already done for yacht buyers.

<title>Wasting Your Money -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>Wasting Your Money </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With all the talk in Washington about slashing budgets, cutting deficits and axing federal programs, you'd think it would be hard (or at least harder) to come up with stories about government waste, fraud and abuse. After all, these are the first things Congress and the White House would do something about ... right?	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Wrong. Despite Congress' best efforts to trim the pork, big government is alive and well. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider:<ul>
	<li> Auditors for the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently discovered that the Baltimore Public Housing Authority had purchased eight new Chevy Blazers as take-home cars for its top managers; hired a security firm that employed 29 convicted felons; and sold more than $25 million-worth of contracts for building repairs to contractors, some of whom were friends or relatives of Authority employees, without allowing competitive bidding. In spite of these irregularities, HUD recently awarded the housing authority $115 million more to construct 338 new apartment units.<p>
	<li> According to the General Accounting Office, the official auditing arm of Congress, the U.S. Export-Import Bank gave large bonuses to 200 of its 448 employees -- even though only 10 were eligible. Of five federal agencies reviewed for such "bonus abuse," the Ex-Im Bank had the smallest work force -- but accounted for one-quarter of all bonuses government-wide! <p>
	<li> The brothers Alfonso Jr. (Alfie) and Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, citizens of Spain, are two of America's richest sugar barons. Their fortune is estimated at $500 million. Because they are considered "domestic growers," the Fanjul brothers also are "entitled" to a government-enforced import-protection subsidy that adds about eight cents per pound to the cost of the sugar we buy. How much of our money are the Fanjul brothers pulling in from this subsidy each year? A cool $65 million.<p>
	<li> Financial mismanagement in the District of Columbia is legendary. In 1994, for example, Lloyd Arrington Jr., president of the city-funded Economic Development Finance Corporation (EDFC), collected a $17,000 bonus on top of his $70,000 salary, another $1,650 for parking and $600 for rented formal wear, dinners and entertainment. By the time his now nine-year old EDFC -- created to loan money to promising businesses 3/4 was audited in 1994, it had made only 17 loans, or less than two per year.<p>
	<li> HUD (again) funded and sponsored a "training session" for 260 public housing tenants and HUD employees in 1995 -- at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort! "We promise you a vacation that will be unforgettable!! Casinos for Dads. Beaches, Swimming, Snorkeling, Dancing & Touring etc. ... for youths. Exotic Shopping, Beauty Salon for complete pampering for Moms. Appetizing, Savory, Delicious foods for the Family Meals," read the invitation. Cost to taxpayers for a "training session" later found by the HUD Inspector General to lack "programmatic substance" (in other words, it was a boondoggle)? $325,000.<p>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's more -- much more. Like the new $373 million air-traffic-control system -- installed at 16 airports and destined for 47 -- that has suffered frequent shutdowns and failures. It has failed nearly once a week at Washington's National Airport. Or the Public Health Service physician who complained recently to <i>The Washington Post</i> that he is being paid $117,000 per year, plus a $15,000 bonus, to do absolutely no work at all. He made the front page. Or the $280,000 taxpayer-funded study now getting underway in Seattle to determine if a chemical widely used in sexual lubricants makes sex safer for homosexuals. Yes, you read that correctly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe now you can understand why Congress was willing to go to the mat with the administration -- to the point of allowing the government to shut down temporarily -- over federal spending. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These horror stories are just a few of the boondoggles that have been uncovered. Just think what remains hidden from view. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h3>Truth in Testimony</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html"> Edwin Feulner </a><br>

August 22, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is it that only liberals care about children and the needy, while conservatives seem more concerned about the well-being of defense contractors? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I ask this loaded question because it says a lot about the advocacy game as it is now played across America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While many groups and organizations do essential, valuable work in communities across the nation -- often without credit or notice -- many national "charity" groups have their hands in the pockets of taxpayers. But this is okay because they "care." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the recent "Stand for Children" rally in Washington, organized by the Children's Defense Fund and led by Marian Wright Edelman,  a good friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and a leading proponent of the spend-more school of social welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The CDF's idea was flawless. By using the theme "Stand for Children," CDF made it almost impossible for anyone to question its agenda: more government spending. To do so would appear, "against children." By dubbing this approach "non-partisan," the stage was set for a liberal welfare establishment-media lovefest, with conservatives as the main course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives didn't roll over and accept defeat. Instead we showed that the liberals' motives are not always as pure as they would have us believe. In the case of the "Stand for Children" rally, many of the organizations pushing the rally are on the public take -- receiving a grand total of at least $392 million in taxpayer funding in fiscal year 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No wonder these groups argue so passionately about the need for greater federal funding and are so vicious in attacking anyone who might question it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, these are the very same groups that line up to testify whenever Congress holds hearings on whether welfare spending should be cut. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If that sounds like a conflict of interest, that's because it is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What makes the scam possible is that these groups are not required to reveal the fact that they are feasting at the public trough. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An organization might be getting 90 percent of its money directly from the federal government, and it can still go before Congress -- and the TV cameras -- and argue for more money for this program or that, without ever revealing that it is a recipient of federal funds. No wonder the welfare states keeps expanding. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's no need for a new law, no need for the president to sign legislation to rectify this situation. All the Senate and House of Representatives have to do is change their own rules so that all advocates before Congress must state how much money they receive from the government. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under such a "Truth in Testimony" rule, representatives of, say, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) appearing before House and Senate committees would be required to disclose that their organization received $76 million from the federal government in 1993. This just might tend to shed a new light on AARP's heart-rending requests for more spending on programs for the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Similarly, union officials testifying on behalf of federal job training programs would have to reveal that their unions receive millions of dollars each year to administer these very programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe some day the media might even catch on and report on the vested interests of many who regale Congress with pitiful tales of welfare woe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Until then, taxpayers should demand that lawmakers ask tax-funded "charities" two simple questions: "What's in it for you?" and "How much is it going to cost the taxpayers?" These are two questions Congress and the media have ignored, at least so far.
<p>

<h3> Socially Responsible Business </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
July 25, 1996
<br>

	The tragic ValuJet crash this spring, according to critics of corporate America, shows once again how the profit motive devalues and debases our society. If only ValuJet management hadn't cut corners to squeeze every possible nickel out of the system, the critics argue, the tragedy never would have happened. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Against this backdrop, let me recommend a new book to you: John Hood's "The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good," published a few weeks ago by the Free Press. Hood's book continues an important discussion launched some 35 years ago by the late John Chamberlain in "The Enterprising Americans." Chamberlain's book was a portrait of the towering figures of American enterprise -- the "robber barons," some called them -- who made America the great innovative industrial power it remains today: Eli Whitney, Samuel Morse, Cyrus McCormack, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Chamberlain's point was simple: That the achievements of American business should inspire all of us, as he put it, "not because the pursuit of business is a sanctified end in itself but because it palpably makes the achievements of higher ends possible." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But do GM, Hewlett-Packard, K- Mart, TWA, Wendy's and other U.S. corporations have a responsibility to society beyond providing goods and services and generating profits?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Advocates of corporate "social responsibility" -- popular on college campuses, in Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlors, at Grateful Dead smoke-ins, and in government regulatory agencies -- argue that companies have an obligation to fight injustice, promote the public's health, diversify the workplace, eradicate poverty and save the planet, either directly, through corporate philanthropy or (most typically) by order of Big Brother. 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While most of these are worthy goals, Hood demonstrates, as Chamberlain did before him, that business does more good for more people in more ways simply by sticking to business. In a Policy Review article previewing his book, Hood put it like this: "The corporate social-responsibility movement harbors an unrealistic, ahistorical view of commercial activity," focusing on disasters and villains, while ignoring "the revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider just one small example: the U.S. gold-mining industry. As economist Michael Evans of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management noted in a recent Las Vegas Review-Journal article, "private investment, new technologies and enlightened management" have turned the state of Nevada into the world's fourth-largest gold producer over the past 15 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The industry now provides nearly 60,000 high-paying jobs in the state, is known for its "unmatched educational, health and other benefits," and  pays some $120 million per year in state and county taxes. The industry also has spent billions of dollars on equipment built by other U.S. companies, generating additional jobs in other states. With the world demand for gold soaring, even better days could lie ahead.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Except for one fact: Washington doesn't appreciate the contributions of this "heroic enterprise." The government has restricted exploration, discouraged investment and placed a variety of other regulatory burdens on the industry. The net result: If current policies are not reversed, 40,000 mining-related jobs will disappear over the next decade. In two decades, the industry itself will disappear, according to Evans' research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In many ways, the corporate social-responsibility movement is a red herring. As Hood notes, the best corporate citizens are those who create the jobs and amenities we enjoy and "the innovations that make our lives safer, healthier and happier."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I hope you will read Hood's "Heroic Enterprise." It will restore your faith in our system.
<p>

<h3> Dumb And Dumber</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>

July 25, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A certain Mr. Wade Miller of  New Mexico recently called Atlanta's Olympic committee to buy tickets for the Summer Olympics.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"I'm sorry, sir," the voice on the other line replied. "I can't sell tickets to someone outside the United States."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yep -- you heard correctly. The sales office of the U. S. Olympic Committee didn't know that "New Mexico" isn't part of old Mexico. Though he tried, Mr. Miller could convince neither the operator -- nor her supervisor! -- that New Mexico is one of the 50 United States of America. The supervisor, getting on the line when Mr. Miller insisted, told him (you can just hear her tone), "Sir, new Mexico, old Mexico -- it doesn't matter. You still have to go through your country's Olympic Committee." 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When reporters from a Santa Fe newspaper asked for tickets, they were told -- once again -- to contact the Mexican consulate.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When I hear stories like this, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. At first, of course, I laugh -- I mean, it is funny after all. But then I start thinking about why it's funny. And then, I become a little more pensive. If people with so little basic knowledge are able to get jobs with the U.S. Olympic Committee -- as supervisors no less! -- it makes me wonder how many other people like this there are out there, and where they work. A nuclear reactor, maybe? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason we laugh, of course, is because something we all secretly know has been exposed without warning, in all its irony: Our "education system" is now so bad it no longer transmits even the most basic knowledge to a great many people. And those people are becoming such a large proportion of the population that they now show up as employees of organizations as prestigious as the U.S. Olympic Committee.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm not exaggerating or overreacting here. I have a friend who used to be a television news reporter, who once took his camera and crew to the University of Maryland. He wanted to ask university students simple, basic knowledge questions in categories like geography, history, math and science to see whether they knew things anyone at that educational level ought to know. Some of the answers he got will make a believer out of anyone.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two female students tried for a full minute to come up with the formula for finding the area of a rectangle, and finally gave up with embarrassed giggles. One young man couldn't say what part of the world Poland is in. Another simply walked away when asked what, for him, was apparently the stump question: Who was president of the United States during the Civil War?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"What three powers did we fight against in World War II?" was one question. To be fair, my friend says a few came up with the correct answer, with a few hints along the way: Germany, Italy and Japan. Then there was the young man who said, in a confident tone (my friend tells me this is a direct quote): "Well, the first one, I know, is Russia. The second one is Korea. And the third one, I understand, is Pearl Harbor."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pearl Harbor? What on earth is going on here? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A student at a major U.S. university, and he not only can't answer a simple history question every American should be able to answer -- he doesn't even understand what is said to him? Pearl Harbor isn't a "power." It's a little country in the middle of the Atlantic; everybody knows that!
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have to wonder who signed a certificate of graduation from high school for this young man. What "educator" admitted him to a university? And how did he stay there, after he got there?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The answer is simple, and not funny: He's a product of the same politically correct, "socially conscious" educators who have presided over the decline in American education during the past three decades. The reason they have resisted all change in their approach to education is also their great secret: they see this decline as a positive good. After all, academic excellence is just a form of elitism. It will be a great stride forward for social equality when everyone is on the same, dumbed down intellectual level. 	 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What I want to know is: Who should District of Columbia residents call to get tickets to the Olympics? Atlanta -- or Bogota?

<h3> Politicking On The Workers' Dime</h3>
By Edwin Feulner<br>
President,  <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 27, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The silly season, otherwise known as the fall elections, is fast approaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And once again, one of the greatest travesties in American politics will be played out: Millions of Americans will be forced to help candidates and promote political positions they don't agree with. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How can such a thing happen in modern-day America? After all, isn't this the land of the free? Not if you're a rank-and-file union member in most states.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For years, big labor has engaged in one of the most undemocratic practices imaginable: using the dues workers must pay to the union as a condition of employment for partisan politicking. This year, with a friend of big labor in the White House, union officials are being more open about it. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney announced a few months ago that his organization would pump $35 million (seven times the amount unions usually spend on elections) into a nationwide campaign to unseat Republican congressmen he considers hostile to organized labor. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two-thirds of the $35 million Sweeney plans to spend defeating Republican officeholders will come from a special "tax" that was imposed on union members in March. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia do not have right-to-work laws. This means working people can be forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment. If they don't like the political choices of union officials, they're out of luck.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The money that organized labor admits spending on partisan politics is vastly overshadowed by various "in-kind" expenditures unions make on behalf of candidates or causes. The late, great labor reporter Victor Riesel several years ago estimated that big labor spends $10 on political mailings, phone banks and other "in-kind" services for every dollar it openly spends on elections. You do the math.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Virtually all this money goes to Democratic candidates and incumbents. Yet, in 1994, exit polls found that 40 percent of union members voted Republican, for the very pro-family, tax-cutting, budget-balancing Republicans Sweeney and his colleagues have targeted for defeat. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So what's  a union member to do? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For starters he or she may seek inspiration from a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In  the case of <i>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</i>, union member Harry Beck objected to the fact that his union dues were being used to fund political activities he didn't support. Beck challenged his union and won. The court ruled that union members can get refunds on that portion of their dues not devoted to costs associated with collective bargaining. In Beck's case, "that portion" was found to be 80 cents out of every dollar. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, when President Clinton took office, he weakened the impact of the Beck decision by rescinding former President Bush's order that required notices be posted in the workplaces of federal contractors, notifying workers of their rights under Beck. Clinton ordered the notices be torn down. So much for being on the side of workers!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Union politicking is nothing new and unions have a right to participate in the electoral process. However, fair-minded citizens should ask whether it is just to force union members to pay for political activities--including helping candidates--with which they may not agree. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is not a partisan issue. If you're a liberal or a Democrat, all you have to ask yourself is how you would react if the tables were turned: How would you feel if John Sweeney planned to spend $35 million in coerced union dues to help Newt Gingrich and his allies? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	You'd be pretty angry.<p>

<h3>Tune in to Talk Radio</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 27, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Americans who think there's a liberal lilt to the news reporting they hear and read every day no longer have to rely on us cranky conservatives for affirmation. The evidence is now overwhelming. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When asked their political philosophy in a recent survey, 61 percent of 139 Washington bureau chiefs and congressional correspondents said "liberal" or "moderate to liberal." Just 9 percent said "conservative" or "moderate to conservative." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Almost nine out of 10--89 percent--said they voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. This compares to just 7 percent for George Bush and 2 percent for Ross Perot. As for party affiliation, 50 percent said they were Democrats, just 4 percent Republicans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As for journalists nationwide, 56 percent of the 2,703 surveyed in a huge Los Angeles Times poll conducted in 1985 called themselves "very liberal" or "somewhat liberal." Just 18 percent said they were "very conservative" or "somewhat conservative." Several other studies by media analysts Robert and Linda Lichter, among others, have shown substantially the same. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Does this necessarily mean journalists allow their political beliefs to bias their news coverage? Of course not. But it sure raises certain suspicions when these cool, detached "professionals" get things wrong in a way that makes the conservative Congress look bad and the liberal White House look good. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Take just one example: the debate last year over reforming Medicare, the health-care system for America's 37 million senior citizens. Everyone by now knows that Medicare is rapidly going bankrupt and has to be reformed: There is no choice in the matter. But when conservatives <I>tried to slow down the built-in rate of increase</I> in Medicare spending--not cut spending, mind you, just slow down the rate at which costs are going up--congressional liberals accused them of making mean-spirited "cuts" that would hurt the elderly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did the media respond? Although reporters were shown repeatedly that over seven years Medicare spending would increase by $100 billion over and above current levels--from $4,900 to $7,100 per person--the vast majority of media reports told readers and viewers that the conservative plan would "cut" Medicare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Backtrack three years, to the debate over President Clinton's liberal health-care reform scheme. That plan would have increased Medicare spending at the same rate as the 1995 congressional plan. Yet, the media didn't assail the president for "cutting" Medicare. Like congressional conservatives, President Clinton took pains to make it clear his administration wasn't "cutting" the program, saying: "Medicare [is] going up at three times the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare cut." The media took the president's explanation at face value. Two years later, they pounced on Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The double standard has become so obvious few bother to deny it. In fact, many observers are beginning to recognize that the "talk radio" phenomenon has come about precisely because there is such a wide gulf between what people know to be true and what the media frequently tell us is true. Would Rush Limbaugh have 20 million listeners if Americans had been hearing both sides of the issues for the past several decades? I doubt it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Talk radio is the steam valve for political discourse in contemporary America. Liberals--not consciously, but effectively nonetheless--have been holding down the lid for decades. But the pressure became too great. Liberals stopped paying attention to one little outlet--AM radio--and all the steam came blasting out in a "rush" (sorry, I couldn't resist).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 So next time a news report gives you the sneaking suspicion that the reporter is spending too much time chatting with Kennedy clones at liberal cocktail parties, you're probably right. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, for some balance, tune in to talk radio.

<h3>"It's The Economy, Stupid," Circa 1996</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Presidential advisor James Carville, the highly regarded Democratic political operative from Louisiana's bayou country, helped keep the 1992 Clinton campaign in focus and "on message" with a simple four-word phrase, "It's the economy, stupid."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the White House is smart, this will not be its theme in 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Though the White House and national media have been trumpeting the economy's "unexpectedly strong" (as The Washington Post put it) 2.8 percent first-quarter gain, this is modest growth by normal standards -- and voters remain uneasy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Flash back four years: With the American economy just emerging from a two-year recession in the fall of 1992 and many Americans nervous about their economic prospects, Carville's one-note samba -- played over and over again throughout the campaign -- clearly helped propel Bill Clinton into the White House, forcing George Bush to retire to his beloved Texas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now it's Bill Clinton's turn to run for re-election. And though the economy is not moving backward (the definition of a recession), it's not setting any speed records either. Fifty percent of major U.S. companies trimmed their payrolls in the 12 months ending June 1995, some of them significantly. Indeed, from March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The public -- especially the nearly 8 million people who are working two or more jobs to make ends meet -- know something is amiss. And they are concerned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration's initial response was a mix of denial and cheerleading: the silly claim that the economy is the healthiest it's been in 30 years. The White House has had the good sense to back off a bit from this claim.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A new study shows why.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">study</a> was conducted by economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> using a highly reliable computer model of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What the model does is simulate economic activity. By feeding the many "variables" that affect the economy into the model -- from changes in tax and budget policy to data on population growth and other demographic factors -- a seasoned economic forecaster can predict future economic activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beach and Hodge turned the clock back to January 1993, before the new administration pushed the $241 billion tax hike through the 103rd Congress. Without getting into all of the mind-numbing technical details, they then ran the model on "fast-forward," asking it to tell them what the economy would look like today if tax and budget policy had not been changed in 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What they found was not good news for the White House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They found that another 1.2 million Americans would have jobs today if the economy hadn't been saddled with the tax increase. They learned that the U.S. auto industry would have built and sold an additional 1.1 million new cars and light trucks. And they learned that the typical U.S. wage-earner would have taken home an additional $2,600 in after-tax income.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The big numbers are equally disturbing. For example: The overall U.S. economy would have grown an additional $208 billion between 1993 and 1996. And business investment -- the key factor in creating jobs -- would have been $42.5 billion higher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While there has been some quibbling about the exact details of the Beach/Hodge findings, the overall thrust of their work remains unchallenged: Tax hikes hurt, and the huge 1993 tax hike hurt big time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If the Clinton administration wonders why American workers are still uneasy about the economy, they should tell the White House: "It's the tax hike, stupid!"
<p>

<h3>Your Right To Know</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a>
<br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. 	Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government  --  and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called "The Right To Know Payroll Form."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "Right To Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans With Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security.        
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. 	Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look moneywise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out  --  in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right To Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, all the rest is taken out  --  Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92.  	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government  --  much of it before they even know about it  --  they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Are Conservatives Winning Or Losing? -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>ARE CONSERVATIVES WINNING OR LOSING?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, many Americans thought it was time to dance on the grave of big government. Instead, conservatives themselves bogged down in a bitter eight-year political war with dozens of special interests -- from farmers to welfare workers -- who depend on big government for their livelihoods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When conservatives took control of Congress in 1994, many of us again thought we had scored a victory for smaller government. Wrong again. President Clinton gave as good -- or better -- than he got from the new Congress. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, over the past year big government has continued to get bigger. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't until the president's 1996 State of the Union declaration that "the era of big government is over," that I truly began to believe conservatives finally had won. After all, when an opponent is forced to mouth words he doesn't believe, words that go 180 degrees in the direction opposite his political leanings, in short, the very words his opponents have been saying, this is when he has lost the war -- at least the rhetorical war -- the war of ideas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives will have to fight tooth and nail for every inch of territory they gain in the next few years. Liberalism has not surrendered; and we'd be naive to expect it to. After all, it's just too much fun spending other people's money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, those Americans who were really paying attention had a rude awakening following President Clinton's grand declaration about big government's demise. Untrue to his word, the president's first request to the returning Congress was for $8 billion in new spending for the current fiscal year. His fiscal year 1997 budget offered more of the same: a $358 billion increase over the levels proposed in Congress' seven-year balanced budget plan. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All these efforts will have to be strenuously opposed, and in years to come, gleefully overturned. In the meantime, conservatives will have to buckle down and think about what it means to govern. After all, the Republican Congress has encountered some rough going of late. Is this any surprise? Legislative governance -- that is, passing laws that do what you want them to do -- is not easy. It's like trying to herd cats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatives are unaccustomed to running Congress; they've been backbenchers for decades. This requires an adjustment. It requires a period of learning. There is nothing inherently disgraceful in the failure that comes from such learning -- except not learning.  	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, the conservative agenda articulated in the House GOP's Contract with America remains largely unfulfilled. Perhaps too much was attempted. Perhaps compromise was dismissed too easily in the fervent desire for real change. Perhaps the message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media. These are understandable, forgivable mistakes. I say learn and move on.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What do conservatives need to learn? For starters, when they campaign against each other in primaries, they have to stop attacking other conservatives for espousing great conservative ideas. For example, the defining issue of the 1996 presidential campaign should have been -- and still could be -- the <a href="/heritage/taxsite">flat tax</a>. One candidate, so intent upon defeating flat-tax candidate Steve Forbes that he was willing to say practically anything, called the flat tax idea "nonsense." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tell that to Hong Kong, whose flat-tax economy has been the most consistently expanding in the world for the last 30 years! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax is one of the most marketable, most urgently needed -- by Americans of all income levels -- ideas conservatives have proposed in decades. Yet, in their pursuit of political gain, conservative candidates obscured the issue in a flurry of flying fur. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatism's message has been confused in the past year, by the rough and tumble of Washington politics. But that can be remedied. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberalism's message, on the other hand, has become utterly irrelevant to America's aspirations and values. It is beyond redemption. That's why liberals have to cloak themselves in conservative rhetoric just to get a hearing. This bodes well for the future of America. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The principles of conservatism -- free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values and a strong national defense -- don't change in the middle of a presidential election or a budget battle. They don't change whether Republicans are in power or Democrats are in power or whether that power is shared, as is presently the case.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I am optimistic about conservatism because what we believe is enduring. I am optimistic because liberalism is a disaster that can no longer be disguised. I am optimistic because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not wishful thinking. And I am optimistic because people genuinely want to get this country back on the right track. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America.

<title>Clinton's War on the Armed Forces - Heritage Commentary
</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Clinton's War on the Armed Forces</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	President Clinton has said, "the era of big government is over." But so far, it looks like it's over for only one area of government -- national defense. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration is looking for a 6 percent cut in the 1997 defense budget. While that may not seem like much, it will further starve an already hungry armed forces wizened by nearly a decade of consecutive budget cuts.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider this: The president wants to cut procurement  -- purchasing of parts, machinery and equipment our troops use in the field on a daily basis -- by $3.4 billion. Yet, when adjusted for inflation, procurement is at its lowest level since the beginning of the Korean War. It hasn't been trimmed -- it's been hacked with a meat cleaver, by more than two-thirds in the last 10 years.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now some of you may be thinking, "Hey, the Cold War is over. Communists are now nothing more than cabana boys in third rate dictator-run countries like Cuba. What could be wrong with a major downsizing of our military? The United States doesn't need to be a super power when there is no other super power to worry about."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The only problem with this line of thinking is that while the magnitude of danger may be less -- no one threatens us with total annihilation the way the Soviet Union once did -- the volatility of danger is much greater. Rogue nations working to obtain nuclear and chemical weapons -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- don't care if the United States is a super power. All they care about is bullying their way onto the world stage -- and they're getting the weapons to do it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recognition of this, the Clinton administration itself has said that the United States needs to be able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously. Yet, the White House has failed to provide the funding that would enable the Pentagon to meet this goal. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition to procurement, the Pentagon's "operations and maintenance" budget is being bled to death -- siphoned off into areas not related to combat readiness. Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia between 1992 and 1995 have cost American taxpayers some $6.6 billion. None of these missions contributed one iota to U.S. security.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the American military is being weakened by starvation. Consider: In 1995 the Pentagon was not allowed to buy a single new tank. By the year 2005, every tank in the Army will be older than the soldiers driving them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't too long ago taxpayers were told that Pentagon chiefs favored hammers costing hundreds of dollars and toilet seats that should have been gold plated for what we paid for them. There was no excuse, of course, for such excess. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But essential investments in the day-to-day operations of our fighting men and women --  and combat readiness -- should not be confused with the waste of the past.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	President Clinton does the armed forces a disservice when our soldiers and sailors go without essential training because equipment is broken and there are no parts to fix it. Pentagon chiefs are now regaled with stories of maintenance crews "cannibalizing" other pieces of equipment to make Band-Aid repairs on equipment that has worn out.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton administration wouldn't have committed the United States to being able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously if military planners didn't consider such a scenario -- say in Korea and the Middle East, for example -- a distinct possibility. But if the Pentagon isn't given the training, equipment, spare parts and supplies it needs, it can't fulfill this mission.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or, our fighting men and women can be thrown into the middle of a conflict without the proper support, and we can just hope for the best.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is this the administration's military strategy?   <P>

	Liberal activists once again have used the occasion of Earth Day to scare people into believing the environment is in such bad shape that more government programs are needed to "protect" us. One favorite theme is the alleged global population explosion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the last five years alone, U.S. newspapers and magazines have published more than 7,200 articles on this subject. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, the latest rave in environmental circles is a new book claiming a devastating drop in male fertility over the past half-century, threatening our very ability to reproduce. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OK, so which is it? Are we about to overpopulate ourselves to death, or die out as a species? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As most Americans realize, environmentalists are constantly sounding the alarm about something or other. Fortunately, most of us know instinctively that a healthy dose of skepticism is in order -- that the doomsday stories are a bunch of baloney (itself alleged to be a health hazard, because of the chemical preservatives in the meat).  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all of the stories involve highly complex scientific issues that a nonscientist can't possibly understand. Which is why its so important to put things in perspective. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The newest "danger" on the horizon involves a somewhat racy subject: sperm. According to the new book, various chemicals in our diets and environment are wrecking havoc with our genetic material, lowering global sperm counts to dangerously low levels and threatening the future of life itself -- man and animal alike.   
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the overheated publicity materials being sent out by the New York publisher, studies have documented "as much as a 50 percent drop in human sperm counts over the last 50 years." Oh really?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Predictably, supporting the book's claims (here's where perspective is important) are some of the same people who have been hollering the loudest about global overpopulation, urging the United States to support United Nations and Planned Parenthood birth-control efforts. Now, instead of financing condoms for Chile and Chad, America is supposed to do something about the fertility deficit in Fiji and France.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is precisely the kind of contradictory flip-flop confusion that raises skepticism about the entire environmental movement.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, the agenda of environmental alarmists is the same as it has always been: Convince the American people that modern chemicals are deadly and evil and stampede the government into spending more money on more programs that will further restrict our choices and freedom.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bottom line, of course, is that environmentalists can't have it both ways. We can't have a global population explosion and a fertility crisis at the same time. As Mr. Spock of "Star Trek" might put it, "It doesn't compute."

<title>Drifting Toward a Taiwan Crisis - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>DRIFTING TOWARD A TAIWAN CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 8, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a blatant show of intimidation, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is now firing missiles at targets just miles from Taiwan's largest cities.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The missiles are intended to undermine the Republic of China on Taiwan's democratic government -- which will hold its first-ever presidential election on March 23.  
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And why shouldn't the PRC feel perfectly free to bully one of America's best friends in Asia and its 7th-largest trading partner? After all, the Clinton administration has done little to give China pause as to the consequences of such acts. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, instead of clearly spelling out what America's response would be if the communist Chinese attack Taiwan -- thus discouraging such aggressive acts -- the blundering Clinton foreign policy team has lent encouragement to the Chinese. For example, an unnamed State Department official told U.S. News & World Report last October that U.S. military action was unlikely. "We would not be in a position to react with force," the official was quoted as saying. "We would not elect to do that, I'm sure," he added.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Certainly not. Of course, a 12-year-old could figure out that even if this were true -- which it shouldn't be -- you don't go telling a potential adversary about it. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration not only shouldn't be saying such things, this should not be its policy either. The administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan, period. Nor should it rule out the use of force if the Chinese decide on such a reckless course. In fact, instead of standing by while the PRC lobs missiles in Taiwan's direction, the United States should be holding naval exercises in the region: to send a message of our own. Instead, when the U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz made a run through the Taiwan Strait in December, administration officials -- who could have just kept their mouths shut! -- were quick to assure all parties that the move was due to inclement weather in the Pacific. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By failing to tell China's leaders where America stands, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could enslave the citizens of Free China, place every U.S. ally in Asia at risk, and wipe out what little confidence our Asian allies might still have in our reliability in a crisis. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before it's too late, President Clinton must make sure Beijing understands that America feels a moral obligation to defend Taiwan, and that it will do so, come what may. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After all, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act -- U.S. law -- states that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States." The president should reaffirm that it will regard violations of Taiwan's rights as a threat to U.S. security and will act accordingly. He should tell China it could face not only severe economic sanctions -- ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo -- but also the full military might of the United States.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Such steps should be taken now, before the real shooting starts. After it starts, America can only lose. Even if a PRC-initiated attack on Taiwan didn't spread any further -- and there's no guarantee that it wouldn't -- China would have successfully challenged America's ability to protect its allies. Other challenges would follow, in Asia and elsewhere.      
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, the reason China is threatening to come to blows is that it's scared of tiny Taiwan. Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States last June -- to speak at a class reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University -- China has been rattling its saber. Chinese amphibious and airborne military assault exercises involving 20,000 troops, 40 ships and 100 aircraft -- designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan -- preceded the island's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway now. China fears that Taiwan will be seen as a model for political reform on the mainland, and is resentful of Taiwan's growing economic prosperity, based on a Western-style free market. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most portentous of all, the PRC may be preparing for a more decisive confrontation with Taiwan in the future. In a speech Jan. 30, Premiere Li Peng said that "During the period [1996-2000] ... settling the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese people." Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that "the important role to be played by the Army in taking back Taiwan," was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the face of such challenges, President Clinton so far has chosen to hide his head in the sand. This makes America appear weak, not just to China, but to Taiwan and our other Asian allies as well. If America doesn't even have the nerve to talk tough to China before a crisis erupts, why should anyone believe we would defend Taiwan with force in the event of an attack? 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There need not be a military crisis over Taiwan. All it would take to insure that it doesn't come would be some tough talk and a little saber rattling of our own. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What's so hard about that?    
<p>

<h3>WHY THE BUDGET DEBATE MATTERS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 15, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CBO, OMB, baseline budgeting, reductions in the rate of 
growth.  To most Americans the budget battle between Congress and the White House has been 
impenetrable, a duel over accounting methods "explained" in acronyms only the initiated can 
understand.  No wonder many Americans are tuning out, or worse, focusing on the only part of 
the debate they can grasp -- the partisan sniping.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a shame. The budget debate is the most important 
political discussion this nation has had in a generation -- a debate over what kind of country we 
want the United States to be.  On one side are those who want the federal government to possess 
unlimited resources, the better to fix every conceivable social problem the country might face.  
For debate purposes, these are the liberals. On the other side are those who believe the federal 
government's power should be strictly limited, the better to preserve personal freedom and allow 
individuals to keep what they earn.  These are the conservatives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The budget is the battlefield on which these two visions for 
America clash, and no issue highlights the divide between these two camps more boldly than 
taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For conservatives, the tax issue boils down to one simple 
question: Whose money is it anyway? If, as conservatives believe, the money people earn 
belongs to them, then taxes should be kept as low as possible.  Which means current tax rates 
need to be cut.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Liberals focus on a different question: How will tax cuts 
affect Treasury receipts?  The measure of tax "fairness" is not whether Americans are forced to 
pay too much, but whether the government has all the "revenue" it needs to run its myriad social 
programs. In this view, the American people not only have a duty to pay steep taxes, but should 
feel honored for the opportunity to help create utopia right here in the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Or take another hot-button issue: welfare.  The debate is not 
about "ending welfare as we know it," as the president vowed to do during the 1992 campaign.  
In truth, we all want to end welfare as we know it: liberals, by increasing spending on a variety 
of programs that, after the Great Society's many failures, will finally (they hope) replace welfare 
with work;  conservatives, by spending less and weaning people off their dependence on 
"compassionate" government.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On foreign policy,  the budget debate casts into stark relief 
serious differences over America's role in the world. It's probably true, as liberals claim, that they 
do not view America as the world's policeman.  In reality it's worse: They view America as an 
international welfare agency whose social workers (read: soldiers) can and should criss-cross the 
globe doing good deeds like keeping peace and building nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	None of this is said to disparage liberals as people.  With 
the best intentions they have guided -- or misguided -- our national policies for the better part of 
the 20th century.  But now liberalism is choking on its own political success.  It's overarching 
goal -- a vast federal government mobilized to redress all social ills -- has been achieved, but at 
the cost of almost $80,000 in public debt for every family in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite its continuing failure at the polls, liberalism refuses 
to go quietly.  In the current budget battle,  liberals have ruthlessly employed the only weapons 
remaining in their arsenal: fear and distortion.  For example, the proposed Republican balanced 
budget calls for a 7 percent annual increase in Medicare spending; liberals portray this as a 
"cruel" cut.  GOP efforts to return power and responsibility to the states are portrayed as a secret 
scheme to kill school lunches or hurt the poor.  And plans to rein in the spiraling costs of 
Medicare, which is heading for bankruptcy as sure as this is 1996, is depicted as an attempt to 
deny health-care benefits to the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is that kind of misrepresentation that betrays the fatigue 
liberalism is feeling these days.  It has no new ideas to offer, no agenda other than preserving the 
status quo.  For this reason the current budget battle may very well be one of the last debates in 
which 1960s-style liberalism even has a voice.
<p>

We were 35 minutes ahead of TWA Flight 800 on the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But for a whim, we would have been on the later plane. A TWA flight to Rome, departing within minutes of ours, was cancelled. The Rome passengers were put aboard TWA Flight 800, to make connections in Paris. We were not aboard TWA because, at the last minute, our travel agent found a bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Close friends and family knew of our destination, but few knew whether we were flying with Delta or TWA. When we arrived in Todi, our hostess had been up most of the night, fielding calls from our friends in America -- wanting to know what she knew.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She had verified with a kindly Italian airline clerk that we were indeed on the Delta flight, that our names were on the manifest, that we probably watched "Grumpier Old Men" on the inflight movie. He reassured her and she relayed the news to America. We didn't learn of the TWA crash until we arrived in Todi.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We settled into the enchanting stone house overlooking the Umbrian hills, and called home. We thought our family would like to hear our voices. We knew we wanted to hear theirs. We spent the next few days and nights swinging helplessly between polarities of alternating emotions, haunted by images of a plane exploding, plunging through the night into the dark sea, taking with it 230 men, women and children -- fathers, mothers, daughters, sons who would never see another day.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Frugality saved our lives. At least that's what we told ourselves. But we could not escape the eternal question, a soulful and frightening version of the tragic challenge: Why us? Or more to the point, why not us? Frugality is not a virtue that spares lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Indeed, the night after we arrived in Todi we went out to an especially fine, and expensive Italian restaurant and there we spent far more on food than we saved with the bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Whatever we do now suddenly feels strange and precious. We are like children tasting a fresh fig for the first time, discovering the extraordinary in a blade of grass, a clay cup, a barking dog, the crunching sound made by the tires against the stones in the dirt road, the shapes of the white clouds scurrying across the sky as they begin to turn a beautiful shade of gray.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Everything is beautiful. Everything counts. We can't settle for the commonplace experience of a vacation. This vacation must mean something more. We feel compelled to testify to life, to our senses, to our appreciation of the world in all the wondrous variety of God's infinite gifts to man.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We celebrate with fresh bread and old wine, the trivial and the contemplative. Whatever we look upon and listen to is nourishment for the soul, linking us with others through succor and sustenance.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Umbria is a special place to think about the inexplicable. Its earthy colors, punctuated by acres of sunflowers and threaded with cypress trees, is a region of gentle, verdant, undulating hills and valleys where St. Francis of Assisi fed the birds. He was a man of prayer and penitence whose poetry in praise of all living things is a lesson to us still.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We rediscover the Sistine Chapel at St. Peter's. We look at Michelangelo's glorious fresco of God giving life to man. God barely touches man's fingertips and the spirit is suddenly tangible. We stand in awe of the vividness of the image, now illuminated in a gorgeous restoration of color. We ask again the eternal questions that haunt every thoughtful man and woman tormented for the answers to the questions about the meaning of life and death.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We do not find the answers. We say a silent prayer for the passengers aboard TWA Flight 800 and mourn with their families. We leave the Sistine Chapel chastened and uplifted, sobered if not wiser. The forces of evil and terror wound deeply and destroy with enormous power, but such dark forces ultimately have no power to smash the human spirit. <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<font size=7>Conservatism can close<BR>
Dole's gender gap</font><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is obsessed with the gender gap. All the pundits inside the Beltway say so. His gaffes, his turn-arounds, his flip-flops, his misspoken attitudes and waffles over abortion, the assault weapons ban, and a less-than-enthusiastic attempt to trash the affirmative action quota schemes that discriminate against the innocent, are meant to reach out to the women's vote.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>They aren't working. He's looking through the wrong end of the telescope. He's right to show tolerance for those with different opinions on abortion. His choice of Rep. Susan Molinari, an unusual one, as the keynote speaker at least sharply contrasts to the Democrats who wouldn't let Bob Casey, a former governor of Pennsylvania, even talk about his pro-life convictions in New York in 1992.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole's record as a pro-life senator shouldn't be discounted by pro-lifers simply because he has lately become inarticulate on the subject. But he desperately needs to re-focus on what pro-life and many pro-choice women agree on. A majority of women in both parties want to ban the infanticide procedure euphemistically called "partial-birth abortion." They want to be notified if their under-age daughter seeks an abortion.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Elizabeth Dole gave her husband good advice when she told him to look at crime as a women's issue. A majority of women favor the ban against assault weapons, but few expect it to have much impact on their lives. A majority of women, like men, want dangerous criminals locked up for longer. That's always been a strong Republican issue and Mr. Dole ought to ask Bill Clinton how he hopes to reconcile midnight basketball and curfews as an effective approach to crime. Such ideas are the work of an illogical mind and reflect a pandering politician.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Affirmative action hurts ambitious women, and there are lots of ambitious women in this country today. Furthermore, they vote. Bob Dole ought to gather the facts and talk to women who are naturally receptive to conservative fiscal solutions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One of the most fascinating stories lost in the debate over affirmative action is the way that women are smashing through glass ceilings. These women don't need affirmative action and, in fact, many of them could be hurt by it, especially those among the large numbers of female entrepreneurs with small companies who don't need meddlesome and burdensome government mandates.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women own and run a third of the businesses in the United States and 40 percent of all retail and service firms. According to the Public Interest, magazine women-owned and operated firms grew by 43 percent -- almost double the rate for all firms -- between 1987-1992 under Ronald Reagan and George Bush. These women also increased their payrolls by 100 percent, compared to 38 percent for all firms in the same period of time.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who look up and see only their reflections in the glass ceiling usually have made "quality of life" choices that determined their rank. Those who got in and duked it out like men are closing the wage gap, rapidly. Working women between the ages of 27 and 33 who have not had children earn 98 percent of what a man earns. A 2 percent disparity isn't fair, but it isn't bad and it's certainly not difficult to close.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who continue to earn less than men in their fields usually have chosen to work less and take off more time, mainly for the children. Women are more willing than men to give more points to "home and family" in measuring success, whether they work or not. These women especially appreciate lower taxes.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women, traditionally the moral arbiters of our society, are fundamentally conservative. Many are deeply offended by Bill Clinton on character issues and appreciate the integrity they perceive in Bob Dole. So far this moral outrage hasn't registered in the polls, maybe because Mr. Dole hasn't talked directly to them. Now is the time if he is ever to do it.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>The shattered fairy tale<BR>
of Charles and Diana</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><DD>The marriage and divorce of Princess Di and Prince Charles
is a fairy tale for our time. Their story has all the appropriate literary
ingredients.<BR><DD>Prince Charming may not be as gallant as we like our princes to be, and we
don't know whether Cinderella turned out to be so terrific either. We only know that the shoe
fit.<BR><DD>Royal watchers chatter about the many ways Prince Charles and Princess Di were
mismatched, but the original Sleeping Beauty was mismatched with her prince, too. She slept
through the last 100 years. At least Di was awake in the 1980s.<BR><DD>There's also a jealous
Other Woman in the Di and Charles fairy tale triangle. Camilla Parker Bowles is a mistress of
the prince, not the mean stepmother, but she gets no sympathy from the rest of us and deepens
our empathy for the hardships endured by Di. The princess once remarked with bitter wit: "There
were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded."<BR><DD>An angry Queen Mother also
pulls her weight against the princess, not letting her keep the title "Her Royal Highness."
That's a little like giving her back the glass slipper after it's broken, but at least she gets
to live in a palace.<BR><DD>Lots of fairy tales include dwarfs and rogues, unpleasant little
people who try to put something over on the princess and who frequently disguise themselves as
something finer. Does anyone doubt that Capt. James Hewitt, who kissed the princess and told the
world about it, and more, is such a stunted human being? The princess describes his "handsome
physique," but everyone thinks that such physical perfection must camouflage an ugly character
inside.<BR><DD>People in disguises in fairy tales are free to say outrageous things, half-truths
and lies, because the princess cannot see the wickedness within. Capt. Hewitt may later turn
into an ass, literally, reflecting his nature in outward form, but even without the tall ears we
can see that he's a donkey. When his tell-all book was published in London, Tory Member of
Parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor said, "I cannot comprehend how he can still look at himself in
the mirror." Mirrors tell the truth. Snow White's royal stepmother discovered that to her
dismay.<BR><DD>I've been reading fairy tales (that's what happens when a grandson comes into the
family). Fairy tales are more illuminating and insightful during this pre-election season than
Bob Dole's inexplicable gaffes and Bill Clinton's "conservative" conversion pronouncements. One
man on the road to ruin, the other on the road to Damascus. (Read your Bible.)<BR><DD>I've
discovered what John Updike saw in a collection of Italian fairy tales: "They were the
television and pornography of their day, the life-lightening trash of a preliterate
peoples."<BR><DD>We're fascinated by the stories of Princess Di and Prince Charles for the same
reasons medieval men and women repeated fairy tales and for reasons these stories remain
popular. They're rooted in the reality of human emotion, both conscious and unconscious, an
awareness of wishes and desires that make us do strange and irrational things. They also grow
out of the culture and history of their time, at the upper reaches of society as well as what we
would now call the underclass.<BR><DD>No one -- certainly no one who has ever been part of a
couple -- believes any couple lives happily ever after, but it's fun to imagine they do. That's
no longer possible as newspapers, zoom lenses and an increasingly permissive society bring the
philanderings of the prince and the promiscuousness of a princess into our living rooms. You
might call this "defining deviancy up."<BR><DD>We no longer need to pretend that royal
personages act any different than commoners. But the British, unlike their American cousins,
must consider whether it's worth it to them to continue to support in such a lavish fashion a
modern royal family which creates such a cultural embarrassment. Americans may pay thousands of
dollars for faux pearls to turn Jackie Kennedy into faux royalty, but at least we don't pay
taxes to invent happy fairy tales we know aren't so.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>We get the leaders we deserve. Such cliche may be glib but it's not without insight.<BR><DD>The character issue is dismissed as irrelevant and hence unimportant, and Bill Clinton holds a large lead over Bob Dole. Explanations, such as they are, abound.<BR><DD>First, Bill Clinton has been through a trial by fire and is no longer burned. We knew that he was no angel, but 43 percent of the voters gave him a plurality to win in 1992. So who cares?<BR><DD>"Filegate" may change the polls in ways that the conviction of his business buddies in Arkansas did not. But that's certainly not clear yet.<BR><DD>Character and politics seem to have little to do with one another. The Democrats have succeeded in sticking unfair descriptions of "extremism" on the Republicans. Bill Clinton knows how to read the polls and promise the American people exactly what they want, which is what a lot of the extremists promised first.<BR><DD>The rap on Bob Dole, who nearly everyone agrees is a man of character and integrity, is that he cannot turn his virtues into victory. He hasn't persuaded the American people why he wants to be president. Besides, "he's too old." That may be inaccurate, but it's a powerful perception nonetheless.<BR><DD>Hence, better to elect a deeply flawed young man than a decent "old" man. Sophisticated Europeans understand this amoral approach. They could never understand how a successful president like Richard Nixon could be brought down by the clumsy cover-up of a third-rate burglary.<BR><DD>But Americans have been a deeply moral people in matters of money, sex and power. When a leader shows lapses in any one of these categories, we react by electing someone who is dramatically deficient in those vices.<BR><DD>Gerald Ford, a stolid congressman, conspicuous for his ordinariness, restored a measure of confidence to the office of vice president after Spiro Agnew disgraced it by taking money under the table. Jimmy Carter had lust in his heart, but he kept it there, and he was upright and virtuous in his personal habits, a sharp departure from Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, leaders whose private behavior was unscrupulous, promiscuous or unprincipled, or all of the above.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has surmounted scandals of sex, money, and power, at least so far. No one cares about Gennifer Flowers any longer and Paula Jones has been relegated to the wrong side of the tracks, beyond feminist concern. The Little Rock trials demonstrated that as governor Bill Clinton had criminal associates, but he has not yet been found guilty of anything illegal. Not yet.<BR><DD>In fact, the public appears to be extremely forgiving of Mr. Clinton. He could promise a middle-class tax cut in his campaign in 1992 and drop it completely after he won the election. He could seek the lifting of the arms embargo on the Croats in Bosnia, and once elected drop it. The voters don't care. Not yet.<BR><DD>Bob Dole supporters, down in the dumps about his poll ratings, insist that his ultimate integrity will win out if he's able to connect with powerful conservative issues that he has not yet articulated with any force -- slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, balancing the budget, school choice, English as our binding language and a foreign policy that won't suffer from "misguided romanticism." But they seem to be trying to persuade themselves first.<BR><DD>A fascinating book called "Character Above All" measures 10 presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush on elements of character. The most provocative essay is by David McCullough, Harry Truman's biographer. He reckons that "character counts in the presidency more than any other single quality."<BR><DD>Could we find another president like Harry Truman? "Who knows?" he replies. "Maybe somewhere in Texas she's growing up right now."<I><BR>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>When Hillary Rodham Clinton is tempted to give in to self-pity, she ought to consider her sisters of earlier White House imprisonment. She and Eleanor Roosevelt were neither the first nor will they be the last to suffer outrageous slings and errors. Nor are they the most "victimized," in the fashion of the day. This pouring of new whine into old battles does not become a first lady.<BR><DD>She can consider herself lucky by comparison to Rachel Jackson, who was so vilified by the supporters of John Quincy Adams that she didn't live to move into the White House. She had wanted to skip the inauguration of her husband, but Andrew Jackson's friends warned that she mustn't give in to her tormentors lest they enjoy a "chuckle" at scaring her away.<BR><DD>She made plans to come to Washington, only to be reminded that her enemies not only called her an "adulteress" (and worse), but described her as "fat, forty, but not fair." Old Hickory himself was 61, but that didn't count. Buying a ball gown wasn't much fun. Rachel grew depressed and fell sick before she left Nashville, fulfilling a wish she had announced, paraphrasing the Psalmist, when she heard that her husband had won the election: "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to live in that palace at Washington."<BR><DD>If it's a seance she wants, Hillary ought to run a short circuit to Mary Todd Lincoln, who also dabbled in spiritualism, even before there was a Psychic Friends Network, believing that she had supernatural powers to communicate with dead relatives. But despite Mary's confidence in her own prophetic powers, she couldn't foresee how wretched she would be as first lady.<BR><DD>Although she was loyal to the Union cause, many of her relatives, including two brothers, fought for the Confederacy. She was accused of being a traitor and a spy. The newspapers were merciless, even when Will, her 11-year-old son, died. Instead of showing the first lady a little sympathy in her grief, the newspapers attacked the style and "extravagance" of her mourning clothes.<BR><DD>Not only did Mrs. Lincoln endure the assassination of her husband, but when she became a widow, a Lincoln biographer argued, probably inaccurately, that Lincoln had only one real love in his life, Ann Rutledge, a woman who died before he met Mary Todd. On reading this, Mrs. Lincoln broke down and was eventually placed in a mental institution by a son.<BR><DD>Florence Harding, like Nancy Reagan, consulted an astrologer -- as a senator's wife, not as first lady. But why not? It was "Madam Marcia" who told her that her husband would become president of the United States and he would also have many sordid affairs. Madam Marcia was right on both counts. Futurespeak has a downside.<BR><DD>Mrs. Harding, like Hillary Clinton, was furious at those who protected her husband from her. President Harding continued to see Nan Britton, a favorite mistress, after he moved into the White House, occasionally partaking of Nan's favors in a coat closet adjoining the Oval Office. Once when Mrs. Harding heard that that woman was in the White House she set out to find her, and only because someone tipped his Secret Service detail did the president and Nan escape the wrath of "the Duchess."<BR><DD>Nor is Hillary the first first lady to make personal and public sacrifices to protect her husband. Bess Truman learned early in the election year of 1948 that the White House was collapsing, rotting from within. Mrs. Truman preferred to bear the accusation that she failed to initiate a formal social season than to give her husband's enemies the metaphor of a crumbling White House. The Trumans moved into the Blair House after he upset Tom Dewey, and the White House was renovated.<BR><DD>Jean Houston, Hillary's psychic friend, suggests that she carries the burden of 5,000 years of subservience to men, and compares her to Joan of Arc. Bob Woodward writes in his new book "The Choice," that Hillary "seemed jerked around by the muddled role of first lady as she swung between New Age feminist and national housewife."<BR><DD>The first lady cut short one session with Jean Houston to inquire into Chelsea's tummy ache. Thus a child's aching tummy brought the burden of 5,000 years of "female subservience" abruptly to earth -- where it belongs.<P><BR>

<font size=7>The rising tide of 'Wifewater'</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Hillary Rodham Clinton has done more for educating the public in the principles of modern feminism than Gloria Steinem or Betty Friedan, the early superstars of the movement.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She climbed to the nexus of power using everything it takes. Like many male wheeler-dealers before her, she took ethical risks which, now that they have come to light, are like curses. Chickens coming home to roost.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No wonder that she's taking a solo trip to Eastern Europe to celebrate the Fourth of July in Prague. Wicked wags in Washington say, unkindly, that she's looking for a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For anyone who doesn't yet know her offenses, a quick read of the majority report on the Whitewater hearings will fill in most of the blanks. Many ethical lapses lead in and out of Vincent Foster's office and continue to fuel speculation not only about why he committed suicide, and where, but how his files mysteriously disappeared from his office with the help of Hillary's staff: "From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death," the committee says, "Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases --were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That means they dealt with papers about Whitewater and Travelgate that were -- and are -- potentially damaging to the First Couple, which the first lady knew were in Vince Foster's possession.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What we have here is a pre-White House/post-White House scandal in which Hillary Clinton is accused of hiding or destroying documents from her law firm, and for holding on to files when they were subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, two years earlier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"At every important turn, crucial files and documents 'disappeared' or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised," the committee charges. One of the most damaging bits of evidence are her fingerprints on the late-recovered billing records of the Rose Law Firm found in the White House residence last August. Although other fingerprints were found as well, the others are not those of anyone who was in that part of the White House the day the files were found.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's more, the billing records -- which Mrs. Clinton says she's "happy" were finally found -- reveal that Hillary lied about the amount of time she spent on the shady side of the Whitewater and Castle Grande land investments. She had the most to lose if the billing records were made public.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Naturally, the Democrats are trying to diminish the importance of her activities, attacking the committee report as blindly partisan. They'll have lots of time during the campaign to make their side of the argument. What may be more fascinating for the rest of us is to consider is how Hillary has played the cards handed to her, and its implications for the future course of feminism.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's abundantly clear is something many feminists are loath to accept. A woman in power -- however that power is obtained -- is little different from a man in power. She can use it for better or for worse, but being a woman has very little to do with it. Lord Acton's famous dictum applies to her, too: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mrs. Clinton gingerly slides back and forth into mini-feminine dramas, putting on pink and granting interviews with favorite reporters to talk about menus and White House decor. Such appearances are carefully orchestrated for maximum political impact. Just as a man will occasionally use his "sensitive" side to highlight how much compassion he has, he knows that really power resides in his tough positions. No man knows better how this works than Hillary.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A chorus of friendly critics has frequently suggested that if only Hillary Clinton had come clean about Whitewater and Travelgate she could have quickly put it all behind her. This overlooks the possibility that maybe there was something to hide. You can only come clean if you are clean.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The First Feminist doesn't get the First Man off the hook, either. No matter what his wife did, Mr. Clinton as governor and then as president is responsible for her semi-official actions affecting the public good and bad, whether by arranging to have employees in the White House travel office cashiered, or in causing elderly blue-collar Arkansans to lose their savings in bad land investments.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The late, great Satchel Paige, who had a curve ball that could go around a mountain, used to say that it's dangerous to look back because "somethin' might be gainin' on you." If Hillary is brave enough to look back, she might recognize it.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BODY>
</center><DIV ALIGN=Right><FONT SIZE=2><B>LONDON</B></DIV></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've always enjoyed the comfort and easy convenience of the London underground. The tunnels and cars lack the grime, grunge and menacing quality we associate with most big city transportation. New York this is not. Not yet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But today the London subway is emblematic of the cultural changes that reflect a deterioration in manners, morals and civility that we've always associated with our ever-so-polite English cousins. Graffiti is everywhere. Litter is more prominent than it used to be. Rudeness is commonplace. A fear of violence lurks in spontaneous discourtesy.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I boarded a subway car on June 8 with dozens of young men heading for an important soccer match at Wembley. They wore the black leather jackets of hooligans, swigging beer from cans, unshaven and loudmouthed, singing rowdy drinking songs.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>When two English bobbies boarded the same car, these young men switched to verses of "Old MacDonald's Farm," drawing attention to "the pigs" with a boisterous "oink oink here, and an oink oink there." The bobbies showed their customary patience and forbearance, holding steady lest a riot break out. But it was scary as well as shocking to feel adolescent intimidation kept in check only by police firmness.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Brits worry about violence breaking out whenever their soccer team plays, and commentators are much in demand to lend historical perspective to bad behavior. But England is wary this month as it hosts "Euro 96," the soccer championships of Europe.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One professor, who directs the soccer research unit at Liverpool University, traces the roots for modern hooliganism back hundreds of years, when young English working men went abroad to fight. This is to explain how the fighting spirit lives on in the shrunken psyche of a small island nation. But soccer as the Crusades? Others argue that violence and aggression among the lower classes are psychological compensation both for Britain's poor athletes and bruising social realities. Wobbly legs made me do it. Or maybe it was Lady Thatcher.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>After this mindless drivel how can it hurt for a foreigner to offer her instant analysis? What seems to be at work is a growing tolerance for anti-social behavior such as we thought was rampant only at home.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I lived in London in the "Swinging Sixties"; I have no illusions about the coarsening of manners in the city once identified with propriety. But remembrances of the Beatles and Carnaby Street, miniskirts, mod ties and Chelsea mornings evoke a nostalgic high of innocence. We're talking about the loutish rebellion that has followed them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Behaving badly, loud swearing and filthy insults, drinking and fighting in what the stylish English critics have dubbed the "New Lad" culture has been elevated to a lifestyle of perverse glamour that's begun to upset even the cultural elites that created the monster.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The defenders of nastiness and the violent underpinnings of the "New Lads" are in cowardly retreat, hiding behind the feeble defense that they never expected their irony and wit to be drunk straight up as it was "democratized down."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The New Lad style was taken up by a mass of young men who had little in common with their counterparts in Medialand," writes Cosmo Landesman, a critic bewailing the decline of civil standards in London's Sunday Times. "These were the prole-lad-tariat, and they had no interest in irony. Here was loutishness without the alibi of quotation marks. Now the middle class of Medialand are horrified by what they've unleashed."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sound familiar?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first to speak out against moral decline in London, are, like their American counterparts, conservatives who were derided as "right wing" squares, cranks and old fogies. But old fogies have a way of cranking up influence over time. The starting point for most cultural and political debates in England -- as in the United States -- is right of center.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Recently Bill Clinton, ripping off another conservative issue, called for curfews for American children as a means to control violence by youngsters. The British Labor Party was inspired to quickly follow. But Tony Blair, head of the Labor Party, suffers the same problem (without the character issue) afflicting Bill Clinton. The farther he runs to the right, neglecting his core support, the more he risks becoming merely a bleached imitation of the political opposition.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Lefties in England face the same dilemma that lefties in the United States confront with our president. Can they trust their leader to run right and govern left? If not, why vote for watered-down conservatism? Good question.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>The hip young man in khaki Dockers and the striped Henley has a problem. He's just met a young woman he thinks he might like a lot. But before he can unreel his line she tells him: "I'm into abstinence."<BR><DD>He's heard this lady's line before, at cocktail parties where nothing stronger than sparkling water of expensive vintage is served, on or off the rocks. Should he take it personally, or put it down to the luck of the draw? The third or fourth time he hears it he might wonder, is something else going on here?<BR><DD>Sometimes such a woman sounds like the incredible tease that every boy's mother has warned him about. But who, male or female, needs this or any other come-on in our sex-drenched age, when every man can be a libertine without even trying.<BR><DD>But wait: from almost anyone's circle of acquaintances among single women in their 20s and 30s comes a repeated refrain: They're tired of a man's great sexual expectations. In this game even liberty has its limits. A woman wants to get to know her man before she knows him.<BR><DD>Since the dawn of the sexual revolution, which was supposed to have put all aright, sex and not love has preceded intimacy, and the intellectual and emotional titillation that a man and a woman find in the first thrill of a romance has been reduced to days, sometimes hours. Some women, determined to regard themselves as gifts to the men they expect to love, call themselves recycled virgins. They're transformed in mind if not precisely in every aspect of body.<BR><DD>Premature mating, they believe, puts at risk the delicious journey of discovery that courtship provided for generations upon generations of young adults before them.<BR><DD>Few of us want to return to boy-meets-girl conversations on a front-porch swing with Mom, Dad, two brothers, three sisters and the neighbors looking on and listening in. (Nobody has a front porch, anyway.) Nevertheless, the easy flirtation of style over substance, with no guarantee of even a call the next day, may be becoming yesterday's weapon, the discarded Gatling gun in the war between the sexes.<BR><DD>The men in the trenches of this warfare want something better than a casual hayride, too. David Klinghoffer, who writes the "token man" column in Women's Quarterly, understood just how times had changed one Sunday morning when, on a Hamptons weekend with several other eligible young men, he found himself in the usual fight over the newspaper. Everyone reached not for the arts or book review sections, or even the sports pages, but for the wedding announcements. Who among their friends was lucky enough to be on the latest casualty lists from the front?<BR><DD>Many unattached young women so despair of finding Mr. Right they suspect themselves of the commitment-phobia they accuse young men of. How else to account for always choosing the wrong man, which ultimately keeps them free from a lasting attachment? Of course, with wrong men as plentiful as the mosquitoes on a summer's night at the lake, sometimes a girl can't help herself.<BR><DD>The Victorians, whose manners and morals are not always any longer a source of merriment for the sophisticates of our age, raised romantic love to elevated heights by introducing an element of the sacred into the pursuit of pleasure. They linked sensuality with divinity, sexuality with divine approval. A man regarded a woman as "saint-like," or "heavenly," an angel of light sent to restore his faith in life, love and marriage. Or tried to. Instead of sleeping together, courting Victorians attended church together. This required an appreciation of sexual abstinence and chastity, even if occasionally observed in the breach. They understood that romantic love without opposing resistance could have all the flavor of Juicy Fruit left overnight on the bedpost.<BR><DD>Julia in Byron's "Don Juan" linked remorse with temptation:<BR><DD>"A little still she strove, and much repented,<BR><DD>And, whispering 'I will ne'er consent' -- consented."<P><I><BR></I><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I> <FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

were merely tasteless</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><Align=center>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1><Align=center>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BODY>


<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've changed my
treadmill schedule from the evening, when I watched "The News Hour with Jim
Lehrer," to the morning so I can get a sampling of the talk-show fare and stay in
touch with "real people" outside Washington. No offense to Jim Lehrer, but I can
watch him at night without the help of endorphins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But if my morning energy
level has gone up, my tolerance for talk television has sharply declined. In the weeks
since I began surfing for the morning shows the absolute worst, yet quite typical,
was about identical 10-year-old twins. Two girls and two boys were videotaped by
their parents showing how nasty they could be to each other, kicking and biting and
pulling each other's hair. Then we meet the twins live, in the television studio, to
hear and see them tell the audience why they hate one another. Each boy and girl
wish they weren't stuck with a horrible double.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>To give this junk morally
redeeming value, we're told that after the commercial break these twins are going
to want to shape up and learn the meaning of brotherly (or sisterly) love. When we
return we're introduced to the tutors for the twins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One is a tragic mother
who ran over her son, a twin, when he was 4 years old. She didn't see him as she
backed the van out of the driveway. She felt a bump and wondered if she had hit the
dog. She thought both boys were asleep upstairs in their room. Her son, sitting by her
side, describes almost inaudibly how lonely he is and wishes he could bring his
brother back. By now everybody is crying, the twins, their mothers and the audience.
I confess, me too.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've written about child abuse on television before and
this time I'm not even going to castigate the hosts of such shows. They only offer
what the guests and the public of the idiot culture will bear. But what can we say
about the exploitative parents of these children? Do they have no
responsibility?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Maybe less should be written about the effects of television
sex and violence on children and more about the ill effects of putting children on
display before the cameras. This is a long way from "Sesame Street" or silly home
videos.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We eagerly write child labor laws. We lock up pornographic
photographers of children. Isn't it obscene to portray children violently taunting
each other in scenes of sibling rivalry and then on cue parade their feelings before
their friends and millions of others?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last time I complained about child
abuse on television, it occurred on a show where children, ages 6 and 9, were trotted
out to explain how and why they wanted to kill their mothers. Greek tragedy this
was not.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The hosts usually make a pretense of offering such families "a
therapeutic environment," with bright lights and microphones, lots of supportive
gasps, sympathetic applause, and of course ample commercial breaks. Frequently a
resident expert is recruited to say that killing mothers is bad for their health, or
that beating up a sibling is not nice, either.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>These shows are sometimes
defended as "the democratization of culture," a harmless low-brow pleasure -- like
watching Christians being fed to lions? Or defended as giving those who don't have
much to feel good about an opportunity to feel superior to someone else: At least my
kids don't want to kill me or each other! They've even been called popular theater
with an Aristotelian catharsis: There but for the grace of God and television
producers, go I.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But no matter how you look at it from an audience's point of
view, the children placed in front of that camera are abused children. We should
worry about the psychological impact on their lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Now that we've bid our
farewell to Phil Donahue, who started this abuse, we can wax nostalgic about a more
innocent time when the host merely wore a skirt and brought male strippers into our
homes. Tastelessness beats beating up kids.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for

<BR><DD>Big Bob Dole and little Billy Clinton are strapping on the shootin' iron for the shootout at Gender Gap. Like the Clantons and Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral, they're itchin' to show the wimmen just who the real man is.

<BR><DD>Neither of these men strike any resemblance to Gary Cooper, to stretch the metaphor, but each is desperate to convince the ladies that he's a man who knows how to protect women, children and the community from bad guys in black hats.

<BR><DD>Women ought to find it offensive that any candidate thinks he can woo a woman on the basis of her &quot;gender&quot; (what in our pre-euphemistic days we called simply, sex.) But in a world where voting blocs are about differences, and women make up a majority of voters in almost every economic category, it can't hurt to target women. Picking up their votes is another matter.

<BR><DD>Bob Dole, who is looking for a quick fix for his depressing poll numbers, decides that women's issues might help him cross the finish line first. He cites day-care funding in the Republican welfare-reform bill, which Bill Clinton vetoed twice, as well as the balanced budget and regulatory reform, which are Republican initiatives that provide strong reasons why women should vote Republican in November.

<BR><DD>Bill Clinton, who is better at seducing women with his sensitive and puckered lower lip, is aggressively wooing blue-collar women, who voted in the presidential elections in 1992 but who stayed home in the 1994. Some women are harder to seduce than others.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women in focus groups describe the president as a &quot;wussy&quot; and a &quot;pantywaist,&quot; according to Hanna Rosin in the New Republic magazine. They're not charmed by his boyishness or his chameleon-like changes. They're familiar with untrustworthy men who promise them moonshine at midnight and disappear in the harsh light of morning.

<BR><DD>These women, who have been described by pollsters as Angry White Women, do not have a college degree, and they're too smart to be impressed by Hillary Rodham Clinton trading on her husband's position to achieve the perks of power. High-powered patronizing women like the first lady are the nemesis of women who would rather stay home with their children than put their children in day care, if only they could afford it. Feminists who scorn men as white male devils make them uncomfortable; some of those men with pitchforks and forked tails happen to be their husbands.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women are the biggest losers when public schools decline and they can't afford an expensive private school, like, for example, Bill and Hillary Clinton. They're a natural voting bloc for such conservative temptations as school vouchers, dumping affirmative action (which hasn't much benefitted them and certainly not their husbands), and illegal immigration which sometimes takes theirs and their husbands' jobs.

<BR><DD>Abortion is often not an emotional issue for these women, but most are appalled (like most of the rest of us) that Bill Clinton vetoed a bill banning partial-birth abortion (nothing short of infanticide), which liberal feminists railed at in China, but accept in our own country.

<BR><DD>If blue-collar women are angry and disconnected from feminism, middle-class mothers feel like Rodney Dangerfield, who &quot;don't get no respect.&quot; They're stressed to the max.

<BR><DD>A survey of more than 18,000 women for Parents magazine turned up some surprises. Sixty-eight percent of the working moms say they work for money, not emotional or intellectual satisfaction, up 12 points in seven years. Big majorities of mothers prefer part-time work to full-time work when their children are young. A mere 4 percent say they would choose full-time work. Though 49 percent of working mothers say they envy at-home moms, only 11 percent of at-home moms envy working mothers.

<BR><DD>Readers of Parents magazine make up a special sampling because nearly all of them live with their husbands, have been married only once, and more than half are college graduates. They are especially open to listen to Bob Dole's critique of the president for vetoing balanced budget proposals and welfare-reform bills. This would have put more money in their pocketbooks, to spend or save as they see fit.

<BR><DD>Most startling of all is the majority - the majority - of young mothers under 25 who say they prefer the lifestyle of the 1950s, the decade the feminists love to hate; 43 percent of these mothers say they long for the security and less pressured lives of that decade. A 24-year old mom captured their sentiment succinctly, describing herself as a &quot;June Cleaver Wanna-be.&quot;

<BR><DD>Neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole will woo their votes. These women vote very much like their husbands, and aren't interested in life in Gender Gap.

<BR><DD>The baby boomers flooded the culture with post-pubescent rebellion: &quot;Never trust anyone over 30.&quot;

<BR><DD>Adults trembled and then surrendered. Now the boomers are on the back side of 30 themselves and their children are saying: &quot;Never trust anyone over 13.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany, 13, is typical. She lives in a small New England town where her parents moved to get away from big-city problems. The big-city problems have moved into their town and into their living room.

<BR><DD>&quot;What she watches and hears from television and her peers on the bus to school deprives her of childhood innocence,&quot; her mother tells me. &quot;We can't control the other children, but we thought we could control our own daughter.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany's parents put a &quot;family-code lock&quot; on MTV so she wouldn't watch too much television. But Brittany is bright and she broke the code. Retaliating, she put her own code lock on the &quot;Discovery Channel,&quot; her parents' favorite.

<BR><DD>On the way to school, one of Brittany's buddies laced a large Coke with vodka and passed it around on the bus. She wound up in the emergency room, dead drunk.

<BR><DD>What we have here is a variation of the inmates taking over the asylum. With computer-literate, media-saturated, middle-class children poised for revolt, it's more difficult than ever for parents to maintain their position of authority.

<BR><DD>Not so long ago we accepted terms like &quot;identity crisis&quot; as a normal stage of development that adolescents would be expected to pass through. But today young people are exposed to so much &quot;adult&quot; information without the emotional development or psychological security to cope with it that parents are terrified.

<BR><DD>We look for one-shot elixirs to enable them to cope. We try to prevent teen-age pregnancy by distributing condoms at school. That sounds reasonable, but it plays to the lowest common denominator among us. The girl who would say &quot;no&quot; because she's afraid to get pregnant is reminded that the school provides condoms for squeamish young girls just like herself. How could it be bad?

<BR><DD>Movie and television producers, sensing a growing movement for censorship, offer ratings so parents will know what their children shouldn't watch. That only makes such shows and movies more desirable, of course, and the children quickly find the latchkey kid with no supervision at home. They hang out there to watch whatever they want.

<BR><DD>Most of us remember our own teen-age traumas and figure that those of our children will pass, too. But parents raising teen-agers today can't be so sure. The starting place for belligerence is so far beyond where the baby-boomer parents ended their rebellion that the test of limits is limitless. Today's teen-agers tolerate graphic sexuality and violence that would have made their parents throw up.

<BR><DD>Children are entering puberty at younger ages, some as early as 10. They're more likely to want to separate themselves from their families when parental protection is absolutely essential. Their mothers burned their bras; their daughters never get one. Young girls of another generation who would debate who to go out with, and &quot;how far to go,&quot; now debate when and with whom to have uncommitted and casual sex.

<BR><DD>We could begin to change some of this by pointing out that rhetorical and abstract appeals to sexual equality are false and misleading, hiding a multitude of dangerous differences starting at puberty. What once made up a teen-ager's fantasy life quickly became a short cut to coarsened reality. Parents must repeat and re-establish moral principles that reinforce an understanding of the difference between the sexes, enabling young women to once more become the arbiters of what's acceptable and what's not, because they're the ones who have the most to lose.

<BR><DD>This started out to be a column about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, pending in Congress, which is an attempt to give parents a veto power over policies in schools that they say undermine them. It sounds good, but it won't take the place of parents paying close attention to their own children. Nothing else, in the end, will work.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=7>Time for another<BR>killer euphemism?</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><Align=center>

<BR><DD>In 1789 Jonathan Swift bewailed the shameful numbers of abortions and murders of &quot;bastard children&quot; among the Catholic peasants of Ireland, desperate women who sacrificed innocent babes to avoid the expense and the shame of giving birth without benefit of clergy. Such horrid practices, Swift wrote, &quot;would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman beast.&quot;

<BR><DD>In searching for a way to alleviate such cruelty, Swift invents an American, whom most Englishmen regarded as a not-so-noble savage, to support his modest proposal.

<BR><DD>&quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,&quot; he writes in a satire that became a classic of English literature, &quot;that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.&quot;

<BR><DD>Swift was only ahead of his time, and he was only kidding. His modest proposal was deliciously sly in appealing to an impeccable financial logic. His classic was a dig at the rapacious absentee English landlords of Ireland, whose money-grubbing tactics were condoned by the British parliament, ministers and the Crown.

<BR><DD>Taking a cue from Swift, the time is right for a similar modest proposal to President Clinton and all those congressmen who are willing to uphold his veto of the ban on &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>First the facts: a partial-birth abortion is the euphemism for the procedure of turning a baby around (with forceps) in the birth canal so that his tiny legs and tummy and arms escape the mother's body, allowing the doctor to stick a pair of scissors into his head while it is mostly still inside his mother's body. The doctor then spreads the blades of the scissors to allow him to insert a tube with which to suck out the tiny brain. Scientists who work with animals in a laboratory wouldn't be permitted to perform such nasty business.

<BR><DD>So heinous is the procedure that such abortions as are done are mostly to preserve the mother's health, usually her psychological health, since the procedure is done a few seconds before the baby's head slips free of the womb.

<BR><DD>And since psychology is so crucial, why should we deprive the mother-to-be of &quot;psychological closure&quot; by the technicality of keeping the head inside the birth canal while the procedure is being done? Why not do it outside, so that she can watch?

<BR><DD>Why not, in fact, provide a grace period of 15 minutes after birth, to allow her to decide whether she really wants to have a baby. Or even an hour. Perhaps a day or two. Why rush these things? The doctor's scissors would still work the next day.

<BR><DD>It's almost impossible to anesthetize an infant in the womb without putting the mother in great danger. But a baby who lives outside the womb for an hour or even a day could receive treatment to reduce pain prior to its execution. We shouldn't be barbaric, after all. The law, of course, must exempt this carefully considered procedure from charges of premeditated murder. We could give such infanticide a nice name like &quot;mercicide.&quot; The kindly Dr. Jack Kevorkian might offer the use of his death machinery.

<BR><DD>There is another great advantage to this scheme. By forcing the whole baby out of the mother's body for mercicide, we could decide at our leisure whether the infant is indeed a monster with four legs and no suitable brain, thus avoiding disposing of (we must watch our language) a Down's Syndrome child or a child with a cleft palate, both of which are justifiable reasons now for electing a &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>In fact, the law as it is now interpreted enables a mother of a normal baby to kill the child in the last trimester if the birth contributes to a mother's depression or neurotic excesses. Though it may be difficult for some to imagine that a loving adoptive mother would welcome a live baby with Down's Syndrome or a cleft palate, that option would be made available before mercicide, which is after all permanent.

<BR><DD>The advantages of this proposal are obvious and many, it seems to me, as well as of the highest importance to the body impolitic. To satisfy the squeamish who require the delicacy of euphemism, as the president seems to, we could describe mercicide as killing with kindness.

<title>Fumento: Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda - 12/11/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 11, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda</h2><p>     
<P>
 I don't know about you, but when I want a real scare I don't pick up a Stephen King novel
 or rent a movie like Curse of the Demon.  No, when I want a real bone-chilling I go to my
 neighborhood news stand and look at the covers of the women's and family magazines. Where
 else, I ask you, can you find such headlines plastered over the face of Kathie Lee Gifford
 or Claudia Schiffer:  "Schools That Make Kids Sick," "The Foods That Are Poisoning Your
 Child," "Are Pesticides Poisoning Our Children?" "The Woman Who Stole 5,000 Babies,"
 "Stranger Danger," "The Infidelity Epidemic," and "EPA Warning: How the Sun Can Kill Your
 Kids."
<P>
 My favorite?  Hmm . . . That would probably have to be: "Shocking Report: 
 Babysitters who Maim and Kill."  Boy, that'll keep a parent up at night, won't it?  Or at
 least keep the parent from ever going out again until the children are old enough to stay
 home alone. 
<P>
Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis did a poll in
which he found that women were far more likely to buy into the latest fad scare than were
men.  While he wasn't sure of the reason, I'll bet these magazines have something to do
with it. The Washington, D.C. watchdog groups Consumer Alert and Media Research Center
appear to agree.  Indeed, their recent study, "Women's Magazine's: A Liberal Pipeline to
Soccer Moms," found that in addition to lipstick and tampons, what these magazines
specialize in selling is fear--and the notion that Big Government is almost always the
solution. Looking at a year of offerings from 13 such magazines, with a combined
circulation of over 66 million, the organizations found most stories on science and risk
issues served no other purpose than scaring the skirts off readers--outnumberingd balanced
articles by two-to-one.
<P>
Among them:
<ul>
<LI>Family Circle in last August's article, "Danger in the House," warned of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides.  The evidence?  Well, there's this spooky anecdote about a mother who blamed a neighbor's pesticide spraying for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting.  That's enough for you, isn't it?  After all, mother knows best. 
<LI>McCall's and Better Homes & Gardens warned of pesticide residues in baby food.  The McCall's article warned that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults (a supposition, not a fact), but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. 
<LI>Articles in Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Weight Watchers reported the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer, without noting that the largest study ever conducted on the subject looked at two of the most often-mentioned culprits -- the insecticide DDT and the insulating liquid PCB -- and found no connections.  Weight Watchers even condemned scientific studies that pointed to such causes as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." Next thing you know, even saying the words "breast cancer" will be politically incorrect because it suggests that it's a woman's fault that she has breasts.  And what all this has to do with watching your weight I just can't figure out. 
</ul>
<P>
 Once these magazines have you
 hyperventilating into a paper bag, they then spring upon you the solution to these terrible
 problems. Yes, it's Uncle Sam, or more specifically Uncle Bill and Aunt Hillary.  The
 Consumer Alert/Media Research Center survey found 115 articles with positive portrayals of
 government activism and/or calls for more activism.  There were only 18 negative portrayals
 or calls for less government action.  Of these, 23 stories also asked readers to lobby
 government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. 
<P>
 Having made their readers
 feel bad about the way mankind is treating the environment (when you're describing
 something bad, like polluting, using "mankind" isn't sexist), they then go on to promote
 feel-good environmentalism.  Never mind that even the New York Times magazine recently did
 a cover article affirming what free-market environmentalists have been saying for over a
 decade--that most recycling is a waste of time, energy, and money.  Out of the 15 articles
 in the women's magazines on recycling, each and every one was solidly in favor of it.
 (Actually, probably the last 14 articles were simply recycled versions of the first one.)
<P>
 "Story after story," in these magazines, says Consumer Alert Executive Director Fran Smith,
 "outlines a problem and proposes that a new law be enacted and that women should lobby for
  it."
<P>
   Not for nothing did the Clinton team label its re-election campaign aimed at young
   mothers and women in general as its "Redbook strategy."  The Redbooks of the nation had
   already paved the way for his second term.

<h2>
 "Killer Airbag" Hysteria is the Real Killer
</h2>     
<p>
<dd>
 For all the news lately about the threat that airbags pose to children, you'd think it's
 the Slaughter of the Innocents all over again.  You'd believe you could look out your
 window at any time and see an airbag chasing some poor little boy or girl down the street.
 But no, such is not the case.  The scariest thing about this whole airbag thing is not the
 threat to children but that the media has taken its cue from USA Today, the paper that
 prides itself on promoting hysteria.
<p>
<dd>
 It was USA Today that led the coverage of the missing
 children epidemic in the early 1980s, telling us, "estimates of lost children [per year]
 run as high as 2 million," and asking "how could it happen?"  It also said, "More than
 100,000 children are abducted each year." How could it happen?  It couldn't and didn't. 
 The newspaper was later forced to admit that the two million figure was probably about
 30,000, of which (according to the FBI) only 67 were kidnapped.  Oops.
<p>
<dd>
 More recently, it
 was the first newspaper to inform us of an "epidemic" of  black churches being torched by
 racists.  After six months of incendiary reporting it finally admitted that of over 70
 black church burnings it looked at, only three were clearly done by racists and a third of
 the churches were burned by blacks.  Oops. No matter, there's always a new hysteria to be
 created.
<p>
<dd>
 And so it was that USA Today crack reporters in May kicked off the airbag mania
 with an article running under the inch-high headline, "DEADLY AIR BAGS."  An accompanying
 story was titled, "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children."  If your trembling hand turned to
 the next page you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags Are Claiming the Lives of Children," while
 yet another page blared, "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly." The rest of the media then
 followed USA Today, which is about as wise as letting Stevie Wonder pilot your plane. 
 Suddenly it's worthy of a headline when a child is so much as injured by an airbag. It's
 gotten to the point where volunteers at busy freeway rest areas spent their Thanksgiving
 handing out fliers warning parents of the danger of these pneumatic beasts.  (USA Today
 proudly displayed a story on this on page one.)
<p>
<dd>
 I've always been a big seat belt fan,
 myself.  They've saved my rear (and the rest of me) twice.  But it's clear that even if you
 do wear a seat belt and especially if you don't, airbags are far more likely to save you
 than to kill you.
<p>
<dd>
 Department of Transportation (DOT) figures show that since 1987, airbags
 have probably kept 1,136 people from being crushed to death, with the life-saving rate
 accelerating rapidly as more and more cars are equipped with them.  In 1995 alone, airbags
 prevented 462 deaths. The trade-off?  Since 1990, DOT says, they have caused 52 deaths,
 including those of 32 children.  You needn't dig out that misplaced pocket calculator to
 see that this comes out to a net savings of a lot of lives. As to those 32 children, in a
 real sense that is 32 too many.  But other than being mauled by a Siberian tiger in New
 York City, there is practically nothing less likely to kill your child than an airbag. 
<p>
<dd>
 Indeed, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, during the time those 32
 children were killed by airbags, over 15,000 children age 11 or under were killed in car
 accidents for reasons having nothing to do with the devices. But hard facts like these are
 the first casualty of panics. And so, reacting to the hysteria, DOT has decided to relax
 the law making it illegal for a mechanic to disconnect a vehicle owner's airbag.  The
 utterly unavoidable result is that people will die in crashes whose lives would otherwise
 have been saved by the devices. And for what?  As tiny as your child's risk of being killed
 or injured by an airbag currently is, you can reduce it even further by simply by sliding
 the passenger seat all the way back, and by making sure your child is wearing a seat belt. 
<p>
<dd>
 Last year, over half the children killed by airbags were not wearing seat belts.  The
 one-year-old girl who just died from an airbag was, according to the coroner, not properly
 restrained. To reduce your child's near-zero risk from airbags to absolutely zero, just put
 him or her in the back seat. Unfortunately, panicky people don't think about such things. 
 So it's off to the auto shop to have both the passenger and driver side bags disconnected.
 The first time a person is impaled on a steering wheel or squished by a dashboard because
 of a disconnected airbag, I hope we read about THAT in the papers.  But don't expect to
 hear about it from USA Today.

<title>Fumento:Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile - 9/05/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>  September 5, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile</h2><p>     
Bill Clinton has made it clear yet again that he likes cruise 
missiles, with their ability to slip under radar screens and do damage 
without endangering the guy who launched them.  No, I'm not talking 
about Iraq, but rather Clintons' advocacy of a federal law prohibiting 
those convicted of domestic abuse misdemeanors from ever again being 
able to legally obtain a gun.  I've counted at least five things it 
accomplishes: <p>
<ul>
<li> It appeals to feminists. 

<li> It appeals to Americans' natural desire to protect women and 
children. 

<li> It promotes "gun law creep," whereby inch by inch we make fewer and 
fewer people able to legally obtain and keep guns. 

<li> It promotes "federal power creep."  See above. 

<li> It leaves the public with the impression that Clinton is a no-
nonsense "law and order" president. 
</ul>
If you're thinking that none of this has anything to do with making 
anybody safer, you're missing the point--there's an election hard upon 
us, and as Clinton taught Bush there's no such thing as a safe lead. <p>

But let's hear out Cruise Clinton. <p>

Said the president, "if you're stalking or harassing women or 
children, you shouldn't have a gun."  Can he not know that the 1994 
Violence Against Women Act which he signed already forbids the sale of 
guns to stalkers and harassers who are under court restraining orders? <p>

"The problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be 
particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for future 
violence," said Clinton.  "And that is the painful area of domestic 
violence." <p>

In fact, as Woman's Freedom Network Vice-President Cathy Young notes, 
"There is no evidence that domestic violence misdemeanor offenses are 
more violent than non-domestic misdemeanor assaults."  We'll just 
chalk that one up to presidential puffery. <p>

With domestic violence, says Clinton, "often there's a plea bargain 
which goes from a felony to a misdemeanor. " <p>

Sure, but that's true of all felonies. "Virtually all available 
research shows that when the levels of injury are the same, domestic 
assaults are no less likely than non-family assaults to be prosecuted 
as felonies," Young told me.  <p>

To the extent such plea-bargaining is a problem, it can be dealt with 
"three strikes and you're out" or other mandatory sentencing laws.  
Increasingly, states are passing just such laws.  Our purpose should 
be to try to make sure those guilty of felonies are punished with laws 
meant for felons, not to apply felony laws to persons who commit 
misdemeanors. <p>

"If you commit an act of violence against your wife or child, you 
shouldn't have a gun," thunders Clinton, who is such a fatherly type 
that he plans to adopt a child if the polls show Dole getting to 
close. <p>

But it's not that simple because the definition of "violence" can 
stretch from all the way from an unwanted grab to strangling your 
spouse and tossing the body into a meat grinder. <p>0

In most states, misdemeanor assault is any intentional touching 
without consent.  That includes such things as poking someone with 
your finger. In a New Jersey case, a man was convicted of misdemeanor 
assault not for punching his girlfriend but rather the couch she was 
sitting on.  Some states allow misdemeanor assault convictions for 
yelling at someone.  Los Angeles hero Rodney King accused his wife of 
assault because she yelled at him in the car for not being able to 
read a map.  (Rather than press charges, he promptly ran her down.) <p>

All of these are wrong, which is why the law covers them.  You can 
serve "hard time" for misdemeanor domestic violence.  But take away a 
person's right to own a gun for life because of an arm grab or heated 
words?  Slap that person in the same category as a brute who blackens 
his wife's eyes because she burned the toast?    <p>

Ironically, one outcome of this might be that many prosecutors and 
judges would feel sorry for the defendant faced with a 
disproportionate penalty, and be tempted to let him or her go scott-
free.  <p>

Conceivably Clinton's proposal could keep guns out of the hands of 
some violent people, if we make the shaky assumption that violent 
people when turned away from stores won't just go out and buy their 
guns on the street.  It's also true that we would keep guns out of the 
hands of some violent people if we forbade them for other arbitrary 
reasons, such as having blow-dryed gray hair and a bulbous nose. <p>

But the point of any law that denies somebody the right to own a gun 
should be to match as closely as possible that denial to persons most 
likely to use them for violence. There's no evidence that this is the 
case here. <p>

One figure cited in support of Clinton's proposal is that according to 
the Justice Department, of the 1.7 million incidents of domestic 
violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  That comes out 
to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot 
or even that bullets were fired.  Considering that almost half of all 
Americans own guns, guns and domestic violence hardly go hand in hand. <p>

Like most gun control measures, this proposal is essentially 
irrelevent to crime control.  If you think reelecting Clinton and 
piling on more federal laws are worthy goals, you may not mind.  
Otherwise you'll see this as the harmful distraction and campaign 
stunt that it is. <p>

<title>Fumento:"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope - 8/28/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 28, 1996</i><p>
<h2>"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope</h2><p>
       


He's the sickest American cult figure since Charles Manson, with two 
major differences. First, he's killed almost eight times as many 
people. Second, he's still walking around, free to kill again. And 
kill he will. Some call him an Angel of Mercy, but he's better known 
as Dr. Death. <p>

As I write this, Dr. Jack Kevorkian has put down/put to 
sleep/euthanized persons 35, 36, 37, and 38, though lately he's been 
killing faster than I can type. None of the people appear to have been 
imminently close to death. One had Lou Gehrig's disease, the same 
illness that Dr. Steven Hawkings had for decades when he penned a 
best-selling book and became world famous. Two had multiple sclerosis, 
the disease Annette Funicello had (and has) when she starred in her 
film autobiography. <p>

The fourth, 42-year-old Judith Curren, was a nurse and a mother of two 
young children. She was overweight and depressed and believed she 
suffered from a vague (though sometimes real) malady called chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS). None of these are terminal, and the woman's 
belief she had CFS may well have been a manifestation of depression. <p>

Further, severe depression is often accompanied by a desire to commit 
suicide. But this is a highly treatable condition, and in any case a 
severely depressed person no more has the capacity to "elect" to die 
than a five-year-old girl can "elect" to engage in sex. <p>

But no matter, for Dr. Death continues to be treated like some gallant 
crusader. "Dr. Jack Kevorkian stepped up his campaign for doctor-
assisted suicide," began a recent Associated Press article. <p>

Wrong. Kevorkian no more kills in the name of any higher cause, 
including doctor-assisted suicide, than a lion rips out an antelope's 
throat in the name of balancing the eco-system. The lion is driven by 
instinct; Kevorkian by something we used to call evil.  <p>

The man is a ghoul. Some of us like to watch female volleyball; 
Kevorkian likes to watch people die. A much-ignored 1993 Newsweek 
article documented that in the 1950s, while studying to be a 
pathologist, Kevorkian made regular visits to terminally ill patients 
and peered deeply into their eyes. He wanted to watch the sparkle of 
life disappear. "There was no practical application," he admitted 
later. "I was curious, that's all." <p>

Later he advocated surgical experimentation on the bodies--
particularly the brains--of live death row prisoners. Later still he 
expanded his idea to encompass other persons, including "comatose, 
mentally incompetent or otherwise completely uncommunicative 
individuals . . . " <p>

Earlier this year, thinking he was making some salient point, 
Kevorkian invoked Christ's death, saying "Do you think it's dignified 
to hang from wood with nails through your hands and feet?" He said, 
"Had Christ died in my van . . . it would have been far more 
dignified." <p>

Look Jack, it's not just that a van would look rather bizarre hanging 
above the altar of my church. When Christ sacrificed his life, he knew 
he was setting himself up for crucifixion, the most painful and 
undignified mode of execution in use. Again, Kevorkian shows he is 
devoid of understanding of humanity. And it speaks volumes about the 
pro-euthanasia movement that it pretends that this man is a crusader 
for a larger cause, rather than a grown-up version of the little boy 
who pulls wings off flies.<p>

Not that some euthanasia supporters aren't just a bit queasy after 
this latest round of killings. "Sooner or later, someone will die for 
the wrong reasons," conceded a USA Today editorial, not specifying 
what the right reasons are. <p>

Others warned that if we don't watch it, we'll slide down the slippery 
slope. As if we haven't already? Jack Kevorkian IS a one-man slippery 
slope. He keeps loosening the definition of who "deserves" to die. 
Originally he saw the need to pretend that his 
clients/patients/victims were in great pain and on death's doorstep. 
But after the latest killings he admitted, "It had nothing do with 
lethality. It's quality of life . . . . Quality of life." <p>

This evolution was utterly predictable. It's called the "camel's nose" 
effect. The camel puts his nose into the tent to see if he can get 
away with it. If so, he keeps moving in until he's fully inside, hump 
and hooves. <p>

Those on both sides of the euthanasia debate in the United States are 
fully aware of the history of legal euthanasia in the Netherlands. It 
began with a doctor responding to the wishes of her terminally ill 
mother who was in much pain. Within a few decades it encompassed 
killing infants born with non-fatal diseases--Down's syndrome and 
spina bifida. Patients in persistent vegetative states, often 
incorrectly referred to as "comatose," are also now legally killable 
in Holland. <p>

According to a Dutch government survey, doctors there kill some 20,000 
patients a year, most without the patients' consent. The difference is 
that the Dutch took decades to get to that point, while Kevorkian is 
trying to bring the whole camel in within a matter of years. And 
damned if he isn't getting away with it. <p>

We need to ask ourselves right now if we want to follow Dr. Death down 
the Dutch path or if we're going to treat human life as sacred. In 
other words, we tell our doctors that they are to follow the 
Hippocratic Oath they took and "first do no harm." Executioners kill; 
doctors are supposed to heal. And "Dr. Death" is a contradiction in 
terms. <p>

<title>Fumento:The EPA vs. Clean Air - 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 22, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  The EPA vs. Clean Air</h2><p>



                    

DENVER, COLORADO  "Make a better mousetrap and the world will beat a 
path to your door," goes an old saying. Well, not always.  In some 
cases you just may find a 300-pound government gorilla obstructing the 
way. Such has been the experience of University of Denver chemistry 
professor Donald Stedman. <p>

Stedman has developed a machine which, when hidden by the side of the 
road, can detect how much exhaust a car puts out as it drives by. High 
emissions trigger a video camera which films both the car and its 
license plate.  This allows the municipality using the device to send 
a letter (perhaps backed by a fine) to the violator informing him that 
his car must be repaired. <p>

As present, the standard practice in high-pollution areas is to 
subject cars to regular inspection and maintenance programs. The 
problem is that drivers with the dirtiest cars can pass the test by 
pouring a commercial additive into their gas tank. (Since they refused 
to pay me a product placement fee, I won't tell you the name.) Or they 
can pass by tampering with the exhaust system.  <p>

Studies with remote sensors have shown that such cheating is rampant. <p>

But drivers who happen upon remote sensors have no ability to cheat. 
The effectiveness of such devices has been demonstrated repeatedly in 
the U.S. as well as in Canada and Great Britain.  Indeed, they have 
now been put into regular use in various parts of California; Phoenix; 
Ontario, and Stedman's hometown of Denver. <p>

"If we want to have any success in reducing emissions from autos, we 
must employ remote sensing technology" says Buzz Breedlove, the 
assistant director for the California Research Bureau. <p>

But the EPA, whose mission is supposed to be preserving the 
environment, doesn't like remote sensing. <p>

Why?  Breedlove told me that "the staunchest opponent of remote 
sensing" he knows once said, "The problem with remote sensing is that 
it will clean up all the cars  and we won't be able to justify a 
centralized program on a cost-effective basis." <p>

For over a decade now, the EPA has put all its eggs in one basket: the 
inspection and maintenance program. In part, this is because such 
testing requires a large centralized bureaucracy to administer it. <p>

This involves--surprise--lots of money!  The tests cost about $25 per 
car.  Remote sensing, by contrast, is about 50 cents per test. <p>

Although the EPA has improved the efficiency of its testing devices, 
they will never be truly cost efficient. "It's not a mechanical 
engineering problem," Stedman observes, "It's a human behavior 
problem. The driver's interest isn't in reducing emissions; it's in 
passing the test." <p>

Hence, if the driver thinks he'll fail and be liable for perhaps 
hundreds of dollars in repairs, he'll cheat. And the EPA's equipment 
can't stop him. <p>

But pride, reputations, and bureaucratic inertia refuse to allow the 
EPA to admit this.  And so, while remote sensors work to clean up the 
air, the EPA is working against remote sensors. <p>

First, the agency actively discriminates against state and local 
governments that want to use remote sensors. Under the Clean Air Act, 
governments are not given credit for actually cleaning up the air. 
Rather, they're given credit for running programs that the EPA says 
SHOULD BE cleaning up the air. And in its credit formula, remote 
sensing counts for very little.   <p>

Second, EPA has now cut off further funding for Stedman's lab, 
hampering his efforts to enable it to detect more types of pollutants. 
For six years he got a fairly small but, to him, vital amount of his 
research money from the EPA. No more. <p>

But hey, things are tough all over, right? Money is tight these days. 
But not for things that suit the EPA's  agenda--namely more government 
regulation. <p>

Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar Jonathan Adler has documented 
that from 1993 to 1995 alone, the radical environmental group the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) received almost $2 million of 
your and my tax dollars funneled through the EPA. That's 20 times what 
Stedman's shop was receiving annually. <p>

The American Lung Association (ALA) received almost as much from the 
EPA. Unlike the NRDC, the ALA does some good work.  But part of what 
it does with all that cash is to lobby for EPA-proposed mandates.  It 
even sues the EPA to make regulations stricter.  Since by law the EPA 
can't lobby itself, it throws money at organizations who will do it 
for them.   <p>

In fact, the EPA even gives cash to a group called the Consumer 
Federation of America, which publishes literature disparaging remote 
sensing. <p>

The EPA's mandate isn't to promote bureaucratic self-interest and 
political lobbying, but to clean up the environment. Supporting remote 
sensing would do just that. <p>

<title>Fumento: Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study - 8/15/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 15, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study</h2><p>

A new report on the impact of laws allowing persons to carry concealed 
guns has gun control advocates shooting wildly and missing their 
target by a mile. <p>

The report, co-authored by law professor John Lott and economist John 
Mustard, both of the University of Chicago, concluded  "allowing 
citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it 
appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths.  If those states 
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted 
them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 
60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly."    <p>

Think of it; that's more murders than the combined total of 21 states 
last year.  That's over 4,000 women last year alone who were violently 
sexually assaulted. <p>

In percentage terms, the authors found that when state concealed 
handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 
percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent, 
respectively.  (Thirty-one states now have such laws). <p>

Lott and Mustard, however, probably feel like they've been assaulted 
after the smearing they received in much of the press. <p>

For example, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence 
Dan Kotowski blasted the study as biased because it was funded by the 
Olin Corporation, which owns Winchester, Inc., a firearms 
manufacturer.  An <i>Associated Press</i> (AP) story and that of individual 
newspapers aired the Kotowski allegations as fact, but they were wrong 
several times over. <p>

Lott, as the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics at Chicago, 
is paid by the Olin FOUNDATION, which funds guest academic positions 
at institutions throughout the country.  It does not choose the 
scholars who fill these slots, but leaves it up to the institution.  
Nor does it choose their research projects.  John Olin did make money 
in firearms, but died in 1982, endowing the foundation that bears his 
name.  Since then there has been no connection between the Olin 
Corporation and the Olin Foundation. <p>

AP has now issued a retraction of the allegations.   <p>

On the other hand, Kotowski gets ALL his money from advocating handgun 
control. <p>

Meanwhile, Douglas Weil--who as research director at the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence also makes all his money from advocating 
handgun laws--claimed the Chicago study "goes against well-established 
evidence," citing specifically a University of Maryland report from 
last year which claimed to show that concealed weapons laws cause 
homicides to go up. <p>

Really?  The Chicago report looked at the entire nation over the last 
15 years for which data were available.  The authors of the University 
of Maryland study, conversely, picked out just five cities to report 
on out of the hundreds it could have chosen.  They didn't even use the 
same sample period for the cities, but the periods they did choose 
were just a few years each. <p>

So somehow a study that uses specially-picked cities and specially-
picked periods of time is better than one covering the whole nation 
over a decade and a half.  It makes sense to the gun control 
advocates. <p>

The nation's top law enforcement official also weighed in.  Asked 
about the Chicago report at a press conference, Attorney General Janet 
Reno avoided giving direct comment, saying she hadn't yet read it.  
But Reno, the former chief state prosecutor in Florida's Dade County, 
added her impression that Florida's concealed weapons law "didn't seem 
to be effective." <p>

Oh no?  When that law was passed in 1987, Florida had the nation's 
highest murder rate and it was going up.  Immediately it began 
dropping steadily year by year, falling almost 30 percent by 1994 and 
putting Florida under the national average in homicides.  Of over 
320,000 licenses issued between the time the law passed and the end of 
January of this year, only 58 have been revoked because the owner 
committed a crime. <p>	

So why does Miss Reno think the law wasn't effective?  Maybe it has 
something to do with the view she stated to a B'nai B'rith gathering 
in Ft. Lauderdale in 1991 that, "The most effective means of fighting 
crime in the United States is to outlaw the possession of any type of 
firearm by the civilian populace." <P>

Naturally, some gun control advocates would rather avoid the need to 
use data at all.  "It defies common sense," said Kotowski at his press 
conference, "to think that putting more guns on the streets is going 
to make us safer." <p>

Actually it makes perfect sense.  If a criminal thinks you might be 
packing something more powerful than a tiny canister of pepper spray, 
he might be just a bit more hesitant to rape, rob, or kill you.  
That's common sense, and the Chicago study simply backs it up. <p>

Common sense also suggests that if this were happening, criminals 
might compensate somewhat by committing more property crimes.  And the 
Chicago study found just that.  Criminals respond "to the threat of 
being shot" by substituting "less risky crimes," state the Chicago 
authors.  One example is burglaries in which the criminal has "cased" 
the house to make sure no one will be home. <p>

That seems a small price to pay.  I don't know about you, but I'd 
rather have my home or car broken into than be smashed over the head 
for my wallet or have my girlfriend raped.  I'll bet even most handgun 
control advocates feel the same way.   <p>

<title>Fumento:  Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish - 8/07/96</title>

   <h2>
         Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish</h2>
<P>
(DENVER, COLORADO) Oxygenated fuels started here in Denver and took 
the nation by storm--sort of like the Denver Boot, a nasty contraption 
they clamp onto your wheel when you don't pay your tickets.  But 
unlike the boot, which works all too well (don't ask me how I know!), 
it turns out that oxy fuels may be virtually worthless, yet cost 
motorists across the country billions of dollars. 
<P>
That's the conclusion of a recently-released report by the National 
Research Council (NRC), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The report has been utterly ignored outside of the Denver area, yet it 
concerns municipalities--and drivers--across the country. 
<P>
Oxygenated fuels, generally shortened to "oxy fuels", are made by 
putting an additive into gasoline, usually either ethanol made from 
corn or a chemical derived from natural gas called MTBE. These 
additives put more oxygen into the gasoline, and in theory make your 
car burn more cleanly. Allegedly they especially reduce the production 
of carbon monoxide, which reaches relatively high levels in many 
places during the winter. 
<P>
About 27 areas around the country are using oxy fuels during the 
winter months.  They are not provided as options, but rather forced 
into your gas tank by law.  Which is the only way local governments 
can get motorists to use them, since they not only cost as much as 
seven cents a gallon more than regular gasoline but also decrease 
mileage by at least 2-3 percent. 
<P>
As to how much this is costing the nation as a whole, bizarrely enough 
the EPA says it doesn't know.  "That should be one of the easiest 
things to identify," says Carleton Howard, an atmospheric scientist at 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, 
Colorado. 
<P>
In any case, the Colorado Health Department says the program has cost 
the Denver area alone about $14 million a year since 1988 and critics 
say it could be twice that.  It could therefore easily be setting back 
the nation over half a billion a year. 
<P>
And for what?  We don't know, says the NRC.  Nobody knows. 
<P>
The Colorado Department of Health (CDH) instituted the oxy fuels 
program back in 1988 under pressure from lobbyists funded in great 
part by the huge grain conglomerate, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).  
ADM is the biggest producer of the oxy-fuel additive ethanol.  It has 
also been supporting an activist who goes around saying that ethanol's 
chief rival, MTBE, makes people sick. 
<P>
  The CDH concluded the oxy-fuels program was a resounding success and 
made it permanent in Denver.  Mayor Federico Pena (now Secretary of 
Transportation) crowed about it, the Environmental Protection Agency 
crowed about it, and next thing you know, Congress was requiring it 
around the country. 
<P>
But CDH had based its approval on two findings.  First, it said that 
carbon monoxide levels in Denver's air had gone down significantly 
since the program was instituted.  Actually the city's carbon monoxide 
levels had been dropping yearly since the 1970s, primarily due to the 
installation of catalytic converters on cars.  Ah!  Details, details, 
said the CDH.  Don't bother us with details! 
<P>
Second, it put together a nice computer model that it claimed showed 
that an area-wide oxy-fuels program would reduced carbon monoxide by 
29 percent. 
<P>
But while computers don't lie, liars compute.  The NRC found that the 
most optimistic study which actually measured carbon monoxide 
reductions from oxy fuels found a 16 percent drop.  And the author of 
that study, University of Denver chemist Donald Stedman, says that 
even if everybody else had such promising results "it wouldn't be cost 
effective." 
<P>
Other studies such as one conducted by the University of Georgia found 
virtually no reduction in carbon monoxide emissions at all. 
<P>
According to one NRC panel member, University of Colorado professor 
Douglas Lawson, it does seem to be the case that at warm temperatures 
oxy fuels reduce carbon monoxide.  But carbon monoxide is only a cold-
weather problem.  "In some studies there were higher carbon monoxide 
emissions with oxy fuels at that lower temperature than with standard 
fuels," Lawson told me. 
<P>
Further, even if oxy fuels do reduce carbon monoxide, they can 
increase levels of other pollutants.  For example, benzene levels go 
up.  Benzene is strongly suspected to be a human carcinogen. 
<P>
Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, merely replaces oxygen in the 
bloodstream.  While this can be fatal in massive doses (such as when a 
faulty propane heater killed former tennis great Vitas Gerulaitis), in 
even the heaviest levels ever recorded in the air above a city it 
never causes anything more than headaches and fatigue. 
<P>
In any event, notes Lawson, "It's been known since 1983 that majority 
of emissions come from a small percentage of the cars on the road."  
<P>
Says Stedman, "Forcing all drivers to use oxy fuels for the sake of 
those few broken cars is like making everybody take aspirin every day 
for the sake of a few who will get headaches." 
<P>
As a result of the NRC findings, Colorado Governor Roy Romer--hardly 
an enemy of regulation--says he is considering dropping the oxy-fuels 
program.  Unfortunately, since this story was ignored in all the other 
parts of the country that have since adopted it, the evil that 
Colorado's regulators did will live on.

<h2>
           Paper Scares Parents for Politics and Profit
</h2>
<p>
"DEADLY AIR BAGS."  So ran the inch-high headline in USA Today.  "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children," was the title of an accompanying story.  Jump to the next page and you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags are Claiming the Lives of Children," while yet the next jump is entitled "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's nothing a sensationalist paper likes more than running stories about suffering children, and no paper does it better than USA Today. Back in the early 1980s it led the way in publicizing the epidemic of missing children, an epidemic that turned out to be non-existent.  Now there seems to be an epidemic of children crushed under air bags which--oh irony of ironies--are supposed to save lives.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not the world's biggest proponent of air bags.  I AM one of the world's biggest proponents of seat belts. Twice seat belts have saved my life.  The second time was when my car went flying off a cliff and tumbled down 350 feet.  I would have had just a few scratches had my air bag not then--after the tumbling had stopped--gone off and bruised my face.  Gee, thanks a lot.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that's the nature of the beast.  Presently air bags only protect you in head-on collisions.  And while they don't provide much additional protection beyond seat belts, they apparently do help a little, saving a little over 500 lives a year.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unless, it seems, you're a small child.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to USA Today, probably 20 children will be killed by air bags this year, ten more than will have their lives saved by the devices.  Now ten children is ten children, no doubt about that.  But this year, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, about 1,100 children between the ages of 0 to 4 will be killed in motor vehicle accidents.  An additional 2,000 will die who are between the ages of 5 and 11.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
With that many deaths, it is hard to imagine any aspect of motor vehicles less likely to kill your child than air bags.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything that can possibly kill your child that will kill fewer children this year than air bags.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, USA Today does everything it can to exaggerate the scope of these deaths.  Of 22 children known to have been killed by air bags since 1993, it pictures fully 12 of them.  For each and every child on which it was able to obtain records, it lists their name, age, home town, and date of death.  Their anguished parents are repeatedly quoted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Meanwhile, the thousands of other children killed in other ways since then by car accidents go unmentioned, and even the number goes unlisted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yeah, yeah, but aren't I missing the big point here, that these devices that are supposed to save lives are taking them?  No, because tradeoffs with safety devices are commonplace.  Seat belts, for example, save over 5,000 American lives each year but every once in a while somebody whose life would have been saved if they had been thrown clear was instead trapped in their vehicle by a seat belt.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Air bags do save lives.  Last year, according to National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) figures, air bags saved 570 lives and took 12, including eight children.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The real point here is that while we're off  turning little bogeymen into giants, giant bogeymen are stalking the land but not getting huge spreads in USA Today or elsewhere.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A fourth of all children in this country are now obese, setting them up for a lifetime of disease and early death.  Schools are steadily dropping physical education programs from their curricula and nobody's complaining.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Half of all black children in this country, according to Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, are suffering broken chromosomes due to lack of folic acid in their diets.  Broken chromosomes often lead to cancer. Adding folic acid to the diet is a cinch, but parents worried about airbags and all the other media-fabricated scares of the week--from Alar to power line electromagnetic fields to pit bull attacks--don't even know this.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of course, as few deaths as air bags cause, they could be made to cause even fewer.  Many years ago regulators such as Joan Claybrook, who was then President Carter's head of NHTSA and is now at the Naderite Center for Auto Safety, suspected that air bags posed a risk to children. Nonetheless, she pushed full speed ahead and child safety precautions were never built in.  But whose fault was that?  Why, says USA Today, Ronald Reagan's of course!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"'If I had gone back another four years, it's entirely possible we'd have gone back and rewritten the (air bag) standard' to better account for children," USA Today quotes Claybrook as saying. "But Ronald Reagan ousted Carter," says the paper, "foreclosing Claybrook's chance to revise the standard."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Entirely possible"?  She just needed four more years?  It's bad enough to use pictures of cute dead kids to sell papers, but turning them into political fodder--well, that's just cold.

<h2>
The Great Black Church-burning Hoax
</h2>
<p>
Responding to the reported wave of southern black church burnings, 
President Clinton proclaimed that "Racial hostility is the driving 
force" behind the church burnings and said, "I want to ask every 
citizen in America to say we . . . we are not slipping back to those 
dark days." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Okay, Mr. President, I'll say it.  I'll say it because this "epidemic 
of hatred" is a fraud.  A myth.  A deliberate hoax.  There is no good 
evidence of  any increase in black church burnings. There is, however, 
evidence, that a single activist group has taken the media and the 
nation on a wild ride. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It turns out there is no good federal data on black church arsons.  
The FBI doesn't keep such statistics, and the Department of Justice 
doesn't usually break them down by white and black churches or arson 
and accidents.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms only 
tracks federal fires and those it's specifically asked to investigate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A private group, the National Fire Protection Association, keeps 
careful track of church arsons.  While their data don't break down 
churches by race, they do show a dramatic drop in the number of church 
arsons, from 1,420 in 1980 to 520 in 1994. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Though arson committed against any house of worship is especially 
heinous, it should be reassuring to know there have been far fewer 
recently than there used to be.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So who is giving out these data suggesting it's open season on black 
churches?  It turns out the main source--indeed, the one which started 
the whole thing--is far from impartial.  It is the Atlanta-based 
Center for Democratic Renewal, whose self-proclaimed mission is to 
work "with progressive activists and organizations to build a movement 
to counter right-wing rhetoric and public policy initiatives." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally called the National Anti-Klan Network, it changed its name 
when the Klan virtually fell apart in the 1980s.  But far from seeing 
that as a sign of declining bigotry, it has continued for more than a 
decade to issue statements and reports "discovering" a sudden 
resurgence in racist activity. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR's agenda goes well beyond rooting out genuine bigotry; the 
group tars mainstream conservatives with the same brush as racist 
criminals.  The Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the CDR board said,  
"There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons 
and those that are really doing the burning." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In late March, the CDR held a press conference and released a 
preliminary report showing a tremendous surge in black church arsons 
from 1990 to the present.  From there it's been a media snowball, with 
over 2,200 stories written on the subject to date--including three 
huge consecutive layouts in USA Today. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"You're talking about a well-organized white-supremacist movement," 
the Rev. Mac Charles Jones, a CDR board member told one paper.  "This 
is domestic terrorism," he told CNN. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But after numerous law enforcement agencies concluded there didn't 
seem to be any contact between those arsonists who had been arrested, 
others have blamed, as Jesse Jackson put it, "a cultural conspiracy."  
The "ringleaders" are everyone from talk radio hosts to Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas to the religious right. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
said the Christian Coalition "created the context for the fires." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR report claims there have been 90 arsons against black churches 
in nine southern states since 1990, with the number rising every year 
up to 35 in 1996 as of  June 18.  Each culprit "arrested and/or 
detained," it stresses, has been white. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But when I contacted the law enforcement officials of several states 
on the CDR list, a very different picture emerged. The CDR, it turned 
out, regularly ignored fires set by blacks and those that occurred in 
the early part of the decade, and labeled fires as arsons that were 
not--all in an apparent effort to make black church torchings appear 
to be an escalating phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example CDR lists ten churches allegedly torched in Alabama, but 
State Fire Marshall John Robison says that only one of these was a 
confirmed arson.  All the others were accidental, undetermined, or 
weren't fires at all but vandalisms. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
CDR somehow managed to omit three bonafide black church arsons that 
took place in Alabama in 1994.  In two cases the culprits were black. 
Moreover, the group left out ten black church arsons that took place 
before 1994, creating the illusion that the burning of black churches 
is a recent phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even the claim that black churches have been singled out for arson is 
questionable.  In 1995, according to USA Today, there were 45 arsons 
against white churches and 27 against black ones in the surveyed 
states. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Other than saying that some black churches over the years have fallen 
prey to racists, we can't easily infer motives. "We have not uncovered 
in [Alabama's] 38 cases a single piece of information to substantiate 
racially-motivated fires," said Robison.  Further, "There have been no 
dramatic increases, except for this year because of the media hype."  
Other states' officials have told him the same. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here lies the ultimate irony.  By claiming there has been an epidemic 
of black church burnings, it appears that in recent months they have 
actually caused one. They have also fomented tremendous racial 
division and caused great fear among southern black churchgoers. That 
which the Ku Klux Klan can no longer do, a group established to fight 
the Klan has done for them.

<h2>
Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento

<P>
We often hear that to live longer, most of us need to lose weight.  
But did you know that when it comes to automobiles, losing weight is a 
killer? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's the conclusion of a draft National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) study just evaluated by the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS).  It found that for every 100 pounds shaved off the 
average weight of cars, 322 more Americans will die each year in 
traffic accidents. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The NAS panel declined to endorse the report, but did not specifically 
reject the 322 death figure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That estimate is considerably higher than the 200 deaths  a year cited 
in a 1991 NHTSA report. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it should make us re-evaluate an anachronistic law that's turned 
an agency with "Safety Administration" in its name into a killer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The law is CAFE, which stands for Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
standards.  Congress enacted it in the mid-1970s as a means to 
increase the fuel economy of cars and reduce our dependence on foreign 
oil.  It mandates that the cars sold by any manufacturer selling in 
the United States must average at least 27.5 miles per gallon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since then, we've fought a war which made clear that nobody can tamper 
with our foreign oil supplies.  The post-war period has shown that the 
world has such a glut of oil that even with one of its major producers 
(Iraq) out the business, prices when adjusted for inflation are as low 
as they've ever been. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet CAFE remains on the books and it continues to kill.  Here's why. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are numerous ways in which auto makers have made their vehicles 
more fuel efficient.  Engines have been improved, tires have been 
stiffened so they balloon less at high speeds, car bodies have been 
made to cause less wind resistance. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But for all this, the easiest way to improve mileage is still to make 
a car lighter or to simply sell more lighter cars and fewer heavier 
ones. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA has calculated that every 10 percent reduction car weight, on 
average, produces and 8 percent reduction in fuel consumption. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And there's the rub.  For as car companies have sold more lighter 
cars, there have been more deaths as a result. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In what is still the best peer-reviewed work on the subject, Robert 
Crandall of the Brookings Institute and John Graham of Harvard 
calculated that CAFE had caused about 500 pounds to be cut from 
automobiles and that this 500 pound reduction was causing from 2,200 
to 3,900 fatalities per year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They found that each 100 pounds shaved off cost 440 to 780 lives--
somewhat above NHTSA's calculation but the point is the same.  
Lightness kills. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In defense of CAFE, NHTSA has pointed out that since it was enacted, 
automobile death rates have gone down considerably. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sure they have, but that's because on a per-vehicle miles traveled 
basis deaths have been going down since the 1920s.  The point is they 
would have declined even further but for CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another argument is that cars are safer than ever because of things 
like airbags and crumple zones that make the car collapse upon impact 
in such a way as to protect passengers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This, too, is true but irrelevant.  Were it not for CAFE those cars 
would be safer yet.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, one study shows that an airbag is the equivalent of about 485 
pounds.  So the airbag that you think makes you so much safer really 
just, on average, offsets CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA contends that while cars have gotten lighter, there's no telling 
how much of this is due to CAFE  and how much to market forces.  It 
notes that many consumer items, such as cameras have been downsized by 
manufacturers without any incentive from the government. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that comparison is "incredibly dumb," points out Sam Kazman, chief 
counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.  
"Cameras are products you carry around on cords around your neck.  
There's a tremendous incentive to make them smaller and lighter.  But 
with fuel prices staying the same, there's no indication that market 
forces have made cars lighter." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since 1988, Kazman and CEI have fought CAFE, calling it "blood for 
oil."  In 1992 they sued NHTSA over the agency's insistence that CAFE 
wasn't killing anyone.  The court found that NHTSA had used "fudged 
analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and "bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo" 
in order to avoid dealing with CAFE's safety impact. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unfortunately, NHTSA won the next time the case returned to the court, 
because the judges said that while they were troubled by the safety 
issue, a bureaucratic agency deserves a certain amount of deference. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And so, the deception continues.  As do the deaths. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If all that's not enough for you, Bill Clinton and Al Gore's 1992 
book, Putting People First proposes raising CAFE standards to 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2,000 and 45 miles per gallon by 2015.  That 
sounds more like putting people last.

<title>Fumento: Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction - 6/27/96</title>

<h2>            
Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
When I heard seven tobacco company executives testify before Congress back in 1994 
that smoking wasn't addictive, I thought "These guys are lying through their nicotine-
stained teeth." The issue has resurfaced with Bob Dole's recent remarks at a Kentucky 
rally that, "To some people, smoking is addictive; to others, they can take it or leave it." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Having studied the issue since that original congressional hearing, I've found it's a lot 
more complex than most of us think. In fact, Dole's characterization seems about as 
sound as anything you'll hear on the subject. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
No matter, for Dole is a presidential candidate, and so a tempting--apparently irresistible-
-target. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The last thing our kids need to hear is a statement from a man who would be president 
that smoking is not addictive," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. "Senator Dole, side 
with our kids, not with the tobacco industry."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Dole's comments show that Joe Camel -- the cartoon 
advertisement figure -- is in the lead to be his running mate. Mother Jones magazine 
actually took a full-page advertisement out in the New York Times declaring that Joe 
Camel would be Dole's choice for Surgeon General. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Referring to the fact that tobacco companies have been among Dole's biggest campaign 
contributors, Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said "Bob Dole should spend 
more time looking at the scientific evidence and less time counting his campaign 
contributions."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But you needn't be a recipient of tobacco money to think that this addiction thing is a lot 
smokier than it might seem.  True, a lot of people have had a hard time quitting 
cigarettes, but there are about as many who have managed to quit as are still smoking.  
According to the surgeon general, the vast majority of them gave up the habit without 
formal treatment. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We live in a country in which a third of us are obese. Virtually all of them will tell you 
they've tried restricting their food intake but just can't keep it up.  Does that make food 
addictive? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One definition of addiction says that the substance in question must have some sort of 
intoxicating effect, and cigarettes do--albeit very slight compared to such drugs as 
cocaine and heroin.  But researchers have found the same thing about chocolate, that it 
raises levels of certain chemicals in the brain and makes you feel better. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of us joke about being "chocoholics" but to some who binge on thousands of 
calories of chocolate a day it's no laughing matter.  Indeed, a drug has now been found to 
block chocolate cravings. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But there is no scientific definition of addiction.  Neither the Diagnostic and Statistical 
manual of the American Psychiatric Association nor the World Organization use the term 
addiction.  This allows anybody who wants to use any definition they wish. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, the famous 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on smoking concluded that 
smoking was not addictive, though the Surgeon General's office now says it is--a move 
some say is motivated by politics and not science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately it comes down to how a New York Times headline put it in 1994: "Is Nicotine 
Addictive?  It Depends on Whose Criteria You Use." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Bob Dole cleverly sidestepped the issue of whether smoking is addictive in general 
and observed that different substances have different effects on different people. You 
really can't argue with that--as much as his opportunistic opponents have tried. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As it is, however, the issue of addiction is a red herring.  Dole was also right when he 
said, "But I think the more serious question is whether or not the FDA has jurisdiction" 
over cigarettes. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA is using the addiction issue as an excuse to gain the power to regulate tobacco.  
But it routinely regulates drugs that are non-addictive--antibiotics, for instance--while 
forsaking regulation of substances that are. By the same criteria the FDA is applying to 
tobacco, "beverages containing alcohol or caffeine are addictive, but they're not regulated 
as drugs," notes Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, author of an upcoming 
book on the anti-smoking movement. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Addictiveness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for FDA jurisdiction," he 
says. Rather, it's just a smokescreen for Commissioner David Kessler to justify the 
sudden reversal of its longstanding position that cigarettes are not covered by the Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. "They pretend this is a new development," Sullum told me, "but 
people have been talking about the addictive potential of tobacco for hundreds of years." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Only in one respect was Dole truly wrong. He also told the Kentucky crowd, "In effect, if 
they should claim jurisdiction and find that cigarettes are a drug, then in effect, you're 
banning cigarettes and production of tobacco, so it's going to affect a lot of people." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Possibly, but probably not. Kessler and Waxman did initially say that if the FDA decided 
to regulate tobacco as a drug, a ban might be its only option. But now the FDA is instead 
pushing a series of measures ostensibly intended to reduce underage smoking, including 
restrictions on advertising, promotion, and sales. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Personally, I like some of what they propose. Society has traditionally given children less 
leeway to do stupid things than it has adults. But Dole's right in that cigarette regulation 
is best left to the states--and individuals and their parents. Federal Big Brother should--
pun intended--butt out.

<h2>
     Animal Rights Mean Human Wrongs
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Back when I was in college, I attended a meeting of the local animal 
rights organization.  When somebody asked the group leader about using 
animals for medical research she replied (and I'm not making this up) 
"Well, it's our belief that people shouldn't get sick, in which case 
there would be no need for animal testing." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Such awesome smugness is actually par for the course for these people.  
Consider the following statements from Ingrid Newkirk, co-founder and 
vice-president of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the 
largest animal rights organization.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Medical research is "immoral even if it's essential." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even if animal testing produced a cure for AIDS, "We'd be against it."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And here's the kicker:   "Six million people died in concentration 
camps," she told the Washington Post, "but six billion broiler 
chickens will die this year in slaughter houses." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Somehow I have trouble identifying that chicken breast I ate last 
night with my cousins who died in German camps.  And I must say that 
"Heil Frank Perdue!" seems to lack an ominous ring. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But then, I am a member of the group that constitutes the lowest form 
of animal life.  No, not lawyers--humans. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This week, the animal rights groups are going on the warpath against 
us human types.  They're launching "World Animal Awareness Week," 
beginning June 18th, in Washington, D.C. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the medical community has decided it's mad as hell and 
isn't going to take it anymore. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They pre-empted Wacky Week by launching their own campaign.  It 
included a press conference, statements by scientists and patients 
affected by animal rights extremism, release of a joint consensus 
letter signed by the nation's leading AIDS organizations supporting 
animal testing, and a report called Endangered Cures, which details 
specific areas of research threatened by animal rights activists. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Animal rights activists aren't called that for nothing.  They don't 
just stand around on street corners politely handing out pamphlets.  
Indeed, they have struck at scores of labs across the country and in 
other nations, smashing equipment and releasing experimental animals--
sometimes killing them in the process. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Among the raids the animal liberators have conducted was one on the 
laboratory of Dr. John Orem, who was using cats in painless research 
on crib death.  Crib death will claim 8,000 babies lives this year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Everyone who works with experimental animals lives in constant fear of 
harassment, vandalism, and death threats.  Said PETA's medical 
advisor, Dr. Neal Barnard, a few years ago, "We're demoralizing the 
people who think there's a buck to be made in animal research.  And 
they're starting to get scared . . . and they're starting to veer 
away." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the activists are also waging a war of public opinion with 
misleading ad campaigns, staged photos of animals in pain, and by 
enlisting the support of many celebrities like Paul McCartney, the B-
52s, Kim Basinger, Mary Tyler Moore, Woody Harrelson, and Alec 
Baldwin--the last of whom was later spotted wearing a leather jacket.  
Oops. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The worst aspect of these campaigns, says Frankie Trull, president of 
the Foundation for Biomedical Research.  "Is the way they have shaped 
public opinion by providing misinformation and playing upon emotions 
of people who love pets." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is ironic, because if the activists get their way, keeping a pet 
will be outlawed as slavery.  Pet ownership is an "absolutely abysmal 
situation brought about by human manipulation," Newkirk told the 
Washingtonian magazine. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But such views are kept out of the slick adds.  As a result, "They're 
eroding public support that would allow this research to continue," 
Trull told me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The stakes couldn't be higher.  Animal testing of drugs intended for 
humans is absolutely vital.  Indeed, it's required by law. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"All drugs approved by FDA in last 30 years have to be tested on 
animals," says Wise Young, a professor of neurosurgery at New York 
University Medical Center and medical advisor to actor Christopher 
Reeve. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Without animal testing, he told me, we wouldn't have gotten anti-
hypertension drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, pharmaceuticals for epilepsy, 
or any of the modern anti-depressants.  "It's horrendous the kinds of 
lives people have when they don't have the benefits of research." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He noted that one drug originally tested on spinal cord injuries in 
humans failed.  But later it was tried in much higher doses in 
animals. There it was found effective and the trials were successfully 
repeated in humans.  This drug was given to Reeve and reduced his 
paralysis to the point where he has been able to resume much of his 
life. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, the animal rights activists are simply parasites.  They 
benefit just as much from animal-assisted medical research as anyone, 
even while they vigorously oppose it.  Oh sure, they abstain from 
eating hamburgers or wearing raccoon coats. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On the other hand, they could wear bracelets with tags (similar to 
those worn by persons with penicillin allergies), saying "In case of 
emergency, do not administer any drugs or therapies tested on 
animals." Bet you don't see that any time soon.

<P>

Wanted for pandering: President William J. Clinton. No, not 
philandering, pandering.  The latest incident: doling out money to 
veterans allegedly suffering from the effects of the herbicide Agent 
Orange, in order to shore up his political support among a group that 
has understandably come to loathe him.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clinton had a PR problem with the military even before he became 
president.  When almost three million of America's sons and daughters 
served their country in Vietnam, he was dodging the draft and figuring 
out a way to smoke marijuana without inhaling.  As president, he had 
barely taken the oath of office when he ordered that homosexuals be 
openly allowed in the military. And now, the greatest insult, his 
lawyer has declared him an active duty serviceman in order to postpone 
Paula Jones's suit against him. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So with the election just five months off and his opponent a true war 
hero, Clinton decided to open the government coffers to a number of 
Vietnam vets by providing compensation for those who have suffered 
from a rare nerve disease called peripheral neuropathy, who contract 
prostate cancer, or have babies born with spina bifida. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Veterans' Administration has estimated the five-year cost of this 
largesse at $350 million, which of course is too low because early 
estimates always are.  In any case, because prostate cancer is the 
most common malignant tumor in men (about one in ten will eventually 
contract it) and because Vietnam vets are only now starting to reach 
the age where it becomes a major threat, the cost of this giveaway 
will surely reach many billions of dollars. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This might be fair if there were scientific evidence that these 
problems were really being caused by Agent Orange.  But there is not. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Those who were exposed to the very highest levels--the men of 
"Operation Ranchhand" who actually sprayed it--have been intensely 
studied for years. They have shown no more cancers, and their children 
no more birth defects, people with no dioxin or Agent Orange exposure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, one of the Ranchhand researchers told a House committee in 
April, "The accumulated evidence does not establish that there is a 
cause-and-effect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina 
bifida." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So where does President Clinton get off on saying there IS a 
connection? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
His support comes from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which is 
an update of an earlier report previously used to grant compensation 
to veterans suffering other diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, non-
Hodgkins lymphoma, and certain respiratory cancers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
IOM is an arm of the non-governmental National Academy of Sciences.  
Congress asked the group to look into Agent Orange after Congress's 
own Office of Technology Assessment repeatedly found that very few 
ground troops were ever exposed to the herbicide and that no vets or 
their offspring had been shown to suffer health effects from it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Both IOM studies used methodology that was anything but scientific.  
They largely ignored the volumes of data that showed no link between 
Agent Orange and health effects--the Ranchhander findings--and instead 
looked at studies of  Swedish and Dutch herbicide applicators, and the 
like. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Any study of anybody anywhere in the world with exposure to 
herbicides was used by IOM," explains Michael Gough, director of 
science and risk studies at the Cato Institute, a former chairman of 
the Ranchhand Advisory Committee, and author of the book Dioxin, Agent 
Orange. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One problem: None of these people were exposed to Agent Orange, but 
rather to other types of herbicides, many of which didn't even contain 
dioxin. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, the studies themselves consistently contradicted each other.  
One might find an excess of lung cancer but not of Hodgkin's disease.  
Another would find an excess of Hodgkin's disease but not of lung 
cancer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ignoring such inconvenient facts, the IOM--well aware that it was 
working under political parameters and not scientific ones--seized on 
the slightest excuses to indict the herbicides even when the evidence 
weighed heavily on the other side. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, their 1993 report listed 28 studies which looked for 
prostate cancer among persons exposed to herbicide.  Of these, three 
were positive (that is, they found a statistically significant 
increase), one was significantly negative, and 24 didn't go either 
way.  Bingo!  Herbicides cause prostate cancer.  Agent Orange is an 
herbicide.  Ergo, Agent Orange causes prostate cancer! 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"It's unbelievably bad what the IOM did," says Gough. "I think one of 
the major costs of something like this is that all the scientists, 
government and nongovernment, who have done their best to understand 
and explain the health of veterans are now discredited." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, he says, it also bodes ill for getting the truth out on Gulf War 
Syndrome, another alleged disease phenomenon that has more to do with 
politics than science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, it is the vets themselves who will lose the most. Yes, 
some will get money, if they contract the right diseases. But at the 
same time, they're being needlessly terrified. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How many vets will now refuse to have babies because they're afraid 
they will be born with birth defects?  How many will spend the next 
few decades agonizing that because of their Vietnam service they are 
far more likely to contract prostate cancer, a terrible illness to get 
even if you survive it?   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Once again, Clinton has shown himself the enemy of the military.  And 
it's when he's making a show of being compassionate that he does the 
most damage.

<h2>Men & Abortion</h2><p>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">
<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><br> 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am going to try to say this without sounding like a man-hating 
feminist. Here goes. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are few things in life more disgusting than men who, when 
discussing abortion, use the phrase: "I can't tell a woman what to do 
with her body." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's like a password. It's usually pronounced with a self-satisfied 
smile. They're saying, "I'm cool. I'm a supportive kinda guy. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of women." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yea, right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes, there's a slight reluctance in their voice as they recite 
the mantra. Those are the ones who believe that while they, 
personally, are opposed to abortion, they couldn't tell a 
woman...blah, blah, blah. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You've heard it before, I'm sure. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In most cases, these guys have never, in their lives, used the words 
"chaste" and "dating" in the same sentence. You can bet that many of 
them are pretty adroit at telling a woman what to do with her body, if 
it happens to serve their own needs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Abortion, or "choice," as it's euphemistically called, becomes a 
requirement, for many of them, because it has the ability to erase any 
unforeseen problems caused by their lack of moral discretion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I was at a G.O.P. cocktail party last week, and a man used that old 
line on me: "I can't tell a woman what to do with her body."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I gave him the logical response: "What about the body inside her womb? 
What if it's a male body, a little boy? Surely that can't be her body, 
because she can't be a man and a woman at the same time. Can you tell 
her, in that case?" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He looked at me glumly. This was not the response he expected. He 
probably assumed, because I'm a young woman, that I'm pro-choice.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not a wise move. Three major studies within the last four years show 
that women tend to be more pro-life than men.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Makes sense, doesn't it? We're the ones with the maternal instincts, 
and if we know the facts of life -- meaning all the stuff you never 
read in the newspaper, such as what an abortion does to an unborn 
child -- many of us come down on the side of the baby. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I've been around enough men to know that they occasionally daydream 
about great feats they would perform if, for example, they suddenly 
found themselves trapped, with their whole platoon, under enemy fire. 
It's one of the most charming qualities of men, this desire to prove 
themselves to be brave and fearless. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, so many men fail to realize that all around them, in our modern 
world, are opportunities to show their valor. Every day, they are 
confronted with opportunities to witness to the truth -- situations 
which, perhaps, take more courage than saving a platoon from enemy 
attack. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once a month, I attend a rosary vigil with about 200 people in front 
of a local Planned Parenthood clinic. I see the woman going in for 
abortions, some reluctantly, some being steered through the door by a 
man who is probably the father of the baby.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After about 45 minutes, some of the men come out, alone, looking 
relieved. They did their duty and sat in the waiting room with their 
significant other until it was time for the abortion, and then they 
get to go off -- get a cup of coffee, read the paper -- while she's in 
the recovery room.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What bothers me is that most of these guys are dressed as if they were 
on a date -- as if they were on the way to the movies. Except, this 
date involves the destruction of their children, and the wounding of 
their girlfriends. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'm with the early feminists, when it comes to abortion. Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Alice Bunker Stockham, and the 
whole crowd of them were staunchly pro-life. They called abortion 
"child murder," and the "exploitation of women and children." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More emphatically, they pointed out that abortion primarily serves the 
needs of the predatory male. In a July, 1869, article in "The 
Revolution," the feminist newspaper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
and Susan B. Anthony, the latter -- of current U.S. one-dollar coin 
fame-- wrote: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Guilty? Yes, no matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to 
save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty 
who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will 
burden her soul in death; but oh! thrice guilty is he who, for selfish 
gratification, heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove 
her to the desperation which impels her to the crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In her day, Susan B. Anthony was describing a tiny minority of men. 
Today, you'll run into hordes of them at just about any political 
cocktail party you attend. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, still, there are countless other men who dare to swim against the 
tide -- men who respect life, and respect women, at a time when 
neither is required by the world. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those are men who don't have to daydream about performing feats of 
great valor. They do it every day.

<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  



When the local Catholic priest trades his black suit and Roman collar 
for faded jeans and a T-shirt, and says to his flock, "Just call me 
Bob," what should you do? 
<P>
I suppose intercessory prayer should be your first response, but after 
that, you might think of picking up "Serpent On the Rock," a 1994 book 
by Alice Thomas Ellis, a native of Liverpool. 
<P>
It's a funny, faithful, and realistic view of what it means to be 
Catholic in the 1990s.  <P>

P.D. James, best-selling author of British murder mysteries, reviewed 
the book for the Times Literary Supplement, and described it as: "One 
woman's idiosyncratic, passionate and sometimes intemperate 
view...(It) should be compulsory reading for all bishops and placed in 
the library of all seminaries and theological colleges." <P>

But, most importantly, it will make you laugh. In fact, it's quite 
possible that while reading the book you will, on occasion, be 
convulsed by fits of uncontrollable laughter. I was. 
<P>
Ellis, the mother of seven children, traveled across Ireland and 
England, asking people what they thought about the current state of 
the Catholic Church.  <P>

 Ecumenism, liberation theology, liturgy, and feminism -- it's all 
there. <P>

She gives plenty of ink to Catholics who dissent from Church 
teachings. Then, she politely puts in a word or two of her own. 
<P>
She writes: "Visiting some people I had not seen for years I found 
again that smiling determination to deny that there is anything awry 
in the Church -- despite the fact that the Vatican and many 
theologians are seldom in accord and that there is laxity, confusion 
and an abundance of what used to be called heresy until it was decided 
that this was rude and everyone was entitled to his own opinion." 
<P>
Ellis, on church architecture: <P>

"If you visited a place where you knew the Catholic church had been 
recently constructed, you only had to ask for the most diabolically 
ugly building in town, bar none." 
<P>
On the interior decoration of churches: 
<P>
"It doesn't feel too different from McDonald's or the bank, and the 
local post office has got a new carpet, too. If I merely want to feel 
comfortable I go to the pub." 
<P>
On Confession: <P>
   "The church noticeboard advertised a 'Ceremony of Reconciliation' 
with the word 'Confession' in brackets. One day, bowed down under an 
awareness of my failings, I went to unburden my soul. Having conducted 
an examination of conscience I announced 'sub rosa' that, on 
reflection, I had to accuse myself of having fallen short in virtually 
every aspect of what was required of me: I was, to say the least, 
inadequate as a daughter, wife, mother and Catholic. Picture my 
astonishment on hearing my confessor suggest soothingly that he feared 
I was suffering from 'low self-esteem.'" 
<P>
On women priests:  
<P>
"I find something infinitely touching in the sight of males serving at 
the altar. A seriousness, a dignity and a humility which are not 
readily apparent in most of the other things they do. Women don't give 
the same impression. I saw some round the altar in New Zealand. They 
looked incongruous and bossy, very much as though they felt only they 
knew how to wash up properly." 
<P>
On sex: 
<P>
"I keep meeting women who insist on telling me how important their sex 
drive is to them. Once they might have announced they were regular 
church-goers; now they tell you they're sexually active. It's a sort 
of claim to credibility." 
<P>
On homosexuality: 
<P>
"Nor do I understand why so many people seem determined to define 
themselves by their sexual orientation. It seems unnecessarily 
limiting. When a person fixes you with a glance and says 'I'm 
gay/lesbian, you know,' you think: 'So what, darling? Just don't eat 
with your mouth open.'" 
<P>
On nuns:  
<P>
"One sometimes hears of women who are said to have been 'hurt' by the 
Church. I was thinking now of a new-style 'nun' who, finding herself 
at dinner sitting between two Jesuits, burst into tears because they 
spoke only to each other. She felt ignored and therefore diminished -- 
and fled, weeping. As a married women I am entirely accustomed to this 
kind of experience and do not mind it in the least. It gives you time 
to think your own thoughts, which are often more diverting than the 
conversations of men. Perhaps she would have felt more at ease in an 
old-fashioned convent where she would not have had to cope with the 
complexities of social intercourse between the sexes." 
<P>
Unfortunately, you might have a problem getting your hands on a copy 
of "Serpent on the Rock," published by Hodder and Stoughton, a British 
firm. So far, the book hasn't been distributed in America. 
<P>
Your local bookstore may be able to special-order it. If you have 
friends or relatives in Ireland or England, you could ask them, or 
even beg them, to send you a copy. Or, write directly to the publisher 
at: 338 Euston Rd., London NW1 3BH. 
<P>
It's worth the effort. If you're not one of the lucky Catholics in 
America who lives in a parish with a licit and reverential Mass, then 
you're probably long overdue for a dose of laughter, the best 
medicine.

<html><head><title>Howley: Divorce, Irish Style</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 28, 1995</I><hr><h2>Divorce, Irish Style</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  

Centuries of oppression couldn't stamp out the Catholic Church in 
Ireland. The deadlier the persecutions became, the more people clung 
to the Rock of Peter. 
<p>
A tragic famine that killed one out of every eight people in Ireland 
didn't shake their faith. Only a tiny fraction became "soupers," the 
name given to people who denied the faith in order to receive food 
from Protestant soup kitchens. 
<p>
Nor could dismal poverty, lasting for generations, make Irish people 
lose their hope in winning eternal life through fidelity to the 
teachings of the Church.  
<p>
But, a decade or two of secularization and materialism has managed to 
cripple the faith in Ireland quite easily, with hardly a voice raised 
in complaint. 
<p>
For proof of that, just look at their politics. 
<p>
In 1990, Ireland elected a left-wing, pro-choice lawyer, Mary 
Robinson, as president. In 1993, the government removed legal 
sanctions against homosexual activity, and made condoms freely 
available. 
<p>
And now, in a country that is more than 92 percent Catholic, divorce 
has been legalized -- albeit by a wafer-thin margin. 
<p>
In fact, the recent divorce referendum proved to be the closest vote 
in Irish history. A recount confirmed that only 9,114 "yes" votes 
provided the margin of victory for 1.6 million ballots cast. 
<p>
The Irish press lent a helping hand in defeating the pro-family 
forces, just as our own American press does for family issues on our 
side of the ocean. 
<p>
For example, Irish articles tended to describe those who opposed the 
legalization of divorce as blindly following the heavy-handed 
teachings of the oppressive Catholic Church. 
<p>
On the other hand, pro-divorce voters were not portrayed as mindlessly 
following the dictates of the liberal agenda -- like liberal Democrats 
in America, who all claim to be free-thinkers, yet, march lockstep on 
every issue.  
<p>
No -- articles tended to give the impression that supporting divorce 
qualified someone as being thoughtful and farseeing. 
<p>
And, the press employed their usual "reductio ad extremus" technique, 
giving big play to stories that profiled heartbreaking cases, to 
emphasize the tragic results of opposing liberal advances.  
<p>
Such as: the story of a young woman, abused and deserted by her 
husband, consigned to a life alone. In reality, that situation 
represents only a tiny fraction of the marriages in Ireland. 
<p>
Someday, the Irish will learn what many Americans have gleaned from 
watching the disintegration of our own society: Tough cases make bad 
laws. 
<p>
As it turned out, there were several deciding factors in the campaign 
to legalize divorce. The biggest was the $800,000 chunk of public 
money used by the government to fund a pro-divorce publicity drive. 
Shortly before the big vote, an Irish court ruled it was illegal to 
use tax revenues in that way. But, by then it was too late. Most of it 
was already spent. 
<p>
And, the pro-divorce movement was helped with cameo appearances by a 
host of Irish celebrities, such as Bono of U2, and Van Morrison. 
<p>
Another factor was the weakness of the Catholic Church, depleted by an 
endless array of sex sandals that began several years ago when the 
much-beloved bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, resigned after admitting 
he had fathered a child with an American woman. 
<p>
In the days before the vote, posters appeared on lampposts all over 
Dublin picturing Bishop Casey. The text stated: "Let the Bishops look 
after their own families ... VOTE YES." 
<p>
Fifteen years ago, no prominent Irish politician would have dared to 
support divorce. To do so would have meant mean electoral suicide. 
Yet, in the recent divorce campaign, every major party was pro-
divorce. 
<p>
What could have caused such a change in Irish society? The biggest 
impetus, many agree, has been the endless stream of soul-less 
television shows beamed into Irish homes over the last decade, most of 
it American-made. 
<p>
Last June, I was in Ireland, visiting my family. One afternoon, I 
stopped at a friend's farmhouse for tea, and while we chatted, she 
kept the television on in the background to entertain her four-year-
old daughter. 
<p>
Children in Ireland watch television just like American kids: soaking 
everything in with big eyes. 
<p>
It was an episode of "Murphy Brown" that portrayed Murphy and her 
lover having a tryst in a hotel room.  
<p>
My friend didn't mind that her daughter was exposed to such 
immorality. But, it was a shock to me, even though I was weaned on 
that kind of trash. 
<p>
What was once inconceivable in Ireland had become old hat. 
<p>
In times past, the Irish believed that marriages, even unhappy ones, 
lasted forever. They believed that adultery was a poison to a society. 
And, their laws reflected their beliefs.  
<p>
Today, they have set their sights on the liberal path that Americans 
blazed more than 20 years ago.  
<p>
It leads, as we know first-hand, to a place where broken families, 
violence and endless heartache are commonplace. 
<p>
Remember that lonely young woman, abused and abandoned by her husband? 
Currently, she represents just a handful of Irish women. But, you can 
bet that in a few decades, that sort of misery will be spread all over 
Ireland.

<html><head><title>Howley:  Pagans I Have Known</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 16, 1995</I><hr><h2>Pagans I Have Known</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  
 
The press pretty much ignored the 20th annual Women's Ordination 
Conference, held during the Veteran's Day weekend at a Marriott hotel 
near Washington D.C. 
<p>
Apparently, it's not newsworthy when 1,000 Catholic women -- more than 
half of them nuns from mainstream orders -- gather to denounce the 
teachings of their church, ridicule the pope, and voice avid support 
for lesbianism and abortion.  
<p>
Ho hum. Tell me something new. 
<p>
But, if the reporters and their cameras had been there, I'd be willing 
to bet that they wouldn't have focused on the over-the-edge, bizarre 
events of the conference, such as the Friday night opening ritual that 
included women dressed as bishops and priests, dancing on-stage to a 
rhythmic, sensual drum beat.  
<p>
Instead, they probably would have zoomed in on the mere handful of 
moments that corresponded with their idea of what these women are 
interested in: ordination and inclusive language. 
<p>
But, anyone who has spent five minutes around W.O.C. members knows 
better. Do you really think these women want to kneel at the feet of a 
"patriarchal" bishop to receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders?  
<p>
No way. First, they don't believe in Sacraments, as instituted by 
Christ and defined by the Catholic Church. For example, I've heard 
their leaders suggest, repeatedly, that several new Sacraments should 
be added to mark the stages of women's lives, such as the onset of 
wisdom, which supposedly happens when a woman reaches 50 -- they call 
it "croning." 
<p>
The "Sacrament of Croning." See what I mean?  
<p>
Secondly, they are adamant about their desire to dismantle the 
priesthood as we know it, and change the function of a priest into a 
non-sacramental facilitator who derives power from the community. 
<p>
 "Ordination means sub-ordination," was the mantra at the recent 
conference. They claim they want to "deconstruct" the priesthood. 
Meaning, they want to destroy it. 
<p>
And, inclusive language? They're definitely not interested in that. 
They demand that liturgical language be exclusively feminine. 
<p>
I've been to plenty of W.O.C. and Women-Church gatherings. The events 
always include prayers to the goddess, who, for the uninitiated, has 
three personalities -- maiden, mother, and crone -- each with various 
names. 
<p>
And, the conferences usually include bread-breaking rituals that 
resemble a Catholic Mass. 
<p>
At most of their rituals, the focal point is an altar with a statue of 
the goddess, usually with a candle burning in front of it.  
<p>
During the Saturday night "ritual meal" at the recent conference, 
there was no statue in sight, but the goddess personality of the 
moment was the ever-popular Sophia, a W.O.C. invention that twists the 
Scriptural meaning of "Sophia" -- recognized by Catholics as the 
virtue of wisdom, or as another name for the Holy Spirit -- and turns 
it into a pagan deity. 
<p>
That night, in the darkened banquet hall, one of the incantations 
sounded eerily like the Divine Praises: 
<p>
"Blessed be Sophia. Blessed be her holy name. Blessed be all women: 
young, generative and wise. Blessed be Sophia's sisters who keep alive 
the discipleship of equals. Blessed be all children who tell the 
stories of their foremothers...."  
<p>
It was chanted by all the attendees, following a bread-breaking 
ceremony. The only ones who didn't take part were a handful of 
faithful Catholics who were there as observers. 
<p>
Hours later, after the ritual meal was finished, and the attendees had 
moved on to another room for an all-women dance with cash bar, I spoke 
to one of the waitresses, who was clearing tables. 
<p>
"What did you think?" I asked her. 
<p>
"I'm a born-again Christian," she warily told me, in broken English, 
"so I really don't know about these Catholic things." 
<p>
"This was definitely not Catholic. It was pagan," I said, 
emphatically. 
<p>
She looked relieved to find out that I wasn't one of "them," and 
confided, in a low voice, "I felt the presence of evil here, tonight." 
<p>
"Me, too," I told her. 
<p>
Beyond the fact that every soul is precious in the eyes of the Father, 
why should the apostasy of W.O.C. followers interest us in the least? 
<p>
Because these are powerful women. They teach at Catholic universities 
and seminaries. They run Catholic high schools. They work in 
chancelleries and parishes. They design R.C.I.A. and C.C.D. programs. 
They run retreats and offer spiritual direction to unsuspecting 
Catholics. 
<p>
They don't want to leave the Church. They want to remake it, in their 
own image. 
<p>
And, it's rare to find one who doesn't have a string of graduate 
degrees after her name. The elderly members of their religious orders 
may live in fear of losing their health insurance as a result of a 
shrinking financial base, but these younger members, typically 50 to 
65 years old, have plenty of money to continue their education. 
<p>
In the battle for the soul of the Roman Catholic Church in America, 
these women are mighty adversaries, indeed.<p><p> <I>Copyright 1995, <a href="mailto:73360.271@compuserve.com">Kathleen Howley</a></i><P> <br><center><a href="/townhall/tbut.map"><img src="/townhall/tbut.gif" ismap border="0"></a></center></body></html>

<title>Howley:  The Catholic Church(es) in China</title>
</head>

<h2>The Catholic Church(es) in China</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
 
Americans are in the dark when it comes to the Catholic Church in 
China -- or, I should say, the two Churches in China: one, the 
underground Roman Catholic Church, the other, the Communist-controlled 
Patriotic Catholic Church. 
<p>
To illustrate the degree of confusion, Joseph Kung, the nephew of 
Ignatius Cardinal Kung, the much-beloved bishop of Shanghai, tells the 
following story: 
<p>
He was at a pro-life dinner last year in New Jersey. A monsignor 
tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself, and said: "I just saw 
your uncle. He gave a speech at the seminary this morning." 
<p>
Joseph Kung knew his uncle had not been at the seminary that day, and 
immediately realized that the monsignor was talking about the OTHER 
bishop of Shanghai -- Aloysius Jin Luxian, S.J., appointed by the 
Communists and consecrated without the Holy Father's permission. 
<p>
After Kung explained the situation, the monsignor replied: "I had no 
idea. I thought I was listening to the Roman Catholic bishop of 
Shanghai. And, so did all the other people at the lecture." 
<p>
Generous Catholics in America have donated millions of dollars to aid 
the Catholic Church in China. Few realize that their money is helping 
to support the Patriotic Church. 
<p>
Still, the real Catholic Church in China is alive and growing 
stronger, despite the fact that it is persecuted, penniless, and, it 
would seem, friendless. 
<p>
Chinese Roman Catholics celebrate their Masses in hiding, or, during 
bolder moments, in open fields. They risk life and limb to protect 
their underground priests and seminarians. Their families pray the 
Rosary in secret.  
<p>
Life would be easy if they would just align themselves with the 
Patriotic Catholic Church. But, they won't. 
<p>
They follow the example of their shepherds, the loyal bishops who have 
refused to renounce the fullness of the faith, despite imprisonment 
and torture. Three years ago, one elderly bishop, Joseph Fan Xueyan, 
S.J., was beaten to death by his jailers. The rest of the world hardly 
noticed. But, his flock did. 
<p>
On the other hand, the Patriotic Church controls the real estate, the 
churches, and has approval from the Communist government and numerous 
Catholic bishops in the free world. Often, their seminarians study in 
America, supported by American dioceses. 
<p>
Bishops and priests of the Patriotic Church describe themselves as 
loyal members of the Catholic Church. Or, if they are willing to admit 
to their true status, they'll rationalize that the pope is "making 
overtures" to the Patriotic Church.  
<p>
The Holy Father has a certain brand of patience and tact that he uses 
when dealing with Communists -- a method he learned first-hand during 
his years in Poland. It's not to be confused with approval. 
<p>
In fact, John Paul II made his feelings clear when he made the true 
and loyal bishop of Shanghai -- Ignatius Kung -- a Prince of the 
Church. 
<p>
"With what prayerful longing and love do I follow the life of the 
loyal Chinese Catholic communities," the pope said, when he received 
Cardinal Kung in 1991. 
<p>
True -- the Patriotic bishops say they love the Holy Father, and 
respect him as the Successor of Peter. But, they don't believe that he 
has the authority to appoint bishops or to govern the Catholics in 
China. 
<p>
Cardinal Kung, now 94 and living in Connecticut, spent 30 years in a 
Communist prison. If he had been willing to renounce the authority of 
the pope, he would have been released and rewarded with a high 
position in the Patriotic Church. Others did -- like Bishop Jin of 
Shanghai, Bishop Fu Tieshan of Beijing, and Bishop Zong Huaide, the 
president of the Patriotic Association. But, Cardinal Kung would not. 
<p>
Today, the Communists continue to arrest members of the underground 
Church. Sadly, the state-connected Patriotic Church has yet to 
denounce the persecutions. 
<p>
The ranks of the loyal bishops arrested within the last few weeks 
include the 76-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu -- his second arrest since 
August -- as well as Bishop Han Dingxiang and Bishop Jia Zhiguo. All 
were later released, but the message was clear: don't give us trouble, 
or you'll be arrested again. 
<p>
Several underground priests, including a Jesuit, are currently serving 
prison terms. One was recently released, after being severely 
tortured. 
<p>
And, lay people have been imprisoned for attending an underground 
Mass. This past Easter, dozens were arrested and tortured. 
<p>
For an update on recent arrests, or for information on how to help the 
underground Catholic Church in China, contact the Cardinal Kung 
Foundation, P.O. Box 8086, Ridgeway Center, Stamford CT 06905. 
<p>
 With all its advantages, it would be reasonable to assume that the 
Patriotic Catholic Church has the most followers, wouldn't it? But, it 
doesn't work out that way. 
<p>
There are three million members of the Patriotic Church. Compared that 
to NINE million members of the underground Roman Catholic Church -- an 
increase of 300 percent since the beginning of the persecution in 
1949. 
<p>
Best of all, the true bishops of China continue to proclaim Church 
teachings joyfully, loudly and completely -- even though they know the 
only way to ensure their own safety is to stay silent. 
<p>
Sixty years ago, Catholic school children in America donated "pennies 
for China" to support the missions. 
<p>
Today, we have reaped a priceless reward for that almsgiving: an 
example of courage and faithfulness that could -- if it were more 
widely known -- be an inspiration for others to remain steadfast in 
the ancient Faith.

<title>Old TV Makes A Comeback</title>

<h2>Old TV Makes A Comeback</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
I stopped watching mainstream television shows almost two years ago. I 
finally cracked.  <p>

One of the last straws was an episode of "Seinfeld" -- a well-written 
series that was relatively clean in its first year, but gradually 
ended up in the gutter. <p>

Jerry, after sleeping with his new girlfriend, decides that he doesn't 
like her. So, he asks a buddy how many more dates he has to waste on 
her so he can break up with her "like a gentleman."  
<p>
Has womanhood fallen so low in America? Is respect for females so 
absent, and the standards of gentlemanly conduct so warped? 
<p>
The answer is, "Yes." But, but, must we be continually reminded? 
<p>
I resolved -- after that episode, and others that were even worse -- 
to honor the old-time computer motto: "Garbage in, garbage out." 
<p>
Watching shows that featured members of my generation sinking to the 
bottom of a moral pit -- although being very witty in the process -- 
was bound to effect any viewer, eventually. Makes sense, doesn't it?   
<p>
So, I decided to go cold turkey. 
<p>
Now, I keep the TV tuned to either CNN, C-Span, or Nickelodeon, the 
cable station where Dick and Laura Petrie are still young, Mary Tyler 
Moore is still looking for a husband, and Lucy is still trying to get 
a spot in Ricky's nightclub act. 
<p>
Perhaps Nick at Night, advertised as "safe TV," has put me out of 
touch with popular culture. Recently, I asked a friend, "Did you watch 
Nick last night?" 
<p>
She replied, innocently, "Whose Nick?" 
<p>
And, last month, when I saw a road sign for New Rochelle during a trip 
to New York, I turned to a pal and asked, "Hey, do you know who lives 
there?"  
<p>
She didn't. 
<p>
But, a growing number of Americans could answer that question. TV 
shows that feature a better vision of America are making a comeback, 
as recounted in a recent Washington Times story. 
<p>
The article, titled, "Old television gives disgruntled viewers new 
hope," credits the "Dick Van Dyke" show -- set, of course, in New 
Rochelle, NY -- as being one of the most popular shows on "old TV." 
<p>
According to the article, Warner Brothers, Universal, Columbia and 
Paramount are all trying to start cable networks that will feature 
1960s and 1970s sitcoms. 
<p>
Old television is big. Very big. 
<p>
And, why not? The old shows remind us of a era, not so long ago, when 
Moms were at home when their kids came in the door from school, 
neighborhoods were safe, and marriages tended to last a lifetime. 
<p>
I was a baby when Dick Van Dyke made its original run in the 1960s, so 
I don't remember it first-hand. But, that was the America that I grew 
up in. Not such a bad world, after all. 
<p>
When I was a kid, my Mom used to send us out the door without worrying 
about us -- just like Laura did with Richie. Can you imagine? Even if 
we were a whole block away, there was another Mom nearby, keeping an 
eye on us through her kitchen window.  
<p>
The biggest part of our day was when Dad came home from work -- just 
like on the old sitcoms. We would crowd around him, looking for hugs. 
The dog would bark. It was general pandemonium. 
<p>
Now, the biggest part of the day for many American children is the 
moment when Dad or Mom walks through the door of their daycare center 
to take them home for a few short hours, before returning them the 
next morning. 
<p>
Today's network executives have a strange sense of what "family 
values" means. They claim their new fall lineup is dominated by family 
shows.  
<p>
But, the most normal family they could come up with is portrayed in 
"Bless This House." According to the previews, it portrays a family 
with "rock solid values."  
<p>
Unfortunately, the actor who plays the husband is Andrew Dice Clay -- 
a real-life comedian known for his obscene nightclub acts. 
<p>
In addition, TV executives this year came up with 10 new "family 
shows" with divorced or single parents. Some would call that being 
"realistic." I call it, "accentuating the negative." 
<p>
Also, on the heels of the already-established "NYPD Blue," touted as 
the first R-rated television series, there are at least a half-dozen, 
brand-new "adult" shows bent on breaking new ground. Half feature law 
firms. The rest feature news rooms. 
<p>
TV Guide describes one of them as containing "gratuitous lewdness." 
Remember -- in the eyes of TV Guide, that's not necessary meant to be 
critical.  
<p>
Another contains "risqu scenes." A third is described as "seductive." 
<p>
If the writing is good, and the story lines are interesting, the new 
R-style shows will probably attract even some Americans who try to 
live according to higher principles.  
<p>
And, despite their good intentions, they will slowly, bit by bit, be 
corroded.  
<p>
After all, garbage in, garbage out. 
<p>
Give me that old-time TV, any day of the week. 
<p>

<title>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</title>

<h2>GRAMM: CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are just a year away, and the contestants for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination are already out of the gate and heading for the first turn.  With an unpopular Democratic incumbent likely to be on top of the ticket -- for the first time in sixteen years -- and with a historic victory in last November's midterm congressional elections, Republican challengers are fighting to win a nomination many see as virtually guaranteeing a four-year lease on the White House.<p>
One GOP presidential aspirant has a leg up on the competition -- and maybe an arm, as well.  In the view of many political insiders, in fact, he's been preparing to run for President for at least the last decade, with his sights set on the 1996 GOP nomination.  With a secure Senate seat, a national fund-raising apparatus to go with his prodigious fund-raising skills, and an issue clearly in vogue, he is likely to be one of the finalists for the GOP crown.<p>
He is U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and though he has never before run for national office, he already is seen as a member of the GOP's top tier of presidential contenders.<p>
<b>THE NEW NOMINATING ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Before we can begin a dispassionate analysis of a presidential contender's prospects, we must recognize the changes in the rules regarding the nominating process, and their likely impact on the contest itself.<p>
The formal 1996 nominating season will be shorter than any in recent memory.  Large states like California and New York -- which, between them, control one-third of all the electoral votes needed to capture the White House -- long have held their primary elections relatively late in the election season.  As a result, they had relatively little influence over the party nominees.  Party activists in those two states, tired of having to support candidates largely chosen for them by others in states with earlier primary elections, finally rebelled and decided to move their respective state's primary elections up on the calendar, to give them more influence over the process.  Key midwestern states -- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan -- facing the loss of their own influence as a result of the California and New York moves, are now considering holding their primaries on the same day in mid-March, as sort of a Midwestern regional primary.<p>
The result:  with California moving from early June to late March, and with New York moving from late April to early May, more than seventy percent of the delegates to the 1996 GOP convention will be chosen within a six-week period from mid-February to the end of March.<p>
The impact of the scheduling change on the nominating race could hardly be more dramatic.  No longer will long-shot candidates have the luxury of plotting an insurgent upset in Iowa or New Hampshire, then coasting on free media while raising money over the next several weeks.  In the new environment, money will matter even more than previously; candidates simply won't have time to raise large amounts while in the heat of battle.  Most seasoned analysts expect that a candidate will have to have a minimum of $20-$25 million on hand on January 1, 1996, to have a serious shot at winning.  And the shortened time-frame means that name identification and media skills will increase in value, as well.<p>
This new environment, then, favors candidates with the ability to raise large amounts of money, who know how to present themselves well through the media, and who already have positive name identification.  On two of these three counts, Phil Gramm is well-armed for the competition.<p>
<b>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Money is the mother's milk of politics, now more than ever.  Of the last eight major party nominees for President -- that is, going back to the 1980 campaign -- seven were the candidates in their party who had the most money in the bank on December 31 of the year preceding the nomination contest.  The new primary schedule enhances the need for early money.  Gramm has some of the best fund-raising skills of any of the likely contestants -- including even Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who has already run three national campaigns.  Even before the end of the 1994 election cycle, Gramm was far in front of the pack when measured by funds on hand for a potential run -- he had almost $8 million in the bank, as compared to about $2.5 million for Dole.  None of the other potential GOP candidates had even $1 million on hand.<p>
Too, Gramm knows how to raise money.  In his last Senate campaign, he spent more than $12 million; and since then, he has served four years as chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  From his post at the NRSC, Gramm has had the opportunity to travel the country on behalf of dozens of GOP Senate candidates -- and, in the process, has acquainted himself with literally thousands of high-dollar donors, the kind who write $1,000 checks without a second thought.  It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that every American who has contributed $5,000 or more to the GOP in the last four years probably has an autographed photograph of himself and Gramm hanging on the wall of his den or office.<p>
The second key to winning the GOP nomination will be positive name identification.  This is the chink in Gramm's armor.  As the field begins to shape up for 1996, Gramm runs far behind better-known party leaders like Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, and Dick Cheney.  In early trial polls, Gramm only captures 2-3 percent of the GOP vote against the field, while Dole and Kemp battle it out for first place in the low twenties and high teens.<p>
But name identification can be driven up with paid advertising -- as long as there is adequate money to finance it.  As noted above, Gramm will likely have more money to spend than any other candidate in the field.  Thus, it is the third key to the nomination -- media skills -- that likely will become the determining factor.<p>
Media skills can be broken down into PAID media skills and EARNED media skills.  "Paid" media is just that -- media advertising paid for with campaign dollars; "earned" media is time on the mass media earned by the candidate for making news in some way.<p>
Gramm's earned media skills have, for the most part, been little better than adequate.  His slow Texas twang turns off Northeasterners as much as it soothes Southerners; but his wit and his knack for framing issues serve him well in the studio interview setting.  He has been known to drone on in speeches to large gatherings; he is perhaps best-remembered for his long-winded and boring keynote speech to the 1992 GOP convention in Houston.<p>
But while Gramm may not be well-armed when it comes to basic earned media skills, when the battleground shifts to PAID media skills, there is not a stronger warrior on the field.  Gramm's television commercials are things of beauty, miniature movies -- not surprising, given the attention Gramm pays them, not to mention the money he lavishes on these mini-productions.<p>
In big states like New York and California, the ability to successfully communicate with the electorate through television advertising is THE key to success.  And that means just two things are needed:  a good flight of commercials, and the money to saturate the media.  Gramm will have both.<p>
<b>SOME NEGATIVES</b><p>
It's a good thing Gramm has money going for him, because he's got to overcome several handicaps on his way to the White House.  To begin, no Republican has gone directly from the Senate to the presidency in this century (and only one Democrat, John Kennedy, has made the trip); Senate experience appears not to be as great a plus as experience in a governor's mansion, which, with its executive decision-making prerogatives, is viewed by most voters as a better testing ground for the nation's chief executive.<p>
Moreover, Gramm -- long known to the public at large as a conservative activist -- starts with a relatively small base in his own party, as a result of the kind of internecine warfare among conservatives that threatens to divide their movement and render it politically impotent.<p>
At issue is Gramm's support for the 1990 budget deal -- which included what was then the biggest tax increase in the nation's history -- despite President Bush's promise of no new taxes.  While conservatives on and off Capitol Hill raged about the President's betrayal, Gramm loyally carried water for Bush, and was pilloried by purist conservatives for his apostasy.  The following year he opposed a Social Security payroll tax cut offered by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even opposed another Social Security payroll tax cut -- combined with a capital gains tax cut -- offered by Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Tom DeLay.<p>
These heresies have given cause to some conservatives to think that Gramm -- a former economics professor at Texas A&M -- cares about only the spending side of the budget equation, and that he is unwilling to consider tax cuts as stimulative and necessary.  To most Americans, these arcane debates -- pitting minority factions of a minority party against one another -- remind them of nothing so much as Medieval arguments over how many angels will fit on the head of a pin; but to the conservative activists who have enormous influence over the nominating process of the Republican Party, they are important tests of purity.  If Gramm allows himself to be boxed in to a corner marked "green eye-shade Republican" along with Bob Dole, he will leave the economic optimist label open to others.<p>
But it's not just money and access to money that sets Gramm apart from the rest of the Republican field; it is another trait, deep in his bones.  In the words of one former House colleague of Gramm's, "Phil wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, 'What are the ten things I need to do today to be President?' -- and then he gets seven of them done."  It is a driving ambition deep within Gramm, a determination to do what it takes in order to be President.??<p>

<title>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</h2>
<i> by Bill Pascoe</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Add Bill Bradley to a list that already includes Ross Perot, Colin Powell, and Jesse Jackson, and what do you have?  On the surface, a list of possible Independent candidates for the presidency -- but below the surface, a recipe for the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
For even as the political class muses loudly and publicly about the erosion of two-party politics and the breakdown of civil society -- both because the Establishment finds such talk interesting in an otherwise slow news month, and because it sells newspapers -- it blithely overlooks a fundamental fact gleaned from any in-depth analysis of American political history:  that national elections are about relatively simple choices; that much more often than not, those choices boil down to ONE simple question in the minds of most voters (to wit, Do I want to return the incumbent party for another four years in the White House?); and that, therefore, virtually any Independent candidacy (to the extent it is effective in its goal, which is to win votes) can have but one result -- the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.  In 1996, the exception could be Mr. Jackson.  A Jackson Independent candidacy would likely have two effects, at least one of which would be good for the Democratic Party:  on the down side, a likely split-off of the black vote, with much of it going to Mr. Jackson, thereby making more difficult Mr. Clinton's chances for reelection; but on the good side,  an increased turnout among black voters, which could redound to the party's benefit in salvaging congressional seats that otherwise would be considered at risk.<p>
The jury is still out on whether Mr. Jackson will run or not.  The betting here is that he won't.  But that still leaves Messrs. Bradley, Powell, and Perot.<p>
And if even one of the three were to mount a serious Independent candidacy -- let alone a combination, or even, possibly, all three -- the likely result would be a renewal of Mr. Clinton's lease at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<p>
Ah, the Conventional Wisdom says, of course that's true of potential Independent bids by Mr. Powell or Mr. Perot.  Both of them, according to the CW, would draw more heavily from the GOP presidential candidate.  Nothing new there.  But how would an Independent bid by a known Democrat like Mr. Bradley enhance Mr. Clinton's electoral prospects?  Wouldn't he draw from the  Democratic base vote, and weaken the President?<p>
No.  Mr. Clinton has a firm hold on his party's base vote.  Feminists, liberals, pro-abortionists, welfare recipients, gays, environmentalists, union members, public service employees -- the traditional Democratic coalition -- are still solidly behind the President, who has done as much as he can to deliver for them.  He was elected to office with 43 percent of the vote, and his approval ratings have hovered within a ten point range of that margin throughout his presidency, never dropping much below, even though he never gets too high.<p>
More importantly, any analysis that projects presidential results based on a simple reading of partisan loyalties -- or even ideological loyalties -- misses the point.  When push comes to shove in the polling booth, voters choose not on the basis of party or ideology, but on whether they want to give the incumbent party another four years in power.  Just ask Ken DeCell and Alan Lichtman, whose seminal book THE THIRTEEN KEYS TO THE PRESIDENCY remains the best analysis -- and projection 
model -- for explaining voter behavior in presidential elections.<p>
By their standards, a Perot or Powell candidacy would help Mr. Clinton not because they would split the GOP vote with the Republican candidate, but because they would split the ANTI- INCUMBENT vote with the Republican candidate.  (Interestingly, a close examination of exit polls from 1992 shows that, contrary to much of the Conventional Wisdom, Mr. Perot didn't actually hurt President Bush, he HELPED him, by splitting the anti-incumbent vote then, too; had Mr. Perot not run in 1992, the result would have been NOT a Bush reelection, but a Clinton LANDSLIDE victory.)<p>
Similarly, a Bradley Independent candidacy would provide a second option NOT for those inclined to return to Mr. Clinton to the White House, but to those seeking his removal.  And to the extent he waged a serious campaign and actually won serious votes, he would, necessarily and concomitantly, draw anti-incumbent votes from the anti-incumbent candidate -- e.g., the Republican nominee.<p>
Thus, in the unlikeliest of paradoxes, an Independent bid by a long-time Democrat unsatisfied with his party's presidential leadership would likely have just the opposite of its supposedly intended effect.<p>
Mr. Bradley has been accused of many things in his career, but being stupid isn't one of them.  The day before he announced his potential Independent candidacy, he claims to have called 120 people to tell them of his decision to retire from the Senate, and to discuss future options.  Would someone please send him Mr. DeCell's phone number?<p>

Tobacco is this season's fashionable evil -- like eating steak and potatoes, or going to church. Enlightened people just don't indulge in such morbid things. (Speaking of behavior modification, the real old Dole would challenge President Clinton to scold gays for their addiction to practicing anal sex, the chief conductor of the AIDS virus, which is far deadlier than tobacco smoke.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's enough to make little Richard Cohen bang his rattle against the wall on the op-ed page at The Post: ". . . he went after [Miss] Couric, the Dorothy of our early morning Oz." (Won't someone please send this poor guy a man-size box of Kleenex?)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's evidence, scant but nevertheless just visible, to suggest that Mr. Dole is at last paying occasional attention to his own instincts. Only in Washington can you hear grown-ups question the universally held belief that the media are relentlessly liberal, or suggest that a candidate is out of step for saying what everyone already thinks.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole has been in politics long enough, longer than his armchair skeptics, to understand that neither he nor anyone else will take down Bill Clinton with a campaign designed to please the League of Women Voters. He'll have to fight with the tenacity, energy, guile and shrewdness of Mr. Clinton, who in turn will fight with the artifice, deception and cunning that propelled him from the casino-and-racetrack culture of Hot Springs to the hothouse of Washington and the White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The rap on Mr. Clinton is that he has elevated phoniness to high art. You might not like Bob Dole's indulgence of tobacco smoke, or even his treating a network bimbo with the respect he accords his other media adversaries, but the anger looks authentic. His only hope for November is that authenticity is what America is yearning for. America, not America's media, is the authentic constituency.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

morning</FONT></center><BR><DD>Suppose you're Bob Dole and you wake up on a Monday morning in
August, pick up The Washington Post (the quickest way to ruin your day), and there on the front
page is more bad news:<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has just been indicted for mopery, Hillary is a
fugitive from justice last seen in Nepal, and Janet Reno has appointed a special prosecutor to
press charges that Socks the Cat has been hunting mice out of season.<BR><DD>But a new poll,
commissioned just in time for the Republican National Convention in San Diego, shows the
president 31 points up on you, and you're only 6 points ahead of Ross Perot.<BR><DD>Ordinarily,
this would curdle the cream in your coffee, but the cream had turned sour weeks earlier. You
decide to drink your coffee black, to match your mood. You sit there, staring at the trees on
Roosevelt Island across the Potomac (which looks particularly bleak), and your mind begins to
examine the possibilities:<BR><DD><I>Hmmmmmmmmm. George McGovern is a nice guy, a good friend,
but do I really want to be remembered as the man who made the Nixon-McGovern blowout look like a
cliff-hanger? And Fritz Mondale -- always liked him. Good man. Wrong on some stuff, not so bad
on other stuff. But do I really want to challenge his mark of winning only a single state? The
numbers from Kansas don't look so hot, either.</I><BR><DD><I>Got to do something. Maybe make
another speech. Start wearing a tie again. Put new pennies in my loafers. Take Katie Couric out
to lunch. Get a new bathing suit. Buy some jokes. Whatever. Nah, it wouldn't last. Been there,
done that. Maybe call Colin Powell one more time. Nah, been there, too. Besides, he's like all
the other generals, waiting for somebody to appoint him president. Got enough of generals in
Italy.</I><BR><DD><I>What if ... Nah, too bold. Better to lose it all in November. Except . . .
Nah, better wait 'til Liddy leaves the room even to think these thoughts. Ah, there she goes ...
What if . . . I call a press conference and announce that I'm stepping aside. Had some chest
pains, back pains. Pains in the neck. Whatever. Gonna throw the convention open. No endorsement.
Not from me. The ultimate act of loyalty and generosity from the ultimate party man. Who else
would be remembered as being so unselfish? Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of the party. Only I actually will. Let the right-to-lifers and the abortionists slug it out.
See how far Pat Buchanan gets in an open convention. Let's see who's got the uh, nerve, to get
in now. Jack Kemp won't. He's afraid he might run third. Or fourth. Never called fourth-and-one
in his life. I won't play any favorites, but I might get somebody to nominate Colin. We'll see
how the general who couldn't get to Baghdad fares with all those ex-privates and ex-corporals
out there in the convention hall. Whatever.</I><BR><DD>Well, of course it won't happen. Nobody
with a politician's ego would forego the moment of watching himself being nominated for
president of the United States, standing up there waving to a standing ovation big enough to
fill a stadium and loud enough to make a man's mother believe some of them actually mean it. But
it is a thought, and if such wistful musings ever occur to Bob Dole it doesn't take a Hollywood
scriptwriter to imagine what would happen.<BR><DD>The country would be electrified, and here,
finally, is the place to use that cliche. Direct current at 240 volts. The reporters and
commentators would go bonkers, finally getting to cover a nominating convention like they had in
those old black-and-white newsreels. The good, gray Republican Party, where a simple
disagreement over where to go for dinner is considered gauche, finally giving lessons to the
Democrats, who can start a floor fight over a resolution commending Mother Teresa for giving
milk to starving babies, about how to conduct a free-for-all.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama
is proud to cast its votes on the 29th ballot for . . . </I><BR><DD>ABC would pull its camera
crews from Bosnia, CBS would call back reporters from Tel Aviv, CNN would forsake its stakeout
of O.J. The newspapers would double their staffs in San Diego, with finally something to
actually write home about. <BR><DD>The delegates in San Diego would forget all about the beach,
the side trips to Tijuana, the cocktail parties aboard the yachts tied up in the
harbor.<BR><DD>Best of all, the race would be transformed overnight.<BR><DD>By waiting until
August to bequeath his great gift to the party, Bob Dole would guarantee an open convention.
Nobody would have time to raise the money to ruin it in the way that the primaries have ruined
the process, and at last the Republicans could tell little Virginia that yes, Virginia, there
really is a Republican National Convention, and this is how it's supposed to
be.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama is proud to stand fast on the 44th ballot for . .

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>Let's blame the dead for the scary stuff</FONT></center><BR><DD>These guys at the White House are fast learners.<BR>
  George Stephanopoulos sees how Mortuary Bob Woodward gets by with talking to men lying in comas and crediting the most unlikely assertions in his books to sources conveniently dead, so George does it, too.<BR><DD>It wasn't Hillary who hired Craig Livingstone to vacuum raw FBI files to put together dossiers on their Republican enemies, says the president's senior adviser. "It was Vince Foster."<BR><DD>Dead men not only tell no tales, they don't dispute tales, either.<BR><DD>This emboldens Hillary. She was in Romania and Eastern Europe for the Fourth of July holiday (where she didn't have to put up with a lot of tacky flag-waving by men in military uniform parading down the avenue), but she supports Mr. Stephanopoulos in his blaming of Vince Foster, who, though still dead, has his uses yet.<BR><DD>Said she, repeating the White House mantra the nation has heard over and over in Clintonoid answers, some under oath and some not, to all questions about Whitewater: "I don't know anything about it."<BR><DD>She has no idea who hired the hapless Mr. Livingstone: "I know I didn't."<BR><DD>She doesn't like Gary Aldrich's new book, either. "It is a politically inspired fabrication, and I don't think anyone should take it seriously."<BR><DD>But the White House is taking it seriously indeed, mounting a full-scale offensive we hadn't seen since, well, since Bill and Hillary attacked Gennifer Flowers' claims that she had been Mr. Clinton's main squeeze for years and years in Little Rock, when Miss Flowers produced a tape recording of beddy-bye conversation that included Mr. Clinton's suggestion that Mario Cuomo was a Mafia asset. (Mr. Clinton denied saying it, of course, but apologized the next day to Mr. Cuomo for saying what he never said. Of course, it never happened, but he would never do it again.)<BR><DD>Americans soon learned what Arkansans had learned before them, to their considerable sorrow, never to take the first denial as the last word from either Clinton.<BR><DD>Mr. Stephanopoulos, citing widespread coverage of the Aldrich book by newspapers and lecturing David Brinkley on the ethics of journalism, complains that Washington newspapermen and journalists seem willing to believe anything malicious, salacious or promiscuous about his bosses. Journalists, in his view, don't enforce a high-enough credibility threshold.<BR><DD>What he means is that when someone tells the story that the prez sneaks off in the middle of the night to visit a bimbo -- no doubt to discuss Bosnia policy -- almost everyone is likely to believe it. True or not, the most risible rumor has the ring of truth. Sad that may be, but whose fault is that? Nothing but hoots of disbelief would have greeted a story like that about Jimmy Carter. The trouble Mr. Clinton and his men have on occasions like this is that he, like Jimmy Carter, has a track record.<BR><DD>We've all come to recognize the track record. First the denial -- in the case of the Aldrich book, not exactly a categorical denial -- and then the White House smear attacking "the Republican smear." Finally, days or weeks later, the facts dribble out, confirming the original story.<BR><DD>We're near the end of the first stage of this controversy, with Mr. Stephanopoulos attacking not Gary Aldrich, but Bob Dole, of all people, demanding that he disavow the book that has so panicked the White House, but that Mr. Dole has had nothing to do with.<BR><DD>The White House is not really concerned about the reputations of either Clinton. It's too late for that. But if the allegations in the Aldrich book -- like the allegations in the Meredith Oakley book, the Roger Morris book, the James Stewart book, the Bob Tyrrell book to come, take a number -- begin to stick, it's curtains for the Clintons. At some point the wonderfully/woefully tolerant American public will decide that we've had enough of Flem Snopes' grandson and his unblushing parvenue bride.<BR><DD>The White House knows how to read polls, and knows what not to attribute to them. <BR><DD>The Wall Street Journal reported only last week how some Democratic congressional candidates, even in liberal districts, are putting a little distance between themselves and the president.<BR><DD>Says John Tierney, a Democratic candidate in Massachusetts: "I'm campaigning on my own strengths." Says Steve Eastaugh, a Democratic challenger in Maryland: "A person's not worth spit if he doesn't defend his team captain. But I don't defend Clinton." Even the Democratic candidate to succeed Patsy Schroeder in Colorado says, with emphasis, that she's "not a Clinton Democrat."<BR><DD>"They're being prudent," says Charles Cook, a political analyst. "They don't know what's coming next." Too bad for George, but who does?<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>It's 1996, and we're all from Arkansas</FONT></center><BR><DD>What a country. (If the polls are correct.) Most Americans think the president is probably a crook, more than half of them think his wife is the family bag man and a shrew besides, and 62 percent have concluded that the administration they preside over uses the power of the government to intimidate and blackmail private citizens.<BR><DD>And they want four more years of it.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton leads Bob Dole by 17 points, or 20, or 22, or 6. Whatever. Take the poll of your choice. Talk about the Stockholm Syndrome.<BR><DD>This is good news for people who sell newspapers, because the Scandal/Outrage/Screw-up of the Day sells newspapers. It's a shame for the country, but the bigger shame appears to be that the country doesn't any longer give a damn who a president is or what he does. Hot Springs is at last writ large.<BR><DD>A poll taken for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News and released late last week, not only shows Mr. Clinton up by a ton, but 44 percent are down on Hillary, 62 percent think she's lying about past deeds of graft and greed, 35 percent say they believe the president helped himself to public money to cover his Whitewater investment, and 68 percent say they believe the Clinton White House is using the FBI, illegally, to bullyrag opponents.<BR><DD>New revelations litter the landscape, if not yet the public consciousness. The books pour out a profusion of perversion, greed, incompetence and criminal bumbling. The Clinton crowd is exposed as a collision of clowns or crooks, and probably both. It's not the comedy, stupid, it's the stupidity.<BR><DD>We've become such a nation of soap-opera addicts, having mainlined Oprah and Phil Donahue and their cretinous compatriots for so long that we no longer aspire to be "the good nation" that Alexis de Tocqueville found here almost 200 years ago, when he observed that America was great because it was good and predicted that America would cease to be great when it ceased to be good.<BR><DD>We live in the New Age now, and happy is as happy does. A new book out this week, "Unlimited Access," by Gary Aldrich, an FBI agent assigned to the White House, details how the president assuages his melancholy memories of Gennifer, Sally, Paula, Kay and the other ladies of the wee hours he left behind in Little Rock. Mr. Aldrich describes how the prez leaps into the back seat of Bruce Lindsey's car, pulls a blanket over his head and doesn't come out until they're safely in a tunnel beneath the JW Marriott Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. He takes an elevator to a suite upstairs, where the late evening's yum-yum awaits. This would be the hour for the bad guys to unleash missiles, since nobody knows where he is for hours and hours. Hillary is safe in the arms of the Sandman.<BR><DD>This beats the arrangements in Little Rock, where he was reduced to using the front seat of a car on the deserted grounds of his daughter's school or the back seat of his limo on a side street at the foot of Main. But let's be fair. Bill Clinton is not the first president to slip around with the satin smoothness of the son of a preacher man. Warren Harding made a love nest of a closet off the Oval Office. Grover Cleveland made out like Bill Clinton before he got to Washington, leaving a love child in his wake, and JFK partook often of the consolations of forbidden feminine charms and, in a fit of populist bonhomie, even shared his treats with a Mafia don.<BR><DD>FDR had a squeeze, too, but his was a vice that paid the homage of hypocrisy to virtue, and nobody knew for sure for years afterward. This was in part due to diligence and careful competence, and in part the work of media that protect Democrats to conserve energies to ravage Republicans. Bob Packwood was hounded from office for kissing women in elevators, but when Bill Clinton was caught at dropping his drawers and demanding curb service it was his accuser who was held up to public ridicule. "I'm not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life," said Johnny Apple of the New York Times in a widely quoted (and widely copied) dismissal of the larger part of Bill Clinton's life and career.<BR><DD>Some people say that this merely reflects selective distaste, but Mr. Apple is not the only man in town who finds sex a vice unfit for the consideration of gentlemen. But polls indicate that a mean average of 61.3 percent of the rest have concluded that vice is nice at twice the price, and Bill Clinton is our man.<BR><DD>Robbing banks in Arkansas is old stuff, and doesn't count. Covering it up in Washington is what anybody would have done. Using the FBI to compile dossiers on "enemies" is sort of shoddy, but Republicans deserve it. Billy Dale might have been Everyman, but thinking about it can make a man's teeth itch.<BR><DD>Too bad for Bob Dole, but that's the way the cookie -- whoever she may be -- crumbles. We're all from Arkansas now.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

the summer of '73</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton is not a crook. We have Chris Dodd's word on it.<BR>
  And the word of Paul Sarbanes, Mary McGrory, Richard Cohen, Jim Hoagland, Tom Lantos and maybe Norman Ornstein. And Mark Fabiani's and Mike McCurry's.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Democratic defensive line -- the politicians, academics and journalists who work hard to make our lives happy and productive, if only we would listen to them -- assures us that despite all the evidence that the ganglion of criminal scandal called Whitewater may look like a duck, walk like a duck and even quack like a duck, it's really a turkey.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing upsets these refined worthies more than for someone to remark on the obvious, that the Clinton White House smells like the Nixon White House, that the flavor of the Clintonoid excuses, rationalizations and tortured justifications is remarkably similar to the taste of stale Nixonian leftovers, and that Pennsylvania Avenue reeks of the aroma that old-timers remember from the summer of '73.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"On my scorecard," writes Jim Hoagland in The Washington Post, "the president has endured a couple of bad but far from fatal weeks as the Senate Whitewater committee rolled out its final, conflicting reports, old associates in Arkansas were convicted in crooked land deals and House hearings revealed the White House's improper possession of more than 400 FBI investigative files. All that hurts, but there was no smoking gun: The Clintons were not personally and conclusively linked to major scandal."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Say what? Mr. Hoagland, a genial fellow who has heretofore successfully disguised himself as a wise-policy wonk and good-government groupie, thus reduces the Clinton White House "enemies list," to which he insists the Clintons are not "conclusively linked" even though it happened in their house, from outrage to merely a matter of "impropriety." We didn't hear this kind of excuse for Chuck Colson, who went to prison for the possession of a single FBI file.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mary McGrory, still waiting for JFK to float out of his grave at Arlington to rescue Camelot, mocks the Republicans on the Whitewater committee as witch-hunters: "They put a pointed hat on Hillary Clinton ... and they all but called her ... the wicked witch of the White House. But that doesn't make it Watergate. She isn't the president." Evita Peron wasn't the president of Argentina, either, but she did a good imitation of the maximum leader. (Don't cry for me, Arkansas.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Tom Lantos, the congressman from California, turned livid the other day when someone on Bill Clinger's committee, investigating Hillary's beheading of Billy Dale, remarked on the perfectly obvious, that the Clintons, who matured, sort of, in the Watergate years, learned nothing from that experience, except how to do it better.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Paul Sarbanes, who hectored the Nixon men without mercy for crimes less outrageous than those for which the Clinton men -- and women -- have implicated themselves and each other, finds the Clintons guiltless of doing anything wrong in Washington and even perfectly innocent of anything shady in Arkansas. (Ain't nobody here but us chickens.) Richard Cohen, the conscience of The Washington Post, assures us that he took time out from his bizarre feud with blacks to personally investigate the FBI files scandal and found nothing to worry about. (So there.) The good gray Norman Ornstein, also writing in The Post, says what went wrong at the White House was a bureaucratic snafu after all: The Clintons cut the size of the White House staff, and shouldn't have, because what they (and we) actually need in Washington are more bureaucrats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For their part, the Clintons keep sending poor Mark Fabiani out to tell the reporters artless fibs, stretchers, fables, myths and yarns every time another scandal rocks the house. The president has put him in the position of the man who, caught by his wife between the sheets with her best friend, tells his wife: "I guess you'll try to make something out of this."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Fabiani will be on call over the next few weeks as the second Whitewater trial proceeds in Little Rock, where two bankers are on trial for robbing their bank in behalf of Bill Clinton when he needed the last few sacks of cash to sew up his gubernatorial election in 1990.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's fingerprints, so far as we know, were not on the deal. David Hale, his earlier banker angel, says Mr. Clinton was always insistent that his hands never touch the deals he designed.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton, up 20 points in the polls and looking at disgrace and ruin, is his daddy's salesman son, still trying to sell the notion that nobody but David Hale, a convicted felon, has accused him of anything illegal. But one by one the president's men are becoming convicted felons.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sort of reminds people with long memories of Richard Nixon.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

with not very much</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole poses an interesting question for America in 1996: Can a man with no strength of his convictions beat a man with the strength of no convictions?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole seems determined to campaign on a platform that can be boiled down to a forgettable bumper sticker: "Vote Republican: We're Not as Bad as You Think We Are."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton's message, no less succinct, is the mirror image of the Republican slogan: "Vote Democratic: You're Right, We Bad -- And You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This sets up an interesting Hobson's choice, with each alternative worse than the other, and the answer may tell us not only who the president will be, but a lot about who we are as a people. Bill Clinton and his campaign-year alter ego, Dickie Morris, understand that almost everybody mistrusts Mr. Clinton, many regarding him as a liar like his wife and a fraud like no other, but an amiable fraud nonetheless and a likable liar besides. Not only that, he's famous. Mr. Clinton and his guru believe that since America now keeps pace with fiction, liars rule.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is a man of character and principle, even if he gives the impression that he doesn't understand what that means, exactly. In any event, he gives the impression that he's not really serious about wanting to be president. He seems to think the presidency is something like being a senator, only bigger, if not necessarily better. He believes in things, but not too much, which is good, but he's not as famous as Bill Clinton, which is not so good.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The poor guy has been so long in the Senate, where cutting deals is the mark of leadership, that when he closes a sale now, he can't shut up. He had the abortion question squared and boxed, safely on the shelf, with all the Christian "extremists" willing to put their suspicions aside, and then somebody or something persuaded him that Colin Powell and John Warner and Christie Whitman and the pro-choice wing of the party deserved a little lagniappe. Having flaunted his tolerance in the face of the conservatives, he shoved it down their throats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He expects to bask in the applause of the liberals and Democrats whose approval such Republicans not-so-secretly covet. We'll see how long he has to wait for that. Within minutes after his tribute to the successes of 1970s liberalism in his farewell address to the Senate, all but ignoring the legacy of Ronald Reagan in his rush to shower accolades on the Democrats who thwarted the Gipper's revolution, the Democratic National Committee in return faxed a bulletin to political writers listing 10 bad things Mr. Dole had done as a senator. (Note to Colin Powell: They're ready for you.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Given the givens, selling himself as the lesser evil is not necessarily a hopeless strategy. Despite the piously naive cliches of the political-science professors, the pundits and the good-government groupies, most people vote against, not for. Bill Clinton has disillusioned a lot of his 43 percent of '92, but if he has persuaded many in the 57 percent who voted against him in '92 that he's better than they thought he was, it's difficult to find them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No one understands this better than Mr. Clinton and Dickie Morris. That's why Mr. Clinton is running this year as a conservative Republican. He'll steal every issue Bob Dole lets him steal, understanding that he can't fool all the people all the time, but with a little Clinton luck maybe he can fool enough.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What terrifies the president and the man behind the curtain is the sure and certain knowledge that, despite everything the media elites can do to persuade everyone otherwise, Americans are growing more, not less, conservative. A poll taken last month for USA Today demonstrates that 83 percent of Americans favor a balanced budget, 83 percent want to prohibit racial preferences (i.e., scrap affirmative action), 82 percent want to make English the official language, 80 percent want life sentences imposed on drug dealers, 74 percent want term limits, 73 percent want prayer in the schools, 73 percent oppose legalization of marijuana, 71 percent want to cut off welfare to deadbeats, 71 percent want to reduce the number of government agencies, 67 percent oppose same-sex "marriage," and 57 percent oppose partial-birth abortions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Exact or not, such percentages tell Mr. Clinton -- and almost any other politician who can stay awake through the second cup of coffee -- who the real extremists are, and that there's no percentage in diluting a conservative message.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That's why he intends to run to the right of Bob Dole if the Republican nominee lets him. Mr. Dole and his compassioneers, full of moderation and meekness, may persuade a few people that he's not as bad as they think he is, but he'll never get anyone to throw his hat in the air with a message like that. An army marches on its stomach, and you can't win a war on milk and toast.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>The limited hangout at the White House</FONT></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing makes Bill Clinton and Miss Hillary and their friends jump quite like barking the words "Nixon" and "Watergate" at them, in the manner of thrusting a cross in the face of Count Dracula.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Like the count, they quail.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>You can almost see the beads of perspiration breaking out in the hollow of Miss Hillary's pretty throat, and the president reddens like a schoolboy caught with a hot book hidden between the covers of his geography text.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's no sign yet of the ghost of Richard Nixon, but he can't be pleased by the comparison, either. Fortunately, it's difficult to libel the dead.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first lady, who worked as a staff lawyer for the congressional committees working to bring down Mr. Nixon an eon ago, is a quick study and she learned a lot. Her mistake, as it may turn out, is that she thought she could make the Nixon strategy work in her husband's White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Nixon's men came up with what they called "the modified limited hangout," the paying out of as few of the sordid details of the Watergate scandal as possible in hopes that the press would go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's men are similarly paying out the sordid details of the Whitewater collection of scandals -- any one of which might be worse than the third-rate burglary of the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Office Building on Virginia Avenue NW -- in the hopes that the press, with an attention span shorter than you could find in any kindergarten class, will get bored and go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modified limited hangout is not working any better for the Clintons than it did for Mr. Nixon, for whom ultimately it did not work at all. Pity the poor spokesmen at the White House. Not only are they asked to tell fibs, distortions and stretchers to the reporters, some of whom are finally getting it, but the fibs, distortions and stretchers change every hour on the hour.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last week, Mr. Clinton's hapless excuses men came up with the third and fourth explanations of why the president's lawyer (and we can assume that a smart Yale lawyer like Bill Clinton knew about it all the time) tried to get the confidential FBI files on Billy Dale, covering 30 years of his life, seven months after the first lady ordered him fired as director of the White House travel office.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. William Clinger of Pennsylvania suggests that Bernard Nussbaum, who was the president's lawyer, sought the FBI documents because even then the White House was concocting a smear job on Mr. Dale. Naturally, Mr. Nussbaum couldn't remember sending the request to the FBI. Nobody in this White House ever remembers anything. This is the first White House in history to make Alzheimer's disease, with its consequent loss of memory, a helpful qualification for employment.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Then someone at the White House had another bright idea. Maybe someone could say that Mr. Dale was being considered for another White House position, and they needed the background checks to make sure they knew who he was. He had only worked for the U.S. government for three decades. This was an excuse first tried at the Nixon White House when, in a celebrated fiasco, it got caught putting together a dossier on a prominent Washington reporter and then insisted that he was being considered for an important job in the administration.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But wait! The FBI dossier was not asked for by Bernie Nussbaum, who as everybody knows would never pull a dirty trick, but by the General Accounting Office. Drat! Then the GAO said no, it had never asked for nor looked at FBI files on Mr. Dale.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Back to the drawing board once more: The White House said it asked the FBI for the files by "accident" when it routinely sought background reports on all White House employees. Bernie, George, Bruce, Patsy, Harold, Maggie, maybe even Hillary. Not just Billy and the boys, but everyone in the Goodtime Gang.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was too much for Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI. He certainly doesn't want to do a Patrick Gray imitation, and be left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind. He ordered a full investigation of the White House request for the FBI dossier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"He certainly doesn't want the bureau mixed up in this stuff," says an official at FBI headquarters. "He has moved to make sure that the public's perception is that there's not some cozy relationship between the White House and bureau executives."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This is surely a puzzlement to the president, accustomed to using the State Police for all manner of conveniences when he was the governor of Arkansas. Puzzling to the first lady as well, who thought she had learned from the errors of the Nixon White House and imagined that the failure was not in conception, but in execution.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

Learning lessons,<BR>all of them wrong
</FONT></center>

<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>When Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the president of the
Confederacy on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery, he and the occasion were
acclaimed as the time and place where "the man and the hour have met."<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We may be on the scene of
another occasion when the planets align themselves with reckless abandon and
God throws down the stars in a fit of divine disgust. Bill Clinton, the man, and
the nation, in an hour of disarray, have met.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Disaster followed Davis, and disaster is no doubt
stalking us, too. Billy Graham said it best the other day when he came to
Washington to receive the Medal of Freedom: "... the greatest nation in history
stands on the brink of self-destruction."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The signs of unraveling are certainly all about. The chief of
the Navy, having presided over the emasculation of the greatest sea service in
the history of man (presuming Atlantis had nothing better), shoots himself in the
chest, which almost anyone's elderly aunts, armed with their modest knowledge
of firearms, could have told him was not the way to do it. He was afraid someone
might think he was wearing his medals crooked.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was the most dramatic Washington suicide
since James Forrestal, the secretary of defense, leaped from a window at the top
of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1947, pursued by the vicious demons and fierce
worms known only to himself, haunted by fears of the red menace when it was
not fashionable to be so haunted. It's already the second major suicide of the
Clinton administration, and as the going gets tougher, the curveballs breaking
ever more sharply across the plate, all the president's men must stand resolute
against despair.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>Like Vince Foster, Mike Boorda was by all accounts a man of splendid
character and moral stature, but, like Mr. Foster, he was over his head in the pool
of ego and ambition that the capital is and has been since the days when someone
was forever trying to set fire to George Washington's wooden teeth.<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What other explanation can
there be for the suicide of a warrior who is expected to dispatch 19-year-old
boys -- and pregnant 19-year-old girls, to make the most shameful point -- to
court a briny death on the stormy sea but who so quails at the prospect of talking
to a reporter that he takes the weak man's out?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's difficult to imagine that an old salt as
experienced as Mike Boorda would have killed himself over the misuse of his
medals, as dear as such decorations are to the men who understand the sacrifice
required to win them. It's not so difficult to understand why Washington, with its
unerring instinct for getting it wrong, took a crash course last week in how many
pins can dance on a campaign ribbon.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Boorda, though skillful enough at playing the
bureaucratic game to make it to the top of the sea service, might have understood
that at the end he had let down his beloved Navy by betraying it into the hands of
snotty Clintonoids who think that no opportunity must be missed to emasculate
the military the commander in chief has said he "loathes."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The admiral conceded months before his
death that he reckoned that he had let down the Navy by caving in to the
pressures brought by the neurotic feminists inside and outside the Congress, and
the frightened senators (some of them Republicans) leaping to chairs, pulling up
their pants' legs to cry "eeeek!" when Pat Schroeder walks into the room, who
demanded the head of Adm. Stanley Arthur when he was nominated to be the
commander of the Pacific Command.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Arthur, a 500-mission hero of the Vietnam War
(enough already to condemn him to scorn and ridicule), was accused of reaching
an incorrect judgment when a female pilot filed a sexual-harassment claim
against her flight instructors. Upon investigation, Adm. Arthur ruled the claim
without substantial merit. The poor woman should count her lack of blessings;
she might have been assigned to the USS Acadia, "the Love Boat," which returned
from the Persian Gulf War with 10 percent of her crew in a family way, more in
need of diapers and bassinets than armor and bullets.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The promotion was held up by a single
senator, the self-righteously strange David Durenberger of Minnesota. "I should
have fought this to the end," Adm. Boorda conceded to the Navy Times. "I helped
screw it up, and I don't feel good about it."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That made everything A-OK, of course. "Feeling
good" is what life in Bill Clinton's America is all about. But not to everyone. Jim
Webb, another authentic hero of Vietnam who was Ronald Reagan's secretary of
the Navy, demanded of the weak John Dalton, the Clintonoid secretary of the Navy,
and of Mike Boorda: "Where was the outrage?"<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But outrage is not appropriate in a Navy fit for a
lady, and a ladies' Navy is what we've got.

No cheap sentiment<BR>for his generation
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Gentlemen (and ladies): Start your spinning.

<BR><DD> This is the Bob Dole nobody expected to see, lean and tough and poignant without the cheap sentiment, and from the White House to the newsrooms of the elites (and some who only dream of being among the elites), the favorite adjective was &quot;desperate.&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;The irony of Dole's decision ... is that one of the pivots of Dole's campaign was in fact an admission of his defeat&quot; (from the Boston Globe). The announcement &quot;is a drastic bid to unyoke himself from an unpopular Republican Congress ...&quot; (from the San Jose Mercury News). &quot;A bold maneuver, full of potential perils - not the least the possibility that an electorate weary of tactics and stratagems would see his resignation from the Senate as just another gimmick ...&quot; (from the New York Times).

<BR><DD>Some of the punditry was born of the amnesia that strikes nearly everyone who has lived in Washington long enough to get a telephone. Says Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster: &quot;Dole will live to rue the day. ... It's too tactical. You're denying your career. It's like going back to Russell and announcing you're moving to New York.&quot;

<BR><DD>Kevin Phillips, the Democrats' favorite Republican analyst, agreed: &quot;I don't think this puts a whole lot of electricity in his socket. He can go out and give speeches, but the speeches he gave before were no good.&quot; Concurred Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, echoing the favorite spinsters' word of the day: &quot;It sounds like a strategy that's a good deal more desperate than the situation demands now.&quot;

<BR><DD>There's no doubting that Mr. Dole was in tough shape - dire straits, a panic, up a creek without the paddle, almost any of the cliches the pundits rush to employ. But the speech, one of the most memorable campaign speeches since Ronald Reagan's famous speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, does not strike the ears of Middle America as a gimmick, a stratagem or even a tactic. (Most people forgive politicians their tactics, even when they shoot trespassers.)

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole sounded at last like a man who knew what he was doing, who was saying what he thinks because he was speaking from the heart. His careful, precise allusion to his heroic service in World War II struck just the right grace note. There is life after all beyond a company job in the ultimate company town: &quot;I will be the same man I was when I walked into the room, the same man I was yesterday and the day before, and a long time ago when I arose from my hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world. And I trust in the hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way, which is good because we have a hard task ahead of us.&quot;

<BR><DD>He does, indeed. But when he speaks his mind from his heart, it rings as true as the sound of distant battle. Speaking this way now, after so many months of avoiding all sentiment because he was afraid it would sound like cheap sentiment, makes it all the more believable. If hardly anyone can imagine authentic sincerity from Bill Clinton, who will say everything about anything to anybody, hardly anyone doubts that the tears and the choked sobs were real. Nobody, said Steve Forbes after watching the remarkable ceremony on television, can pucker a lip like Bill Clinton, and only the most foolish of fools would try.

<BR><DD>The most heartfelt part of the Dole farewell was the hardest for Washington to credit: &quot;My campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is right, it's about electing a president who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but rather its difficulties.&quot;

<BR><DD>Lincoln's famous observation about not being able to fool all the people all the time will get its test this year. Bill Clinton has a lot of things going for him - youth, vigor, the gift of gab unencumbered by steadfast principle or heartfelt conviction - and the greatest of all is his confident reliance on the cheerful willingness of the public to cut a little slack to a roguish shill.

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole is embarked on a mission to see how many adults are left in America. He has said that he thinks a man of his generation, arguably the bravest and most dependable since the nation sent two mighty armies to battle against each other and there was enough left over to tame a frontier and build a constellation of gleaming cities, has enough left over this time for one final mission.

<BR><DD>Like Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador who burned his boats on the beaches of Mexico 400 years ago to impress upon his crewmen that they were in the New World to stand or die, the Republican candidate for president is gambling that America has had enough of the children's hour.

Somewhere there's a<BR>hero from Kansas
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Now that someone from Kansas has to stand up to the wizard behind the curtain, where's Dorothy?

<BR><DD>The wizard, without even popping a sweat, has sent the Republicans into a tailspin a lot like the crash of George Bush in 1992, when his eye-popping poll numbers fell from 92 percent in the wake of the war in the Gulf to 38 percent in the ruins of November.

<BR><DD>One loud &quot;boo!&quot; from the nation's most famous draft dodger and the entire regiment of Republicans, who only yesterday imagined they should be posing for recruiting posters, went flying for cover, crawling up under the nearest front porch to hide with the dogs. Bill Clinton, who's never met a woman he didn't run after or a man he didn't run from, was the most astonished pol in town.

<BR><DD>When the president found someone to throw the first punch at Newt Gingrich, he never imagined that nobody would strike back. When he found someone to throw the second punch, he never imagined that the Republicans themselves would join in piling on.

<BR><DD>The campaign to demonize the speaker was simple and brutish: Throw out lies and distortions and scream even louder when the Republicans fire back. The lies got louder, but the Republicans never fired back.

<BR><DD>The speaker's aims were not radical, unless most of us are radical: Cut down the size of government, shrink the budget on which big government feeds, crack down on criminals, throttle welfare cheaters, strengthen the military, roll back the regulatory bureaucracy, cut the throat of the trial-lawyer lobby before everyone but the lawyers are bankrupt, limit the terms of congressmen so they can return home to productive jobs, take the necessary steps to preserve the medical-care safety net - and cut taxes. Some radicalism.

<BR><DD>So radical, in fact, that President Clinton adopted most of these goals himself, beginning with his assertion that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; None of his own troops, liberals all, believe he really means it. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose contempt for the organizer of Vietnam anti-war rallies is obvious, calls him &quot;an unusually good liar,&quot; and in this case the president's big-government allies feel reassured.

<BR><DD>Some of the speaker's erstwhile allies, in the bravura of the morning after the November '94 blowout, likened their mighty victory to the D-Day landings at Normandy. The analogy, for a bunch of guys who mostly spent the Vietnam war at the Student Union, sounded a little far-fetched to some aging ears, but if some of these warriors had been barreling across France in the summer of '44 they would have braked cold on hearing Axis Sally's first diatribe against that ol' meanie Georgie Patton, and looked for a barn to hide in. Second Lt. Al D'Amato would have wanted the Germans to understand that he never really liked that Patton fella, anyway.

<BR><DD>Who can be surprised that the clouds of pink and baby blue floating over the White House are made of gauze and giddiness? Bill Clinton hasn't had a stroke of luck like the Republican collapse since Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer so obscure that even Mrs. Schwarzlose wasn't sure who he was, turned up as his only serious opponent in a Democratic gubernatorial primary back home. (Mr. Clinton won, but not by much.)

<BR><DD>The moral is that the Republicans can make a race of it in '96, too, if they can figure out which end of the gun you shoot with, and how to tell a foot from foe.

<BR><DD>For weeks everyone in Washington was trying to figure out whether Bob Dole was asleep, or merely dead, and now they're trying to figure out whether Al D'Amato is the hit man from Cleveland, dispatched by Mr. Dole, or whether he's just a slap-happy, showing off.

<BR><DD>What the Republicans seem to have lost sight of - and Bill Clinton hasn't - is that the conservative tide is still running, and gaining momentum. The great risk to Republican fortunes is that the voters will conclude that the Grand Old Partypoopers never had the convictions they seemed to have the courage of only a few months ago. Bill Clinton has no convictions, either, but he knows better than anyone else how to fake it.

<BR><DD>Mike McCurry, his press agent, remarked May 6 that the pendulum measuring the Clinton fortunes is groaning against the rope, close to reaching its apogee. Soon everything that has been breaking in the president's favor may begin breaking the other way.

<BR><DD>But maybe not. Iron laws govern politics, but not the iron laws of physics. The Republicans think they've got the character issue cold, and maybe they do, but in a street fight and a presidential campaign raw courage can count for more than character.

<BR><DD>The wizard, trembling behind the curtain, understood that. So did a little girl from Kansas.

The stern rebuke of<BR>a Sunday-school boy
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>To everything a season, to quote the forbidden texts, and that includes even politics. If you wait long enough, the wheel comes 'round.

<BR><DD>Only nine presidential campaigns ago, the elites of media and academe were aghast at the redneck notion, propagated by the lesser fundamentalist tribes, that the pope and his Roman legions would impose the morality of a foreign church on America if Americans were foolish enough to elect John F. Kennedy.

<BR><DD>Voting for the Catholic candidate thus became something close to a civic duty for the enlightened American. The enlightened elites of course never imagined that anyone as smart and as attractive as a Kennedy actually believed any of that religious stuff, just as the enlightened elites never imagined that Martin Luther King and his fellow clergymen in the civil-rights movement were men of actual faith. In 1965, when I asked to interview Dr. King and said that I wanted to talk about faith as well as politics, he invited me to lunch in New York. &quot;I thought no one would ever ask,&quot; he told me, and a promised 30 minutes stretched into the mellow gloaming of late afternoon, long past the ham sandwiches at his desk, and we talked about how faith in Christ must guide every step in a believer's life.

<BR><DD>Ah, but now the enlightened elites are not so sure.

<BR><DD>Just when they thought the streets - or at least the power positions in the culture - were safe for atheists and pagans, witches and wizards and assorted lesser geeks, along comes something barbaric and grotesque like President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. Suddenly the priests and preachers and rabbis think they have something to say that the rest of us ought to hear.

<BR><DD>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a Catholic and a Republican who usually supports secular Democratic positions (and whose efforts at raising well-behaved children have been mixed), was one of the first to tell Pope John Paul II to butt out of the moral argument. &quot;Such direct involvement in politics is not a good idea, because I think it confuses people.&quot;

<BR><DD>This is an odd view, that politicians and not priests should declaim on moral issues, and that when priests want to say something about moral issues they should be careful not to offend the politicians.

<BR><DD>The partial-birth abortion procedure is certainly a moral issue, though the Ministry of Euphemy has already decreed that it must be called &quot;intact dilation and evacuation,&quot; or &quot;late-term abortion,&quot; which is somewhat like calling the District of Columbia &quot;an interesting experiment in local government.&quot; But you may have noticed that the media have already taken the cue.

<BR><DD>This particular abortion, on a whole baby in the act of being born, is so gruesome, so cruel, so like something from the Manual of Procedure at Auschwitz, that the vicars of the Catholic Church, beginning with the vicar of Rome, have suspended their usual reticence at involving themselves in American electoral politics to tell Bill Clinton that he blundered in behalf of the forces of darkness.

<BR><DD>Cardinal John O'Connor of New York departed from his sermon during Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral to rebuke those who, like His Honor the mayor, denounced the pope for sticking his nose in what the mayor insists is only the business of politicians.

<BR><DD>Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, appearing on the David Brinkley program, repeated for television what he had said earlier, that if a public official finds an irresolvable conflict between his conscience - the president has said that he personally finds this abortion procedure repugnant - and public service he should resign.

<BR><DD>&quot;I think that's rather straightforward,&quot; the cardinal said. &quot;It means what it says. I believe that an individual has an obligation to follow his or her own conscience, and I don't think any of us would want to be served by persons who don't do that.&quot;

<BR><DD>Well, of course no one could imagine that he had Bill Clinton in mind as a man conflicted by demands of duty and conscience, but it is curious that a pol as attuned to the political uses of public worship could have made such a miscalculation. Bill Clinton, after all, is the man who, after losing his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, suddenly joined the largest Baptist church in Arkansas, which telecasts its Sunday morning services, and joined the choir on the assurance that he could sing from a position at the preacher's right hand, in full view of the camera at all times.

<BR><DD>Some cynical people have noted that now, since it has become clear that Baptists and other evangelicals aren't likely to do doodly-squat for him in November, he has abandoned his church for Hillary's Methodist congregation, one of the most liberal in town. This is, of course, merely another of those Arkansas coincidences.

<title>Rockwell: Bad Law Bites Back -- 12/3/96</title>

<h2>Bad Law Bites Back  </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
The &quot;Contract with America,&quot; reflexively denounced
by leftliberals, was never as good as its bad reputation. It posed
as big government's tormentor, but on close analysis proved to
be more gimmick than gauntlet. It even included some planks that
increased the power of the central state.
<P>
One item in particular did positive harm. This was the Congressional
Accountability Act, passed in the first days of the last &quot;revolutionary&quot;
Congress. Its point was to apply the government's health and labor
laws to Congress, thereby ending its previous, and presumably
hypocritical, exemption. Hardly anyone stopped to ask: was there
a reason for exempting Congress in the first place? 
<P>
Congress is beginning to find out. If labor laws apply to
Congress, its employees can use the courts to demand quotas, form
unions, threaten strikes, and generally cause trouble. And who
enforces all these laws? Bureaucrats in the executive branch.
That gives the Clinton administrationor whoever happens to be
in chargedirect control of Congressional offices.  
<P>
In the American constitutional tradition, Congress is <I>supposed</I>
to be exempt from any laws enforced by the executive. Remember
the doctrine of the separation of powers that used to be taught
in highschool civics? Congress supervises the executive, not the
reverse. Any other system invites abuse of power, corruption,
and intimidation of the elected officials closest to the people.
<P>
Let's say some lawmaker wants to cut the budget of the Labor
Department, and has a good chance of succeeding. Well, maybe the
Secretary of Labor might get interested in whether this lawmaker
is obeying all the laws on overtime pay or racial nondiscrimination.
Just the accusation would cause harm.  
<P>
To avoid that kind of intimidation, lawmakers might decide
they have better things to do than attack the agencies with new
legal power over them. That takes the heat off the home of big
governmentthe executiveand puts it on the Congress, the branch
charged with overseeing the spending of our tax dollars. 
<P>
The proponents of the Accountability Act argued that if Congress
is going to impose lawslike racial quotas or the minimum wageon
the private sector, the least it can do is obey these laws themselves.

<P>
For starters, not all legislators vote for every law. Why
should a majority of lawmakers be able to impose laws, enforced
by the president, on a minority of lawmakers? Even if a law passes
unanimously in one Congress, why should a future Congress be bound
by it? Congressmen should have sovereign immunity from all these
laws, even when they are passed by the Congress itself. 
<P>
A case now before Congress illustrates the point. Members
of the U.S. Capitol Police, a Congressional institution, want
to form a union, an action made possible only by the police applying
the executivedepartment labor code to themselves. In response,
the Republicans have done the right thing: sued to prevent it
from happening.
<P>
As the Republicans arguethough not for the recordunionization
introduces all sorts of complications. Unionized cops can, for
example, engage in work slowdowns and expel conservative, antiunion
police. Moreover, unions are heavily political organizations,
backing Democrats in all national elections.
<P>
If this suit succeedsand it probably will notit would gut
the Congressional Accountability Act, which would be great. But
by attempting to prevent unionization, the 105th Congress puts
itself in the ironic position of trying to repeal one of the most
heralded, if wrongheaded, achievements of the 104th.
<P>
When imposed against private companies, U.S. health, safety,
and labor laws cost hundreds of billions in lost productivity
every year. They are a major source of the secular decline in
American business vibrancy. Why did Congress, which should be
trying to repeal these laws, instead expand them?
<P>
When confronted with this point, some people argue that the
real purpose is to make Congressmen &quot;feel&quot; the laws
they have imposed on the American people and thereby encourage
them to work towards cutting red tape. But this too is a flight
of fancy. The authors of the Contract believe in these laws for
the private sector, and meanwhile, good lawmakers face witch-hunts
by the regime they are supposed to be battling. 
<P>
 Congress is right in suing to stop a police union. But it
should also admit it made a mistake in imposing this law on itself,
repeal the darn thing, and then repeal the oppressive regulations
that make life a living heck for American business.
<P>

<title>December 2, 1996--Murder by Air Bag</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<I>December 2, 1996</I><p>
<h2>Murder by Air Bag</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR>
Can we trust government to regulate business? For an answer, take
a look at the great airbag fiasco. Five years ago, the government
mandated that air bags be installed in cars. In an instance of
death by government, these bags kill people involved in fender
benders. 
<P>
Turns out, the car makers were right about the dangers all along.
But they were browbeaten and overruled by the usual cabal of anticapitalist
militants, Congressional liberals, and regulatory bureaucrats.
Let's review the history. 
<P>
Ralph Nader and his political network never stopped trying to
replicate the successful smear of the Corvair, as found in his
famous fairy tale, <I>Unsafe at Any Speed</I>. In the seventies,
they dreamed up a new way to attack the car industry, by now vulnerable
to media assaults. 
<P>
Here's what Nader and the gang came up with. Hear ye, hear ye:
there's a technology that would massively cut automobile deaths.
It is a pillow that pops out of the steering wheel in an collision.
Yes, it's even better than the seatbelt.
<P>
So why aren't these magic pillows available on cars? Why, indeed,
aren't they mandatory? In a word: Greed, said Nader and Co. The
car makers could be spending money to save your life. Instead
they are lining their pockets with profits from unsafe vehicles.
<P>
Thus did the air bag become the leftwing craze of the Carter years.
Typically, the product and the mythology surrounding it embodied
socialist paranoia. In this view, the capitalist is secretly killing
the consumer while the average man is too stupid to know about
it, which is why we need the government to intervene.  
<P>
But if air bags were a valuable product worth the expense, car
companies would have installed them while Nader was in law school,
if only to gain an advantage over the competition. 
<P>
None of the Naderite nonsense was convincing to people who knew
something about markets. But the media laughed at company warnings:
that, first, air bags were not cost efficient (yes, you can put
a price tag on safety; we could all drive around in tanks, after
all). Second, air bags would make people think they could get
by without a seatbelt, thus increasing injury. 
<P>
Third, that air bags are not soft and fluffy at all, but can hit
your forehead like a 200 mph brick wall. You might have all your
limbs after a crash, but you might also be dead. The companies
warned that children and small women were particularly at risk.
<P>
But the crash dummies favored by the consumer groups didn't test
for this factor, and, anyway, the well had been poisoned. The
media dismissed company complaints as more evidence of the capitalist
conspiracy to make people drive dangerous cars.
<P>
The government prevailed against the car companies, and the airbag
mandate went into effect. Everyone cheered Ralph and booed Detroit.
But the bags added billions to the cost of cars, led Americans
to drive more recklessly, and directly killed some fifty people
in just the last three years, including the infant who was decapitated
by an air bag in Idaho.
<P>
Haven't they also saved 1,500 lives? That's the claim, but there's
no way to know. It's easy for the airbag lobby to play fast and
loose with these hypotheticals.
<P>
Plus, it's one thing to have a loved one die in a tragic traffic
fluke; it's quite another to have him killed by a government mandate.
It's the difference between falling and being shoved off a ledge.

<P>
To correct the problem, the government is considering a number
of options. One is to allow people to have their air bags disconnected
by car dealerships. That's right: they can't do that legally now.
<P>
Another is to mandate a huge warning sign on the dashboard: WARNING!
DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY CAN OCCUR. Thanks a lot. Another is to
mandate a &quot;smart&quot; bag that will supposedly adjust to
your height and weight so it won't kill you. Still another would
order you to keep your baby in the back seat (as if a single parent
could take a long commute that way).
<P>
Mandate, mandate, mandate, that's all the government can talk
about. Instead, those behind this mess should be offering public
apologies and then forced to pay compensation to the families
who've had their mothers and children murdered by air bags, to
the car buyers who've had their prices artificially increased,
and to the car companies that have been vilified and harassed.
<P>
Even if the government won't draw the right lesson from this fiasco,
we should. Don't trust the feds with your safety. Trust those
in private enterprise, who have the best interests of the consumer
in mind. They won't kill you and then lie about it. 
<P>

<title>Rockwell: The Republican Mixed Economy -- 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>The Republican Mixed Economy</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 




In the 1950s and following, when full-blown socialism began to lose 
its intellectual credibility, there arose a theory of the "mixed 
economy." The idea was that the best of socialism and capitalism can 
be combined into a new system that curbs the excesses of both. The 
result was the political economy of contradiction: "market socialism," 
"collective entrepreneurship," and "community investment," among many 
other strange hybrids. <p>

The theory of the mixed economy didn't get very far, no doubt because 
of its confused and conflicting character. Property is either private 
or it isn't. Prices either float freely or they don't. Investment is 
either market-driven or it's not. One system must dominate the other, 
in the same way that cars must drive on the left- or the right-hand 
side of the road. <p>

The idea of the mixed economy may have fizzled among American liberals 
(though academic publishers are still enthralled with the idea). In 
the Republican Party, however, the idea is making a huge comeback. The 
party is not backing the old mix of socialism and capitalism or 
anything as systematic as that; it is backing the political economy of 
polar opposites.<p>

No where is this more evident than in the Republican treatment of the 
budget. With Jack Kemp on the ticket, supply sideism has again become 
the dominant fiscal ideology. There's nothing wrong with the idea that 
tax cuts fuel economic growth. The American people are overtaxed, and 
only an all-out statist would deny it. The problem is the belief that 
government spending can go up forever without someone, sometime, 
having to pay for it. <p>

The Republican plan has not spelled out any spending cuts because Jack 
Kemp doesn't believe they're necessary (as he demonstrated during his 
free-spending HUD years). He's got a long history of excoriating 
people to his right who have the courage to call for cuts in Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare generally. He never misses 
the chance to underscore the ticket's desire to keep the social 
"safety net" exactly the way it is, or even expand it. <p>

In some areas, Republicans are pushing for huge spending increases. 
For example, they say that the Clinton administration has cut the 
military budget too far too fast, and that they will reverse course 
with tens of billions in new spending. And they are promoting the 
hare-brained idea that taxpayers should foot the private-school bills 
of any kid who is dissatisfied with public school. <p>

At the same time, tax cuts have become the centerpiece of the 
campaign. They are promising a three-year 15 percent cut in income tax 
rates, a per child tax rebate, and a 50 percent capital gains tax cut. 
That's laudable, though the full program--even if it passes--won't 
begin to reverse the tax increases Robert Dole has engineered during 
his 35 years in office. <p>

For once, liberals are asking the right question: where in tax-cut 
land is the money going to come from to supply new guns to the 
Pentagon, and a $2000 annual voucher to every "poor" child in America? 
The candidates won't say, except to suggest that this contradiction 
will be solved through the mysterious magic of "economic growth." 
Private enterprise can be enlisted, unwittingly, to pay for ever-
higher public spending. <p>

The ticket compounds the error by suggesting it will "end the IRS as 
we know it," a phrase designed to lead voters to believe they will no 
longer have to answer to the tax police. Here again, the idea is a 
fine one. But to make it a reality, government must dramatically curb 
its appetite for spending. Without such curbs, the promise to stop 
collecting taxes, or make paying them less onerous, is deeply 
deceptive.  <p>

There is such a thing as the bottom line. Every dime in new public 
spending must be extracted from private markets, either through 
stepped-up use of the taxing power or more borrowing, or by calling on 
the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt by printing money. All three 
have a destabilizing effect on the financial markets at some point. 
There's no such thing as having your cake and eating it too. <p>

The same contradictions spoil the Republican monetary policy. Jack 
Kemp has long advocated a gold standard (or, more strictly, a gold 
price rule for monetary management). But the chief benefit of the gold 
standard is that it puts shackles on the ability of government to 
borrow and monetize debt. You can always print paper money (which is 
why politicians like our present money system), but gold has a fixed 
supply (alchemy being the stuff of legend). <p>

At the same time, Kemp evangelizes for giving the poor more "access to 
credit." He endorses the dangerous movement to force banks to lend 
money to borrowers on grounds of their lowly economic status, without 
regard to whether the loans will be paid back on time or ever. This 
policy requires the kind of loose money regime absolutely prohibited 
by the gold standard. You can't expect to gain the benefits of a gold 
standard unless you're willing to accept its discipline. <p>

The same mixed-up approach is evident in their statements about 
regulation. Dole and Kemp employ the rhetoric of deregulation and call 
for the government to stop muscling private enterprise. At the same 
time, just prior to the convention, Dole told a group of disability 
activists that he is going to expand enforcement of his pet Americans 
With Disabilities Act.<p>

Yet the ADA--which calls on all public and private entities  to make 
accommodation for every conceivable disability, physical or mental--is 
surpassed only by the Clean Air Act in the costs and burdens it places 
on business. According to the letter of the law and court precedent, 
practically every business and public facility is in violation right 
now. For that reason, the ADA has become the latest get-rich-quick 
scheme for the litigious overclass of trial lawyers. <p>

So it goes for the freedom of association. The ticket has strongly 
implied it will retain the laws imposing affirmative action; indeed 
Kemp has been a rabid advocate of these policies. At the same time, 
the Republicans want to be seen as opposing "quotas," the logical and 
necessary outcome of anti-discrimination laws empowering the 
government with defining what constitutes illegal preference in the 
workforce. <p>

On and on it goes with welfare spending (they promise both a 
guaranteed national income and policies to force people to work), 
education (they promise to abolish the Department of Education and to 
have it administer a federal voucher program), immigration (they 
promise to end the free ride and give immigrants full rights to 
welfare), and trade (it is supposed to be both "free" and "fair," i.e. 
restrictive).  <p>

The final and most brazen contradiction has been the Republican 
Achilles heel for at least three decades. They promise smaller 
government at home while insisting that the U.S. step up its empire of 
foreign aid, foreign troops, and foreign wars. This is the most deeply 
dishonest of all the clashing positions within the Republican grab 
bag. A government big enough to run a global empire will hardly shrink 
from total social management at home. <p>

Philosophers speak of antinomies: contradictory truths that may not 
negate each other. Unfortunately for Republicans, these do not exist 
in economic policy. The mixed economy of Robert Dole and Jack Kemp is 
just as mixed-up as the attempt to blend socialism and capitalism. 
Reality eventually forces the politicians who try it to choose one 
path or the other. <p>

<title>Rockwell: Conservatives and Vouchers -- 7/22/96</title>

<h2>
Conservatives and Vouchers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seeking to align himself more closely with conservatives 
before the Republican convention, Bob Dole has endorsed a federal 
school voucher program. But if he had done his homework, he would 
have known that conservatives have grave reservations about 
putting private schools on the dole. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Dole's idea is a four-year pilot program that would cost 
$5 billion, with half the bill paid by the federal government 
providing the states foot the rest. Four million students from 
mostly poor families would get grants to attend private schools.
This is "a civil rights movement for the 1990s," he said. Is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For decades, conservatives have debated with liberals on 
education. Liberals say money needs to be redistributed from rich 
districts to poor ones, and overall spending increased 
dramatically. Bosh, say conservatives. The answer lies with local 
control, returning to basics, and rewarding achievement. Throwing 
more money at the problem--especially federal money--will not 
work. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To which side of the debate does the voucher idea belong? 
Vouchers means new federal spending in a new federal education 
program that violates the 10th amendment. Vouchers guarantee 
perpetually higher budgets for the Department of Education, which 
will distribute them. Vouchers get the feds involved in the 
funding and running of private schools, something not even Mr. 
Clinton's Goals 2000 does. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even Mr. Dole's pitch is strangely class-based: we should 
take from the rich, who send their kids to private schools 
because "they have the money," and give to the poor, so they can 
have "choice" too. The implication is that disparities in wealth 
are inherently unjust; it takes subsidies to make people truly 
free. Only the far-left used to talk like this. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course rich people have more "choice" than poor people, 
and not only in the schools they attend. Rich people can live in 
nicer homes, drive nicer cars, dress better, eat fancier food, if 
they so choose. Mr. Dole says "that's not the way it ought to 
work in America." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Oh? There's a name for the system that allows such 
disparities: it's capitalism. Those who work hard, save, and 
invest benefit materially, as they should. And by spending their 
own dollars on private school, people are investing in the future 
of their children. How strange that Mr. Dole would be the one to 
offer such a radical critique of this system. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's brand new in Mr. Dole's plan is that vouchers would 
also be given to home schoolers. That's a sure path to disaster. 
The feds would not only monitor and license these caring 
mothers--the way social workers do welfare recipients--but also 
determine what and how many hours they teach. Goodbye 
homeschooling. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already Americans are taxed to the hilt to pay for failing 
public schools. Already states are strapped by intrusive federal 
regulations that have transformed many schools into condom-
distributing, multicultural petri dishes. Now, Republicans are 
supposed to get behind a program that will do to private schools 
what the feds have done to public ones? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's safe to say that Mr. Dole's idea won't go far. Of course 
teachers unions oppose vouchers. But so does an organized 
movement of religious and economic conservatives in the 
Republican Party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
George Roche of Hillsdale College says vouchers would remake 
private schools "into the image of the very public schools that 
have failed so miserably." Ronald Trowbridge adds that "if 
government vouchers are extended to private primary and secondary 
schools," private schools "will become virtually extinct." 
Columnist Samuel Francis says that if vouchers pass, the nation's 
"private and parochial schools would soon be homogenized by the 
same government that has already ruined public schools."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at the budget figures, Charlotte Allen, writing in 
the American Spectator, is shocked by the sheer cost. Taxpayers 
will "find themselves obliged to pay for a private-school system 
on top of a public-school system." Worst of all, they will "leave 
us even more in thrall to a powerful central government."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pat Buchanan, who once backed them, says he took "a hard 
second look at those school vouchers." Now he predicts they will 
"entail greater state contamination and control." Why not "give 
the billions back to taxpayers" in tax cuts, he asks? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economist Murray Rothbard was once asked what he proposed in 
place of vouchers. Abolish the Department of Education, he said, 
repeal regulations on private schools, cut public school budgets, 
and insure local control. Finally, Dr. Rothbard said, the best 
voucher is a person's own hard-earned dollar; government should 
let us keep what we earn. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead, Mr. Dole has proposed yet another far-flung federal 
program. On this issue, as with many others, he has abandoned the 
true conservative position, and thrown in his lot with the 
big-spending, egalitarian left.

<title>Rockwell: Alienation in American Politics -- 7/8/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Alienation in American Politics 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "alienation" of workers 
exploited by wage slavery. Someday, they predicted, the system 
would come unglued, and the workers would expropriate the 
expropriators. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a bunch of malarkey, to be sure; no system is as 
exploitative as socialism. Yet alienation does exist: it's what 
average citizens feel towards the political process and the 
massive federal government it sustains. Every day we are 
exploited more and more, and yet seem powerless to change 
anything. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the recent example of VMI and the Citadel, proud 
and ancient institutions steeped in the respective histories of 
their states. As single-sex military academies, they offered 
young men the camaraderie only this setting can provide. Then, 
for no good reason, a majority of the Supreme Court decided it 
didn't like these schools. In one fell stroke, they are 
destroyed. It's the kind of action that alienates citizens from 
their government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example involves Stalinesque demographic planning. 
Federal judges in Baltimore, Maryland, and Dallas, Texas, have 
decided that inner-city public housing residents should be living 
in the suburbs, again, for no good reason. By court order, these 
residents will be dispersed according to a government plan and at 
taxpayer expense. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is wildly unpopular, both among those who pay to live 
in nice areas and among public-housing residents. When a similar 
scheme was tried in Chicago, it led to enormous social upheaval, 
huge population shifts, and the wrecking of formerly decent 
neighborhoods. No doubt, if the judicial dictators get their way, 
the same will happen in Baltimore and Dallas. Yet exploited 
citizens are powerless to stop these schemes. No wonder they feel 
so alienated from the government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example was brought home by the bombing in Saudi 
Arabia. How many people knew the U.S. stationed thousands of 
troops at the King Abdul Aziz air base in Dhahran? Of those, how 
many think the U.S. has a vital interest in continuing to do so? 
Yet when 19 Americans were killed, the obvious solution--bring 
the troops home--escaped everyone in Washington. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bloated military budget and the foreign policy it 
supports have virtually nothing to do with the average citizen. 
Only the traditional beneficiaries of imperialism gain: 
politicians, corporate exporters, military contractors, lifetime 
bureaucrats, and spooks. The long-suffering taxpayer is alienated 
from the whole system, yet powerless to change it. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The examples provided by the last few years could be 
multiplied without end. Clintonian tax increase, Nafta, Gatt, the 
Mexican bailout, welfare for immigrants: all are projects of federal 
government, all were fantastically unpopular, yet all were 
steamrollered through anyway. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "power elite"--the 
wealthy and unaccountable capitalists who oppress the workers. 
Who today denies that American politics is in fact dominated by a 
power elite? This class is not made of capitalists, who make 
their living, after all, by serving the consuming public. It 
consists of employees and hangers-on of the federal government 
itself. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alienation is fueled by the obvious reality that the power 
elite does not have independent means of support. The huge public 
treasury they have at their disposal is transferred directly from 
the paychecks of the working class. This creates a permanent 
state of conflict, and deepening political discontent unlike any 
we've seen. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some people drop out of politics altogether, and turn 
towards radical groups with a leftist or rightist bent. Those 
still active seek other outlets, including third parties. Most
Americans think two parties are not enough. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What else can we expect when the nominees of the major 
parties are such open representatives of the ruling class? But if 
Watergate undermined faith in the presidency and in government 
generally, what will the newest unflattering revelations about 
Bill Clinton do? They can only increase alienation and 
discontent, and cast a permanent pall on the Beltway elite. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elite may bemoan this fact, but the rise of intense 
anti-government feeling is the most encouraging development in 
modern political life. Jefferson and Madison said a free people 
should never have confidence in men with power. The bigger the 
government, the less it should be trusted, and the less it's 
trusted, the more likely it is to fall. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In Marxist lore, history would settle all scores in favor of 
socialism. But the opposite is happening, and, because the system 
cannot hold, time is running out for leviathan. The expropriated 
taxpayers will have their day, the troops will come home, the 
central planning will end, and the dictatorship of the power 
elite will be no more. Then we will understand the one truth in 
Marxism: the state can wither away.

<title>Rockwell: Clinton's Libertarian Cloak -- 7/3/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Clinton's Libertarian Cloak 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a crazy, mixed-up political world when Bill Clinton 
comes out for individualist libertarianism. The trend began in 
his state of the union address when he announced that "the era of 
big government is over"--and then proposed half a dozen new 
government programs. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But that statement was merely a coming attraction. During a 
press grilling on the FBI files controversy, Mr. Clinton said he 
is "appalled" by "any kind of abuse of public authority that 
tramples on the liberties of individual citizens." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He's gone beyond stealing Republican issues. Now he's 
remaking himself in the image of Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine. 
Moreover, he says, this is not a new position, but one held "from 
my earliest days as a young man."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's new-found libertarianism does have one 
advantage. He has committed himself to a philosophical standard 
by which he can be judged. Do his policies measure up? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House wants to outlaw work that pays under $5 an 
hour. But what if a person can't find a job that pays that much? 
If he works for less, he and his employer violate federal law. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's a clear case of public authority trampling on the 
liberties of individual citizens. If a person works for two bucks 
an hour, and the deal is by mutual agreement, there's no harm 
done. But when the government steps in to prevent the 
transaction, it robs both parties of the liberty to contract. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar examples can be found on every page of the U.S. 
Code. Why should the government drive a wedge between consumers 
who want to buy cigarettes and companies that want to sell them? 
Why should the government force employers to hire people who 
aren't right for the job?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why should the government stop importers from selling Iraqi 
oil? Why should the government prevent property owners from 
draining their swamps and developing their land? Why should the 
government tax away up to 40 percent of people's incomes, and 
declare some to be "unearned"? All these actions trample on 
liberty. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is it unfair to discuss economic policies when Mr. Clinton 
was talking about the "civil liberty" not to be spied on by 
federal police agents without cause? No, although left-liberals 
have long tried to have it both ways, dreaming of socialist 
economics and strict enforcement of the Bill of Rights. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the ACLU, it's impossible to separate the different 
aspects of liberty. A government that forbids and controls 
economic exchange will think nothing of invading what are 
designated as "civil liberties." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There might have been a time when left-liberals believed in 
free association and other civil liberties. They are still fuming 
because Senator Joseph McCarthy thought it mattered when a public 
figure in Hollywood or the State Department was a member of the 
Communist Party. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But those days are long gone. Today, the left is far more 
hysterical about private militias than Mr. McCarthy ever was 
about communists. Freedom of association? Any gun owner who gets 
together with a few friends to fret about the feds is to be spied 
on and treated as a potential bomb builder or church burner. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals are still shrieking about J. Edgar Hoover's 
investigations of the civil rights movement. But today, left-wing 
nonprofit groups spy on people's political affiliations and share 
their files with happy federal bureaucrats. No anti-communist 
group of the 1950s painted with the broad brush of the 
"anti-hate" blocs of the 1990s, which link the desire for tax 
cuts or less recycling with every manner of terrorist activity. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The left loved the Bill of Rights when it was used by the 
federal government against the states. With the independence of 
the states demolished, the left thinks nothing of openly 
attacking the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th amendments. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bill Clinton's devotion to libertarian doctrine is 
laughable, so is the left's claim to defend individuals against 
the government. These are the people who have created the 
Orwellian state they warned us against, and--among a host of 
other depredations--turned private comments into punishable 
speech crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's libertarian sentiments were provoked by the 
accusations that he used FBI files for political purpose. We'll 
know he's serious when he proposes to burn--not the files on 
political appointees--but the millions of dossiers on law-abiding 
private citizens. Until that great day, the big government whose 
era he claims has ended, will still be lording it over us.

<h2>
The Politics of Church Fires
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1988 Willie Horton ads were considered awful because 
they played on fears of race and crime for base (that is, 
Republican) motives. Fast forward eight years, and consider the 
uses to which the Democrats are putting the church burnings in 
the South.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These fires are invariably described as part of a "wave" or 
"rash" of attacks against blacks not seen since Jim Crow. Even 
though almost all are unsolved, the Clinton Justice Department 
assures us that whites are the perpetrators and racial hatred the 
cause. Therefore, these are not mere arsons, but big-league 
political crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, more than 200 federal agents are crawling around 
the rural South, usurping local and state fire investigators, and 
the South-bashing New York Times has had a field day, running 
treatises on why this is exactly what one would expect from a 
racist region. We should all look to New York City, locus of 
peace, harmony, and intergroup love. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A gaggle of left-wing organizations, led by specialists in 
racial agitation, has declared the burnings to be part of a 
conspiracy tacitly encouraged by the Republican Congress and the 
Supreme Court's rulings against racially drawn voting districts.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Jesse Jackson takes it a step further. The burnings are part 
of a new "anti-black mania," he says, a "white riot" spread by 
"lawmakers." People in white sheets burn churches, but so do 
Congressmen "in blue suits, who use thinly coated, veiled race 
signals when they say welfare and crime and three strikes and end 
affirmative action." Mr. Jackson urges people to register and 
vote for you-know-what party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As for the victimized pastors themselves, they went on 
television to complain that they and their parishioners had been 
questioned, even though it's standard procedure to look to owners 
first when a building is torched. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All this is but a side show to the central message as stated 
by Bill Clinton. Standing outside a black church in South 
Carolina, he denounced burnings, poverty, and discrimination, and 
proclaimed the glories of civil rights. "We are not going back," 
he said. "We are not slipping back to those dark days." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In case you missed it, there's a political agenda here: any 
attempt to repeal quotas or welfare is, like torching a church, 
motivated by hatred. This is how liberal politicians play on 
racial fears and crime for their political purposes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton has already been caught in one fib. He said he 
had "vivid and painful memories of black churches being burned in 
my own state when I was a child." It turns out that there is no 
record of such burnings. His remarks had to be corrected by a 
spokesman. They weren't churches, but "community buildings." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Joyce Price and Warren Strobel of the Washington Times
talked to NAACP officials, black pastors, and historians in 
Arkansas. But only one expert could remember a suspicious fire in 
the 1950s that involved a racial element. Curtis Sykes, chairman 
of Arkansas's Black History Advisory Committee, said the fire was 
set by a black man, who was convicted of several insurance-fraud 
arsons. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Frank Wolfe of the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette said that Mr. 
Clinton might be remembering the bombings in Little Rock on Labor 
Day 1959, resulting from resentments over forced school 
integration. Trouble is: all the targets were white, including 
public officials, lawyers, and firemen who had turned their hoses
on protesting white parents. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fibs aside, the campaign marches on. Always anxious to find 
evil in Alabama, the media have focussed on our four fires since 
December. But Alvin Benn of the Montgomery Advertiser raises 
serious questions. Since 1990, thirty-eight houses of worship 
have burned in Alabama. Twenty were black; eighteen were white, 
although there has been no publicity about them. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And none of the fires apparently involved "hate," says the 
State Fire Marshal. For example, some burglars set fire to 
churches after robbing them. Other cases involved internal church 
disputes, drunks who decided to burn a building, insurance fraud, 
electrical fires, and lightning. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More interesting data: thirty church burnings in the South 
over eighteen months may sound like a lot, and it is obviously 
thirty too many, but it represents 0.03 percent of the arsons 
recorded. In just 1994, Chicago had more than 1,000; Los Angeles 
more than 3,000; and New York City more than 5,000. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The church fires may "harken back to a dark era," as Mr. 
Clinton claims. But his efforts certainly harken back to other 
fear-based campaigns to get out the vote, while chilling anyone 
who would question statist federal policies and the racial 
orthodoxies used to justify them.

<title>Rockwell:  The Terror Threat? -- 6/5/96</title>

<h2>
The Terror Threat?
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whip yourself into a frenzy. Dig a shelter out back. Fly 
into a panic and be extremely scared. It's time for special 
alarms, drills, and teach-ins. Most of all, pay your taxes with 
diligence and joy so the government can protect you.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The big news? The feds say terrorists are loose on the land. 
And you could be their next victim. The only way to safety is to 
surrender your money, your freedom, and your guns to the 
bureaucrats, and quake with fear unless the FBI is near. At least 
that's what we'd do if we believed everything we're being told. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ever since the Oklahoma bombing, we've heard that the threat 
of domestic terrorism means the government needs vast new power 
and money. Every chance they get, officials from virtually every 
federal police agency--the FBI, FEMA, Justice, the CIA--tell the 
press that a bomb could blow up your neighborhood any minute. 
Look out! 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And that's only the beginning. Why, do you realize that 
someone could use chemical weapons against your hometown? Even 
more frightening is the supposed prospect of biological warfare. 
If something isn't done right away, we'll be infected with a 
deadly disease or writhe on the floor, dying from asphyxiation. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The likelihood that state or nonstate actors," says head 
spook John M. Deutch in his best bureaucratise, "will attempt to 
use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests is 
growing." But, never fear, the feds are here to protect you, 
just as they protected so many in the past. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last November, for example, FEMA hosted a creepy gathering 
in Mount Weather, Virginia, attended by the CIA, the FBI, and 
various other spies and paranoids prominent in the D.C. political 
racket. They met in a huge bomb shelter built at the height of 
the Cold War to maintain life and luxury for government officials 
as the civilian population suffered nuclear annihilation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At this meeting, according to the Wall Street Journal, the 
geniuses in government met to fret about how little money is 
being spent to prepare for terrorist attacks. But "some serious 
planning has begun," says the Journal. Oh to be a fly on that 
wall. Who can doubt that these people salivate over the prospect 
of martial law, suspending the Constitution, and shoving the 
population around like cattle?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What will the ruling regime do to maintain its power in the 
post-Cold War environment? Well, there is the terrorism bill 
passed by Congress and signed by the president. It bolstered 
federal police power with new funds and responsibilities, and 
restricted the rights of American citizens. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Funny that the framers of the Constitution never anticipated 
the need for an internal police force to keep the people in check 
and protected. If they had, they might have given up those silly ideas 
about liberty and self government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Going on seven years now, the ruling elites have confronted 
a serious problem. With no credible foreign threat on the 
horizon, the central state seems to have lost its primary reason 
for existence. The average fellow can't understand what the 
apparatus in Washington does with 1.7 trillion bucks every year. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A government this big does its best to avoid peace at home 
and abroad. As it knows from experience, these are the times that 
try men's pocketbooks. People demand lower taxes, shrinking 
government power, and less government arrogance. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For instance: during the first World War, the government 
practically established martial law at home, planned most 
industrial and agricultural production, revved up the military 
machine to full capacity, and squelched free speech and a free 
press. It was a sad chapter, but one that came to a quick close 
when the war was over. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the American people demanded an immediate end to the 
violation of their rights and the high taxation of their 
property. The military shrunk in size, and the war planning 
boards were shut down, not to be reopened until the New Deal 
(under the auspices of curing an economic crisis, itself brought 
on by the Federal Reserve). 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same thing might have happened after the Second World 
War, which also saw an explosion in government power over the 
economy. But just as people were demanding a return to normalcy, 
the Cold War intervened, and thankfully so for folks in 
Washington. The communists were coming, and taxpayers could be 
relied up on to stay frightened and relatively docile for another 
forty years. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fast forward to 1989, and the end of the ramshackle Soviet 
empire. With no substantial foreign policy threats on the 
horizon, peace and freedom threatened to break out yet again. A 
series of botched military exercises overseas has made the public 
ever more skeptical of the ruling regime. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terrorism is as good an excuse as any for keeping people 
alarmed about some enemy, and to deflect attention away from the 
real threat to their liberties, which is the government itself. 
Indeed, for several years, polls have recorded record-level 
dissatisfaction with government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington is none too happy that nobody seems to care about 
the supposed terrorist threat. Complains Senator Dick Lugar, 
"there is almost a sense of denial out there in the public." 
Indeed a recent poll--which underscores that the public is 
keeping its wits--reveals that only a few Americans are 
"seriously worried" about terrorism. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The government is trying to fix that. Some militia guys were 
recently arrested in Georgia, and the anonymous federal informant 
who had undoubtedly egged them on told the press they planning to bomb 
the Olympics. Not true, said the on-the-record briefing that followed, 
but the essential message had already been planted in the minds of 
many.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And last year, the feds called the Anaheim, California, fire 
department to say that Disneyland would be sprayed with poison 
gas in three hours. Whoops, they said later, it's not true. But 
again, the essential message had been planted. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From the beginning of time, governments have used the 
prospect of attack, real and phony baloney, to inspire citizen 
compliance. Will it work this time?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I have my doubts. A government that can't deliver the mail
surely can't stop poison gas attacks. And the American people 
have become stingy with their rights and liberties, as they 
should be and will ever be, now that government has become the 
"fearful master" George Washington warned us against.

<title>Rockwell:  Revenue Neutrality   -- 5/9/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Revenue Neutrality  
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans might as well pack their bags, admit defeat,  
and head home. Their entire program has been doomed by the  
doctrine of "revenue neutrality." In practice, it means that the  
government's income can never fall. This has turned fiscal policy  
into, at best, a pointless exercise; at worst, a deeply dishonest  
shell game.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Look at recent Republican maneuvers. Every proposed lower  
tax is matched by some increase. Give a tax credit for adoption,  
and raise taxes on business. Cut gas taxes, and increase other  
excise taxes. What's next? Cuts in the inheritance tax, "paid  
for" by an increase in the gas tax? Maybe the per child tax  
credit can be "paid for" by repealing the adoption tax credit.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The total burden of taxes remains the same no matter what  
these guys do. So what is supposed to be the purpose of this  
nonsense? If it is too much to ask that the federal government  
take less from the private sector, Republican slogans about  
cutting the size of government are empty. There's no point to  
elections, platforms, or debates, because you can't cut  
government without cutting its income.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The doctrine of "revenue neutrality" is a leftover from  
George Bush's 1990 budget agreement, which raised taxes and  
arguably lost him the election. Part of the deal was that any  
increase in spending must be accompanied by an increase in taxes;  
likewise, any decrease in taxes must be matched by an equal  
decrease in spending.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At first, it sounds reasonable to treat the federal budget  
as if it were a household's. But it's not, because it doesn't  
consist of owned property. It is a vast redistribution scheme  
whereby property is pilfered from some and doled out to others;  
either or both practices should be curbed wherever possible.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Before the 1990 budget deal, no one said that all tax cuts  
had to be "paid for" in other ways. That language makes it seem  
deeply expensive to cut revenue, and thus fiscally irresponsible.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For taxpayers, however, a tax cut is not an expense, but a  
boon. It allows them to keep more of what is rightfully theirs in  
the first place. What's expensive is keeping taxpayers on the  
hook for the same percentage of the national income, year after  
year, and never allowing it to fall.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One fallacious assumption behind the doctrine of revenue  
neutrality is that Congress can know exactly what people will do  
before and after tax changes. Consider the gas tax. It's possible  
that deep cuts in the gas tax would cause the price to fall and  
the demand to rise, thus increasing overall revenue. But Congress  
doesn't even consider the prospect. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is true for many taxes. If the inheritance tax were cut  
dramatically, people's incentive to accumulate property would  
increase dramatically. It's even possible that the resulting  
economic activity would offset the revenue losses of the tax cut.  
So it goes for the income tax and every other excise tax.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But let's say the so-called Laffer Effect didn't kick in,  
and total revenue actually went down. A loss to government is a  
gain for everyone else. Lower revenue means government is less of  
a burden on the American people, and that the economy is that  
much freer. That's why we should be as thrilled to see a falling  
tax take as a falling crime rate. Each makes people that much  
more secure in their person and property.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about the deficit? It's true that deficits crowd out  
private investment, tempt the Treasury into monetizing debt, and  
drive up interest rates. A balanced budget, with both spending  
and taxes low, is a joy to behold.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But we live in the age of deficits not because taxes are too  
low, but because government has been freed from the obligation to  
back the currency with gold. It's no coincidence that the budget  
was last balanced in 1969, when gold restricted the Treasury's  
ability to pile up debt.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Why do increases and decreases in the deficit always seem to  
surprise the political class? Because its size is influenced by  
factors over which they have little control, like economic  
growth, the business cycle, the size of the underground economy,  
and the numbers of people receiving wages and salaries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One thing politicians can control is how much government 
steals from our paychecks every year. But to fix that, we must  
first trash the 1990 budget deal. Concocted by an evil genius,  
it's the only budget agreement in the last two decades that  
anyone bothers to obey. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So long as "revenue neutrality" is the rule, leviathan will  
grow and grow, and the Republican promise to reduce the size of  
government will continue to be a rhetorical cover for the same  
old political racket.

<title>Rockwell: "Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry -- 5/08/96</title>

<h2>
"Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
  
Federal offices aren't often surrounded by protesters. But   
egregious civil-rights decisions against Mitsubishi and Hooters   
inspired their workers to take to the streets. Meanwhile, lesser   
victims of the civil-rights police are forced to suffer in   
silence as legal defense bills threaten bankruptcy.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Justice Department and the EEOC decide what constitutes   
"discrimination" on grounds of race, religion, age, disability,   
and sex, the most sensitive areas of our national life. Since any   
action can be construed as somehow influenced by them, the   
government can exercise ferocious power over a vast range of   
economic decisions.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When a business is involved, bureaucrats act as the   
sure-to-win plaintiff's lawyers capable of imposing de facto  
quotas in any business or industry. It has the power to brand   
companies with labels like "racist" and "sexist," and drive them   
to ruin. It is a main reason why race relations are so rotten   
today, and why, more than three decades after the Civil Rights   
Act, everyone feels more victimized than ever.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Not only has the Congress done nothing to curb this, it is   
preparing to expand government power into the makeup of our   
families. The pretext is a bill making it easier to adopt   
children. There is a $5,000 tax credit, "paid for" by higher   
taxes on business. But the heart of the bill is a provision   
putting the federal government in charge of adoption and   
foster-child services, imposing huge new costs, and robbing   
prospective parents of the freedom to choose.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the adoption process, adoptive parents, biological   
parents, and children work directly with public and private   
adoption agencies. After years of experience, agencies have   
learned which matches are likely to succeed, and which are not.   
The criteria are often unquantifiable, but can include such   
factors as race and ethnicity.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


For example, a Vietnamese family may know of some Vietnamese   
orphans in need of permanent loving homes. So long as the match   
is otherwise suitable, the agency will work with the parents to   
accommodate their request. Children are then brought together   
with adoptive parents who will love them and care for them.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But Washington planners find this intolerable, and so are   
scheming to abolish it. They don't want people to be able to   
specify the race of the children they want to adopt; nor do they   
want an agency to be able to draw on its experience in working   
with parents insofar as race is involved. The planners would   
replace the right of contract with bureaucratic edict.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the Washington tradition of antonymous titles, the bill   
is called the "Adoption Promotion and Stability Act." It mandates   
that adoption providers can no longer "discriminate in making a   
placement decision" on the basis of national origin, race, and color.  
The original bill was so draconian it had to be amended to   
say race can be one factor if more than one "qualified" family   
want the child. In fact, the amendment counts for nothing.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Let's say a young mother considers giving up her child for   
adoption. Today, she is allowed, within reason, to specify what   
kind of family she would like her child to be brought up in,   
including the racial makeup of that family. If this bill passes,   
the agency will not be allowed to take her wishes into account.   
Faced with less certainty about her child's future, she will be   
more likely to choose abortion.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The same goes for adoptive and foster parents. If the bill   
passes, they will still be able, for now, to request the sex and   
religion of the child they would like to care for. But any   
request regarding race or national origin will not be considered   
under most conditions. Will the Vietnamese couple be just as   
interested in adopting a white or black child? Of course not, and   
they might just drop out of the process.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How will the government know whether discrimination takes   
place? In its usual ham-fisted fashion, it will count the   
numbers, establish quotas, and override people's preferences. It   
will substitute private judgment with rule by bureaucrats and   
lawyers, and give the Justice Department veto power over all   
private decisions that affect adoption and foster care.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This law will also be subject to category creep like other   
civil-rights bills. It's only a matter of time before religion,   
sex, and disability are added to the list. In time, Washington   
will be running the private and state-level child placement   
industry the way it runs its own welfare bureaucracies.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The proponents of the bill make the wildly unproven claim   
that all delays in foster and adoptive placements are due to   
discrimination against minorities. They have demonized the   
National Association of Black Social Workers for seeking black   
homes for black children. Like all liberals bent on social   
engineering, they pursue their plans with a John Brown-like fury   
and blindness to the other side.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What, then, is the real cause of sluggishness and   
disequilibrium in the system? Federal laws that overregulate the   
industry and prevent a well-functioning market for parental   
rights from emerging. So these revolutionary Republicans, instead  
of repealing the existing government interventions, impose more.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The result will be to make adoptive agencies and social   
service providers vulnerable to killer lawsuits from parents who   
experience any delay. "Public-interest" lawyers will also file   
civil suits by the thousands, and tie the placement process in   
knots. In a system already replete with broken hearts, this will   
impose limits on the numbers of organizations willing to be   
involved in the first place.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The bill will not end up "promoting the adoption of minority   
children," as supporters claim, because Washington can't people from  
deciding not to be adoptive or foster parents, or from choosing  
abortion over childbearing. The more freedom of choice the government  
takes away, the less anyone will want to bear the burden in the first  
place.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There's a moral principle involved here too. The federal   
government has long managed our associations with regard to race   
at ever more intimate levels, and the results have been awful.  
Now it wants to make the same divisive intervention into the   
makeup of families. What's next? Non-discrimination laws for   
marriage?  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's time we begin to trust the judgment of the private   
sector, and local levels of government over federal, and stop   
transferring power to Washington. Unlike Mitsubishi and Hooters,   
the children and parents victimized by civil rights enforcement   
aren't in a position to stage public protests.

<h4>THOMAS A. SCHATZ</h4> 
President<br> 
Citizens Against Government Waste and<br> 
Council for Citizens Against Government Waste<br> 
</center> 
<p> 
Thomas A. Schatz is President of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) and the Council for 
Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW). 
<p> 
CAGW was founded by J. Peter Grace and Jack Anderson in 1984 following the release of the Grace 
Commission report. It is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit, educational organization with more than 600,000 
members nationwide. Mr. Schatz is a nationally recognized spokesperson on government waste and has 
appeared on hundreds of radio talk shows from coast to coast, including WBZ in Boston, WGN in 
Chicago, KABC in Los Angeles, WCBS in New York, and WOAI in San Antonio. His national television 
appearances include: "ABC News with Peter Jennings," "CBS News with Dan Rather," "NBC News with 
Tom Brokaw," CNN, CNBC, "Larry King Live," "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," and numerous local 
network affiliates. 
<p> 
According to official Office of Management and Budget figures, implementation of Grace Commission 
recommendations saved taxpayers $152.4 billion through 1990, and CAGW estimates another $ 100 
billion have been saved since then. An additional $78 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1993 and $54 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1994. 
<p> 
As President of CCAGW, the 501(c) (4) nonprofit lobbying organization, Mr. Schatz spearheaded the 
expansion of the grassroots Taxpayers Action Network to more than 400 chapters nationwide. Mr. Schatz 
has also testified on government waste issues before committees of the United States Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
<p> 
During his nine years with CAGW, Mr. Schatz has been instrumental in a development program that 
increased membership from 5,000 to more than 600,000. 
<p> 
Prior to joining CAGW in 1986, Mr. Schatz spent six years as legislative director for Congressman 
Hamilton Fish and two years practicing law and lobbying. 
<p> 
Mr. Schatz holds a law degree from George Washington University and was graduated from the State 
University of New York at Binghamton with a BA degree, With Honors, in Political Science. He is 
married to Leslee Behar and has two daughters, Samantha and Alexandra.

<title>Schatz: Radioactive Tax Boondoggle  -- 08/01/96</title>

<h2>Radioactive Tax Boondoggle</h2>

By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 

It's hard to imagine the government waste watchdog group Citizens Against
Government waste (CAGW), the conservative Heritage Foundation, the
Libertarian Cato Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Cents agreeing on a
policy issue with The Safe Energy Communication Council, Friends of the
Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. And yet it's true.
These and other philosophically divergent organizations are united in their
opposition to more taxpayer funding for one of the most egregious symbols
of pork-barrel spending: the so-called Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR).
<P>
Bringing the budget ax down on the Department of Energy's ALWR program
should be a no-brainer for Congress. The drive to revive nuclear power with
taxpayer subsidies has failed on Main Street, Wall Street, and in the
utilities' executive suites.
<P>
Today, there's simply no domestic market for these reactors, and the
international opportunities are drying up as more governments turn their
backs on this economically-challenged energy source. Every U.S. reactor
ordered in the past 23 years has been subsequently canceled.
<P>
Two independent surveys released earlier in 1996 show that seven out of ten
American voters and nine out of ten utility CEOs don't want new nuclear
plants tax-funded or built, respectively. Most, if not all, forecasting
reports from Wall Street brokerage and investment firms wouldn't argue with
Bear Stearns analyst Daniel Scotto who quipped that the next nuclear
reactor would be built "when Jimmy Hoffa was found alive and well."
<P>
Yet, after spending 60 percent of all U.S. energy research and development
money on nuclear power between 1948 and 1996 (despite the fact that it now
only provides 8 percent of our overall energy needs), Congress is debating
whether to pump more of our tax dollars into the ALWR program.
<P>
Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), the ALWR was
originally intended as a five-year program to develop advanced commercial
nuclear reactors for the domestic market. But the program has become a
corporate welfare poster child, financially benefiting major firms such as
General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion
Engineering. In 1994, these three companies alone had combined revenues of
$73 billion.
<P>
U.S. taxpayers have provided more than $275 million for this program
between fiscal years (FY) 1992-1996. The fifth and final year of funding
ends in September, but the Energy Department has requested an additional
$40 million for FY 1997, and Westinghouse envisions itself on the receiving
end of funding through FY 1999.
<P>
Now, however, even the monolithic nuclear industry is wavering on the
ALWR's worth. In February, GE, one of the primary recipients of tax funds
for the ALWR program, announced that it was abandoning its Simplified
Boiling Water Reactor program (one of the reactor programs within the ALWR
program), which has received more than $50 million in taxpayer subsidies.
GE defended its withdrawal, stating that "extensive evaluations -- have not
established the commercial viability of these designs," a clear-cut
repudiation of the program's original rationale if there ever was one.
Taxpayers will most likely never recover this investment.
<P>
But there's more. Besides lining corporate pockets for dead-end research,
taxpayer funds have also been used to reimburse the above-named companies
for a portion of the fees charged by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) for its costs to license and certify reactor designs. In other words,
taxpayers are covering the fees which were imposed in order to help offset
the costs of the NRC's services.
<P>
The ALWR program was intended to assist in the design of reactors to be
built in the United States. But since there is no domestic market, U.S.
taxpayer-supported reactor designs -- whose certification by the NRC has been
partially subsidized by the taxpayer under this program -- are being marketed
and sold in Japan, South Korea and other countries. This is a violation of
the intent of EPACT, which stipulates that recipients of any ALWR funds
must promise to construct and operate the reactor in the United States.
<P>
Fortunately, a bipartisan coalition in Congress, spearheaded by Reps. Mark
Foley (R-FL) and David Obey (D-WI) has formed to block any proposals for
continued funding the ALWR. Whether these federal purse-watchers will
succeed depends on citizens raising their voices loudly enough for Congress
to get the message.
<P>
Cutting this tax-vacuum would be an unequivocal statement that Members of
Congress are committed to cutting waste and redirecting budget priorities
to the nation's economic good. It's time to get this tax hog out of the
federal trough.

Picture this: You've been living beyond your means and have had to 
borrow a great deal of money over the years just to keep your bills 
paid and family fed.  Finally, after much procrastination and a few 
sleepless nights, you put yourself and family on a regimen, aiming to 
balance your books over the next seven years while still meeting your 
basic needs.  Tackling  the accumulated debt and interest comes next.  
Then one day, a psychic from the CIA tells you that there's a good 
chance -- but not a guarantee -- that you'll come into some money 
during that seven-year period. 
<P>
What do you do?  Do you spend that hypothetical money, reverting to 
the bad habits that put you in this fix to begin with, or resolve to 
stick to your seven-year plan, recognizing the slim margin of error in 
your calculations and questionable reliability of CIA psychics?   And 
if that psychic turns out to be correct, do you balance your budget 
faster, let's say in five years, and begin to reduce your massive 
debt?  Or do you blow the windfall as usual, costing you more money in 
the long run and imperiling the financial security of your family?  
The logical, responsible answer is to do everything in your power to 
balance your budget faster, start paying off your debt, and break 
free. 
<P>
That's what a reasonable person would do, particularly someone who is 
trying to overcome a lifetime of profligacy.  But in the logic-free 
zone of our nation's capitol, the moral of this parable doesn't 
necessarily track.    
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton continue their dance around the 
budget solution, there's talk of "finding" more money, either through 
revamped economic assumptions or a change in the calculation of the 
consumer price index.  And naturally, being a city of addicts, there's 
already talk in some quarters of spending what has yet to be "found," 
despite the fact that the two sides' budget plans are still hundreds 
of billions of dollars apart.  So while economic assumptions are 
always debatable, and the consumer price index is undoubtedly 
inflated, the idea that we can make things right just by juggling the 
numbers sends the message loud and clear that politics as usual 
continues to rule the roost.  For politicians searching for an easy 
way out, and an escape valve for mounting pressures, it is a nearly 
irresistible solution.          
<P>
So steeped is this city in the compulsion to spend, and so blurred can 
rhetoric and reality become, that it's always worthwhile reviewing the 
facts.    
<P>
Doomsayers have led those unfamiliar with Washington lexicon into  
believing that one, the Republican plan cuts spending, and two, does 
so in a way that will adversely affect the country.  Baloney all 
around.  First, spending will increase in each of the seven years even 
under the "radical" Republican plan. And second, the long-term 
economic benefits of getting the nation's fiscal house in order will 
be worth it.    
<P>
If the Republican plan is adopted, the federal government will spend 
$12 trillion over the next seven years -- an average of $1.7 trillion 
annually.  Medicare will increase 6.4 percent annually -- the most of 
any federal program -- and the per-beneficiary increase will be 47 
percent.  The earned income tax credit, which the president says is 
destroyed by the Republican budget, will increase by 150 percent.  
Student loan volume will increase by 50 percent.  Medicaid goes up by 
30 percent.   
<P>
Give, these projections, the real question is:  How much more do we 
really need to spend?  And what can we afford if, like the person in 
our parable, we're carrying around a $5 trillion debt? 
<P>
Already, interest rates have dropped in anticipation of a balanced 
budget agreement.  The effect on families for housing, car payments, 
education, and other expenses is enormous.  A two percent drop in 
rates can mean thousands less each year in such payments. 
<P>
If there isn't a deal, we will be violating one of Thomas Jefferson's 
moral precepts:  "We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle 
posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves."  
Nobel Laureate James Buchanan recently noted that up until the past 
several decades, balancing the budget was part of our "effective 
constitution," but that "we have lost the moral sense of fiscal 
responsibility to make formal constraints unnecessary." 
<P>
There's a great national debate over "family values."  What kind of 
standards are we setting for future generations?  Without a balanced 
budget, we will pass on a tax rate of 84 percent to our children and 
grandchildren just to pay our bills.  A child born today will pay 
$187,000 in taxes over a lifetime just to pay his or her share of the 
interest on the national debt.  Is that a legacy we can live with?   
<P>
<P>
We can avoid such a fate simply by living within the parameters of the 
Republican plan.   While priorities can always be negotiated, and 
should be negociated, $12 trillion is more than enough money to meet 
the nation's true needs over the next seven years.  And if additional 
funds surface in re-estimates of economic assumptions, let's make the 
moral and just decision to balance the budget faster, start paying off 
the debt, and save the future for our children and grandchildren.

<h2>No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 
There is no such thing as a "budget process" for the federal 
government.  
<p>
Any junior executive will tell you that a real budget is a financial 
plan; it controls how much money may be spent, both overall and for 
each spending category, before any checks are actually cut.  The Grace 
Commission called the federal budget "a political document, ... of 
limited usefulness as a vehicle for planning, control or evaluation."  
Here we are 12 years later and, as Yogi Bera said, "it's deja vu all 
over again." 
<p>
Money is often appropriated without regard to revenue, a practice 
which has been taken for granted for years, but which has lead to a 
federal debt of more than $4.9 trillion.  Even with better than 
average odds that Congress will reach a balanced budget by the year 
2002, the debt is still expected to top out at nearly $6 trillion.   
<p>
The government's fanciful accounting practices invite waste, lack of 
accountability, and gross mismanagement.  But the long-term danger is 
that these distorted budget practices seriously imperil all the hard 
work and political courage being demonstrated on Capitol Hill to bring 
the federal spending juggernaut under control.  
<p>
The annual budget battle over appropriations has become an 
exasperating exercise in futility.  This year, thanks to the tenacity 
of House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (D-La.), and 
many like-minded members of Congress, a significant number of wasteful 
government programs and pork-barrel projects will be purged from the 
13 appropriation bills.  But members who scour the bills looking for 
juicy bits of bacon complain, correctly, that it is the budget system 
itself that allows unwanted pork projects to filter through.   
<p>
In the next phase in the fight for sound government, fiscally 
responsible members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have 
offered budget reform bills to bring federal budget policies in line 
with reality and with private sector practices.  
<p>
A budget reform bill offered by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and 
Steve Largent (R-Okla.) would reconfigure the process from the ground 
up, seeking an end to that mindless annual scramble for scarce federal 
dollars which passes for the appropriations process.  The bill's 
philosophy was summed up when Rep. Cox wrote recently:  "A budget, 
properly used, should provide a framework for the individual spending 
decisions that follow.  The adoption of a budget, therefore, is not 
the proper time to debate those individual decisions."  The 
Cox/Largent legislation would enact a "budget first, spend second" 
provision, reduce the federal budget to a one-page, 19-function 
resolution, and toughen the president's enhanced rescission powers. 
<p>
The spirit of the Cox bill is mirrored in a "truth in budgeting" act 
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) will introduce on November 8.  His bill would 
create a more workable and understandable budget process by 
introducing biennial budgeting, creating a reserve (rainy day) fund 
for fiscal emergencies, putting an end to the fanciful concept of 
baseline budgeting, and enforcing sequestration if spending goes over 
enacted budget and entitlement caps. 
<p>
Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) is proposing budget reform as well, 
including a Spending Reduction Commission. 
<p>
All of these efforts finally begin to liberate the federal government 
from baseline budgeting, the foundation of Washington's "weird 
science."  Baseline budgeting is an entrenched accounting gimmick 
which allows Congress and the President to say with a straight face 
that a reduction in the increase of an agency's budget is actually a 
"cut."   
<p>
The proposed changes may seem common sensical, but they represent 
dramatic change to the Kafkaesque world of federal spending.  Congress 
has been loath to make these "easy" choices in the past, even with 
solid bi-partisan support.  It is so much easier to crow about hard-
fought budget savings from program terminations, while still being 
able to take credit for redirecting the money into other programs and 
trust fund accounts.  This "carve and spend" will continue to 
frustrate real efforts to reduce spending unless Congress moves 
forcefully to overhaul the budget process itself.  The lock-box bill 
approved by the House earlier this year, which will permit saved funds 
to go toward deficit reduction, is a big first step.  But a major 
overhaul must follow, and soon. 
<p>
Reform-minded members like Reps. Cox, Largent, and Barton represent 
the next wave in the revolution that began last November.  Budget 
reform must be at the top of Congress' "to do" list for the next 
session.  Anything less than a full frontal assault on congenital 
budget gimmickry and accounting trickery will make a mockery of all 
the hard-fought gains achieved this session and guarantee that we will 
never get spending under control.

<title>Schlafly: Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention  -- 8/1/96
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>August 1, 1996</i>
<h2>            
Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


      The U.S. Senate should reject ratification of the Chemical
     Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that purports to ban chemical
     weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.
     Contrary to its announced purpose, this foolish treaty would
     increase, not eliminate, the risk of chemical weapons use, and
     would seriously damage U.S. national security interests.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bad guys are deterred by force, the threat of force, or by their
     cold calculation that the costs of evil behavior are not worth
     the risk. Many dangerous countries, such as Libya, Syria, Iraq
     and North Korea, have not signed the CWC and would not be
     deterred by pieces of paper.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China and Iran, which have significant chemical weapons programs,
     are unlikely to comply. Of particular concern is Russia, which
     has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons; the actions and
     statements of its military leaders confirm that Russia would not
     comply at all.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Even though the CWC would not rid the world of chemical weapons,
     it would impose a terrible regulatory and reporting burden on
     every U.S. company that produces, processes, or consumes a
     scheduled chemical. The CWC would affect U.S. firms that make
     dyes and pigments, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, ceramics,
     nylon, paint and varnish, electronics, textiles, and soap and
     detergent.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimates that 2,175 U.S.
     companies would be saddled with reporting requirements and data
     declarations; others estimate that the burden will fall on 10,000
     U.S. production facilities. This time-consuming reporting could,
     in turn, produce additional government oversight and regulation
     by agencies such as OSHA, EPA, and IRS.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     No previous treaty has ever subjected U.S. private industry to
     international inspection. CWC is the New World Order closing in
     on American business.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The process of allowing teams of foreigners to investigate,
     inspect and challenge all facets of private U.S. businesses could
     open them up to industrial espionage and the theft of their
     proprietary information. Forcing them to spend unnecessary funds
     to hire more people to fill out more government forms, and submit
     to routine inspections, would reduce their ability to compete in
     world markets.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In addition to the costs to be borne by private industry, the
     treaty would require the United States to pick up the tab for 25
     percent of the costs of implementation and verification at an
     estimated cost of $200 million a year. Other countries would
     probably demand that the United States pay their costs of
     implementation, too.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the CWC would give birth to a new international
     bureaucracy. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
     Weapons is already headquartered in The Hague with a Conference
     of State Parties, an Executive Council, and a Technical
     Secretariat whose verification responsibilities extend over a
     hundred pages.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Every time we hear trendy slogans such as "global village,"
     "world economy," or "international cooperation," Americans should
     remember that other nations have no familiarity with or
     understanding of our Bill of Rights or our federal structure of
     government with separate state laws. Treaties are customarily
     written as though all power to make and fulfill international
     commitments resides in the head of state who signs the document.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If the CWC goes into effect, what happens to our Fourth Amendment
     rights? The CWC's Technical Secretariat, without a warrant, would
     be empowered to inspect virtually everything within the premises,
     including records, files, papers, processes, controls, structures
     and vehicles, and to interrogate on-site personnel.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Under CWC, what happens to our First Amendment rights? Freedom of
     Information requests will not be permitted under the proposed CWC
     implementing legislation, so Americans would have fewer rights
     under this treaty than if a U.S. agency, such as the FBI,
     investigated them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     As implemented by the Clinton Administration, the CWC would have
     a meddling effect in U.S. affairs. It would forbid U.S.
     commanders to use tear gas and other riot-control substances to
     protect our soldiers and minimize civilian casualties.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The CWC is unverifiable and unenforceable. Former CIA Director
     James Woolsey testified on June 23, 1994 that "the chemical
     weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective,
     that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
     to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In closed societies, factories making fertilizer,
     pharmaceuticals, or plastics can easily cover up their production
     of chemical weapons. After receiving notification of a challenge,
     a facility has six days to hide the evidence before inspectors
     are admitted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Small amounts of concealed chemical weapons can be militarily
     very significant. Used against critical military targets,
     chemical weapons can have dramatic consequences.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     To paraphrase a popular bumper strip, when chemical weapons are
     outlawed, only outlaw governments will have chemical weapons. Our
     World War II experience shows that the best way for civilized
     countries to prevent the use of chemical weapons is for the good
     guys to have their own deterrent arsenals of chemical weapons.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In any event, the Senate must not make matters worse by ratifying
     the unenforceable, costly, and probably unconstitutional CWC.

           Self-Appointed Monitors Of Corporate Responsibility
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The CEO of Cypress in Silicon Valley has just issued an
          eloquent put-down of the social-responsibility
          busybodies who are trying to intimidate corporations
          into selecting their boards of directors on the basis
          of racial and gender diversity. T.J. Rodgers wrote a
          letter to the Sisters of St. Francis in Philadelphia
          who had used their ownership of a little Cypress stock
          to engage in leftwing mischief-making.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Far from being put on the defensive by having a convent
          of nuns lecture him on corporate responsibility,
          Rodgers rejected their arguments as "not only unsound,
          but even immoral." He admonished them that Cypress's
          board of directors "is not a ceremonial watchdog, but a
          critical management function."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress's directors need to have experience as a CEO of
          an important technology company and direct expertise in
          the semiconductor business based on education (usually
          with a Master's degree in engineering science) and
          management experience. Contrary to the nuns' argument,
          Rodgers explained that "a woman's view on how to run
          our semiconductor company does not help us, unless that
          woman has an advanced technical degree and experience
          as a CEO."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Sounds like common sense, doesn't it. "I believe," he
          said, "that placing arbitrary racial or gender quotas
          on corporate boards is fundamentally wrong."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The nuns had tried to lay a guilt trip on Cypress by
          suggesting that it lacks corporate "morality" and
          Christianity by failing to appoint a board of directors
          with "equality of sexes, races, and ethnic groups."
          Rodgers didn't hedge in his response. "I am unaware,"
          he said, "of any Christian requirements for corporate
          boards; your views seem more accurately described as
          `politically correct,' than `Christian.' "
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
         Then, Rodgers went on to argue that the nuns'
          presumptuous requirements for corporate boards are
          "immoral," which he defined as "causing harm to
          people." He pointed out how all the retirees whose
          pension funds invest in Cypress would suffer if Cypress
          were run on anything other than a profit-making basis.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The letter from the nuns was so sanctimonious that it
          did not allow for any possibility that a CEO could be
          moral if he disagreed with their position. I found
          myself cheering when Rodgers told the sisters to "get
          down from your moral high horse."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress employees in San Jose averaged $78,741 in
          salary and benefits in 1995. All are Cypress
          shareholders, have a first-rate health-care plan,
          profit-sharing, and other goodies such as gifts of
          personal computers and employee education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rogers reiterated that "choosing a board of directors
          based on race and gender is a lousy way to run a
          company. We will never be pressured into it. We simply
          cannot allow arbitrary rules to be forced on us by
          organizations that lack business expertise."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers obviously warmed up to the challenge of do-good
          busybodyism. "The political pressure to be what is
          euphemized as a `responsible corporation' today," he
          said, "is so great that it literally threatens the well
          being of every American."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers listed some of the other special-interest
          groups that are harassing corporations about their pet
          issues. These include the complaints that corporations
          are not sufficiently "environmentally conscious," that
          they do business with certain countries, or supply the
          Armed Forces, or pay their CEO too much, or give to
          certain charities.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers cited a Fortune magazine report showing that
          the so-called "ethical mutual funds" that invest
          according to a social-issues agenda, which control $639
          billion in investments, produced an 18.2 percent return
          in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 returned 27.2
          percent. Thus, the investors in the "ethical funds"
          lost 9 percent of $639 billion, or $57.5 billion in one
          year, because they invested on a social-issues basis!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers lashed out at the current election-year frenzy
          in Washington to institutionalize the so-called
          "corporate responsibility" concepts promoted by Labor
          Secretary Robert Reich and Senators Ted Kennedy, Jeff
          Bingaman and Tom Daschle. Their proposals "provoke fear
          and anger against America's business," and are
          fundamentally wrong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          One Bingaman-Daschle proposal would grant a low federal
          tax rate of 11 percent to "responsible corporations,"
          i.e., companies that limit the pay of their CEO to no
          more than 50 times the company's lowest-paid employee.
          Such a rule would limit the pay of the CEO of the
          world's most important semiconductor company (Intel) to
          less than that of a second-string quarterback in the
          NFL.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Commenting on the double standards of the "leftist, out
          of touch with reality" Senators, Rodgers asked, "How
          long will it be before Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and
          Daschle hold hearings on the `irresponsible
          corporations' that pay tens of millions of dollars to
          professional athletes? Or are athletes a `protected
          group,' leaving CEOs as their sole target?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers concluded by stating that he stands for
          "personal and economic freedom, for free minds and free
          markets, a position irrevocably in opposition to the
          immoral attempt by coercive utopians to mandate even
          more government control over America's economy." May
          his tribe increase, and may his forthright statement
          embolden other CEOs to speak up, too.

Whatever Happened To Competition in School?
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     When it comes to the Olympic Games, everyone seems to understand
     that competition produces the winners and the record-breakers.
     It's unlikely that the athletes could reach such heights of
     achievement and endurance if they were not competing against
     other athletes who are closely matched in skills and putting
     forth their very best.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some people, however, are at war against the whole concept of
     competition. They think it is undemocratic, unfair, and elitist.
     It's a sign of the times that, in Cecil County, Maryland,
     basketball is now played by some very unusual rules.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If one basketball team is ten points ahead of the other,
     additional baskets don't count until the underdog team catches
     up. No record is kept of who scores how many baskets, so no
     player can ever be recognized as the star of the team.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     This system should be called Outcome-Based Basketball because
     it's just like the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) that has spread
     through our public schools like a contagious disease. OBE is
     sometimes called Performance-Based Education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE's advocates mouth the mantra "self-esteem." Since the lack of
     self-esteem is postulated to be the cause of all social ills
     (crime, illegal drugs, teenage pregnancies, AIDS, and low SAT
     scores), OBE's primary goal is to inculcate self-esteem.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     There is no evidence that lack of self-esteem causes those
     problems, nor is there any evidence that having self-esteem
     causes students to score better in academic subjects. At best,
     teaching self-esteem is a waste of precious classroom time and,
     at worst, it's teaching the wrong lesson that it's okay to feel
     good about doing poorly in school.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Self-esteem should be the reward that comes from achievement and
     hard work. It should be earned. But lack of evidence doesn't slow
     down the self-esteem peddlers because this mantra advances their
     goal of eliminating all competition from the school experience.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Outcome-Based Education has been properly labelled a dumbing-down
     of public school education. But it's even worse than reducing the
     amount of knowledge covered and failing to teach essential skills
     such as reading.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    The combination of OBE and self-esteem eliminates competition as
     a learning mechanism. This destroys the students' incentive to be
     the best they can be, and it destroys the school's accountability
     because parents have no way to measure what their children are
     doing.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In an OBE school, the traditional A, B, C, D and F are replaced
     by letters that are meaningless in terms of specific academic
     achievement, such as S for Satisfactory (sometimes it just means
     Sometimes) or G for Growth. William Glasser's 1969 book "Schools
     Without Failure" led the charge against traditional grades.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Glasser also argued that giving homework is unfair and elitist
     because A and B students usually do their homework, whereas poor
     students don't, thus widening the gap between those who succeed
     and those who fail in school. He even opposed objective tests
     because they require students to give correct answers, in
     contrast to tests that ask questions for which there are no right
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The anti-competition movement is galloping across America.
     Schools are getting rid of their honor roll, honors courses,
     class rankings, academic prizes, and even valedictorians.
     Spelling bees are out. If fact, even correct spelling is out;
     it's replaced by inventive spelling (so students can spell words
     any way they want).
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Ability grouping, or tracking, is forbidden as elitist,
     undemocratic, or even racist. Pity the poor teacher who has to
     present a single course of study to eighth graders whose reading
     ability ranges from the second to the twelfth grades. This
     problem is getting worse with the mainstreaming of the learning
     disabled.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE does not allow any student to progress faster or farther than
     the slowest child in the class. This system conceals the fact
     that some children aren't learning much of anything.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     What is the teacher to do with the faster learners after they
     complete the assigned material? They are required to do peer
     tutoring (trying to tutor the slower pupils) or "horizontal
     enrichment." The former is a frustration for all students, and
     the latter is busywork.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Cooperative Learning, in which students receive a group grade, is
     another means of concealing who does the assignment accurately
     and who goofs off. The brighter students soon learn that their
     effort is not rewarded, and the slower students learn that
     there's no reason to try because someone will given them the
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The testing system has been corrupted. Not only do all students
     score "above average" (a marvel of statistical fakery), but many
     tests are peppered with questions that ask for non-objective
     responses about feelings, attitudes or predictions, or which have
     a built-in bias toward Political Correctness.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The response to the dramatic decline in SAT scores over the last
     two decades has resulted, not in toughening the curriculum, but
     in raising every student's score 100 points, so now students get
     perfect scores even if they have some wrong answers. This is one
     more way of concealing the distinction between average and
     above-average students.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Competition needs to be restored if schools are to prepare
     students for life. Children should learn early that life is
     competition, and the rewards go to those who work hard, persevere
     and achieve.

Phonics Boom
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It's many years overdue, but the scandal of widespread illiteracy
     has finally become a topic of general discussion and debate, from
     local newspapers to network TV news. Americans are at last being
     told the tragic fact that the public schools are failing to teach
     children how to read.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Our largest and trendiest state suddenly forced the facts of
     illiteracy into the national news stream. California came in last
     in national fourth-grade reading tests, set up a state task force
     to find out why, held legislative hearings, discovered that the
     state's Whole Language method is a disaster, and earmarked $100
     million for new textbooks and teacher training to switch the
     schools back to phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In order to receive their share of the money, schools will have
     to give students "systematic explicit phonics instruction, with
     phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relationships, and decoding."
     Governor Pete Wilson is even requiring that school districts
     spend their federal Goals 2000 money on reading instruction.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, was blunt. "Whole Language was an
     utter failure. Our curriculum taught to kindergarten to
     third-graders, quite frankly, stinks."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Whole Language system teaches children to guess at words by
     looking at the pictures on the page, to memorize a few dozen
     frequently used words, to skip over words they don't know, to
     substitute words that seem to fit, and to predict the words they
     think will come next. The child who is taught those bad habits,
     instead of how to sound out the syllables, will never be able to
     read big words or become a good reader.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many schools give high grades and happy report cards to children
     who are good at guessing and memorizing words, so parents don't
     realize that their children are being taught to guess instead of
     to read. Self-esteem is a higher priority than literacy.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A federal agency called the National Assessment of Educational
     Progress (NAEP) publishes what is called the Reading Report Card
     for the Nation and the States. Its recently released report on
     the 1994 test given to 140,000 students in grades 4, 8 and 12 in
     public and private schools proves that schoolchildren's reading
     skills are not only bad, but are getting worse.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Comparing 1992 and 1994, the NAEP results show a significant
     decline in the percentage of students scoring at or above the
     "proficient level" and at or above the "basic level," and a
     significant increase in the percentage of pupils performing below
     the "basic level." The NAEP tests also show a lack of any
     positive results from the expensive federal Title I program for
     the disadvantaged.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     How did it happen that the entire public school system abandoned
     phonics and substituted a guessing system? It's rather easy to
     date and track the Whole Language system from its official
     adoption by the state of California in 1987, because California
     is a model for other states that want to be "progressive."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     But Whole Language was not a new idea in 1987; it was just a new
     name for the system that was already in widespread use called
     "whole word" or "look-and-say." The mystery as to how that stupid
     system swept the country, starting in the late 1930s, was
     revealed in a report aired the first week of June on National
     Public Radio.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     "Look-and-say" came to dominate the schools as a result of a
     sophisticated marketing plan carried out by Scott Foresman, the
     publishers of the "Dick and Jane" series of elementary school
     readers. Scott Foresman sent slick salesmen to every school
     district to demonstrate how easily children could be taught to
     "read" the inane "See Dick run" stories that had color
     illustrations of Dick, Jane and Spot (the dog) doing whatever the
     one-syllable words described.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     By the 1950s, the Dick and Jane readers were, as Newsweek now
     tells us, "ubiquitous." Rudolf Flesch's 1955 landmark book, "Why
     Johnny Can't Read," fully exposed the fact that this system is a
     cheat on everyone.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The typical first-grader already knows the meaning of thousands
     of big words, such as hamburger, basketball, birthday,
     toothbrush, and even hippopotamus and Philadelphia. But the child
     will not be able to read those words unless he is taught the
     skill of sounding out the syllables. That's what we call phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    It is encouraging to see that California is making a massive
     attempt to abandon the failed Whole Language system and switch to
     the proven method of phonics. But changing the educational system
     today will be like trying to change the course of an aircraft
     carrier with a rowboat.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Parents who want to make sure that their children are not
     handicapped by the dumbed-down methods used in most public
     schools today should assume the task of teaching their own
     children how to read. It's easy to do if you use intensive,
     systematic phonics. I did it with my six children, and I urge all
     parents to do likewise.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Reject MFN For Communist China  -- 6/6/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>June 6, 1996</i><h2>                        
Reject MFN For Communist China
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bill Clinton's policy of cozying up to Communist China by
     granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is in shambles. The
     question of the moment is, will Bob Dole let Clinton dangle on
     the limb of his own mistake or save him from embarrassment by
     agreeing with this shameful policy?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It was all so inconvenient. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
     Firearms (otherwise known as BATF, the agency that played a fatal
     game of cops and robbers against Americans at Waco and Ruby
     Ridge) finally did something useful. They arrested Chinese
     Communist agents for smuggling 2,000 AK-47 automatic assault
     rifles into the United States.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Clinton Administration has such peculiar biases. The
     Administration engaged in hear-no-evil, see-no-evil as long as
     the Chinese Communists merely forced women to undergo late-term
     abortions, locked up citizens who dared to speak out for freedom,
     stole billions (not just millions) of dollars worth of U.S.
     intellectual property, thumbed their noses at signed trade
     agreements, and sold our weapons technology to rogue dictators.
     But when China violated our gun-control laws, that was just too
     much for the liberals!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The BATF arrest of seven persons in the San Francisco Bay area
     stopped a very profitable Chinese business of selling weapons at
     a 400 percent mark-up to U.S. big-city gangs that want to wipe
     out their rivals. It was a sophisticated worldwide operation that
     must have enjoyed the complicity of the Chinese government.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Those arrested have direct links to China's Defense Ministry and
     Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law. To conceal the source of the weapons,
     the money was laundered through Beijing's state-run bank in Hong
     Kong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In the 18-month U.S. sting operation, the Chinese discussed with
     our undercover agents the future sale of explosives, anti-tank
     rockets, and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft systems capable of
     knocking planes out of the sky. One Chinese boasted he could
     bring 300,000 AK-47s into the U.S.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Selling all kinds of weapons is big business for Communist China.
     It has sold missiles to Iran and nuclear reactor technology and
     materials to make enriched uranium to Pakistan.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China's expanding economy is financed by a $34 billion trade
     surplus with the United States that has cost Americans 700,000
     jobs. This trade surplus is partially based on stealing our
     products (computer software, video films, musical recordings,
     compact disks, other intellectual property, books, etc.) instead
     of buying them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Pirated CDs and CD-ROMs are made in China in an estimated 31
     government-licensed plants. China itself can use only about two
     percent of the CDs produced, so the rest go into the
     international market and cheat U.S. companies out of sales.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China signed an agreement to stop this theft in February 1995,
     but nothing has changed. China simply thumbs its nose at the
     whole concept of copyrights and trademarks.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China has made so much money from U.S. trade that it is now
     trying to buy SS-18 strategic missiles, components and technology
     from Russia or Ukraine. For those who've forgotten our worries of
     the Cold War, the SS-18s are the biggies that can reach the
     United States from a launch on the other side of the world.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China continues to persecute Tibet, use slave labor to produce
     goods for export, and show contempt toward any self-government
     for Hong Kong. China tried to threaten Taiwan's democratic
     election process by firing rockets at the island.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     U.S. big businesses, which want MFN because they lust after
     so-called "free trade" with China, should wake up and taste the
     chop suey that China served the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
     Douglas pursued China's aviation market with the passion and
     naivete of a teenage suitor, but ended up (in the word of one
     Douglas executive) being "betrayed."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Over a costly 15-year courtship, Douglas gave China 80 years of
     accumulated aircraft-manufacturing experience. That was the
     largest technology transfer in history. Douglas taught China how
     to build commercial planes, trained Chinese engineers, and even
     turned over powerful weapons-producing technology.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Like classic con men, Chinese officials schmoozed Douglas by
     dangling the prospect of multi-billion-dollar aircraft purchases.
     Then China turned around and gave its juicy contract to Europe's
     Airbus.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Hypocrisy about the demands for MFN status has reached new
     heights on both sides. In America, the internationalist claque
     that continually calls for "free trade" ignores the fact that
     China has slapped a 30 percent tariff on goods it imports from
     the United States. In China, the ruling clique threatens to
     "punish" U.S. companies if we dare to criticize the $2 billion
     piracy of our intellectual property.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It is ridiculous to allow Communist China to enjoy the same
     trading privileges with the United States markets that friendly
     countries have. Congress should reject Most Favored Nation status
     for Communist China, and Bob Dole should show leadership in
     calling for that rejection.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed  -- 5/30/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>May 30, 1996</i><h2>                        
Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed

</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The school establishment has suddenly discovered a bill that
     passed the House last year and is pending in the Senate which may
     interfere with plans to build files of personal information on
     public school pupils and their families. The Family Privacy
     Protection Act was noncontroversial when it sailed through the
     House by 417 to 7, but the school establishment has gone into
     panic and sounded phony alarms over a whole page of the May 19
     New York Times.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Designed to protect pupil and family privacy, the bill is
     straightforward in stating that schools may not, without prior
     written parental consent, ask minors to answer questionnaires
     about political affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological
     problems, sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or
     self-incriminating behavior, appraisals of other family members,
     or religious affiliations or beliefs.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     That's a reasonable rule because the schools have no business
     eliciting that kind of personal or family information from
     students. But in an era when schools assert their right, without
     parental knowledge or consent, to pass out condoms and to force
     little girls to undress and undergo intrusive genital
     examinations, it looks like the schools want to reject all
     accountability to parents.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The hysteria of the school establishment against this bill is
     encapsuled in the lead sentence in the New York Times news
     article: "Research into illegal drug use by American adolescents
     could be stifled by legislation pending in Congress." This is
     followed by quotations from several Ph.D.s ominously predicting
     that the bill "will leave us conducting the war on drugs largely
     in the dark."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     One of these Ph.D.s who is crying around about how the law would
     "cripple" his surveys of schoolchildren, said sarcastically, "We
     also couldn't find out whether they believe in God, which some
     people think is important." Pardon me, but I don't believe he
     should be allowed to ask public schoolchildren whether or not
     they believe in God. Where is the ACLU when we need it?
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires in the
     public school classroom started in the mid-1970s and resulted in
     the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment in
     1978, sponsored by former university president and Senator Sam
     Hayakawa. The public school establishment was powerful enough to
     prevent regulations from being written until President Ronald
     Reagan demanded them in 1984.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     National Education Association agents in the Department of
     Education and public school administrators nationwide circled the
     wagons against this law. Despite egregious violations, it has
     never been enforced.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which has
     been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th, 9th
     and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents were up in arms about
     it, not only because it was privacy-invading, but also because it
     assumed that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal
     tendencies are normal teenage behavior.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Another serious objection was that it encouraged pupils to inform
     on their parents. That sort of interrogation of children should
     not be tolerated in a free society. Here's a typical question:
     "Has drinking by any family member repeatedly caused family,
     health, job or legal problems? If yes, who? (Mark all that
     apply.) Parent who lives with me, Parent who doesn't live with
     me, Brother or sister, Other relative, Other person who lives
     with me." Here's another: "Has drug use by any family member
     repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems? If yes,
     who? (Mark all that apply.)" The same options are offered.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of teenagers
     are using illegal drugs. "If you use marijuana, how old were you
     when you started? If you use any other drug, how old were you
     when you started? How often do you get drunk?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions interrogated the child about his religion. "How
     often do you attend religious services?" "How important is
     religion in your life?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions would be downright traumatic for some children.
     "Have you ever tried to kill yourself?" "How often have you run
     away from home?" "Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that
     you wondered if anything was worthwhile?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the survey included lots of Peeping Tom sex questions.
     "Have you ever had sexual intercourse (gone all the way)? If you
     have sexual intercourse, how often do you and/or your partner use
     any birth control method? Have you been pregnant?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The public schools have no business requiring children to answer
     any of these nosy questions without prior written parental
     consent. To assert that restricting these surveys will hamper our
     "war on drugs" is ridiculous.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The purpose of the pending legislation is to extend the scope of
     the law to all surveys and questionnaires that are federally
     funded, not merely those funded by the Department of Education,
     and also to remove some vague language that has enabled the
     public schools to circumvent the law for the past ten years.
     Senators should say ho-hum to the hysteria of those who might be
     restrained from asking children about matters that are none of
     their business.

What's Going On With Bob Dole's Friends? 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Why are the so-called Republican moderates undermining Bob Dole's 
     presidential candidacy? Doesn't he have enough problems without 
     his friends planting mines on his road to the White House? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     First, Governors Christine Whitman and Pete Wilson gave cover to 
     Bill Clinton on his veto of the partial birth abortion ban, which 
     was overwhelmingly passed by Congress (with support from Bob 
     Dole) and was building to become a major Republican campaign 
     issue. When Whitman and Wilson said on national television that 
     they support Clinton's veto, they destroyed effective campaign 
     use of this issue by Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Whatever one thinks about the abortion issue, this support of 
     Clinton by two prominent Dole supporters was completely 
     unnecessary and grossly unhelpful to his campaign. Dole had just 
     honored Whitman by naming her one of the two temporary chairmen 
     of the Republican National Convention. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Secondly, we saw the incredible undermining of Bob Dole by his 
     longtime friend and fellow Kansan, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, as 
     well as the other moderates, Senators John Chafee, Slade Gorton, 
     Mark Hatfield, and even Kit Bond. What they did was to join the 
     Democrats on a motion (that passed 52-46) to remove Medical 
     Savings Accounts (MSAs) from Senator Dole's leadership amendment 
     to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     MSAs are not only sound policy and very popular, but they are 
     supported by Bob Dole. They help to define the difference between 
     the parties: Republicans support MSAs because they promote choice 
     in doctors and treatment, portability and affordability, while 
     the Democrats oppose them with dishonest class-warfare rhetoric. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Above and beyond the substance of the MSA argument, the Democrats 
     clearly recognized this vote as a crucial Clinton vs. Dole 
     political confrontation. Every single Democrat voted against MSAs 
     and Vice President Al Gore was rushed to the Senate Chamber in 
     case he was needed to break a tie vote. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The rejection of MSAs in the Senate bill was a rejection of Bob 
     Dole's leadership. When Dole has friends like this, he doesn't 
     need any enemies. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Third, Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed signaled his 
     willingness to accept a rewriting of the Republican Platform 
     plank on abortion. He gave talkative interviews that resulted in 
     front-page news stories in the New York Times for three days 
     running. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed may have been trying to help Bob Dole by putting the 
     Christian Coalition's imprimatur on a move long demanded by the 
     moderates, namely, the removal of or watering down of the pro- 
     life plank in the Republican Platform. But his contradictory 
     statements (such as denying that he is trying to rewrite the 
     platform language and the same week releasing a new book that 
     specifically presents new platform language) have the effect of 
     encouraging the pro-choicers to keep the political pot boiling in 
     the media and then push for a prime-time floor fight at the 
     Republican National Convention in San Diego. That is decidedly 
     not helpful to Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's proposed new platform language uses the word 
     "constitutional" in a slippery and deceptive way. Instead of 
     calling for constitutional protection for the unborn and/or 
     overturning Roe v. Wade, he suggests using "legal and 
     constitutional means to protect the right to life." Under this 
     language, all actions would have to be in conformity with Roe v. 
     Wade. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's new book, excerpted this week in Newsweek, also lectures 
     religious conservatives to "shun harsh language" in "Clinton- 
     bashing." That's strange advice in this presidential campaign in 
     which the Democrats are already conducting a no-holds-barred 
     media advertising campaign of Republican-bashing. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed is widely credited with clinching the nomination of Bob Dole 
     by using Christian Coalition troops to carry Iowa and 
     particularly South Carolina for Dole. But he's not helping Dole 
     now by fracturing the constituency that Dole desperately needs to 
     be elected. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Fourth, in a Sunday television appearance, one of Bob Dole's 
     closest associates, Senator Al D'Amato, aimed daggers at Newt 
     Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, accusing the former of setting the 
     wrong agenda for the 104th Congress and the latter of being a 
     "philosophical ayatollah." That is hardly the way to unite the 
     party and encourage broad-based support of Bob Dole, and an 
     experienced politician like D'Amato must know this. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Finally, Bill Kristol has weighed in with the argument that Bob 
     Dole can't win. That's one of the most hurtful slogans that can 
     be hung around the neck of any candidate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     What's going on? Why are the people who were once so determined 
     that Dole be the Republican presidential candidate now sniping at 
     him?

<h2>
The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

.html">
Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<p><BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the most obnoxious features of the Clinton health care
plan (which died the death of a thousand cuts in 1994) was its
creation of a long list of new federal "Health Care Crimes." 
It now appears that the Republicans, in their eagerness to
manifest their total capitulation to President Clinton, have
included an equally obnoxious crime section in their so-called
Health Reform bill (H.R.3160).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Somehow this section (Title II), which parallels the discredited
and (we thought) defunct Clinton bill, was passed by the House
without anybody discovering its far-reaching ramifications. 
Then, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), read the bill and
discovered that much of this health crime section was copied from
the Clinton bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AAPS is the organization whose lawsuit against Hillary Rodham
Clinton forced her to comply with federal law and make the
records of her Health Care Task Force public.  After two years of
litigation, Hillary's lawyers had to admit that they had lied to
the court in asserting that all members of the Task Force were
federal employees when, in fact, the Task Force included outside
special-interest groups with a direct financial interest in
passing the Clinton health care bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republican Health Reform bill (H.R. 3160) criminalizes what
are called "federal health care offenses."  The definition is
excruciatingly broad:  a violation or conspiracy that involves
"any public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce,
under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to
any individual."  "No proof of specific intent to defraud is
required."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill specifies monetary penalties of "up to $10,000 for each
instance" of "failure to comply with statutory obligations,"
for "incorrect coding," or for providing "a medical or other
item or service that a person knows or should know is not
medically necessary."  Big Brother will decide what health
services are "necessary."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new crime of "health care fraud" carries fines plus
imprisonment of up to ten years.  "If the violation results in
serious bodily injury," imprisonment can be up to 20 years, and
if death results it can be "for any term of years or for life."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A person who "intentionally misapplies" any assets of a health
care benefit program "shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; but if the value of
such property does not exceed the value of $100 the defendant
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Did you get that?  If you misapply a benefit that has a value of
less than $100, you can spend one year in prison and be fined,
too.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Whoever" makes a false statement to a health care plan is
liable to a five-year prison term.  "Whoever" can mean anybody,
patient or provider.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In any investigation relating to any act or activity involving
a Federal health care offense, . . . [the Attorney General] may
require the production of any records that may be relevant." 
The Republicans' passion to turn over more and more power to
Janet Reno (which started with the Anti-Terrorism bill) is a
curiosity to behold.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Failure to provide health information, "oral or recorded in any
form or medium," to a criminal investigator from any government
agency carries a five-year prison term.  Information extracted
under this provision can be used against the patient if "the
action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to
the receipt of health care or payment for health care.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill's exotic forfeiture provisions put health care offenses
on a par with racketeering and drug dealing, and are actually
broader than under the Clinton bill.  "The court, in imposing
sentence on a person convicted of a Federal health care offense,
shall order the person to forfeit property, real or personal,
that constitutes or is derived, directly or indirectly, from
gross proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill requires the Federal Government to "establish a
national health care fraud and abuse data collection program"
and specifies that "the information in this database shall be
available to Federal and State government agencies and health
plans" pursuant to any procedures set by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (that's Donna Shalala).  This will empower the
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal Government to use medical records to prosecute almost
anybody.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These provisions mean the end of patient privacy and
confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.  Dr.
Orient asserts that they lay the foundation for forcing all
medical professionals to submit electronic information on every
medical encounter to a central computer, a practice that is
already required by a new Maryland law that takes effect this
July.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Maryland law will require all health care professionals to
disclose to the government the details of every patient
encounter, including diagnosis, test results, therapy, charges,
and 32 pieces of demographic data on every patient.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only Republican part of the Health Reform bill is the section
on Medical Savings Accounts.  The rest of it is ClintonCare.  So,
why are the Republicans fronting for Bill Clinton and Ted
Kennedy?

<h2> 
Books About What's Going On At Colleges 
</h2> 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a> 
 
<P> 
Those who just learned about the dumbing down of our best colleges from the slashing  
report of the National Association of Scholars should do their homework by reading some  
of the excellent books written during the last several years.  Allan Bloom's "The Closing  
of the American Mind" was a trailblazer, but it was followed by several more informative  
books that failed to attract the attention they deserve. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Impostors in the Temple" (Simon & Schuster, 1992) is what Martin Anderson, a former  
Columbia University professor and now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, calls  
many of our nation's academic intellectuals -- that is, people who pretend to teach and  
pretend to do original, important work, but actually do neither.  He says that "the death of  
integrity in the heart of higher education is the root cause of the educational troubles  
which afflict us today." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. Anderson helps us to understand how it all happened at Stanford, one of the nation's  
most prestigious universities.  He describes how Stanford bilked the federal taxpayers out  
of millions of dollars and played a big role in the Political Correctness movement. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. George Roche, president of Hillsdale College, demonstrates in "The Fall of the Ivory  
Tower" (Regnery, 1994) how the easy availability of federal money channeled to colleges  
and universities has corrupted our entire educational system.  He sets forth chapter and  
verse of why and how this is so. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The flow of taxpayers' money has resulted in a large percentage of students being  
admitted to college who have no business being there at all because they are academically  
or emotionally unprepared.  The high rate of default on student loans is a national  
scandal. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One of America's most distinguished scholars, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,  
Thomas Sowell gives us a realistic look at the decline, the deception and the false dogmas  
of the U.S. educational system, which he charges is morally and intellectually bankrupt.   
In "Inside American Education" (Free Press, 1993), he exposes the ideological  
indoctrination and double standards about behavior and race practiced at the leading  
universities. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sowell says that they have presumed to be the conscience of society, while shamelessly  
exploiting college athletes, overcharging the government, organizing price-fixing cartels,  
and abandoning the teaching of undergraduates to student assistants while the tenured  
faculty pursue personal prestige. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Charles Sykes, author of "ProfScam:  Professors and the Demise of Higher Education"  
(St. Martin's Press, 1989), presents a devastating indictment of U.S. universities, which  
he calls vast citadels of waste, ruled with an iron hand by an oligarchy of arrogant,  
tenured professors who are overpaid and underworked. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes names specific universities, professors, dates and places, and asserts that a  
university education is a scam which cheats students, parents, and taxpayers.  He says the  
universities offer more and more courses of less and less importance, including a plethora  
of junk courses referred to by students as "guts" (slang for a course that can be passed  
with no more preparation than gut instinct). 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here are some examples he cites:  Anthropology of Play, Socio-Psychological Aspects of  
Clothing, Music Video 454, Sport and Political Ideology, Recreation and Leisure, Pocket  
Billiards, and Rock `n' Roll Is Here To Stay. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In his second book, "The Hollow Men -- Politics and Corruption in Higher Education"  
(Regnery Gateway, 1990), Charles Sykes explains the politicization of the college  
courses.  He tells how race, gender and class have been enshrined as the looking glasses  
through which all subject matter must be seen if one is to survive in academia. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes explains how colleges have gone overboard with institutionalized affirmative  
action, sensitivity training, and anti-free speech codes.  The second half of the book is  
devoted to a case study of Dartmouth College, which became a prime example of the  
intolerance of those who preach "diversity." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Tenured Radicals" (Harper & Row, 1990) is the expression Roger Kimball uses to  
discuss the radical politics of many in academia. His main focus is on the absurdity of  
what passes for scholarship on the campuses, and he describes the unintelligible jargon,  
or "ProfSpeak," which passes for erudition in the academic world. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Kimball explains the deconstructionist movement, which he calls a hoax perpetrated by  
academics in order to create more possibilities for papers, symposiums, specialized  
classes, and university teaching positions. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In "The Closing of the American Heart" (Probe Books, 1990),Ronald H. Nash describes  
how the decline of moral and religious standards over the past 25 years has contributed to  
the collapse of the nation's educational standards.  He charges that moral illiteracy is  
reflected and taught in academia through relativism, positivism, and humanism. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dinesh D'Souza, in "Illiberal Education:  The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus" (Free  
Press, 1991), explains Political Correctness (P.C.) on college campuses.  He shows how  
P.C. produces closed-mindedness and intolerance, which is to say an "illiberal  
education."  He explains how Political Correctness opposes the teaching of Western  
Civilization and demands that professors give their first attention to race and gender  
issues.

LAS ESCUELAS PUBLICAS REQUIEREN COMPETENCIA
</H2>
Gary S. Becker*
<br>
<p>
CHICAGO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Durante la reciente campaa presidencial, Bill Clinton y
Bob Dole estuvieron de acuerdo en que el sistema de educacin pblica no
est cumpliendo con las necesidades educacionales de los nios pobres y de
clase media. Pero mientras que el Sr. Dole opina que la solucin est en
darles vales o becas a estudiantes para que vayan a escuelas privadas, el
presidente acepta la posicin de quienes se oponen a los vales, argumentando
que la competencia debilitara a la educacin pblica.
<P>
 Yo creo, por el contrario, que la competencia mejorara en vez de empeorar
la educacin pblica. Los opositores mantienen que a travs de los vales y
de becas los colegios privados captaran a la crema, a los mejores y ms
ambiciosos estudiantes. Como resultado, las escuelas pblicas se quedaran
con los indisciplinados, los desinteresados y los mentalmente atrasados. Sin
embargo, tal escenario asume que las escuelas pblicas no mejoraran con la
competencia.
<P>
 Hasta ahora, los colegios privados compiten con un brazo atado a la
espalda, por los subsidios de los contribuyentes que reciben las escuelas
pblicas. Un sistema de vales, bajo el cual los padres puedan seleccionar la
mejor escuela para sus hijos, aplicara una presin competitiva a las
escuelas pblicas, promoviendo el cambio.
<P>
 La causa del mal desempeo de la educacin pblica no tiene nada que ver
con insuficiencia de fondos, ya que los gastos por estudiante -en trminos
reales- se ha duplicado durante los ltimos 30 aos. A nivel nacional, el
costo por estudiante en escuelas pblicas es de $5.000 al ao y en muchas
ciudades alcanza $9.000 y hasta $11.000. El desalentador historial de las
escuelas pblicas generalmente es por su mala seleccin de cursos, falta de
seguridad personal y poca disciplina, lo cual desincentiva todo esfuerzo por
aprender. El sector privado atraera estudiantes ofreciendo mejores
programas de estudio, incluyendo insistencia en tareas, disciplina y
participacin de los padres, todo lo cual tiene gran atractivo para las
familias.
<P>
 Ya que la mayora de los maestros y administradores de las escuelas
pblicas estn dedicados a la enseanza, tratarn de reformar el sistema al
haber evidencia de que el sector privado est atrayendo a sus estudiantes
con los vales. Y si las escuelas pblicas son lentas en cambiar y continan
perdiendo alumnos habr gran presin poltica para que respondan a la
competencia: les reducirn los presupuestos y se despedirn los directores y
administradores que no logren competir.
<P>
 Federal Express y UPS mejoraron considerablemente el sistema de correos de
este pas al introducir un servicio rpido y confiable. Aunque el correo
perdi en la competencia de entregas de paquetes por ser el servicio privado
mucho mejor, a su vez mejor su servicio en respuesta a la demanda del pblico.
<P>
 La economista de Harvard Minster Hoxby encuentra que la competencia de
escuelas parroquiales mejora la educacin pblica del distrito. Todos los
estudiantes mejoran y no hay evidencia de que los colegios catlicos se
quedan con los mejores estudiantes.
<P>
 Muchos estudiantes extranjeros viajan desde  muy lejos para asistir a
universidades estadounidenses por su excelencia. La competencia que hay
entre miles de universidades mantiene despierto a profesores y administradores.
<P>
 El primer programa de becas universitarias para los veteranos de la II
Guerra le dio a muchos una oportunidad que de otra manera no hubieran
tenido. Ese programa mejor radicalmente la educacin superior, al aumentar
drsticamente la competencia por estudiantes. Los veteranos podan usar sus
becas para asistir a universidades privadas o pblicas que los aceptaran.
Esos fondos balancearon los subsidios recibidos por las universidades
estatales, forzndolas a mejorar para poder competir.
<P>
 Becas y vales para nios de los barrios pobres los ayudara en la misma
forma en que se beneficiaron los veteranos de la guerra. Entonces gozaran
de una mayor seleccin de opciones educativas y no estaran obligados a
recibir una educacin mediocre ofrecida por un monopolio estatal.
<P>
 Aun con un sistema de vales, muchos estudiantes -incluyendo lo muy buenos-
permaneceran en escuelas pblicas si estas mejoraran. Y sin duda mejorarn
si tienen que enfrentar la competencia del sector privado.

MEXICO: LA REVOLUCION ECONOMICA POSIBLE
</H2>
Roberto Blum*
<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Proponer que la economa mexicana crezca a una
tasa de 5% anual, cubriendo la demanda de empleo de apenas un milln de
mexicanos al ao, es una muestra de, por lo menos, falta de imaginacin. Los
datos oficiales sealan que el empleo informal lleg al 21,7% de la
poblacin econmicamente activa, unos 8 millones de mexicanos.  Pero son
unos 20 millones los mexicanos que estn desempleados o que trabajan en la
economa informal. Estos requieren hoy un empleo productivo en la economa
formal. Un crecimiento a tasas tan mediocres como plantean los planes
oficiales es inaceptable.  
<P>
                Los "tigres y dragones," pases asiticos con crecimientos
sostenidos cercanos a 10% durante dcadas, lo lograron gracias a la
capacidad de sus gobiernos de movilizar a esas sociedades en torno a un
objetivo de crecimiento acelerado que produjo resultados tangibles en el
bienestar de las familias y de los individuos. Los gobiernos incentivaron la
disciplina y el esfuerzo, lo cual de inmediato se tradujo en beneficios
substanciales en el nivel de vida. 
<P>
                En Singapur hoy, 30 aos despus, casi todos los ciudadanos
son propietarios de su vivienda y han alcanzado niveles de bienestar
semejantes a los de Europa Occidental. China, con 1.200 millones de
habitantes, lleva ms de 15 aos creciendo a tasas verdaderamente
increbles. Hay regiones tan pobladas como Mxico que crecen al 25% anual.
Su secreto fue permitir que el esfuerzo realizado por cada campesino, por
cada obrero, por cada empresario lo beneficie directamente a l y a su
familia.  Las reformas del agro chino de 1978 se tradujeron en tangible
bienestar para las familias a partir de ese mismo ao.  Slo de esa manera,
los gobiernos pueden contar con la confianza de sus pueblos.
<P>
                En Mxico, el gobierno del presidente Zedillo est logrando
estabilizar la economa. Sin duda esto es muy importante, pero no es
suficiente. Si crecemos en los programas minimalistas del gobierno, los
niveles de bienestar perdidos en 1995 no se recuperarn as sino hasta el
ao 2007.  Otra generacin sacrificada.  Otra oportunidad que desperdicia el
gobierno en recuperar la confianza del pueblo. Y sin embargo, esto no
tendra que ser as. No estamos fatalmente condenados a ello. Mxico podra
iniciar un crecimiento acelerado a partir de 1997 y traducir ese crecimiento
en bienestar para todos los mexicanos. Todava tenemos algunas cartas de
triunfo en la mano, todava no se acaba el juego.
<P>
                El general Lzaro Crdenas -el "tata"- capitaliz a los
campesinos.  Les dio la posesin de un pedazo de tierra. As inici la
industrializacin del pas. La reforma agraria y la expropiacin del
petrleo de los aos 30 generaron entre los mexicanos la "ilusin del
cambio" que sostuvo polticamente al PRI durante 60 aos.  Salinas -el
"bueno"- disminuy la inflacin, dom la crisis y, sin duda, reparti
bienestar y esperanza entre los ms pobres con sus programas de
"solidaridad."  Entre todos los mexicanos gener una "ilusin del cambio" y
nos hizo ver la posibilidad de entrar al Primer Mundo. Con las reformas al
Artculo 27 de la Constitucin se dio fin a la reforma agraria, liquidando
el "ejido" o rgimen de propiedad comunitaria que negaba a los campesinos la
posibilidad de vender, arrendar, hipotecar o transmitir por herencia las
parcelas a sus hijos. Los programas Procampo y Procede iniciaron una
trascendente, aunque incompleta, "capitalizacin" del pas.
<P>
                Aunque tarde, el presidente Zedillo todava podra generar
la "ilusin del cambio" y recuperar la confianza de los mexicanos.  Todava
podra nacionalizar -hacer propiedad efectiva de los mexicanos- los bienes
que la burocracia gubernamental y sus aliados corporativistas nos ha
expropiado a todos.  El petrleo, por ejemplo, lo usufructa para su
provecho particular la burocracia y el sindicato de Pemex, sin que los
mexicanos reciban ningn beneficio. Las empresas estatales y sus activos
deben pasar a manos de sus verdaderos dueos, todos los mexicanos, mediante
la distribucin gratuita a cada ciudadano de los certificados que amparan su
propiedad.  De un plumazo, Zedillo -el "estadista"- podra capitalizar a
todas las familias mexicanas con unos cuarenta mil dlares (contando slo
las reservas petroleras), cumplir con su promesa de bienestar para todos y
generar la "ilusin de cambio" que nos permitira comenzar a crecer a tasas
que los asiticos nos han probado ser posibles de alcanzar.

WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Arnoldo Alemn, ex alcalde de Managua y candidato de la
Alianza Liberal, derrot fcilmente al ex presidente sandinista, Daniel
Ortega, en las elecciones del 20 de octubre. La gran victoria de Alemn fue
una sorpresa, ya que las encuestas indicaban estar cabeza a cabeza. La
segunda derrota de Ortega en cinco aos es indicativa de que los
nicaragenses no desean regresar al pasado sandinista. Pero,
lamentablemente, los problemas del pas son muy graves para ser resueltos
por una eleccin.
<P>
 Lo que estaba de por medio en estas elecciones era ms sobre el pasado que
sobre el futuro. La victoria de Alemn es un rechazo al gobierno de la
presidenta Violeta Chamorro, no slo por su incapacidad en reactivar la
economa y detener la cada del nivel de vida sino tambin por su renuencia
a liquidar varios aspectos del legado sandinista. De hecho, se pueden
describir al menos tres de los ltimos cinco aos de gobierno como un caso
clsico de cohabitacin, con los sandinistas al control de las fuerzas
armadas y de la polica, a la vez que ejercan una considerable influencia,
tras bastidores, con arreglos sucios y privados con miembros del gobierno de
Chamorro.
<P>
 A raz de su victoria en 1990, a la Sra. Chamorro se le pidi exterminar el
virus sandinista, pero ella prefiri el camino de la reconciliacin y
pacificacin. Ahora que los sandinistas fueron nuevamente barridos
electoralmente, esa poltica de la presidenta Chamorro luce mejor.
<P>
 Un logro innegable ha sido la desmilitarizacin de la sociedad. Unos 22.000
contras entregaron sus armas y el ejrcito ha sido reducido de 96.000
hombres a 13.500. Tambin ha habido una reduccin paralela de los gastos
militares que en 1990 consuman 40% del presupuesto nacional. En parte, eso
ha ayudado a reducir los dficit del presupuesto y la astronmica inflacin.
Durante los ltimos cinco aos, Nicaragua ha vivido bajo un clima sin
precedente de libertad.
<P>
 Lamentablemente, los errores han sido tan grandes como los logros. Casi la
mitad de los prstamos prometidos a los contras y de los documentos de
propiedad de las tierra no han sido concedidos. Como resultado, repeticiones
de la violencia guerrillera han costado la vida de ms de mil nicaragenses.
Pero el problema ms serio es el estancamiento econmico, sufriendo la mitad
de la poblacin de desempleo crnico.
<P>
 La crisis proviene de la dcada de gobierno marxista que precipit una fuga
masiva de capitales y de los profesionales con la habilidad de gerenciar. La
mayora se fueron a Estados Unidos, donde sus hijos se han convertido en
residentes permanentes. Tomar un par de generaciones volver a crear el
capital humano que Nicaragua perdi.
<P>
 Pero el pobre rcord econmico del gobierno de Violeta Chamorro no es toda
culpa de sus antecesores. En su campaa electoral de 1990, Chamorro haba
prometido revisar las expropiaciones masivas efectuadas por los sandinistas
en propiedades tanto urbanas como del campo. Nunca lo encar y hasta bloque
las iniciativas de la Legislatura Nacional de al menos pagar una
compensacin a los expropiados.
<P>
 Sin una clara definicin de los derechos de propiedad, tanto el capital
nacional como el extranjero le seguirn sacando el cuerpo a la que fue una
de las ms vigorosas economas en Amrica Central.
<P>
 El fracaso de encarar la situacin ha envenenado la atmsfera nicaragense
y desde hace un ao ms de cien mil habitantes urbanos viven bajo la amenaza
de ser desalojados por los dueos que han regresado a reclamar sus
propiedades. Por otra parte, 24.000 demandas relacionadas a la confiscacin
de tierras siguen sin decidirse. Una ley de Estabilizacin de la Propiedad,
promulgada en noviembre de 1995, trat de partir la torta, aceptando la
reforma agraria sandinista, pero requiriendo la compensacin sobre
propiedades urbanas. No sorprendi a nadie que los propietarios no aceptasen
ser compensados con bonos de la semiprivatizada compaa de telfonos.
<P>
 Los que apoyaron a Alemn fueron tanto los que haban perdido sus
propiedades como los que estn inconformes ante la ausencia de oportunidades
econmicas. La campaa de Alemn tambin resalt el favoritismo familiar en
la distribucin de cargos y contratos gubernamentales.
<P>
 Pero hay ms que razones polticas y econmicas en la victoria de Alemn.
Hijo de una familia humilde, se ha sobrepuesto a prejuicios sociales
alcanzando el xito como empresario y luego como alcalde de la capital. Por
el contrario, quienes rodean a la Sra. Chamorro pertenencen a la
aristocracia tradicional nicaragense.
<P>
 El programa de Alemn incluye la revitalizacin de la economa a travs de
prstamos a los agricultores y a los empresarios pequeos. Tambin promete
invertir en la abandonada infraestructura de carreteras, puentes y dems
obras pblicas. Pero lo que Alemn ofreca distinto a Ortega son buenas
relaciones con Estados Unidos, lo cual los nicaragenses -con razn o sin
ella- piensan que es la clave en la recuperacin econmica.
<P>
 Lo nicas tampoco han olvidado "la piata", la reparticin de propiedades
gubernamentales durante las ltimas semanas del gobierno sandinista. As le
pusieron la mano a propiedades que algunos estiman en $200 millones y otros
en $2.000 millones, repartidas entre unos cinco mil sandinistas, en su
mayora funcionarios altos del rgimen. De esa manera Ortega cre una
"burguesa revolucionaria" a la mexicana, pero al mismo tiempo produjo una
inmensa brecha entre los sandinistas privilegiados y los comunes y corrientes. 
<P>
 Ortega trat de proyectar una nueva imagen, vistindose bien y eliminando
del himno sandinista aquello de que el gringo es "el peor enemigo de la
humanidad". Pero los nicas no creyeron en su repentino pluralismo, indicando
que sigue viajando frecuentemente a Cuba y que no hay evidencia de
democracia interna en su partido. De hecho, el partido se dividi al
separarse el ex vicepresidente Sergio Ramrez. Es significativo que la
mayora de los legisladores sandinistas se han ido con Ramrez.
<P>
 La poltica nica hoy se caracteriza por su divisin en tres "familias", en
s fraccionadas: el sandinismo, el antisandinismo y el grupo ms pequeo que
puede designarse como conservadora y que apoy a Chamorro. Ms del 60% es
antisandinista, pero entre ellos algunos quieren un rompimiento con el
pasado y otros favorecen un gobierno en manos de las mismas familias que han
dominado la poltica durante un siglo. La victoria de Alemn es importante
al representar el deseo por una nueva sntesis.
<P>
 Alemn se enfrenta a todas las patologas de la regin: radical desigualdad
y la tendencia a confundir los bienes privados y pblicos. No es fcil ser
optimista, pero al menos el electorado escogi bien.

PEMEX EMPOBRECE A MEXICO

<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO 
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
(AIPE).- Gracias a Pemex, el monopolio petrolero estatal,
los mexicanos somos y seremos ms pobres. Los accidentes mortales ocurridos
en las instalaciones de Pemex en Pltano, Cacao, Cactus, Guadalajara, San
Juan Ixhuatepec, etc. son eventos que nos han empobrecido y cuya factura
vamos a pagar todos los mexicanos con un menor ingreso presente y futuro. La
ineptitud con la cual se ha manejado esta empresa a lo largo de los aos,
las prebendas de que gozan los empleados sindicalizados, la corrupcin que
tradicionalmente ha imperado en los contratos de adquisicin de insumos, la
venta de plazas laborales y todos los dems adornos que caracterizan a
Pemex, implican un aprovechamiento muy ineficiente de la riqueza petrolera
mexicana y por lo mismo una generacin de ingresos derivados de la misma muy
inferior al potencial.
<P>
Los diferentes accidentes que recientemente han ocurrido en las
instalaciones de Pemex reflejan, en ltima instancia, la falta de definicin
de los derechos de propiedad que caracterizan a cualquier empresa del
gobierno y que por lo mismo se traducen en una administracin y operacin
ineficiente, cuyo costo todos pagamos. Entre las muchas campaas
publicitarias de Pemex, tratando intilmente de mejorar su deteriorada
imagen, haba una que afirmaba que "Pemex es de todos los mexicanos". 
<P>
Nada
ms falso. Pemex no es de todos los mexicanos, sino solamente de algunos,
particularmente del sindicato petrolero, que con todas las prebendas que
tienen en su contrato colectivo de trabajo obtienen un ingreso superior al
valor de su productividad. Por lo mismo, si el gobierno quisiera que Pemex
fuese de todos los mexicanos, tendra que volver a expropiar el petrleo,
pero esta vez quitndoselo al sindicato y privatizndolo mediante una oferta
pblica de acciones en la cual todos los mexicanos puedan participar.
El gobierno y la propia administracin de Pemex han sealado que no se
cuentan con los recursos requeridos para la modernizacin y ampliacin de
las plantas petroqumicas de la empresa paraestatal, por lo que propusieron
la venta del 49% de las acciones de las plantas. Si antes se perciba como
poco probable que este mecanismo indujera al sector privado a asociarse con
Pemex, sobretodo por la obsolescencia de las plantas y la presencia del
propio sindicato, despus del ltimo accidente, que muestra las
ineficiencias internas y el lamentable estado de la empresa, la
probabilidad de participacin privada es todava menor. 
<P>
Se sigue insistiendo que Pemex es y seguir siendo una empresa del estado.
Para muchos, ser propietarios de chatarra nos hace ser ms soberanos. Por la
forma en que hemos manejado nuestra inmensa riqueza petrolera, los mexicanos
somos ms pobres y tambin lo sern nuestros hijos.

INMIGRACION Y DROGAS: JUSTOS POR PECADORES

CIUDAD DE MEXICO
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La inmigracin en Estados Unidos sigue
experimentando enormes presiones polticas provenientes de posturas
aislacionistas y puritanas tanto de republicanos y demcratas como de la
bala perdida texana, Mr. Perot.  Esto ha provocado que paguen "justos por
pecadores" en lo que se antoja como un "Juicio Final" fronterizo de
indocumentados y en particular de residentes de origen mexicano.
<P>
                Por otra parte, existe gran preocupacin en Mxico respecto
a las reacciones del Congreso y del Ejecutivo de Estados Unidos, al usar
polticas financieras y comerciales hacia Mxico como medidas de presin
para forzar al gobierno mexicano a combatir el narcotrfico, sin ofrecer
acciones recprocas -en calidad y cantidad- por parte y dentro de Estados
Unidos.
<P>
                Desde la posicin norteamericana, el campo de batalla de las
drogas debe permanecer en territorio extranjero: Mxico, Colombia, etc. Los
narcticos -desde la perspectiva migratoria- es ahora el problema ms
preocupante que afecta el cruce ilegal. La contaminacin de la inmigracin
con drogas es extensa. Cada da ms y ms trabajadores indocumentados son
forzados por el crimen organizado de ambos lados de la frontera a llevar
drogas, lo cual ha sustituido las cuotas que antes se pagaban a los coyotes.
<P>
                La operacin de los "Carteles de Inmigracin" -homlogos de
los "Carteles de Drogas"- coordinados desde Centro y Sudamrica es un nuevo
y extremadamente virulento factor en el aumento de la criminalidad en las
ciudades fronterizas de Mxico. El dinero y las drogas involucradas en esta
extensa operacin estn corrompiendo a la polica, a los funcionarios
aduanales y a oficiales de migracin de ambos pases. Slo basta para
confirmar todo esto darle un vistazo a los testimonios que han salido a
relucir en el juicio del narcotraficante Garca Abrego.
<P>
                Un creciente nmero de otrora inocentes trabajadores
indocumentados estn siendo encarcelados en prisiones federales
estadounidenses y cumplen largas sentencias por delitos de narcotrfico.
Evidentemente, la inmigracin ya no es tan solo un problema interno del pas
recipiente.  No es materia slo de suprimir servicios pblicos a los
inmigrantes. No es cuestin de negar educacin, salud y asistencia a los
hijos de inmigrantes. Se ha convertido en tema de gran importancia en la
poltica local de ambas naciones. Es un problema que concierne a los
intereses de seguridad nacional tanto de Mxico como de Estados Unidos.
<P>
                El crimen organizado se meti en el nuevo negocio del
trfico de seres humanos y tiene que ser despojado de los incentivos que
ofrece el mercado de drogas ms grande del mundo.  Las drogas llegan a
Estados Unidos por invitacin (por la demanda interna), igual como los
trabajadores forneos.
<P>
	La respuesta efectiva a la inmigracin ilegal es una combinacin de mercados
ms libres y flujos legales de personas altamente motivadas. As se evitar
que nuestros trabajadores migratorios caigan en las manos del crimen
organizado, pagando justos por pecadores.
<P>
                Es evidente que la regulacin y los acuerdos internacionales
en materia de narcticos estn creando inmensos mercados y privilegios
monoplicos al crimen organizado. No hay nada ms daino y atentatorio a los
intereses nacionales que la contaminacin criminal de la que son vctimas
los esforzados compatriotas que van en busca de oportunidades que Mxico, su
patria, todava les niega.

EL FRACASO DEL RECICLAJE DE LA BASURA

EL FRACASO DEL RECICLAJE DE LA BASURA
</H2>
Sylvia Pasquier*
<br>
<p>
NUEVA YORK
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La creciente preocupacin por el manejo de la basura y
los desperdicios tom auge en 1987, cuando una gran barcaza, la Mobro 4000,
naveg miles de kilmetros tratando de encontrar un lugar donde le
permitieran descargar la basuras producida por los habitantes de Long
Island, en Estados Unidos. A partir de entonces, Nueva York y otras grandes
ciudades tratan de determinar la mejor manera de manejar la basura.
 El "reciclaje" de la basura ha tenido gran aceptacin como proceso para
obtener beneficios econmicos y proteger el medio ambiente. Pero una
revisin de los resultados obtenidos en Nueva York nos deja ver el gran
trecho que existe entre la propaganda oficial y los verdaderos resultados.
<P>
                La ciudad de Nueva York fue pionera en 1988 en promover el
reciclaje como el mejor mtodo de disponer de los desechos, ejemplo seguido
luego por varias ciudades europeas, principalmente en Alemania. Winston
Porter fue administrador asistente de la EPA (Agencia de Proteccin
Ambiental de Estados Unidos), dependencia gubernamental que fij una meta de
25% como cantidad a reciclar de la basura. Hoy Porter es asesor de varias
ciudades, a las cuales aconseja que abandonen tales metas tan poco realistas.
<P>
                Cada vez que un vehculo recolector de basura completa su
carga de botellas y de latas recogidas de las aceras de Nueva York, la
ciudad pierde dinero. El programa de reciclaje consume recursos, requiere
una administracin especial y una campaa continua para ensear a la gente
lo que debe hacer con docenas de diferentes productos: reciclar botellas de
leche pero no cartones de leche; peridicos s pero no el papel utilizado en
la construccin, etc.
<P>
                A pesar de que el programa de reciclaje lleva varios aos,
la mayora de los habitantes de Nueva York no comprenden todas las reglas
vigentes. El programa tambin requiere de agentes que inspeccionen los
desperdicios y distribuyan notificaciones de multas. Sobre todo, obliga a
utilizar muchos ms vehculos y mucho ms personal que antes, cuando no se
reciclaba.
<P>
                Recolectar una tonelada de desperdicios y basura reciclable
en la ciudad de Nueva York es tres veces ms caro que recolectar una
tonelada de basura no reciclable. Por cada tonelada de vidrio, plsticos y
metales que el vehculo entrega a una empresa privada de reciclaje, la
ciudad de Nueva York gasta actualmente $200 ms de lo que gastara
transportando basura a una zona de relleno municipal.
<P>
                Los directores del proyecto esperaban recuperar este costo
adicional vendiendo los materiales obtenidos, pero su precio jams se acerc
siquiera al costo del manejo. Las empresas privadas de reciclaje exigen,
adems, honorarios por su trabajo, ya que sus costos de procesamiento de la
basura son mayores que los eventuales precios de venta de los materiales
reciclados. Por este motivo, la ciudad habiendo ya invertido $200 por cada
tonelada de material recogido debe pagar otros $40 para deshacerse de ste.
<P>
                El programa de reciclaje le cuesta a la ciudad de Nueva York
unos $100 millones al ao y esta cifra solamente incluye el dinero
proveniente del presupuesto municipal. Hay que agregar el costo escondido de
todo el trabajo efectuado gratis por los habitantes de la ciudad en
cooperacin con el programa de reciclaje. Recientemente, un estudiante de la
Universidad de Columbia sum el trabajo de una semana, siguiendo al pie de
la letra los reglamentos municipales. Le tomaron 8 minutos a la semana
escoger y llevar al stano del edificio donde vive dos kilos de latas y
botellas. Si la ciudad tuviera que pagar personal para que realizara ese
trabajo, costara otros $800 por cada tonelada de reciclaje.
<P>
                Si calculamos tambin el costo del espacio asignado para
guardar todo el material reciclable hasta tanto pasen a recogerlo, segn los
precios actuales de la vivienda y asignando slo un metro cuadrado por
familia, este costo alcanza otros $2.000 por tonelada. Por lo tanto, el
costo verdadero de una tonelada de material reciclable es ms de $3.000.
Cuando los burcratas y expertos ambientales hablan maravillas de los
programas de reciclaje, no toman en cuenta sus horribles costos. Si
ignoramos la relacin costo/beneficio de los programas gubernamentales, todo
suena lindo, bueno y deseable.

TELARAAS MINISTERIALES

Paul Craig Roberts*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Las renuncias masivas en el gabinete del presidente
Clinton nos permiten pensar que las polticas de su segunda administracin
pueden ser ms equilibradas, pero para que ello se logre tendrn que haber
tambin muchos cambios burocrticos por debajo del nivel ministerial.
<P>
 Los ministros reciben toda la atencin pblica, pero el poder operativo
est en manos de sus asistentes, entre quienes han proliferado los
extremistas que piensan que los valores e instituciones de Estados Unidos
son discriminatorios y deben ser reformados.
<P>
 Los burcratas nombrados por Clinton ven discriminacin racial y sexual en
todos los rincones de nuestra sociedad. La encuentran en la institucin del
matrimonio, en los valores religiosos tradicionales, en primas de seguros y
en las tasas de intereses hipotecarios basadas en  los riesgos, en academias
militares fundadas hace 157 aos y en el comportamiento normal de los nios.
<P>
 Recuerda el caso del nio de seis aos que fue suspendido por "acoso
sexual" al haber besado en la mejilla a una niita? Fue el resultado de
regulaciones emitidas por Norma Cantu, vice ministra de Educacin para
derechos civiles. Otro logro de la Sra. Cantu es la imposicin de "equidad
sexual" para destruir muchos programas de atletismo masculino en las
universidades. La Sra. Cantu exige un "equilibrio de gnero" en los
programas deportivos y como las mujeres no juegan ftbol americano, otros
deportes han tenido que ser eliminados para mantener la representacin
proporcional entre varones y hembras.
<P>
 La Sra. Nan Hunter, consultora jurdica asistente del Departamento de Salud
y Servicios Humanos, antes diriga el programa de Derechos de Lesbianas y
'Gays' de la Unin Americana de Libertades Civiles. Ella considera al
matrimonio como otra institucin discriminatoria ms y busca eliminar "la
estructura de gnero en todo matrimonio".
<P>
 Deval Patrick, vice ministro de Justicia para derechos humanos, ha abusado
de su cargo en tal forma que fue denunciado por la senadora demcrata de
Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, por sus "tcnicas tipo Gestapo", aplastando a
ciudadanos y comunidades. Patrick inici una demanda de discriminacin
contra un banco en Chevy Chase, Maryland, obligando al banco a travs de una
campaa de prensa, protestas y manifestaciones de grupos interesados a
conceder prstamos con intereses por debajo de sus costos a "minoras" y a
establecer sucursales segn criterios raciales.
<P>
 Cuando los ciudadanos del pueblo de Bakersfield, California, se opusieron a
la instalacin de una casa para enfermos mentales en su barrio residencial,
Patrick los denunci por discriminacin e inici un juicio federal contra
ellos, sabiendo perfectamente que el bolsillo del gobierno federal es mucho
ms profundo que el de esa pobre gente que defiende su barrio. La alcalde de
San Diego declar ante una comisin del Senado que sufrir los ataques de
Patrick es como vivir en la antigua Unin Sovitica. 
<P>
 Fue Patrick quien logr destruir la tradicin de las academias militares
Citadel y Virginia Military Institute, fundadas en 1842 y 1839, obligndolas
a cambiar su cultura y a aceptar mujeres. Patrick predica a abogados tanto
dentro como fuera del gobierno que los derechos de "las minoras preferidas"
estn por encima de los derechos constitucionales de los que no han sido
designados como minoras.
<P>
 Patrick renunci y busca un trabajo mejor remunerado. Buena suerte. Pero el
Senado republicano tiene que hacer un mejor trabajo esta vez, rechazando
nombramientos de payasos estrafalarios a cargos claves de la administracin.

WAHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- En la cumbre de la Organizacin Mundial del Comercio
(OMC) que se celebra actualmente en Singapur, los Estados Unidos y otras
naciones industrializadas estn insistiendo en la "armonizacin" de
regulaciones laborales con los pases en desarrollo, como condicin para
cualquier futuro acuerdo de libre comercio. Los pases en vas de
desarrollo, incluyendo los Tigres Asiticos, se oponen.
<P>
 El establecimiento de normas laborales mnimas a nivel mundial es parte del
esfuerzo por crear una serie de preceptos comerciales supuestamente justos,
con el fin de "nivelar el campo de juego". Con tales normas, los lderes
sindicales y otros grupos de presin de las naciones industrializadas
intentan que los trabajadores de los pases ricos sean menos vulnerables a
la competencia de la mano de obra barata extranjera.
<P>
 Pero, en el fondo, esto no es ms que una nueva forma de proteccionismo. Y
el proteccionismo, al igual que el mono, aunque se vista de seda,
proteccionismo se queda. La vulnerabilidad de los trabajadores en los pases
industrializados no se debe al mayor volumen de comercio con los pases en
vas de desarrollo sino a polticas macroeconmicas errneas. Por ejemplo,
en Europa Occidental el seguro de desempleo es demasiado generoso,
aumentando los costos laborales de tal manera que la tasa de contratacin
permanente es muy baja.
<P>
 La nocin del comercio "justo" implica una igualdad de resultados, es
decir, una balanza comercial equilibrada. Pero son los individuos, no las
naciones, los que comercian entre s. Y la razn por la que intercambian
bienes y servicios es que esperan beneficiarse del intercambio. Un criterio
ms apropiado sera determinar si las reglas comerciales (que no es lo mismo
que las regulaciones laborales) se pueden aplicar con igualdad y de manera
general a todos aquellos que comercian.  Es ms, ste sera un rol legtimo
de la OMC.
<P>
 La famosa clusula social, que impondra unos derechos laborales mnimos,
elevara el costo laboral de los trabajadores en los pases en desarrollo
muy por encima del rendimiento de su trabajo, creando automticamente un
desempleo generalizado. Como explica la economista guatemalteca Lucy
Martnez-Mont: "El privar a los pases en vas de desarrollo, incluso con
las mejores intenciones, del capital y del empleo necesarios para erradicar
las condiciones de pobreza que nos afligen desde hace siglos solamente
asegurar la perpetuacin indefinida de dicha miseria."
<P>
 Una de las claves para salir de la pobreza es la apertura de los mercados y
a medida que el nivel de vida sube, los trabajadores son capaces de
satisfacer otros deseos menos importantes que el mnimo sustento, como son
mejores condiciones de trabajo y un medio ambiente ms limpio. Nada de eso
se logra por medio de decretos supranacionales.
<P>
 La agenda estadounidense en la OMC es especialmente peligrosa para los
pases en vas de desarrollo porque de lograr imponer la clusula social en
las reglas multilaterales del comercio se paralizaran los avances de los
pases pobres, adems de perjudicar gravemente a los consumidores de todo el
mundo.
<P>
 La libertad de los individuos de disponer de su propiedad como les plazca y
de participar en intercambios voluntarios con otros individuos -ya sean
estos de la misma ciudad o de otro pas- es una caracterstica fundamental
del sistema de libre empresa. Los excesos regulatorios que han conducido al
estancamiento econmico y a una mayor dependencia del Estado en muchas
naciones industrializadas son una restriccin de esa libertad y una
imposicin que los pases en vas de desarrollo no necesitan para nada.

LA VERDADERA MORAL
</H2>
Robert A. Sirico*

<p>
GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Los dirigentes empresariales tienen un
inters personal en promover la comprensin pblica de la economa de
mercado. Sin embargo, ellos pronto se rinden cuando la oposicin
izquierdista se envuelve a s misma en un manto religioso.
<P>
 No tiene que ser as. Veamos el caso de la firma Briggs & Stratton (B&S) de
Milwaukee, fabricante de pequeos motores. En diciembre de 1994 fue atacada
editorialmente por los medios izquierdistas catlicos por despedir a
trabajadores. La empresa respondi con una demanda de difamacin y una
campaa en defensa de la economa de mercado.
<P>
 Thomas Fox, director del National Catholic Reporter, identific a tres
altos ejecutivos de B&S como catlicos, acusndolos de "haberse desviado de
las enseanzas sociales de la Iglesia". El peridico acus a los tres de
"ceguera moral" ante la maldad de los despidos.
<P>
 El artculo asuma que es inmoral que una empresa mude sus operaciones a
otra parte, aunque ello sea necesario para su supervivencia. Segn el cdigo
moral de este peridico catlico, los patronos deben garantizarle a la
fuerza laboral actual sus altos salarios de por vida, se estn ellos ganando
o no los sueldos.
<P>
 Veamos lo que pas en B&S. En 1983 sus motores eran manufacturados en
Milwaukee por miembros del sindicato. Con una penetracin de 65% en el
mercado de cortadoras de grama en Estados Unidos, B&S pagaba un promedio de
salarios 30% ms altos que la competencia. Las relaciones con el sindicato
eran amistosas.
<P>
 Con una posicin privilegiada en el mercado, la empresa poda complacer la
mayora de las exigencias del sindicato, lo cual se financiaba con precios
ms altos de sus motores. Pero esto eventualmente atrajo la competencia de
otros fabricantes y de empresas japonesas. La gerencia se dio cuenta que
tena que realizar cambios para mantener sus ventas.
<P>
 Fred Stratton, el presidente de la empresa, explic al sindicato la
necesidad de congelar salarios y de pagar menos a los nuevos empleados, a la
vez de mayor flexibilidad en las operaciones de la planta. El sindicato
declar una huelga que dur tres meses, provocando una crisis, al no poder
la empresa cumplir con los pedidos de sus clientes, quienes comenzaron a
cambiarse a otros proveedores.
<P>
 B&S respondi mudando parte de la produccin a Murray, Kentucky y a Poplar
Bluff, Missouri, empleando mano de obra ms barata. No se trataba de
"avaricia empresarial" sino de intransigencia sindical y el grueso de la
produccin permaneci en Milwaukee.
<P>
 Las cosas empeoraron. En 1989 B&S sufri prdidas por $20 millones, pero
todava insista en quedarse en Milwaukee. La gerencia convenci a los
lderes sindicales de aceptar una congelacin salarial de cuatro aos,
prometiendo no mudar las operaciones en tres aos y medio. El sindicato
procedi a violar sistemticamente el espritu del acuerdo, rehus aportar
trabajadores para nuevos departamentos e instrumentaron una "operacin
tortuga" ilegal.
<P>
 Ante la creciente competencia y mayores aumentos en sus costos, B&S dio un
preaviso de un ao a dos mil de sus trabajadores y comenz a utilizar
crecientemente sus instalaciones en reas donde pagaba menores sueldos. Si
el peridico catlico hubiese realmente querido ayudar a los trabajadores,
no ha debido culpar a los gerentes sino decirle a los trabajadores que
aceptaran las realidades econmicas y colaboraran con su empresa en reducir
costos. Ha debido recordarle a los trabajadores que tambin ellos tienen una
obligacin moral: dar un da de trabajo por el salario recibido y no
perjudicar a la empresa donde trabajan.
<P>
 Pero gente como Thomas Fox y el resto de la izquierda religiosa les
interesa menos ayudar a los trabajadores que hacer propaganda
antiempresarial. Dada las dificultades, los ejecutivos de B&S, actuaron como
buenos catlicos, satisfaciendo a sus clientes y creando puestos de trabajo.
Fue el sindicato y el peridico catlico los que violaron la justicia social
y los preceptos morales.

EL VOTO LATINO EN LAS ELECCIONES AMERICANAS
</H2>
John Sweeney*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- El voto latino, por mucho tiempo una fuerza silente en
las elecciones presidenciales estadounidenses, el 5 de noviembre acudi a
las urnas de votacin en cantidades sin precedentes en California, Florida,
Nueva York y otros estados claves, ayudando la victoria del presidente
Clinton, en momentos cuando la proporcin de votantes fue la ms baja en una
eleccin presidencial desde 1924.
<P>
 Los votantes latinos tambin produjeron la victoria de candidatos
demcratas en contiendas peliagudas al Congreso y las legislaturas
estadales. Encuestas postelectorales en California, donde vive la mitad de
los latinos en este pas, muestran que votaron por Clinton y dems
candidatos demcratas en proporcin de 3 a 1. En estados como Texas, Nueva
York y Arizona, donde suelen ganar los republicanos, los latinos se
inclinaron por candidatos demcratas en proporcin de hasta 17 a 1.
<P>
 El voto masivo de los latinos en parte tuvo que ver con la aceleracin de
las concesiones de nacionalidad por parte de la administracin Clinton, que
alcanz a ms de un milln de nuevos ciudadanos en el ltimo ao y, tambin,
por agresivas campaas para que salieran a votar en las comunidades latinas.
<P>
 Sin embargo, la razn principal de que el voto latino se haya inclinado
fuertemente hacia los demcratas es la percepcin generalizada del Partido
Republicano como antiinmigrante y antilatino. El Partido Republicano
enfrenta serios problemas con los votantes latinos. Al igual que con todas
las inmigraciones anteriores, los inmigrantes que se nacionalizan tienden a
ser ms jvenes, menos afluentes y con menos educacin que la poblacin en
general.
<P>
Las encuestas muestran que los latinos son firmes creyentes en la familia,
el trabajo duro, la fe religiosa y la seguridad jurdica, exactamente los
valores sociales que predican los republicanos conservadores. Que hayan
repudiado a los republicanos en proporcin aplastante obligar a los lderes
de ese partido a reconsiderar su posicin sobre inmigracin.
<P>
 Una de las razones por las que Bob Dole escogi a Jack Kemp como candidato
a la vicepresidencia fue por la decidida posicin de ste a favor de la
inmigracin, el comercio hemisfrico y de relaciones ms estrechas con
Amrica Latina.
<P>
 Pero la retrica antimexicana de Pat Buchanan, las reformas a la
beneficencia social que discriminan contra los inmigrantes legales
instrumentadas por el Congreso republicano y el referendo antiinmigracin
apoyado agresivamente por Pete Wilson, gobernador republicano de California,
convencieron a la mayora de los latinos que el Partido Republicano no
representa sus valores como ciudadanos de Estados Unidos.
<P>
 Este brinco al Partido Demcrata ocurre justamente cuando est creciendo
rpidamente el voto latino. Entre 1992 y 1996, el voto latino en California
creci de 7% a 10%, de 10% a 16% en Texas y de 11% a 12% en Florida.
<P>
 Las tendencias demogrficas sealan la creciente importancia del voto
latino durante los prximos 12 aos. Segn la oficina del censo, antes de 30
aos los latinos conformarn el 25% de la poblacin de Estados Unidos,
mientras que la minora negra se mantendr entre 12% y 14%.
<P>
 El presidente Clinton obtuvo el voto latino sin competencia alguna. La
decisin poco inteligente de los lderes republicanos en cuanto a atacar la
inmigracin les explot en la cara, ayudando con su retrica antiinmigrante
a los candidatos demcratas.

VENEZUELA: TERRORISMO JUDICIAL

VENEZUELA: TERRORISMO JUDICIAL

CARACAS
(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- La seguridad jurdica es el cumplimiento de normas legales
que garantizan la resolucin pacfica de conflictos entre individuos, a la
vez que la existencia de jueces confiables que aplican las normas legales.
La Constitucin venezolana contiene todas las garantas ciudadanas del mundo
civilizado. Tericamente tenemos una legislacin que hace presumir la
existencia de un Estado de Derecho, de una seguridad jurdica. Pero en la
prctica esa legislacin no se aplica si no te haces "amigo del juez".
La ausencia de jueces confiables tiene consecuencias gravsimas para la
sociedad. Si en los juicios civiles es grave esa situacin, ms grave an se
torna en el caso de jueces penales porque los ciudadanos quedan sujetos al
llamado 'terrorismo judicial'.
<P>
 La ausencia de jueces penales confiables conduce a lo ocurrido en otros
pases de Amrica Latina, una tendencia a hacerse justicia por s mismo,
cuya expresin extrema son los llamados 'escuadrones de la muerte' que
proliferan por la desesperacin de la ciudadana ante la impunidad judicial
de los malhechores que regresan a la calle libres, pocos das despus de
cometido el delito. 
<P>
                  La falta de seguridad jurdica incide dramticamente en la
economa. No hay desarrollo econmico sin inversiones que nos hagan ms
productivos y no hay inversin sin seguridad jurdica.  Desarrollo econmico
y seguridad jurdica son un matrimonio indisoluble. 	
<P>
 La legislacin penal venezolana y especialmente el secreto sumarial son las
principales fuentes de la corrupcin judicial y hoy se ofrecen las ms
variadas soluciones, muchas de ellas no encaminadas a restaurar la seguridad
jurdica sino ms bien para lograr que los "reformadores" sustituyan a los
polticos en el nombramiento de los jueces.
<P>
 En primer trmino debemos modificar la constitucin. La Carta Magna
arrancada por el pueblo ingls a Juan Sin Tierra en 1215 es la primera
legislacin que permiti a los ms dbiles, al pueblo, limitar el poder del
ms fuerte, el rey. All naci la posibilidad de una cooperacin pacfica y
no forzada entre seres humanos diferentes. All tiene su origen la sociedad
moderna. Todas las constituciones deben tener por objeto limitar el poder
del ms fuerte, protegiendo al ms dbil. Deben limitar el poder de la
mayora protegiendo a la minora. Sin esa proteccin no son posibles la
cooperacin social ni la sociedad moderna estable. La sociedad moderna
permite la cooperacin de seres humanos marcadamente diferentes entre s
porque el poder del ms fuerte est limitado constitucionalmente en
beneficio del ms dbil.
<P>
 Pero en la constitucin venezolana tales garantas indispensables estn
mediatizadas con  frases como "salvo cuando... por razones de inters
social", dejando todo en manos de una mayora circunstancial cuando redacta
y aprueba leyes. Esa mayora no ha llegado a eliminar la propiedad privada,
pero ya algunos miembros del gobierno lo han insinuado. Y esa falta de
garantas reales atenta contra las inversiones extranjeras que consideran
que la seguridad de sus capitales estara eventualmente sujeta a la voluntad
de una mayora parlamentaria.
<P>
 En segundo trmino, hay que modificar el procedimiento penal. Muchos jueces
escogen la carrera para hacer uso del poder. Es como si le preguntramos a
los curas porqu han escogido el sacerdocio y nos dijeran "para or los
secretos de las confesiones y chantajear a los feligreses". 
<P>
                  El problema es que los jueces penales examinan, bajo
secreto, la presunta comisin de un delito y pueden privar de la libertad a
cualquier ciudadano. En Venezuela recluir a alguien en el Retn de Catia, en
Caracas, equivale a una sentencia de muerte. Es urgente, por lo tanto,
eliminar el secreto sumarial y limitar el exagerado poder de los jueces en
la legislacin actual.
<P>
 Otro grave problema es que en la legislacin venezolana los menores no son
imputables hasta los 18 aos. As vemos cmo mafiosos se aprovechan
entrenndolos para mandarlos a asesinar por contrato. Otro es la falta de
claridad en la definicin de delitos de difamacin e injuria perpetrados
contra personas jurdicas o sus marcas de fbrica, especialmente en
productos de consumo masivo, cuyas ventas pueden destruirse como
consecuencia de un proceso de difamacin o de falsa acusacin a travs de
los medios de comunicacin.
<P>
 El terrorismo judicial y la inseguridad jurdica que de ella se desprende
mantiene a Venezuela sumida en la pobreza y el atraso.

<title>Statement of Principles -- ACU</title>

<CENTER><H2>The American Conservative Union </H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Statement Of Principles </I>
 <P>
We believe that the Constitution of the United States is the best political  
charter yet created by men for governing themselves. It is our belief that  
the Constitution is designed to guarantee the free exercise of the inherent  
rights of the individual through strictly limiting the power of  
government. 
 <P>
We reaffirm our belief in the Declaration of Independence, and in  
particular the belief that our inherent rights are endowed by the Creator.  
We further believe that our liberties can remain secure only if  
government is so limited that it cannot infringe upon those rights. 
 <P>
We believe that capitalism is the only economic system of our time that is  
compatible with political liberty. It has not only brought a higher standard  
of living to a greater number of people than any other economic system  
in the history of mankind; more important, it has been a decisive  
instrument in preserving freedom through maintaining private control of  
economic power and thus limiting the power of government. 
 <P>
We believe that collectivism and capitalism are incompatible, and that  
when government competes with capitalism, it jeopardizes the natural  
economic growth of our society and the well-being and freedom of the  
citizenry. 
 <P>

 <P>
We believe that it is the responsibility of the individual citizen, whenever  
his inherent rights are threatened from within or without, to join together  
with other individuals to protect these rights, or, when they have been  
temporarily lost, to regain them. 
 <P>
We believe that any responsible conservative organization must conduct  
itself within the framework of the Constitution; in pursuance of this belief  
we refuse to countenance any actions which conflict in any way with the  
traditions of the American political system. 
 <P>
The American Conservative Union is created to realize these ends  
through the cooperation in responsible political action, of all Americans  
who cherish the principles upon which the Republic was founded. 
 <P>
The American Conservative Union will welcome all Americans who are  
prepared to fight for the realization and preservation of these principles  
through political action at the local, state and national level. 
 <P>
                -- Adopted December, 1964

Dear Cleta:
<p>
I live in Glenside, PA, but my family pays more taxes to the city of 
Philadelphia than we do to our home township and county combined.  
Now Mayor Rendell has come out to my town and said we aren't paying 
enough!  We moved out of Philadelphia because we couldn't afford private 
school for our kids at the same time we were supporting patronage and 
perks for Rendell's friends.  How can I help him get it?  
<p>
--Robbed by the City of Brother Love

<p>
Dear Robbed:
<p>
I presume you are talking about the income tax paid by people who work in Philadelphia but who live outside of the city.  Is that what you're talking about?  If not, write back and clarify.  If it is, you are taxed without representation.  You pay taxes on income to a jurisdiction in which you have no voting representation.  I'm wondering if the constitutionality of such a system has ever been tested in the courts.  Maybe you should contact one of the public interest legal foundations and discuss filing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of such a system.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
Here is a possible idea for a "10" Veep nominee.  How about former 
governor Casey of Penn.? Yes, he is a Democrat but that makes the 
choice more provacative and interesting.  He comes from an area that 
is key to winning the election.  If he can pass any health concerns, 
he would be a great choice.
<p>
What do you think?

Dear Frank:  
<p>
I think the Republican convention would go nuts if Bob Dole nominates a Democrat for Vice President.  Did you hear the furor when Dole floated Sam Nunn's name a few months ago?  I admire Bob Casey and his courage, but his health isn't great -- and with Bob Dole's age it makes the Vice Presidential candidate's health a key issue for the fall.  Nice try -- but it's probably a non-starter.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
I have long opposed the minimum wage as an infrngement into American 
private business by a fat over-regulating government.  I resent Uncle 
telling me how much I must pay someone to perform a given task.  How 
can we stop this and other unwarranted entanglement by government in 
private citizens' interests?
<p>
--Doc
</pre><p>
Dear Doc:  
<p>
The way you stop the federal government is by electing members of Congress who are willing to say "no" to their own constituents -- and get the government out of our hair.  That means you should make yourself known to candidates and incumbents and don't vote for anyone who is for higher taxes, more spending and bigger government.  That means you should vote for people who are for LIMITED government, which means term limits, balanced budget amendment, lower taxes.  If we are to create an environment where every person can realize the American Dream, we're going to have to organize the people who think like we do -- and fight back against the powerful interests who want a government that grows and grows.  If you want to help with that effort, write back and add your name to our list of the "Dream Team":  people who will work for real politcal change in America. We'll tell you how.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
As active Constitutionalists, we must find a way to force the major media to <br>tell the truth about losses of our freedoms under the Constitution. We know that <br>laws being forced upon us are in truth unlawful, yet media supports every <br>oppressive law they pass.  I have tried to get them to begin telling the <br>people the truth about internal enemies of our Republic...to no avail. <br>I then assume that the media is part of the conspiracy to destroy <br>American freedoms.

Any suggestions?

Dear Constitutionalist:  
<p>
Yes.  Don't watch the network news, only read conservative newspapers and listen to conservative talk radio.  Since you don't get a balanced view of the world from the mainstream media anyway, you won't be missing anything except a rise in your blood pressure every time you read the paper or watch the news.

Dear Cleta,<br>
<p>
I live in Utah, where the local politicians talk conservatively but act <br>like big spending liberals. For example, our governor actively pursues states <br>rights while he continues to support dumping large amounts of money into <br>a failing educational system and does not support vouchers.
<p>
How can we convince "conservative" politicians to support conservative causes?
<p>
-- Truly Conservative
</pre>
<p>
Dear Truly:
<p>
There are only two things that influence a politician:  votes and money.   The state teacher organizations have a lot of influence even with conservative Republican governors  because they represent lots of votes.  And not only do the teacher unions control the education agenda in most states, but the state school boards association, the school administrators organizations, and even the PTA are all together when it comes to opposing vouchers.  Until and unless the rank and file taxpaying public get organized to support parents' rights in the use of their tax dollars for school choice, the aforementioned organizations (which mostly operate with tax dollars, by the way) will continue to dominate the issue of vouchers, even with governors like Mike Leavitt.  In Utah, however, I would think that a natural ally for you would be the Mormon Church.  Do you know where it stands on school vouchers?  My advice would be to start organizing Mormon parents to get the church to be supportive of vouchers.  Add to that the parents who home school, the Christian Coalition and other family groups,  teachers who are willing to speak out against their union leadership on this issue, Catholic school parents and leaders, and you will have put together a grassroots coalition of parents and taxpayers who represent a lot of votes.  Then, your governor will start to pay attention.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
With the federal government doing so many detrimental things in so many <br>different arenas, what can a person do to combat this overwhelming takeover <br>of our God-given freedoms? Do we even have a Constitution any more? How can <br>they get away with this?
<p>
--Drowning in a sea of politicians
</pre>
<p>
Dear Drowning:
<p>
They get away with it for two reasons:  First,  because the careerists in Washington -- of BOTH political parties -- are more concerned about "getting things done on Capitol Hill" than in making sure they stop bad things from being done.  A good example is what has happened to the Republican Congress in the last six months.  The Democrats have basically put themselves back in charge of Congress and the Republicans have let them be back in charge -- so we have the GOP Congress passing an increase in the minimum wage because the minority (the Democrats) demand it.  That's why I love the House freshmen -- they aren't afraid to take a stand and draw a line in the sand.  It outrages all the insiders -- but the bad things have happened here due to the "go along, get along" philosophy that has ruled Washington for such a long time.
<p>
Second reason:  because average hardworking Americans are not equipped with the right kind of information to do anything about any of this.  Most people have no idea how their representatives and senators in Congress really vote on things that people care about.  And trying to find out voting records is not easy.  So we (my colleagues and I) are working to come up with a system to provide specific information to citizens on a regular basis about how the congressmen and senators vote on things -- and whether the votes are liberal or conservative.  Watch for more information about this effort!  I think if the public knew how most of these congressmen vote, the voters would make changes in Congress.  The politicians fear that, too, which is why they make it so hard for the public to know what they're doing.  We're working on a way to change that.

Dear Cleta:

     How do I get my local newspaper to print my 'letters-to-the-editor'?

     It is my humble opinion that my letters are both cogent and relevent, 
yet they are rarely printed.  They are not overly wordy nor are they blazing 
tirades, but rather are reasoned opinions on todays issues.  I usually open 
with a statement, build a reasoned argument supporting my opening statement 
and then close with a call to action.  I always include my name, address 
and phone number with the letter for verification.

     Can you offer some suggestions?  If you would like, I can send an 
example of a recent letter for your critique.

Cordially,
Robert
</pre>
<p>
Dear Robert:  
</p>
<p>      You didn't say where you're from, so I don't know if you live in a big city or a small town.  Big city papers are the worst -- they are hard to crack because people don't know one another personally.  In a smaller community, the editors tend to know the folks who write letters.  Here are some suggestions:  Call the editor who puts together the letters page (or feature) and ask for an appointment.  Go see the editor and take some of your rejects.  Ask for constructive criticism and try to find out why none of your letters have been printed.  If the editor is a decent person, he/she will try to be helpful and may give you some pointers.  What will really happen is he/she will have a face to put with your name and you'll probably get your next letter printed.  If the editor is a jerk, document the way you were mistreated and send a letter to the editor's boss, usually the managing editor, with a copy to the jerk.  You'll never get a letter printed afterwards but it's not happening now either -- so at least you may be the one who sensitizes the paper a bit for the next guy.
<p>
     The problem with most newspapers is there is little or no competition.  But if there are weekly papers or other community papers in your area, don't overlook those.  They tend to be much more receptive to letters and citizen involvement.  And if you have a local radio talk show, be sure to call and tell your story there about how the newspaper is blacking out your opinions.  One of the reasons that radio talk shows are so successful is because people who have been shut out of many newspapers finally have an outlet.
<p>
     Good luck -- and keep writing (and expressing) your opinions!
</p>
<pre>
Dear Cleta:

     I live in the 20th Congressional District of Texas, "represented" by 
Henry B. Gonzalez, a fat socialist thug who beat up a constituent with whom 
he disagreed in a public restaurant in San Antonio.  The case went to court, 
where Gonzalez's wrists were slapped.  He has a Republican opponent, James 
Walker, who needs help in his campaign.  You don't have to be a rocket 
scientist to know if Gonzalez were backed with tanks and guns he'd be a 
communist.  Ideologically, he thinks just like a communist.  But, lo and 
behold, Walker IS a rocket scientist!  He's a smart guy who can use our help.  
The redrawn district has many independents and conservatives, while many of 
its yellow-dog Democrats may not vote out of disgust for Gonzalez, who was 
nowhere to be found during the fight to save Kelly AFB--in his 20th District--
from the chopping block.

Sincerely,
Marco
</pre>
<p>
Dear Marco:
</p>
<p>  See my advice in our    <a href="/abic/letters/letter-3.html.cgi">first Capital Letters column</a> regarding my representative, Connie Morella.  The same advice holds true for every incumbent.  One difference is that you have a candidate right now.  If he doesn't have a lot of money, it may take more than one race for him to win.  Remember, an entrenched incumbent may have to face a tough challenge a couple of times before it's successful.  And sometimes the mere fact that he/she is facing a tough race is enough to cause him/her to take that fat congressional pension and retire.  
<p>
     In Gonzalez's case, his taxpayer supported pension is worth over $1.2 million.  Why not round up some money and run some radio ads telling people that Gonzalez voted against term limits, against the balanced budget amendment and has a big fat congressional pension that he's voted for himself?  And if it doesn't work this time, just keep working on letting people know how he votes.  It certainly doesn't represent the thinking of that district, I'm sure.  Don't let him get by with it!  Just tell on him every chance you get.
<p>
<p>
<pre>

Dear Cleta:

     Very nice web page!  Listen, you think you have problems with Connie 
Morella?  My Congressman, Albert Wynn (D-MD 4) makes Rep. Morella look like 
a right wing conservative!  This district is one of those "minority" 
districts that is full of government employees, very liberal, etc.  Wynn 
takes elections with 75+% of the vote, and gets lots of AFL-CIO money.
How do we get HIM to listen to logic and reason, or, in the alternative,
displace someone like him?

Signed,
Ron
</pre>
<p>
Dear Ron:
<p>
     You've just advanced a major reason why the "apartheid" districts have been held unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court.  Race cannot be used as a factor in determining the congressional district boundaries.  Unfortunately, political persuasion and incumbency can -- and that is what matters most to incumbents.
<p>
     In the meanwhile, I believe that most black voters are much more conservative than their representatives.  Think about putting together a group of thoughtful constituents in Wynn's district that is bi-racial.  Visit some black ministers and start talking with them about family values and morality issues.  Most minority voters support issues like school choice, term limits, and conservative positions on social issues. Most minority representatives in Congress vote the other way.  See if you can build some common ground with some of the minority citizens who share your views on issues -- and once you get to know one another, perhaps you can reach consensus on some issues on which Wynn votes wrong.  Your activist group might be able to persuade him to change his voting pattern - or perhaps you can begin grooming a replacement who would be more in line with your views.  Don't just assume that minority voters are in tune with their Congressional Black Caucus.  On many, many issues, that is not the case.  The problem is that members of the Black Caucus rarely have any opponents so they vote however they want to.  It is a disgraceful situation and one that is perhaps being changed by the recent Supreme Court rulings on the racial gerrymandering.
<p>
     P.S.  Thank you for the compliment about the web page!  We're glad you're enjoying it!

Dear Cleta,

I am interested in helping organize a group of neighbors for a specific 
cause. Without too much detail, let me briefly explain the problem.
In a middle class neighborhood in which the residents are hard working,
honest citizens, an individual has recently purchased a house citizens,
an individual has recently purchased a house for the purpose of renting
it out. The individual is developing a pattern of renting to people 
who seem to be prone to criminal activity. The house has become a slum 
in the middle of the neighborhood. There has been constant traffic in 
and out of this house and subsequently the neighborhood. Some of these
individuals are known drug users. There have been people sleeping in 
junk cars on the property. There have been numerous residential 
breakins. Several neighbors have witnessed pot smoking in the front 
yard by some of the seven adults that live there. The response from 
the landlord, who lives in another part of town but whose ex-wife lives
next to the rental property, has been something like, "Well, they pay 
their rent on time."

Can we do anything not only to clean the situation up but to also 
prevent the landlord from repeating the act over and over?

A concerned citizen
</pre>
<p>
Dear Concerned:
<p>
<dd>Good for you for taking on illegal activities in your neighborhood!  Keep 
in mind the 3 things you must do to win this fight: 1) gain allies and friends 
2) document everything and 3) make as much noise as you can among decision 
makers. Big shots hate 
noisy constituents.
Some specific suggestions:
<ol>
<li>Document the incidents you wrote about, including the residential break-ins.  List dates and times; take photographs and keep taking them every couple of days.  Build a file.
<li>Check your zoning laws.  Do the laws for your neighborhood permit rental to other than single families?  If not, report (in writing) the violation of the law to your planning and zoning commission, with the documentation.  There are probably also zoning laws about "eyesores" and "public nuisances".  Talk to the city attorney's office in your community and find out what the law is and what the procedures are for getting city action.  You're paying the city attorney--use his/her services as much as possible.
<li>Circulate a petition in your neighborhood. Get signatures from as many of  your neighbors as possible on a petition calling on the landlord to evict the current tenants and supervise the property more carefully.  Rouse the rabble on your side.
<li>Send copies of the petitions and documentation to:
<dd>-- your local elected officials;
<dd>--your local newspapers.  Contact the "metro" section, not the editorial and major reporting side if it's a large paper.  If it's a small paper, it doesn't matter.  Call the managing editor and ask him/her to send out a reporter.  
<dd>-- local TV stations.  Many have developed programs such as "In your corner" where they help citizens take on city hall and that type of thing.  Call your TV stations, and send them copies of your documentation.  If there are good visuals, they might send out a camera crew and do a story.


<dd>-- your local police chief and/or supervising officer in your area.  Follow up with a call to the police and ask what they are doing about this situation.
<li>Organize a meeting of your neighbors in one of your homes to discuss legal action. Call your Mayor and city council member(s) and invite him/her to attend the neighborhood meeting, at which you should present the evidence (again) of the situation and ask what they intend to do about it. Put the officials on the spot. Invite the landlords to attend and explain what they plan to do about the situation.  Invite the press.
<li>Is there an attorney in your neighborhood?  Do any of the neighbors have a son or daughter who is an attorney?  That may become a necessity at some point -- although I'm always hesitant to tell people to hire/listen to an attorney.  They're not universally good and sometimes they are too afraid to lead your group in a fight.  But it wouldn't hurt to start assessing potential attorneys that might be available to help out if you need to file legal proceedings.
<li>Organize a group to appear at your city council meeting if the private meetings don't produce any results.
</ol>
<dd>If you try these things and nothing happens, write me back and we'll figure out what to do next.
<p>

Dear Cleta:

I am a College Professor who became active in local Republican 
politics in the late 80s, on the assumption that all political 
should begin locally. Now, I find myself on the Board of Directors 
of a group called United Conservatives of Ohio.  (I live and teach
in the Dayton, Ohio area.)  UCO does little now except to rate state
legislators (Senators and Assemblymen) and publish these ratings,
something like the American Conservative Union, with which we are 
loosely affiliated.  I would like them to do more than this.  What
do you think of the following, and is there anything you would add to
the list:
 
-a "Home Page" on the Web;
-a quarterly newsletter, focusing on state rather than national issues;
-broader solicitation for funds (at present, we are mostly supported by 
lobbyists and a biennial fund-raising dinner).

We already have a PAC, legally separate from UCO, which doles out tiny 
contributions (in the $100 to $500 range) to candidates for the Ohio 
Legislature.

Thank you in advance for any hints you may have.

Board Member, United Conservatives of Ohio

</pre>
<p>
Dear United Conservatives of Ohio:

<dd>Good for you!  Organizing a statewide entity, having a PAC and hosting a biennial dinner are great activities.  A Web site is another good idea.  Maybe your site should be hooked up with Town Hall somehow, the national conservative web site, so other Ohio folks can find you more easily on the web.
<p>
<dd>One suggestion is to have press conferences during this fall election season where you present your endorsement and contribution directly, in person to the state legislative candidates you've endorsed.  Have a prepared statement as to why this good candidate has garnered your endorsement, the issues that he/she has been particularly good on, and a paragraph about your organization and how to contact it. Have photographers and local reporters there -- or go the newspaper itself in the smaller towns and have your press conference at the newspaper offices. 
<p>
<dd>This is a way for your $100 contribution to be turned into several hundred dollars worth of free press, plus, you look a candidate/legislator in the eye and say thank you publicly at a time when it means something to them.  They will be even more committed to your issues thereafter!
<p>
<dd>Good luck!

<dd>First, this is a long term proposition -- it isn't going to be done overnight.  It will take at least 18 months of planning a campaign to get rid of her, and it might take two election cycles of intense effort.  It is difficult to get rid of an incumbent member of Congress without an infusion of major dollars and assistance like the labor unions are presently pouring into beating up on some of the freshmen.
<p>
<dd>Second, a small group of 5 to 10 people, dedicated to ridding the Congress of Rep. Morella should begin meeting monthly through the end of this year.  Who should come to the meeting?  People with a sincere desire to beat Connie Morella -- and at least one or two people who have been involved in politics in some form prior to this effort. The information at the meeting should include a map of the district and the voting patterns in both the GOP and Democratic primaries as well as the general elections from the past 3 cycles.  
<p>
<dd>Third, form some task forces: research (to gather information about her record); candidate recruitment (to develop a list of possible opponents for Rep. Morella); third, outreach (to develop a plan for broadening the circle of activists plotting her overthrow); fourth, finance (you can't do this for free).
<p>
<dd>Watch the fall campaign carefully and continue to meet monthly through December.  By then, you should have complete research on her record through this Congress and a sense of what it's going to take to beat her in two years.  When you've got that all assembled, write me again and we'll go from there.  
<p>
<dd>This is a good project.  I hope you'll do it.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<b>Dear MRC Member,</b>
<p>
<dd><big>W</big>elcome to <i>Flash</i>, the new monthly newsletter pub-lished exclusively for Media Research Center Members.
<dd>Why a membership newsletter? Actually, the idea is rather simple -- and overdue. Recently we conducted a survey of our supporters to see how well we were keeping you informed about our work at the Media Research Center. 
<dd>The results told me we needed to do a better job.  Members supporting our Entertainment Division efforts weren't aware of the work of the News Division. Subscribers to our newsletters didn't know we had recently opened an office in Hollywood, the Parents' Television Council. PTC supporters aren't following the work of our Free Enterprise and Media Institute. And so on. 
<dd>The survey pointed to the need for a publication for MRC members only. Hence, <i>Flash</i>.
<dd>Each month <i>Flash</i> will serve as your connector to the MRC and its special projects, giving you the timely information on the many projects you are sup-porting through your membership.  Our newsletters. Books. Media appearances. Special reports. Studies. Press releases. Our nationally syndicated column. And much, much  more. 
<dd>Through your newsletter you will also be apprised of  Members' discounts on our merchandise and publications.
<dd>We want you to be abreast of what's going on here and how your gifts make it possible for us to expose and challenge the liberal media.
<dd>As a supporter of the MRC, you understand that the national news media have used their power to promote their left wing views. 
And thanks to you, now the public is on to them, too!
<dd>The Times Mirror Corporation took a survey which shows that 43 percent of the public today believes the national news media set the national agenda. You and I have known that for years. Now, through our efforts, the public is catching on!
<dd>There is another critical front, the cultural wars raging in the entertainment industry. The MRC, through its Parents' Tele-vision Council arm, is leading the fight for pro-family values in entertainment fare. The PTC's mission is to bring responsible, family oriented programming to television, and to organize and mobilize Hollywood conservatives as national spokesmen for our cause.
<dd>The Media Research Center is the largest, most active organization in America identifying, exposing and confronting the liberal agenda of the news and entertainment industries. You make that possible with your support.
<dd> In these pages you'll see why <i>Time</i> (grudgingly) admitted that, "for quality, resources and sheer volume of output, the new star on the right is the Media Research Center."
<dd>We hope you enjoy Flash. And we welcome any questions, comments or suggestions you may have. Please contact us at 1-800-MRC-1423. Or drop me a line. It's always good to hear from you.
<p> 
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Networks Gnawing at Newt</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he national news media continue to ignore political scandals involving the Clinton administration, but wouldn't dare miss an opportunity to report any allegations, no matter how far fetched, against Republicans. MRC's news media analysts regularly follow this trend and expose the reporting of political scandals.
<dd>The results are predictable: biased reporting, chock-full of half-truths and outright distortions.
<dd>Take Newt Gingrich's book deal, for example.
<dd>The media have decided to link bulk sales of Gingrich's book, <i>To Renew America</i>, with violations by former Speaker Jim Wright with his book, <i>Reflections of a Public Man</i>. CNN <i>Prime News</i> anchor Linden Soles introduced a Bob Franken story: "This could be a case of what goes around come around," referring to Gingrich's expose of Wright's bulk book sales violation, which led to his resignation. 
<dd>An article in <i>Newsweek</i> went so far as to claim, "Former Speaker Jim Wright dismissed a pudgy, loudmouthed back-bencher named Newt Gingrich right up to the day in 1989 when Gingrich's guerrilla campaign forced Wright's resignation from the House. Now it appears that Gingrich has made exactly the same mistake".
<p>
<font size=+1><i><center>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that <br>the two deals have nothing in common.</center></i></font>
<p>
<dd>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that the two deals have nothing in common.
<dd>Wright's book deal gave him an outrageously high royalty of 55 percent -- from a publisher who happened to be a former employee.  Gingrich only earned the standard 15 percent from a real publisher. Wright's book was never even sold in bookstores, it was of-fered almost exclusively in bulk sales to lobbyists -- enabling him to get around House limits on honoraria income. 
<dd>Gingrich's book was a genuine commercial property, lasting 12-weeks on the best-seller list (selling close to a half-million books). In addition, the Gingrich book had a grand total of five bulk orders,  totaling just over 500 books.
<dd>Wright was charged with 69 counts of ethics violations -- and resigned in disgrace before being indicted.
<dd>Or take the case of another Democrat, former Speaker Tom Foley.  In 1993 the <i>Boston Globe</i> reported the SEC fined an investment firm $100,000 for giving friends preferential treatment with new stock offerings -- one friend being the former Speaker -- and the networks didn't even blink. Small investors like Foley are generally not privy to initial public offerings (IPOs).
<dd>With this information, Foley was reported to have reaped profits on eleven out of twelve initial public IPOs offered to him the previous year. And yet only one network (CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>) covered the story! The rest completely ignored Foley's investments.
<dd>Our news analysts uncover these facts, then distribute them to millions of people around the country on a regular basis. Research like this is made possible thanks to your support.

<center><h2>FEMI Calls Journalists On The Carpet</h2></center>
<h3>Here's a Pop Quiz:</h3>

<dd><big>R</big>epublicans in Congress propose to balance the budget while increasing spending by 50 percent over 7 years.
<dd>President Clinton calls this a massive cut and shuts down the government for about a week in protest.
<dd>Guess which side the media took.
<dd>It wasn't difficult to predict that they would parrot Mr. Clinton's point of view. That's what they usually do. But something needed to be done about it, or else the American people wouldn't hear the truth.
<dd>That's where the MRC's Free Enterprise and Media Institute steps in. After analyzing the biased coverage of the first few days of the shutdown, FEMI issued a rapid-response study rebutting the media's liberal spin. 
<dd>In the middle of the shutdown, the study of the first few days' coverage was faxed to hundreds of journalists, press secretaries on Capitol Hill, and prominent conservatives.
<dd>The study found that journalists were refusing to report that spending under the GOP plan was actually increasing; and that reporters were only interviewing people upset about the shutdown while ignoring the nearly half of all Americans who thought it wasn't a problem.
<dd>Lo and behold, coverage started to change! The night after we faxed out the study, NBC News produced a report showing how most people outside the beltway weren't put off by the shutdown.  
<dd>An on December 12, ABC's <i>Nightline</i> exposed Mr. Clinton for lying about GOP "cuts." They actually showed, with a graph on screen, how Republicans were planning on increasing federal spending.
<dd>Keeping the media on their toes is our mission! But we need your help in order to continue this fight.

<center><h2><i>Family Guide</i> Gives Parents the Facts</h2></center>

<dd><big>P</big>arents are fed up with the values their children are learning from network television. This year it's worse than ever.  The four major networks appear to be engaged in a fierce competition for the dubious honor of seeing just how many obscenities, lewd remarks, and sexual situations they can pack into a nighttime television program.
<dd>And the family hour -- the  8 p.m.. time slot dedicated for children's programming -- is now the time slot for some of the worst programming of them all.
<dd>As much as parents may want to do it, there's no way anyone can monitor everything on network television today. This year there are over 90 different programs on network prime time television alone. That's all changed now.
<dd>Through our West Coast office, the Parents' Television Council, we have released the <b><i>1995-`96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the first ever comprehensive review of the values presented on every single network evening program.
<dd>MRC analysts reviewed thousands of hours of program footage to compile the <i>Family Guide</i>. They looked at all NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox shows as well as the newest offerings from the WB and UPN networks.
<dd>Rather than look at the artistic merits of a show, the guide analyzes it from the standpoint of values. Which shows are offensive for children? Which shows are highly recommended?
<dd>The Guide is presented in an easy to read format.  Every show on network television is presented with a brief "background" section about its themes, and that's followed with a "summary" outlining what is offensive, or what is recommended.
<dd>The guide is presented with a stoplight format. Red lights are given to those programs not recommended for youngsters; yellow lights for those that contain questionable material; and green lights for those that are recommended for children.
<dd>In November, MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III and Parents' Television Council Co-Chair-man Shirley Jones held a press conference in Hollywood to officially release the <i>Family Guide</i>. As Ms. Jones put it, "The <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i> [is] a new and vital weapon in the fight for [children's] minds. That it has not been available until now is only testament to our parental impotency, that as of this day and this announcement is no longer acceptable."
<dd>Many others have praised the <i>Family Guide</i> including William Bennett, who described it as "an excellent resource: objective, accurate, easy to use...the Media Research Center has been doing good work for a long time. [The <i>Family Guide</i>] will surely reinforce its reputation."
<dd>We hope to distribute tens of thousands around the country this year. To help pay for this very expensive project, we are offering the <i>Family Guide</i> at a special rate for our members. With this guide in hand you won't have to worry anymore about the poison on prime time television affecting the children.

<center><h2>Festering Foster</h2></center>
<dd><bing>S</big>everal new developments renewed questions about White House actions related to the Travel Office firings and the death of Vince Foster.  But you wouldn't know if from watching network news.  On October 24 the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released a May 14, 1993 memo from then-White House aide David Watkins in which he said the First Lady told him to replace career Travel Office employees with a private firm partially owned by a friend.  That contradicted statements made by White House officials over the past two years.  The next day, three handwriting experts asserted that Vince Foster's suicide note was a forgery, thereby implicating White House employees in a grand deception.
<dd>With the exception of a brief mention on NBC's <i>Today</i> on October 29 the networks were silent.  <i>Today</i> co-host Jack Ford asked Tim Russert about "new questions raised about the death of Vince Foster" which "curiously didn't get much coverage at all, the idea now that some experts are questioning the legitimacy of that suicide note."

<p>
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> Welcome to Meet the Media, the fantasy world of objective journalism, where some of the most important media leaders in the land convene to give you the unfettered truth, the expert analysis concerning the important issues of the day. Today we look at the budget crisis. Let me start with you, E.J. If Bill Clinton were to sign the GOP bill, what would happen?</FONT>
<p><b>E.J. Dionne (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "I think that with those kinds of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people."
<p><b>Alan Murray (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>):</b> "If enacted it  would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor. It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Wait a moment, Alan, you sound like Dick Gephardt here. The Republican bill includes a spending increase of $2.6 trillion over the next seven years. That's hardly a much smaller government."</FONT>
<p><b>Robert MacNeil (PBS):</b> "Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of what the Republicans have proposed to slash."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "But that's my point. Politicians like Daschle and Clinton talk about $271 billion in cuts for Medicare but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than 1995. That's an increase of 6 percent annually, far more than inflation. It sounds like the Democrats don't have their facts straight, Eleanor."</FONT>
<p><b>Eleanor Clift (<i>Newsweek</i>):</b>  "The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital, bell  ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be."
<p><b>Tom Brokaw (NBC):</b> "Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?"
<p><b>John Yang (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "I thought I just explained to you that under the Republicans there are no massive spending cuts proposed! And even with the tax cuts, the Republican plan projects tax revenues to increase by 41percent over the next seven years."</FONT>
<p><b>Dan Rather (CBS):</b>  "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and to extreme."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Dan, are you listening? Oh, never mind. Let's move on. The political landscape. Who can the Republicans count on for support?"</FONT>
<p><b>Clarence Page (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>):</b> "Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Whoa! You may not like the Republicans, but where did that come from?"</FONT>
<p><b>Michael Gartner (<i>USA Today</i>):</b> "There's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Really? Conservatives, particularly the religious right, will tell you he's completely out of step with the cultural revolution sweeping the land. Just look at the outpouring of love for Pope John Paul II when he was here last month."</FONT>
<p><b>Timothy McNulty (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</b> "Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of propose laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of Presidents Clinton's warnings."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "OK, so it's resolved: the Pope's a Democrat. We've only got a few seconds left. Last question to Cokie: Is there a bias in the media's coverage of the budget debate?"</FONT>
<p><b>Cokie Roberts (ABC):</b>  "I think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal versus conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending  money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  And that's the last word. A final programming note for our audience. I, of course, am a fictional creation. My guests are not, and neither is every single quote attributed to them. Have a good day.</FONT>

<center><h2>Prime Time's Missing Mangers</h2></center>
<dd><big>H</big>ave you noticed what's passing for holiday fare on prime time television these days?
<dd>Sure, the networks air special Christmas episodes of their shows, but how many actually deal with Christmas?
<dd>Here at the Media Research Center, our Entertainment Division decided to take a closer look at the content of the networks' holiday offerings.
<dd>In our review of 1994 prime time holiday-themed shows, we found that some contained secularized statements of religious principles, but only a few dealt with the Biblical significance of Christmas, or touched on Scripture at all.
<dd>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the Christmas season.
<dd>ABC's <ii>Roseanne</i> was the top offender both in 1994 and 1995. How difficult would it have been to offer one, just one episode that contained family values, that celebrated the Christmas spirit? Surely out of respect for the holiest seasons, Roseanne would tone down her assault on traditional values.
<p>
<center><i><font size=+1>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good <br>deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the <br>Christmas season.</font></i></center>
<p>
<dd>But if you believe that you don't  know Roseanne. This is an actress who enjoys not just assaulting, but insulting family values. And she saves her best for Christmas.
<dd>Her 1994 episode concerned her son's erections at inopportune times, such as while standing at the chalkboard during class. The show ended with Roseanne reciting slang terms for erections: "pitching a trouser tent," "standing up for democracy," and so on. In 1995 she was even worse. So offensive was her December 12 episode that ABC moved the show from its usual 8:00 time slot to 9:30.
<dd>It centered on the wedding of Roseanne's boss Leon to Scott. Yes, a gay marriage, in the middle of the most family-oriented time of the year.
<dd>Not surprising that lewd "humor" pervaded the episode. When Scott, alluding to their upcoming honeymoon, suggested to Leon, "Next week, we could be snorkeling in the nude," Roseanne quipped, "Snorkeling, huh? Well, I guess you can learn a new word for it every day." Just before the wedding, Scott said to Leon, "I love you in a way that is mystical, eternal and illegal in twenty states." And after a minister performed the ceremony, they kissed. Merry Christmas from ABC Television Entertainment.
<dd>There was, however, one holiday program worth looking out for. A syndicated special entitled, <b><i>Red Boots for Christmas</i></b>, is helping to disseminate the true message of the season. 
<dd>The animated half-hour is based on a German folk tale which tells of a grouchy shoemaker who learns that the essence of Christmas is not wrapped presents under a tree, but rather God's gift to humanity: a Savior. 
<dd>Your support  of our enter-tainment division enables us to find new ways to expose how much Hollywood's leftist views differ from those people in Middle America.
<dd>We are offering the <i>Prime Time Christmas Study</i> to our members only. Please see <a href="#order">this</a> for ordering information.

<dd><big>D</big>on't you wish you could tune-in to a program to hear what this year's presidential candidates have to say without one-sided commentary... without dishonest half-truths... and without all the hype by the national news media? And don't you wish you could tune-in to a program where someone was monitoring the national news media for a change? Well, now's your chance! Throughout this election year, you can catch Brent Bozell weekly on <i>Race For the Presidency, The Candidates In Their Own Words</i>.
<dd>Each week, Brent goes head-to-head with Sandy Ungar, the liberal Dean of Communications from American University, giving commentary on the national news media coverage of the candidates and the issues.
<dd>The program, now in it's third month on the air, reaches over 20 million households, and has received a great viewing response. You can find the program on the national cable channel TV Network, as well as on National Empowerment Television (NET). Efforts are underway to offer this to PBS affiliates, and local public access networks.
<dd>To find out if <i>Race For The Presidency</i> is aired in your area, call TCI's viewer service line at 800-218-8077.

<center><h2> Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<dd><big>A</big>fter the 1994 elections I predicted we would see the most outrageous performance ever from the leftist "news" media. Unfortunately I was right -- and it was even worse than I feared. They have turned public support against conservatives. 
<dd>Our goal in 1996 is to neutralize their impact    -- to convince the public not to believe the propaganda being pushed by the media. Early this year we will announce, at a national press conference, our <b><i>Tell the Truth!</i></b> campaign. We will demand that the national media begin -- begin -- to cover the political landscape fairly.
<dd> The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> campaign will start with the formal release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception: Bill Clinton and the National Media</i></b>. It's a devastating, systematic review of how the media have  promoted Bill Clinton from 1991 through 1995. 
<dd>Just as our first book, And That's the Way It Isn't, gave the MRC its credibility initially, this book will give credibility to our national campaign since the findings are explosive and irrefutable.
<dd>The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> <b>Blast Fax Campaign</b> will combine two of the most successful political techniques undertaken in recent years. In 1992 the Clinton campaign was absolutely ingenious with its rapid response teams. James Carville and Co. were everywhere in the national media responding to anything and everything the Republicans had to say on a moment's notice.
<dd>In 1993 Bill Kristol had a crushing impact on the national health care debate by identifying the top public policy leaders in the country and releasing a regular series of impactful fax reports. He was able to change the entire dynamic of the debate along lines of conservatives' concerns.
The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> Blast Fax Campaign will combine both techniques. We are putting together a list of approximately 1,500 top public policy leaders -- with their fax numbers in order to reach them on a regular basis with our blast fax campaign. 
<dd>When there are developments of outrageous media propaganda (which will happen on a regular basis) we will be shooting out blast faxes around the country to put the press on the defensive immediately. 
<dd>In 1996, teams of <i>Tell the Truth!</i> analysts will be in both parties' convention cities. There we will set up offices and publish a daily report exposing everything the press is doing to slant convention coverage. And by making an issue of convention coverage well in advance, we can neutralize the press if they intend to do in 1996 what they did to conservatives in 1992.
<dd>There will be a flurry of activity by us through the mainstream press.  I will continue to do my twice-weekly syndicated column as well as my weekly television commentary on the TCI television network, and will be writing a series of guest editorials on the subject for major publications like the <i>Wall Street Journal, National Review</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>.
<dd>As for our plans to neutralize the media during the presidential elections, we've got our bases covered. These plans are very expensive, however. So, we will be counting on your continued support throughout this very important election year, and I hope I can count on you.

<center><h2>The Bad and the Biased</h2>
<h3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995</h3></center>
<h3>For a sampling of some of the awards, the envelope, please:</h3>
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t has become a tradition at the Media Research Center to present an annual awards issue -- <b><i>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995 </i></b>-- to highlight the year's worst reporting. Each year dozens of conservative writers and talk show hosts gather together to "honor" those responsible for the most irresponsible comments.  
<dd><i>The Best Notable Quotables</i> is the MRC's most popular publication. It is reproduced in papers, the topic of conversation on radio and television talk shows across the country. 
<dd>So how do the media react to our awards?
It's not surprising that the few conservatives in the press are thrilled with our findings and use them for their own ammunition against the liberal media.
<dd><i>National Review</i> ran an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables of 1995</i> in December. 
<dd>Mike Rosen, talk show host and columnist, ran excerpts from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> recently in his column.
<dd>Ray Archer, editorial writer for <i>The Arizona Republic</i>, ran quotes from the <i>Best Notable Quotables</i>, and said this of our examples of the liberal media: "There's no dearth of venom spewed by those who typically tout the liberal line."
<dd>Jeff Jacoby, columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>, used an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> to prove his point in his column entitled, "How the right is demonized."
<dd>The Minneapolis <i>Star Tribune</i> ran a story on January 1 showing both sides of the media bias issue.  It's funny how the <i>Tribune</i> used all empirical, hard evidence from the <i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i> to back up our side, yet when it came to presenting Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's -- FAIR, an organization which alleges <i>conservative</i> media bias -- position, the Tribune printed an opinion column from a FAIR employee, without, as usual, any evidence.
<dd>Not every story based on the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> was positive. 
<dd>Of course, we don't expect the "journalists" who win these awards to be happy that we've exposed their biases. 
<dd>Take Clarence Page, columnist and winner of <i>Notable Quotables'</i> year-end Award for Hypocritical Hate Mongering (for his claim that "most of the KKK ha[ve] joined the Republican Party"). He targeted the MRC and the Best Notable Quotables as the topic of a recent column which ran in the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> 
<dd>He couldn't understand why anyone would take offense to his remark, and cited as evidence that membership in groups like the KKK had gone down during the `80s -- meaning that they were joining the Republican Party.  (How do you think liberals like Page would react if a conservative were to point out that membership in the Communist Party USA had declined in the `80s and that this meant that Communists were now supporting the Democratic Party?) 
<dd>For good measure, the peace-loving Mr. Page concluded his piece by calling supporters of the MRC -- "brownshirts."
<dd>For a full listing of the outlets which have carried our research recently, please turn to page <p>
<center><h3>We'll Decide Who's a Mean-Spirited Republican Award...</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"The Republican  jihad against the poor, the young, and the helpless rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too cruel, no budget cut too loathsome for the party that took control of Congress at the beginning of the year and  has spent all its time since then stomping on the last dying embers of idealism and compassion in government."
<p>
<i>--New York Times</i> columnist and former NBC reporter Bob Herbert.
<p>
<center><h3>But It's Okay for Us to Hate Them Award (for Hypocritical Hatemongering)</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there."
<p>
-- <i>Chicago Tribune</i>'s Clarence Page, commenting on the Million Man March. Page has now written a nationally syndicated column attacking the MRC and <b>defending</b> that comment.
<p>
<center><h3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</h3></center>
<dd>"The scariest of all hobgoblins may be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' vacated by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<p>
-- <i>Time's</i> Jack E. White.
<p>
<center><h3> Republicans Make Us Sick Award</h3></center>
<dd>"Next week on ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, a series of reports on our environment which will tell you precisely what the new Congress has in mind: the most frontal assault on the environment in 25 years. Is this what the country wants?"
<p>
-- a Peter Jennings promotional spot.
<p>
<center><h3>Americans with Mathematical Disabilities Award (for Calling Hikes a Cut)</h3></center>
<dd>"House Republicans denied any impropriety when they approved federal budget reductions of $17 billion and outlined $190 billion more, slashing programs that largely benefit women, children, and the poor, to pay for that 'pouting sex kitten' mistress of their dreams -- tax cuts."
<p>
 -- U.S. News "reporter" Gerald Parshall giving the public "facts."
<p>
<center><h3>The Politics of Meaninglessness Award (for the Silliest Analysis)</h3></center>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings, with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?"
<p>
-- PBS' <i>To the Contrary</i> host Bonnie Erbe, equating gruesome skull-crushing partial-birth abortions to...eating veal. <p>

<center><h3>The Dumbest Quote of the Year</h3></center>
"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it."
<p>
-- NPR's Nina Totenberg, reacting to Senator Jesse Helms' inquiry about AIDS getting more funding than cancer or heart disease.

<center><h2>New Horizons for the Entertainment Division</h2></center>
<dd><big>1</big>995 was a year of change for the MRC's 
Entertainment Division, changes which will greatly raise our profile and increase our influence in the American culture war. 
<dd>Our new mission was in large part inspired by prime time television's new agenda. In the late 1980s and early '90s, many shows were politically themed. Whether it was <i>L.A. Law</i> trashing Operation Desert Storm, <i>thirtysomething</i> promoting abortion, or <i>Designing Women</i> crusading for most every liberal cause under the sun, the small screen seemed at times to overflow with political advocacy. 
<dd>Of late, though, there has been much less explicit political content on entertainment television. 
That's the good news. 
<dd>Instead of politics, prime time is now emphasizing values, but -- here's the bad news -- Hollywood is now as hostile to traditional morality as it ever was to Ronald Reagan and Dan Quayle.
<dd>Tune in pretty much any time -- even during the so-called "family hour," between 8 and 9 p.m. -- and you'll see this for yourself. Popular series such as <i>Friends and Seinfeld</i> promote premarital sex. Obscenities are frequent on such shows as <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>Law & Order</i>. Parental authority is ridiculed on the likes of The Simpsons and Married...With Children. Worst of all, what was once the family hour (8-9 p.m. EST) is now reserved for many of the most offensive programs.
<dd>Yes, when it comes to what Hollywood is teaching our children, the battles are now over values, not politics. 
<dd>To put ourselves on the front lines, last year we established the Parents' Television Council, whose task is to promote responsible prime time programming by working directly with the entertainment industry.
<dd>Though the PTC is headquartered in southern California, its research ammunition will come from the MRC's main office near Washington. In order to focus more of our resources directly on the West Coast, we have decided to discontinue the publication of TV, etc., the Entertainment Division's monthly newsletter. 
<dd>Under the new plan, some of the Entertainment Division's research and analysis will be issued in monographs like the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>; and some of it will emerge as MRC Special Reports, which will examine quantitatively the values promoted by prime time television. 
<dd>An example of the latter is our soon-to-be- released study of sexual content and vulgar language which has become a growing trend for the family hour. Yes, it seems that Hollywood is going out of its way once again to insult the traditional American family by airing material unsuited to children at an hour which in past years was set aside for family viewing. Our goal is to inform parents of these practices and through them to incite change in the entertainment industry.
<dd>We're confident that our revised approach will result in a product that will reach and enlighten an ever growing audience, particularly the parents most concerned about the poisonous values of the entertainment community.

<center><h2>PTC's <i>Family Guide</i> Makes a Splash</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Parents' Television 
   Council (PTC) is a special project of the Media Research Center. The PTC's 1995-'96 <b><i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the only publication written specifically to help parents determine appropriate television programming, has received national attention since its release in late November.
<dd>The Guide was unveiled at a Hollywood press conference featuring MRC chairman L. Brent Bozell III and actress <b>Shirley Jones</b>, Honorary Co-Chair of the PTC.
<dd>And, as if all that weren't enough, the Guide has at least one fan on Capitol Hill. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) was so impressed with the Guide that he plans to give a copy to each member of the House and has invited Brent Bozell to speak to Congress about the "influence of television on our culture" at a  "Members only" breakfast.
<dd>The PTC, Smith said, "provides Americans who want to see positive values instilled in children with an invaluable tool. The <i>Family Guide</i>...is the best summary of the values reflected in current prime time television programs that I've seen." 
<dd>Thousands of copies of the Guide now have been distributed, and its editor, Sandra L. Crawford, has conducted promotional interviews with such newspapers as the Detroit Free Press and The Washington Times as well as with such electronic outlets as the Newstalk TV cable network. 
<dd>The first television ad for the Guide aired in the Oklahoma City market.

<center><h2>FEMI Report Piques Media Interest</h2></center>
<dd><big>D</big>oes the profit motive determine what network executives put on prime time television, or is it their political ideology? 
<dd>Last summer, <b>MediaNomics</b>, the Free Enterprise & Media Institute's (a division of the MRC) newsletter, reported a strange phenomenon. 
<dd>The television networks, we reported, continue to produce prime time shows with extreme, anti-business environmental themes. It doesn't matter that such shows consistently get poor ratings. The anti-business, environmental extremism of television writers, producers, and executives forces the shows on the air.
<dd>The <i>MediaNomics</i> story caught the eye of <i>USA Today</i> magazine's editorial staff. They asked MediaNomics Editor Tim Lamer to expand the article into a story for an upcoming issue of the publication. In his report, Lamer shows how TV shows with environmental themes, such as the recently canceled seaQuest 2032 and the movie The Fire Next Time, garnered extremely poor ratings. Both took gratuitous slaps at business.
<dd>On the futuristic sci-fi show seaQuest, for example, ruthless businessman Larry Deon creates havoc for the world. He breaks off a chunk "the size of New England" from a polar icecap. He wants to flood the Middle East and create a market for his fresh water supply. (Does any of this sound the slightest bit plausible?)Viewers learn from Deon's opponent, Wolenczak, that "Lawrence Deon is a privateer, and his companies are turning the world's water supplies into sewage." Viewers also learn from another of Deon's opponents that "the man's been a grandstander since he sold IBM off in a yard sale when he was 23."
<dd>Deon also engages in piracy and tries to sabotage the Omni-Pacific, a transcontinental underwater railroad -- because it will compete with his airlines, don't you know? The government is afraid to try to stop Deon. One politician asks the crew of seaQuest: "So what are we sup-posed to do, embarrass him in front of the whole world? The last time we did that, he tripled the price of steel and nearly bankrupted the auto industry." 
<dd>America, meet the free enterprise system -- Hollywood style.
<dd>Lamer also points out that this business-bashing is not new to entertainment television. 
A 1992 FEMI study showed that business owners committed 43 percent of all crimes on television and 36 percent of all murders, far more than any other group, including politicians, lawyers -- even mobsters. All this from an industry that purports to "reflect reality."
<dd>FEMI, both through its newsletter and through respected national publications, continues to hold the networks accountable for their attacks on businessmen, society's innovators and job creators.

<center><h2><big>MRC</big> Board of Trustees Meeting</h2></center>
<dd>Each year the Media Research Center invites its Board of Trustees to Washington, D.C. to help chart  the future for the organization. It gives us a great opportunity to get input from some of the people who make our work possible through their donations. The Board met in Washington, D.C. on December 5 to formally review the MRC's work.
We think it's important to give MRC Members the same kind of information, so here are some highlights from the meeting:

Brent Bozell III informed the Trustees of the exciting new plans for its divisions and special projects in 1996 -- the Entertainment Division's new focus on family values and the Free Enterprise and Media Institute's joint projects with other conservative organizations -- also the News Division's plans to confront the leftist media during the upcoming presidential campaign with our <I><b>Tell the Truth!</b></i>  Campaign.
<dd>Among the dignitaries and special guests, Representative J.C. Watts, Jr. (R-Okla) addressed the Trustees. He said of the media: "When it comes to liberals and their lapdog media -- they can lie louder. They are shameless." The Oklahoma Congressman continued, "I have been amazed at how people will go to the well of the House or Senate and spew forth lie after lie and scare our citizens with lies. I have watched in horror as Katie Couric has treated the Speaker of the House [Newt Gingrich] or the Majority Leader [Dick Armey] like criminals for wanting to do the right thing. They can lie louder, but we can tell the truth longer."
<dd>He continued by congratulating the MRC on the opening of the Parents' Television Council in Hollywood. Rep. Watts also reinforced the fact that family values in the entertainment industry are not only entertaining, they are very good business. 
<dd>Syndicated columnist and CNN talk show host Robert Novak also spoke at our Board of Trustees function. Pointing out the simple fact that the majority of journalists are liberal, Novak outlined eight statements that  most members of the press would support:
<ol>
<li>The Republican budget will slash spending for women, children, and the poor.
<li>The U.S. has a global role to protect human rights wherever possible.
<li>Missile defense is a waste of money.
<li>A major purpose of government is income redistribution.
<li>Affirmative action programs are absolutely essential.
<li>The federal government alone can do much better than the states.
<li>Term limits are a bad idea.
<li>America is undertaxed.
<dd>Novak  proceeded by explaining that it's easy to see why the media are biased when you have a majority of journalists who agree with these points.
<dd>Some other special guests who attended the meeting included General Alexander Haig; Ed Capano, Publisher of <i>National Review</i>; Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe; and Arianna Huffington, MRC Trustee and Senior Fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t was early one evening and I was sitting with my young daughter, watching what I thought was a perfectly wholesome show on television. To my surprise and horror, the two main characters on this particular program began having an explicitly sexual conversation. 
<dd>Awkwardly I tried to draw my daughter's attention away from the lewd material coming from the television.
<dd>It's a scene repeated in homes all over America every night. The pollution on the airwaves -- even during the so-called "family hour" -- is out of control.
<dd>Like it or not, studies show that children admire and imitate their favorite celebrities more so than their parents, teachers, or religious leaders. 
<dd>And when surveys also show that by the time the average child graduates from high school he or she will have spent more time in front of a television than in the classroom, who is the teacher in society today?  
<dd>That is why the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division is taking giant steps to make television safe for children again.
<dd>For years Hollywood has been pushing the envelope on sexual themes and rough language. Now the networks have almost completely abandoned what was once the "family hour."  Shows still aimed at children contain some very adult-oriented -- and in some cases, highly offensive -- subject matter.
<dd>In February we released our study, <b><i>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>, and have made the networks' irresponsible programming the subject of a national discussion. 
<dd>We've launched a crusade which has gained support from both conservatives like Rep. Lamar Smith (R.-Tex.) and liberals like Senator Joe Lieberman (D.-Conn.) -- both of whom joined me at a national press conference to release this study on the "family" hour.
<dd>Last month I met with network executives in California. John Matoian (President of the Fox Entertainment Group) and had a very productive conversation about the state of prime time. The Senior Vice President of Programming for the Disney Channel, Bruce Rider, reaffirmed his network's strong commitment to family programming. Warner Brothers' Jamie Kellner told me that maintaining family-friendly programming standards was not only good for young viewers but very good for business -- and would be the cornerstone for this new network.
<dd>So there are good signs  that things are moving in our direction. But now is the time to work, and push, like never before. In these pages you'll get more information on our national campaign, all made possible because of your support.
Sincerely,
<p>
L. Brent Bozell III

<center><h2>Family Hour Findings</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>rime time television's traditional family hour -- 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 7-8 Central and Mountain -- traditionally has been home to scores of wholesome series, including <i>Little House on the Prairie, Happy Days, The Cosby Show</i>, and <i>Full House. </i>
<dd>Not anymore.
<dd>The "family hour" is now dominated by adult-oriented shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>Mel-rose Place</i>, with sexual content and obscen-ities prevalent across the dial. To document how pervasive the problem has become, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division studied a month's worth of "family hour" shows. On February 8 we released <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i> and opened up a new front in the American cultural war.
<dd>Our study found that certain words and expressions that as recently as the early 1990s were rarely heard on TV -- even late at night -- are now common between 8 and 9. "Kiss my ass," "bastard," and "bitch," among other vulgarisms, are now acceptable in the "family hour."
<dd>Of the networks, NBC easily won the foul-language award. It aired more than twice as many obscenities per hour -- 1.26 -- as any other network. Fox, ABC, and CBS turned in virtually identical per-formances, with each averaging just over one curse word for every two hours of 8-9 programming. The series with the most swearing was NBC's Mad About You, with seven obscenities; the same network's <i>JAG</i> followed with six. 
<dd>Depictions of sexual behavior were just as squalid. The former "family hour" constantly portrays premarital sex as frequent and permissible; in fact, during the study period, depictions of extramarital or premarital sex outnumbered those of sex within marriage by an 8-1 ratio.
<dd>Fox led the network standings with the most sexual treatments per hour, but the other networks were close behind. NBC's <i>Friends</i>, Fox's <i>Melrose Place</i> and <i>Martin,</i> CBS's <i>Cybill</i> and <i>Almost Perfect</i>, and ABC's <i>Ellen</i> and <i>The Drew Carey Show</i> are just some examples of shows with typically raunchy portrayals of sex.
<dd>A Vanishing Haven has gained the support of from both the left and the right. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) joined Brent Bozell at the Washington, D.C. press conference where the MRC introduced the study. 
<dd>After summarizing the study findings for reporters, Bozell discussed a letter sent to the entertainment heads of the television networks calling on them to air only "wholesome, family-oriented programming" between 8 and 9. Signers of the letter were Bozell, Lieberman, and Smith, and six other Congressional leaders: Senators Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and Representatives: Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), Steve Largent (R-Okla.), and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.)
<dd>"The bulk of TV programming has rapidly grown ruder, cruder, and lewder over the past few years," Sen. Lieberman remarked on the state of network programming standards. "I'm glad to join with the Media Research Center today to call upon the networks to reestablish the family hour...Like any other parent, I don't think it's too much to ask to have one hour [of TV] a night that's junk-free."
<dd>"Many TV shows aired during what should be [the] family hour are corrupting the morals and corroding the minds of a generation of Americans," Rep. Smith stated. "We hope TV producers will live up to their public trust and take their responsibility seriously."  
<dd>Not only did the study garner bipartisan support, it also attracted the attention of the national media. Even they can't disagree that television's programming standards have been heading steadily down- hill. 
<dd>The press conference generated massive coverage. Most networks covered the event; and stories appeared in <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>New York Post</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and the <i>Washington Times</i>. The study also was cited by numerous radio talk show hosts including, Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey. 
<dd>The debate is in high gear. Rupert Murdoch of Fox Television has now announced his network will institute a ratings system to monitor sexual content and violence on his shows. In the <i>Washington Post</i>, Bozell called this "a good first step," and added: "This is the man most responsible for pollution on the airwaves. Now he's saying he'll rate his pollution instead of doing what he should do. What he should do is get it off the air."

<center><h2>MRC Stamp of Approval</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>amela K. Long, the creator and executive producer of the new ABC family drama, <b><i>Second Noah</i></b>, recently met with Sandra L. Crawford, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division Director, to discuss the series and ask for the MRC's support; and <i>Noah</i> deserves our.
<dd>Filmed at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, <i>Second Noah</i> chronicles the hectic lives of Noah and Jesse Beckett. Noah (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is a former basketball coach and a best-selling novelist, while Jesse (Betsy Brantley) is the chief veterinarian at the Tampa Zoo. Mother and father to eight adopted children of various ethnic backgrounds, the Becketts also run an animal rescue operation, taking in abandoned or mistreated ani-mals. With love and compassion, Noah and Jesse face the daily challenges of raising eight children.
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> places great emphasis on personal responsibility and the family unit. The new series is filled with positive messages about honesty, understanding, and love. It respects religion and condemns racism. 
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> is a quality drama designed for family viewing. Since it has a rich and complex cast of characters to provide limitless possibilities for new stories, we hope <i>Second Noah</i> will be around to offer wholesome family entertainment for a long time to come.
<dd>The series airs on ABC, Monday nights at 8 p.m. EST.
<dd>If you'd like to learn which shows are family-friendly and which aren't, get the 1995-'96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television. Ordering information is provided on page 8.

<center><h2>CBS's Goldberg: Media are biased </h2></center>
<dd><big>V</big>indication is sweet. For years the Media Research Center has been documenting the liberal bias of the media, often provoking hostile denials by journalists. But now someone has joined our efforts -- and the support comes from a most welcomed quarter.
<dd>In a stunning <i>Wall Street Journal</i> column, CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg wrote that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." 
<dd>What prompted Goldberg to write the February 13 article was a <i>CBS Evening News</i> segment about the flat tax by Goldberg's colleague Eric Engberg. Engberg used such loaded words as "elixir" and "scheme" to describe the flat tax, "conjuring up images of Doctor Feelgood selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon," according to Goldberg.
<dd>Goldberg recounted how Engberg spent much of the story saying a flat tax would cause "hideous deficits" without mentioning the role of spending in recent deficit growth. Goldberg also pointed out how Engberg used only a liberal economist for his story, and didn't even label him as liberal, a privilege never granted to conservatives. Goldberg also revealed the networks' dirty little secret: "Part of the problem is that most reporters and editors -- television and print... don't know a capital gain from a mutual fund. This, as much as bias, in some cases leads to the kind of reporting we see on the flat tax and a lot of other economic issues."
<dd>With his temper, Engberg himself probably required several buckets of ice to cool down before pronouncing to the press: "I've never regarded myself as an ideological warrior of any kind."
<dd>And Dan Rather supported Engberg by declaring: "His hallmarks have always been fairness and accuracy."
<dd>Really? See for yourself if these Engberg reports strike you as "hallmarks of fairness and accuracy":
<dd>October 2, 1994, on Newt Gingrich: "From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism...the family values candidate who divorced his ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 22 checks at the House Bank and runs a big-dollar political action committee that won't disclose its contributors." He also called Gingrich "bombastic and ruthless."
<dd>August 28, 1993 <i>Face the Nation</i> question to conservative Rep. Gary Franks: "I know that many of the ideas that you advocate, self-help, up-by-the-bootstraps-type arguments, that has been used for years as an excuse for the government to do nothing, hasn't it?"  
<dd>October 5, 1992: "Feel-bad ads trying to drag down Bill Clinton are regarded as the only hope. In a multi-million dollar assault, Clinton is being portrayed as a duplicitous blobhead who governs a Hee Haw backwater where only the taxes soar. The ads are cleverly worded to suggest Clinton means more taxes." 
<dd>After exposing the Bush ad for relying on "assumptions" that Clinton would raise taxes, Engberg then asked Steven Colford of <i>Advertising Age</i> to describe "the stacking up of assumptions like this, there's a word we use for that." Replied Colford: "I think it's 'lying.'"
<dd>June 7, 1989, on China's Tiananmen Square massacre: "Will the military leaders there be embarrassed by this? Will this be something like Kent State was for our military?"
<dd>April 6, 1989: Engberg charged that in 1985, George Bush "carried promises of U.S. aid to the military dictatorship of Honduras." (Not true: CBS showed video of Bush hugging <i>democratically elected</i> civilian leader Roberto Suazo Cordova.)
<dd>Goldberg's friends told the <i>Washington Post</i>. "He has complained to CBS management about a liberal tilt for several years and has been consistently ignored." 
<dd>Is CBS's reaction to his published charges -- denial and arrogance -- any surprise?

<center><h2>Foreign journalists learn about MRC</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>s media bias just a problem in America? It may surprise you to learn that the Media Research Center's mission to encourage responsible journalism doesn't stop at the country's borders. The National Forum Foundation and Delphi International have made the MRC a popular stop for international journalists. The two groups, which arrange tours of the United States for foreign professionals, now regularly bring their guests to the MRC headquarters to learn more about what we do and the unique role we play in American politics.
<dd>Just in the past few months, reporters and journalism professors from Algeria, Austria, Gabon, Kyrgystan, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, and Russia have visited the MRC. Tim Lamer, Director  of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute, briefs them on the biases of the American media, what the MRC does to combat those biases, and the crucial role of strong watchdog organizations in a democratic society.
<dd>The questions they ask are wide-ranging and fascinating because they reflect the authoritarian backgrounds of their countries. "Does the MRC advocate censorship?" (No, we assure them, but we believe a free press does not mean freedom from criticism.) "Is the MRC funded by the government?" (No, we're funded by like-minded Americans who recognize the need for a check on the media's power, and who want the media held accountable for what they say and write.) In fact, we inform them, the press cannot truly be free unless both it and its critics are not entangled by government regulations and financing.
<dd>Some have expressed interest in someday starting an organization like the MRC in their own countries. Some have remained, working out of our office in order to learn the trade. Many of them find they can use our research for their work back home. All of them come away with a better understanding of the American media and the American political scene.
<dd>By supporting the MRC, you aren't just making the American media more responsible, you're being a positive influence on the global media.

<a name="welfare">
<center><h2>FEMI editor and the welfare debate</center></h2>
<dd><big>W</big>hile combating liberal media bias is the main mission of the Media Research Center, our staffers sometimes take on other issues as well. Example: Tim Lamer of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute recently wrote an article about welfare reform for <i><b>The Weekly Standard</b></i>, one of the conservative movement's premier magazines.
<dd>At issue was an amendment to the welfare reform bill offered by Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment would have allowed government to contract with religious charities to provide welfare services to the poor, as long as they didn't use the money to proselytize. Lamer argued that the amendment was a mistake on three grounds.
<dd>First, the reason religious charities do well is because they proselytize. If they're not allowed to do that, they won't be any more effective than government or other charities. Second, taxpayers of all religious stripes  -- whether Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, Jewish, Mormon, or whatever -- shouldn't be forced by the government into supporting faiths with which they disagree. Third, conservatives shouldn't be turning more charities into clients of the welfare state unless we want even more groups lobbying for big government.
<dd>Lamer's article ran in the January 15 issue of <b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b>.

<h3>L. BRENT BOZELL III</h3>
<h3>Franken Privileges: Cheap-Shot Satire</h3></center>
<dd><big>F</big>ew doubt that Al Franken's a genuinely funny guy. He wrote for <i>Saturday Night Live</i> during its golden age in the latter half of the 1970s; years later on SNL, he created and realized the character of wispy self-help sage Stuart Smalley and performed a hilarious impression of Sen. Paul Simon. 
<dd>Alas, national recognition for his ability to amuse apparently wasn't en-ough for Franken, who now styles himself a pundit as well. He says his sporadically laugh - provoking bestseller Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations (Delacorte) is a "satire about the breakdown in the civility of public discourse," but on the frequent occasions when his ideology crowds out his wit, he's unquestionably uncivil in his own right.
<dd>Is Franken a humorist seeking to score laughs or a polemicist out to slay the dragons of the right? To be sure, much of what he writes is clearly satirical. Of an exhibit at the never-built Disney's America theme park that was to have simulated what it was like to be a slave, he quips, "All I can say is that it [would have been] a gross distortion of history to have the Un-derground Railroad loop the loop." Not quite Jonathan Swift, but pretty clever. His political humor can carry a punch. But can conservatives take offense at a chapter titled "Pat Buchanan: Nazi Lover" when we've laughed uproariously at Limbaugh's "feminazi" digs? Not really, not if the intent is satire.
<dd>But that's where Franken fails. There's a certain venom in his pen that transforms humor into spite, and spite undisciplined becomes insult. Limbaugh thus becomes "mean," a "bully," and a "liar"; Limbaugh's fans are trashed as "yahoos" and "f---ing morons"; Buchanan's a "racist"; and anyone who thinks Ronald Reagan was the greatest President of this century is a "f---ing idiot." Casting aspersions on these and other con-servative personalities and causes, Franken's acting as a hatchet man -- no more, no less. 
<dd>Franken asserts that his harshness is ironic, that he's "making fun of meanness...by being mean myself." The problem with that argument is that amidst all the invective in his book, there's virtually no indication that he does not really despise his targets, or at least their politics. As far as keeping up with whether or not Franken is kidding at any given moment is concerned, Rush Limbaugh... is basically a 271-page shell game. 
<dd>Naturally, Franken's choice for the best President of the century is...Bill Clinton. "I was trying to write a scathing piece on Clinton," he declares, "and at a certain point it just became impossible...This kind of thing never happened when I was writing the Phil Gramm chapter." Gramm, on the other hand, is a "bastard" and a "big jerk." (But how dependable is Franken's opinion anyway? He's still trying to sell the long-debunked story that Gramm invested in a porn flick.)
<dd>Franken pulls out all the stops in a chapter concerned with 1) skewering Reaganomics and 2) blasting Limbaugh for his defense of same. Regarding said defense, Franken sneers, "These are the rational, carefully constructed, deliberate lies of a man running a gi-ant propaganda factory dedicated to two things: convincing people who were screwed sideways by Reagan-omics that it was actually good for them, and encouraging the people who turned the screws to feel good about themselves...Reaganomics worked. This is the jewel in Rush's crown of bulls--t."
<dd>If there is an economically sophis-ticated anti-Reaganomics case to be made, Franken doesn't make it, re-sorting instead to Richard Gephardt-like class-envy hackwork. As for most Americans getting "screwed side-ways," Franken apparently forgets that real income taxes paid by 90 percent of Americans fell by 10 percent from 1981 to 1987, while real income taxes paid by the richest five percent rose by nearly 43 percent in the same period. Add to that the obvious (seven years of prosperity; two decisive elec-tion victories for Presidential can-didates running on a Reaganomics-centered platform) and you realize why liberals in the entertainment community behave the way they do: Like Oliver Stone and his movies, Franken cannot defend the principles of liberalism -- so he enters the world of make-believe instead. Creative license, we're told.
<dd>Towards the end of that ill-fated chapter, Franken writes, "I think I'm really breaking new ground here. I mean, did you see bar graphs in Jerry Seinfeld's book? In Tim Allen's?" No, and the reason you didn't, obviously, is that Seinfeld and Allen had way too much comedic acumen to even dream of putting in bar graphs in the first place. There's some amusement to be found in Rush Limbaugh... but considered as political analysis, it is       -- in the derisive, non-funny sense -- a joke.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC member,
<p>
<dd>I predicted that the media would have a field day with the GOP primaries, and that's just what happened. I don't know if there's ever been more negative or slanderous coverage of candidates  than what Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and others have been subjected to this year. 
<dd>The media are complaining about how dirty campaigns have become, yet mud-slinging is the only issue they'll cover.  With all their attacks on GOP candidates, the media themselves are ignoring the real issues. 
<dd>A recent study, released by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, found that in campaign coverage "the networks devoted twice as many stories to the horse race (60) as the candidates' policies (30)." And let's not forget how negative the media themselves are. The same study showed reporters' "criticism of the race outnumbered praise by a 20-to-1 margin."
<dd>One blatant example of this was CBS's Eric Engberg's description of Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal as "wacky."  Even more flagrant was Ted Koppel's charge on Nightline that Buchanan is anti-Semitic.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>Bozell: "If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country." </font></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>While the media complain about negative campaigns, they are giving less and less time to candidates who are trying to explain their policies. The same study found that the average length of candidates' soundbites was only 7.3 seconds -- shorter than ever. The study also compared the amount of airtime given to GOP candidates (56 minutes) to airtime reporters spent analyzing what the candidates were saying (5 hours, 45 minutes).
<dd>If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country, because they are doing nothing to expose his record.
We <b><i>must</i></b> make the media accountable for their gaps in the truth and distortions of the facts. That is why the Media Research Center has launched a two million dollar campaign to <b>hold the media responsible for their liberally slanted reporting, and force them to begin to "Tell the Truth."</b> Thank you for helping us. 
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>MRC Welcomes new PTC Director Harry Medved</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Media Research Center is proud to announce that Harry Medved, the former National Communications Director of the Screen Actors Guild, has assumed his post as the Executive Director of the Parents' Television Council.
<dd>The Los Angeles based Parents' Television Council is a special project of the MRC. The PTC's goal to restore traditional family values to the entertainment industry.
<dd>"It is a privilege to have Harry Medved join the Parents' Television Council as the Executive Director." said MRC Chairman Brent Bozell in a national statement. "He brings a wealth of experience to the PTC.  Harry knows the industry and its people, and he will be a valuable leader in the efforts to restore family-friendly programming."
<dd>Medved's experience in the entertainment industry is indeed extensive. He is the co-founder of the multimedia company Hollywood Interactive, Inc., as well as the co-author of four books on motion picture history.  During his work for the Screen Actors Guild, he was responsible for overseeing all media relations. He has also co-authored four satirical books on the movie industry with his brother, the well known film critic Michael Medved.
<dd>Harry Medved's broad background provides him with the media savvy necessary to insure that the PTC will have an even greater impact on the debate over values in Hollywood. 
<dd>"I consider this a terrific opportunity to improve communications within the industry on these important issues," Medved remarked. "I look forward to working closely with network executives, producers, writers, directors and actors on this project to build bridges with families across the country."
<dd>Here at the MRC, we are confident that our fight for family values is taking a great leap forward with Medved taking the reins of the PTC.  He will be a valuable asset in our struggle to promote responsible programming, making television  safe for America's children.

<center><h2>FEMI Breakfast Forum A Huge Success</h2></center>
<dd>During his run for the Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes called for the overhaul of our hopelessly confusing tax system while replacing it with a flat tax. 
<dd>Reporters continuously savaged the flat tax, ignoring arguments supporting tax reform. Journalists called it "wacky" and "a cruel hoax." They said it would cause "hideous deficits." They labeled it an "economic elixir." They suggested it would add $140 billion to the deficit. They called it a tax increase on the poor, a tax increase on the middle class, and nothing but a tax cut for the rich.
<dd>According to many economists, it's none of those things. But you virtually never hear this side of the story in the news media.
<dd>That made the flat tax a perfect topic for a Free Enterprise & Media Institute Breakfast Forum. FEMI (a division of the Media Research Center) Breakfast Forums are held with the intention of bringing together conservative policy makers and journalists to discuss important economic issues, to acquaint journalists with conservative sources (whom they rarely quote) and their ideas.
<dd>The flat tax forum was held March 13 in Washington and included then-Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and former Congressman Jack Kemp. In his introduction of Mr. Forbes, MRC Chairman Brent Bozell emphasized that the event was not an endorsement of the Forbes candidacy. 
<dd>Mr. Forbes then proceeded to give a comprehensive overview on the history of taxation in America, then followed it with a thorough explanation of his flat tax proposal. Forbes explained how his plan would not increase taxes on anyone, and how it would cut taxes for everyone. He stressed that the only way to reduce the deficit  is to reduce spending, or have the economy grow, both of which a flat tax would accomplish. Forbes argued that because the flat tax would lower interest rates, it would help homeowners. As for complaints from charitable organizations, he showed how, throughout history, tax cuts have always generated increases in charitable giving by making people richer.
<dd>These were arguments that many reporters, trained on the short soundbite, had never heard. Forbes expressed his gratitude to the MRC for giving him this opportunity to go "beyond 30-second, or ten-second, or three-second soundbites, not trying to play gotcha, but trying to gain true understanding. As we say in <i>Forbes</i> magazine, out of Deuteronomy in the Bible, 'With all thy getting, get understanding.' I appreciate, Brent, this opportunity to help that process."
<dd>The FEMI Breakfast Forum was a huge press event. It drew all three broadcast networks, CNN, and C-SPAN. It also drew major print reporters, such as Michael Barone of <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Gerald Seib of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and Dan Balz of the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The forum also garnered stories in the <i>Washington Post, Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>, and on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>, among many others. The entire FEMI Breakfast Forum was shown on C-SPAN.

<center><h2>MRC Co-Sponsors  CPAC</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual convention held in Washington, D.C., brings together dozens of conservative leaders with thousands of grassroots activists. This year the Media Research Center co-sponsored the 23rd Annual Conservative Political Action Conference. 
<dd>CPAC is host to such groups as the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, and the National Rifle Association.
<dd>It is also a forum for thousands of conservatives from all regions to hear the conservative perspective on the key issues of the day. Noted speakers this year included Bill Bennett, Oliver North, Senator Phil Gramm (R.-Tex.), Congressman Bob Dornan (R.-Calif.),  Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes.
<dd>The Media Research Center played a major role at CPAC this year. MRC spokesmen met with our members and subscribers at the MRC's CPAC booth where we distributed  a wealth of information. 
<dd>The MRC also hosted an open reception for the CPAC attendees, where our supporters were able to talk with Brent Bozell and other key MRC staff. Bozell also moderated the annual debate between CNN's conservative Bob Novak and ABC's liberal Sam Donaldson. Always one of the highlights of the conference, this debate drew a capacity crowd. 
<dd>It was clear, from so many speakers' presentations as well as the mood of the CPAC attendees, that conservatives are fed up with the pervasive influence of the liberal media and their coverage of politics. 
<dd>It was equally emphatic that the movement sees the MRC as the leader in the fight to expose and neutralize this bias.

<center><h2><i>Time</i> Writer Damns Those Conservatives</h2></center>
<dd><i><blockquote>"I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have been named twice in your December 18 edition featuring the Best Notable Quotables of 1995. To be attacked by a mob of lunatics like your panel of judges is truly an honor. I will cherish it nearly as much as I do the condemnation I received from Louis Farrakhan's followers for criticizing the Million Man March and his recent tour of third world dictatorships. Please select me again!"</i></blockquote>
This is a letter to the Media Research Center from <i>Time</i> magazine's Jack E. White. 
White won the "Damn Those Conservatives Award" in our <i><b>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</b></i> for this quote from his June column:
<dd> "These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and Jesse the crank -- Helms that is, not Jackson. But the scariest of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' left by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<dd>White also made runner-up for the "Embodiment of all Evil Award (for Newt Bashing)" in the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i></b> for this quote:
<dd>"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one scary white man...One can only hope Gingrich was sincere in his speech to Congress last week...That could only mean Gingrich is serious about shedding his party's whites-only image. If so, blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the impulses of one scary white man."
<dd>Who makes up this "mob of lunatics"? This year the judges for the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables</i></b> included such broadly respected and well known conservatives as CNN's Bob Novak, CNBC's Cal Thomas, and <i>American Spectator</i> Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell; in years past they have been joined by Rush Limbaugh and Charlton Heston.
<dd>Is it any wonder why the public is fed up with the arrogance of the national press?

<h3>Negative Campaigning: Look Who's Talking   The Washington Times</h3></center>
<p>
<dd><big>T</big>he pundits are right.This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican can-didates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li> Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li> Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace        -- like Albania." 
<li> The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
</ol>
<dd>Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." 
<dd>Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=+1>If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up.</font></b></blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from  the  man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." 
<dd>For <i>Nightline</i>, Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: <i>Nightline</i> ignored them. 
<dd>Liberal <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

<center><h2>MRC's Tim Graham Authors Explosive New Book</h2></center>
<dd><big>F</big>rom the Media Research Center's MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham comes a new book entitled <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency.</i></b>
The result of four years of exhaustive research, the book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how the press has misled the American people by massaging Clinton's image, masking his faults, attacking his opponents and distorting the truth. 
<dd>Using reporters' own words, supplemented by data from the Media Research Center's studies and analyses, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> not only indicts the media, it <b>convicts</b> them. Starting with the primary campaign in early 1992 and going through to the present, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> lays bare the undeniable, irrefutable, unmistakable pro-Clinton bias in the national media. 
<dd>The release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> officially kicks off the MRC's "Tell the Truth!" campaign to stop the liberal media's shameless promotion of Bill Clinton. We have already distributed over 1,000 books to reporters, columnists, television and radio talk show hosts and producers, as well as to every conservative Member of Congress. We are arming conservatives in the media and public policy with the definitive evidence of how the national press is doing everything in its power to promote Bill Clinton and his left-wing agenda. And we're letting liberals know we conservatives are fighting back.
<dd>Tim Graham is heading up a major television and radio blitz. Within days of the official release, he participated in an interview on the 700 <i>Club</i> with Pat Robertson; a panel discussion on PBS's <i>McCuistion</i>; and interviews on radio stations WSPD in Ohio, KSL in Utah, WTIC in Connecticut, WBSN in Massachusetts, KLIF and WOAI in Texas, WJR in Michigan, WAIM in South Carolina, WTAL in Florida, KSN in South Dakota, WROK in Illinois, WWDB in Pennsylvania, as well as the G. <i>Gordon Liddy Show</i>, which airs across the country. Many, many more shows are lining up to get the message out.
<dd>Get the book that Arianna Huffington, Chair for the Center for Effective Compassion, calls "must reading for the GOP." R. Emmett Tyrrell, Editor in Chief of the <i>American Spectator</i> says <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, "shows that the press has been easier on Boy Clinton than Gennifer Flowers was." And nationally syndicated columnist and CNBC talk show host Cal Thomas exclaims, "No one is doing a better job of holding the press accountable for failing to live up to its high calling than the Media Research Center. In <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of lib-eralism than personal peccadilloes." 
<dd>We're offering <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> at a phenomenally low price for Members only. Please see ordering information <a href="#order">here</a>.

<a name="poll">
<center><h3>A New Poll Rocks the world of Journalism</h3></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>A</big> new poll from the Roper Center and the Freedom Forum has rocked the world of journalism. It proves that Washington-based reporters and editors are even more liberal than we thought. Just look at the numbers: 89 percent voted for Clinton in 1992 (as opposed to 43 percent of the public); only 7 percent voted for Bush; only 4 percent are registered Republicans, while 50 percent are Democrats; only 3 percent think the Contract With America was a serious proposal. And get this: only 2 percent call themselves conservative.
<dd>Remarkably, <b>still</b> reporters are denying a bias when given these numbers! I was asked to debate <i>Newsweek</i>'s Eleanor Clift on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> recently; both Robert Novak and I listened incredulously as she absolutely denied these numbers were evidence of bias. Rather, she said, it proved how good a job the media are doing, since they are being so tough on Bill Clinton.
<dd>It defies belief. It also explains why our work is so critical to the conservative movement. In the past month we've had a host of new programs:
<ol>
<li>After four years of research, Tim Graham's new book, <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</b></i>, is now published. It proves how the liberal press worked to elect  Bill Clinton for President in '92, how they've championed his agenda since then, and how they're doing it again in '96.
<li>During Holy Week we released our third annual <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>. By studying over 41,000 network news stories and 1,800 hours of prime time entertainment programs in 1995 we have documented the media's  antagonism toward religious institutions, leaders, and doctrines. It's gratifying to know that some in the press are finally admitting it. "I think there is...a problem with what I call cultural bias on these subjects...religion, abortion, and homosexuality," said <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Howard Kurtz. "I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left of the American public and probably don't realize that they're not always giving a full weights of views of people who have a very different take on these matters."
</ol>And then there is the MRC's campaign to bring the "family hour" back to prime time television. (The campaign began with the release of our study, <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>.) The momentum is growing: over 70 Members of Congress have publicly joined our efforts and signed their names to a full page advertisement that ran in Daily Variety, one of the entertainment industry's leading trade publications.
<dd>All three ventures have something in common: none of these efforts has ever been done before simply because conservatives didn't have the organization or resources to undertake these huge projects. In one month we launched all three of them, and liberals' heads are spinning. They've never been hit like this before, and it explains Bob Novak's statement to me at a reception last week. "They hate you, Brent," he laughed. "They hate you more than any conservative in America!"  Given the company that puts me in, I'm honored.
<dd>Thanks for making all of this possible.
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Tell the Truth! Update</center></h2>
<dd><big>T</big>he biggest obstacle for conservatives in every presidential election for the past 30 years is the media's unfair, slanted coverage. This year the MRC has announced we've had enough -- and we aren't going to take anymore. And we're putting our money where our mouth is -- a $2 million Tell the Truth! Campaign to expose the leftist agenda of the media.
<dd>The national campaign is in full gear; the MRC is everywhere in the press right now. 
<dd>Our "Blast Fax" press release campaign is providing conservative radio talk show hosts and columnists with daily ammunition exposing media distortions. Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Paul Harvey and a host of others are passing this information on to <b>millions</b> on a daily basis. 
<dd>MRC spokesmen are appearing on numerous television and radio shows every single day. They've appeared on CNN's Crossfire, CBN's the 700 Club, National Public Radio, the Oliver North Show, and literally dozens and dozens of others in just the past few weeks alone.
<dd>We have begun distributing Tim Graham's blockbuster new book Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency to hundreds of conservatives in the media and public policy. 
<p><font size=+1><blockquote>From now until the election you will find these regular updates in <i>FLASH</i> on what the MRC is doing to expose the media's biased election coverage.</blockquote></font>
<p>
<dd>Since Tim Graham began his media blitz for the book, orders have been flooding our office. We are confident from these early responses to the book that <i>Pattern of Deception</i> will be hugely successful in exposing how the leftist media are openly championing the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>Another aspect of our national "Tell the Truth!" campaign includes distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, and magnets with the logo, "I DON'T BELIEVE THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA!" all over the country.
<dd> If you'd like to show your support for our "Tell the Truth!" campaign with one of the MRC's "I don't believe the liberal news media!" items call us at (800)-MRC-1423, and we'll send these out to you for a shipping and handling fee of $2.
<dd>We will also be opening an office in San Diego -- during the Republican National Convention. This year the media will not get away with their blatant distortions and outright lies against conservatives, as they did at the Houston Convention of '92. 
<dd>These are only a few of our plans. Much, much more is being prepared for our friends in the liberal press this year. Be on the lookout in <i><b>Flash</b></i> in the coming months for more updates on our "Tell the Truth!" campaign.

<a name="religion">
<center><h2>MRC Religion Report Generates National Discussion</h2></center>
<dd><big>S</big>urveys show the United States is one of the most religious countries in the world. Every year since 1952, Gallup polls have found that about 90 percent of Americans claim their faith is important. On the other hand, a 1995 U.S. News & World Report survey of Hollywood executives found that only 44 percent considered religion important. Another study revealed that 86 percent of  journalists seldom or never attend church, and 50 percent don't even believe in God. 
<dd>Does the product from the news and entertainment media reflect society's views? Not only do both the news and entertainment media not care about religion, when they do touch on it, they regularly attack it.
<dd>It's all detailed in the Media Research Center's third annual report: <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>, the most comprehensive study of its kind in history. Here are some of the findings:
<h3>Prime Time Entertainment Television</h3>
In 1995, there were almost 1,800 hours of original entertainment programming on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB, but only 287 religious portrayals. Overall, 38 percent of these depictions of religion were positive, and 28 percent were negative -- roughly a 4-to-3 ratio. This near-balance of positive and negative may satisfy secular Hollywood, but it offends tens of millions of Americans who cherish their religious beliefs. 
<dd>If it's a simple expression of faith, 77 percent of the depictions were positive. But the more serious the expression (and the one expressing it) the more negative it became. Religious institutions only received positive representations 31 percent of the time. Only 20 percent of the depictions of the clergy were positive, while a whopping 43 percent were negative! And the laity? Only 11 percent of the depictions of lay religious leaders were positive -- 64 percent were negative! 
<dd>There was a bright side. In 1995 we also had CBS's Touched By an Angel, arguably the most pro-faith show in television history. It's also a bona fide hit, the fastest growing show on their network, and the second fastest growing show on all of television!
<h3>Network News</h3>
<dd>The network news programs virtually ignored religion in 1995. Out of 18,000 evening news stories, religion drew only 249, and out of 26,000 morning news segments, only 224 dealt with matters of faith. For the third year in a row, religion stories again represented only about one percent of the networks' total coverage. 
<dd>The Catholic Church dominated what religion reporting there was, with almost half the evening news stories and 71 percent of the morning segments.  
<dd>In more political terms, the religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party, even though it provided the margin of victory for the GOP in '94. As well, though not a single pro-life incumbent from either party lost that year and dozens of pro-lifers were elected to Congress, the media continued to report that pro-life policies were hurting the GOP. 
<dd>Stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics drew another 142 stories in 1995. On the other hand, only three stories focused on the violence of abortion itself, or on documented examples of harassment and violence by abortion advocates against pro-lifers.
<dd>That television's treatment of religion has not significantly improved since the MRC's first study two years ago is troubling. The networks wonder why their audience continues to shrink, year after year. When will they begin to understand that their assault on religion is offensive to 90 percent of the public, and maybe, just maybe, might be a factor?  
<dd>Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press conference on April 4 to release <i><b>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</b></i>. The event was shown live on C-SPAN, and covered by CNN, CBS Radio, ABC Radio, USA Today, the Washington Times, and countless other outlets.
<dd>There has been a tremendous feedback to our work since the press conference aired live on C-SPAN. Viewers across the nation have thanked us for our work on this issue.

<center><h2>MRC's Family Hour Push</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>n this election year, with partisan wrangling everywhere, one issue is bringing together Republicans and Democrats: the MRC's campaign to restore positive values on television, particularly during prime time's Family Hour.
<dd>Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) each circulated petitions to their colleagues seeking their support. (Sen. Lieberman and Rep. Smith joined Brent Bozell on February 8 at a national press conference calling on Hollywood to voluntarily return to the spirit of the family hour.)
<dd>Thus far over 70 Senators and Representatives have signed an open letter, calling on Hollywood to voluntarily program only family-friendly fare in the first hour of prime time (8-9 p.m. on the coasts, 7-8 p.m. in middle America). The text of the letter was reproduced in a full-page advertisement in the April 30 issue of <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<dd>Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the campaign is the support it has drawn from across the ideological spectrum. Conservatives like Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Representative Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) have joined liberals like Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) in backing the MRC's effort.  
<dd>Now it's time for us to target the advertising community. A letter is being prepared for the biggest advertisers on prime time television, asking them to join our Family Hour crusade. Watch this space for regular updates.

<center><h3>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy</h3></center>
<dd>"I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber. Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting.[The manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force...If Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic, and manacled before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society that drove him to madness."--Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam, April 10.

<dd>"Though Republican leaders did not attend the memorial service or funeral, several sent condolence notes to the Brown family.

Dear MRC,
<p>
Love your FLASH news-letter! Your group is doing a much better job of keep-ing in touch with your members this way.
I did have a few suggestions:
<ol>
<li>List an E-Mail Address - Many people are like me, too busy or lazy to write a letter. I would love to see an option to send you E-Mail, you would get correspondence more often and it would be more current.
<li>Create a World Wide Web Site - This is a great way to publicize the organization. I get on the WWW often to keep track of other conservative organizations like the Christian Coalition, AFA [American Family Association], etc. I can get timely, quick info on these groups and interest in your group would be very high.
</ol>
Sincerely,
Mickey Mixon

Dear Representative 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,

such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Dear Congressman:


As a small business owner and taxpayer, I strongly encourage
you to support efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  This
outdated, discriminatory act has cost hard working taxpayers
billions, and inhibited the opportunities of small
construction firms and unskilled (mostly minority) workers.

Davis-Bacon is an example of what's wrong with Washington.
This anti-market law has no place in our government, yet
lawmakers elected for change have been unable to repeal it.
I am shocked to hear that some Members of Congress actually
want to "reform" Davis-Bacon by expanding it.

When the Republicans pulled Davis-Bacon out of the budget
reconciliation bill they sent a signal to voters.  Such
activity told the public the majority party wasn't willing
to aggressively support bold regulatory and fiscal reform.
The confidence I had in Congress since the '94 election is
being eroded by the failures of this Congress to enact bold
reforms.  This failure only benefits special interests at
the expense of all taxpayers and our system of free
enterprise.

As a member of the Small Business Survival Committee, I
understand the implications of keeping a law like Davis-
Bacon on the books.  Time should have run out for Davis-
Bacon, and Members of Congress should repeal this harmful
law.

Dear Senator: 

I urge you to terminate Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal 
immigration proposal, S. 1394, at the Senate subcommittee 
level. 

The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup 
of S. 1394. Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal 
immigration legislation intensifies the restrictive measures
of Representative Lamar Smith's (R. TX) immigration 
proposal, H.R. 2202. 

Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire 
foreign workers. Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign 
help would have to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of 
the employee's annual compensation including wages and 
benefits. In addition, employers would be forced to pay 
that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion of 
the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act). 

Additionally, the new limits on skilled immigration coupled 
with the arbitrary experience requirements will 
significantly lower the number of skilled workers admitted 
to the U.S. annually. Moreover, elimination of the unskilled
immigration visas, prevents families from uniting. Unskilled
immigrants do not displace American workers. The measures of
S. 1394 (and similary House proposals) will do more to 
displace American workers than any perceived move by 
employers to bypass American labor for foreign workers. 

Contrary to the less government principles espoused in 1994,
S. 1394 and similar House proposals, increase government 
spending, expand governmental control over businesses and 
will ultimately weaken the U.S. economy. I strongly oppose 
S. 1394, and I ask you to do the same.

Cristensen (R-NE). 

H.R. 1972 simplifies the tax relationship between the 
business and the independent contractor by defining who is 
not an employee. 

This bill outlines clear, distinct criteria for those 
seeking to perform services as an independent contractor. 
As you are probably aware, independent contractors and small
business owners are presently forced to comply with the 
infamous 20-factor test - an ambiguous tool of the IRS which
lures independent contractors into a spiral of unnecessary 
legalese and expense. 

Many entrepreneurs and small business owners do not have the
time or resources to fight the 20-factor test, some of these 
job producers are forced to close their doors. One recent 
estimate that the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent 
contractors and collected $678 million in fines and back 
taxes over the past several years. 

Clearly there is an institutional bias for the IRS to 
reclassify independent contractors as employees. It would 
be intolerable if Congress failed to pursue reform of the 
20-factor test. 

Small businesses and entrepreneurs, the largest job creators
of our economy, should not be forced to comply with an 
unending string of arbitrary and outdated IRS rules. The 
20-factor test is a prime example of bad tax policy. I 
strongly support Congressman Christensen's bill and I ask 
you to do the same. 

Sincerely,

Dear Senator:

It would be a big mistake to vote for an increase in the 
minimum wage.  A minimum wage hike will hurt the economy 
and cost jobs.

Economists have found that minimum wage increases cost jobs.
Hiking the minimum wage will keep many young people, 
especially minorities and unskilled workers, out of job 
opportunities.  The drive to raise the minimum wage is 
largely politically-motivated and driven.  But many people 
fail to see the destructiveness of minimum wage increases. 
As a small business owner, I know how difficult it is to 
absorb the costs of unfunded mandates like the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is a starting wage, it's a good way for the 
entry-level employees to gain employment experience.  
Studies show that 63% of minimum wage workers earn higher 
wages within a year.  Small businesses are able to determine 
wage scales much better than Congressmen or bureaucrats.

With the implementation of welfare reform, there will be 
many low skilled people looking for jobs -- it will be much 
harder for these Americans to find employment if Congress 
raises the minimum wage.

Now is definitely not the time to raise the minimum wage.  
Leave wage increases for minimum wage workers to the 
employers, not politicians.

<h3>Russell Amos Kirk</h3><br>
<b>1918-1994</b><br></center>
<p>
"For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was the conscience of the conservative movement. As a scholar, essayist, lecturer, and critic, he saw contemporary political events against the backdrop of history, philosophy, and literature -- subjects in which his background was astonishingly thorough. Following the publication of his masterful <I>The Conservative Mind</i>, Dr. Kirk watched the conservative intellectual revival develop around him until his solitary cause of the early 1950s became the dominant trend of the 1980s. As much as any other living American, Russell Kirk was responsible for the growth of that movement. His works have given the conservative movement sage guidance in its efforts to redeem the time and champion the permanent things."

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;<A NAME="gleaves"></A>

The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.<A NAME="pat"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.<A NAME="russell"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<A NAME="irving"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.<A NAME="honorable"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.<A NAME="homily"></A>

Mass of Dr. Russell Kirk<BR>
Reverend Winthrop Brainerd<BR>
St. Matthew's Cathedral, Washington, D.C. </CENTER></B>
<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<HR>

<title>NEW COMMANDER FOR THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</title>

<h2>NEW COMMANDER FOR<br>
THREE-FRONT DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

The new drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, is the antithesis
of his boss.  McCaffrey, whose nomination was announced during
President Clinton's State of the Union message on January 23,
1996, is a decorated war hero, a West Pointer who epitomizes 
&quot;Duty-Honor-Country,&quot; and a true anti-drug warrior.
<p>
While McCaffrey's task should be to mount an all-out attack against
well-entrenched drug traffickers, his efforts are likely to be
diluted because two other fronts need attention.   One involves
repairing congressional relationships, and the other concerns
the difficulty of manuevering inside an administration that lacks
enthusiasm for combatting illicit drug use.
<p>
On the second front,  McCaffrey will fight against this administration's
natural inclination.  Many Clintonites feel more comfortable on
the wrong side of drugs and may resist anti-drug changes with
bureaucratic boobytraps.
<p>
On the first front, Congress is skeptical about Clinton's rebirth
as a crusader against the drug trade.   Senator Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) tried to abolish the drug czar's office, blaming the
administration for sending &quot;a mixed message to America's
youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.&quot;  Shelby
added, &quot;I object to the administration's handling of this
issue -- its lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;
<p>
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) said, &quot;I've been in Congress
for over two decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president
who cares less about this issue.&quot;
<p>
Most importantly, on the front of ending drug trafficking, McCaffrey
must repair past damage.  In 1992, Clinton promised to renew the
anti-drug campaign, but quickly surrounded himself with pro-drug
advisors and bad policy.  He has cut Pentagon, Customs Service and DEA 
interdiction efforts.  The White House has radically downsized the drug 
czar's office and dropped the drug war to last on the National Security
Council's priority list.
<p>
Now, Clinton has shown a sudden interest in the drug issue.  He
wants drug testing for all arrested felons.  He has rejected changes
to a tough crack cocaine law and recently criticized his liberal
media friends for glamorizing drugs.
<p>
Why McCaffrey? In 1993, during a White House visit, McCaffrey
was rebuffed by a female White House staffer who said she didn't
speak to military people.  Clinton attempted damage control by
taking McCaffrey jogging with him.
<p>
To his credit, McCaffrey is an expert on narcotics trafficking.
He returned to Washington from the military's Southern Command
in Panama, where he presided over U.S. cooperation with Latin
American and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction
since February 1994.
<p>
McCaffrey has also said the right things.  He told Congress that
the President's drug strategy &quot;correctly addresses both the
domestic problems of demand and the international problems of
drug manufacturing and smuggling.&quot;
<p>
McCaffrey has clear marching orders.  As the President directed
him in his State of the Union address:  &quot;Lead our nation's
battle against drugs.&quot;  It's going to be tough for this soldier
who is accustomed to giving orders and expecting things done,
however.
<p>
President Harry Truman said of President-elect and General Dwight
Eisenhower, &quot;He'll say, `Do this! Do that! and nothing will
happen.  Poor Ike -- it won't be a bit like the army.  He'll find
it very frustrating.&quot;
<p>
As a fellow West Pointer and former subordinate, I offer this
advice.  Sir, begin your command by performing a thorough mission
analysis, prepare the troops, and then mount a Desert Storm-like
Hail-Mary maneuver to regain lost ground.  Then, exploit your
success.
<p>
Apply the principles of war.  Begin with the principle of security.
Reduce the probability that the enemy might interfere.  Sweep
your perimeter for guerrillas and then identify others who will
impede your plan.  Fair warning, pro-drug partisans are inside
the Clinton camp.
<p>
Define your &quot;purpose,&quot; which means develop a plan that
gains some degree of control over your opposition.  Begin by dumping
the &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy, which substitutes treatment
for enforcement.  Return the war to the front lines reducing both
supply and demand.
<p>
Maneuver is another principle.  Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military
thinker, said there are only two methods of maneuver (attack):
direct and indirect.  Avoid direct attacks on unsympathetic forces
within the administration.  Attack indirectly by going around
them.  Get the support of the American people.  Maneuver to repair
the administration's credibility with Congress and then seek funding
to rearm interdiction forces.
<p>
Use the principle of initiative to take drug abuse awareness center
stage.  Use your allies.  Foster dissent within hostile federal
agencies using natural allies like Reagan-era bureaucrats who
believe in Nancy's &quot;Just Say No&quot; strategy.  They'll
keep pro-drug Clintonites busy while you focus on drug suppliers.
<p>
Declare war on traffickers.  Work with foreign governments to
destroy drug crops, processing plants and their transportation
networks.  Empower the DEA, FBI and local law enforcement to step
up pressure on drug kingpins and street dealers.
<p>
The principle of economy of force requires that you use the minimum
essential resources for those endeavors that require the least
emphasis.  Ask Congress to fund specific drug projects that don't
need your personal attention, thus freeing you for higher priorities.
Canvas the country to reawaken the 1980-era anti-drug activists.
<p>
Use the principle of surprise to attack those who encourage drug
use.  Adhere to the principle of simplicity.  Simple concepts
and clear, concise orders reduce confusion.  This government has
too many anti-drug plans gathering dust and too many chiefs. 
Put your drug fighters in a formation, and insist they stay in
step.  The President will, no doubt, continue to wage a war of
words against promotion of drug abuse in the culture.  This will
make some of them uncomfortable, but it will be your deeds that
turn their discomfort into alarm.
<p>
Finally, the principle of morale is a state of mind.   You must
be confident and determined.   You must demonstrate staying power
and the spirit to win.  Stay visible.   Be a rabble-rouser  --
be a leader.
<p>
America needs a coordinated anti-drug war, and your leadership
can make the difference.  The question is whether Mr. Clinton's
conversion is real and whether, for our children's sake, he will
permit you to lead.

<title>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</title>

<h2>REVAMPING THE DRUG WAR</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A recent rise in drug use among youth has some national leaders
flirting with the idea of legalizing drugs even though recent
history has shown that anti-drug abuse campaigns -- such as Nancy
Reagan's &quot;Just Say No&quot; program -- work.  Indeed, the
absence of such high-profile, nationalized efforts has no doubt
contributed to the recent rise in drug use among youth.

<p>

James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America,
says, &quot;In the last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers]
have gone up dramatically.  We allowed it to happen.  We were
going in the right direction.  We took our eye off the ball.
Kids [today] view illegal drugs as less dangerous and more 
acceptable.&quot;

<p>

Burke attributes the attitude shift to fewer news stories about
the risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization
discussions, and glamorization of drugs by the pop culture.

<p>

The absence of committed leadership from federal authorities has
also contributed to the problem.  Since taking office, the Clinton
administration has been  pushing treatment rather than enforcement
-- a strategy known as &quot;harm reduction.&quot;  In 1995, the
budget share for interdiction was one-third of what it was in
1985.   Investigations, too, were reduced by 28 percent over this
same period.

<p>

Even though treatment funding has expanded by 119 percent in the
past five years, the number of persons treated has actually declined
by 9 percent.  Additional concerns are raised when one looks at
the distribution of taxpayer dollars within the drug programs.
In 1995, the $13 billion allocated to the war against drugs was
spread thinly among 18 federal agencies and 12 functional areas
(such as interdiction, prevention, treatment, etc.).  All in all,
the war involves more than 140 federal programs, each with its
own bureaucracy.  This scatter shot approach tries to spread enough
money around to drown the problem with resources.  Unfortunately,
only a small percentage of the money ever gets to the &quot;street.&quot;
The majority gets absorbed by infrastructure.

<p>

The vast majority of Americans -- 94 percent according to a December
1995 Gallup poll -- consider drug abuse a serious national problem
and want something done about it.  Large majorities oppose legalization
as a solution and most fault illicit drugs as a root cause of
many of America's social pathologies.

<p>

How bad is the problem?  A 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse found that marijuana use among 8th graders more
than doubled from 1991 to 1994, rising from 6.2 percent to over
13 percent.  A similar trend is evident among 10th and 12th graders
while adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin, speed and LSD
is also rising dramatically.

<p>

What are the consequences of increased drug abuse?   Andrew Peyton
Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former NAACP counsel,
writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>, &quot;There
is...an undeniable relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug
addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders and spur
them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;   A
1993 Justice Department study of urban youths over a five-year
period found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency.

<p>

Since 1985, drug-related medical emergencies have skyrocketed
500 percent.   Most of the rise is blamed on heroin and crack
cocaine which are out of control, but the rebirth of designer
drugs like methamphetamine or &quot;speed&quot; is equally startling.
Attorney General Janet Reno said, &quot;[Meth] is spreading
across this country....  There should be no question...that methamphetamine
poses a real and serious threat to the citizens of our nation.&quot;

<p>

The war against drugs doesn't necessarily need more money, but
it does need a major overhaul in emphasis and implementation.

<p><ul>

<li><b>It needs committed leadership.</b> Battles are won tactically
but wars are won strategically.  A winning strategy requires a
leader with vision.  Presidents Bush and Clinton have given responsibility
to a drug czar who has virtually no authority.  One cannot delegate
responsibility unless one delegates commensurate authority to
get the job done.  The President must give this issue a constantly
high profile.

<p>

<li><b>It needs a single responsible federal agency emphasizing
interdiction and prevention.</b> The new drug czar, General Barry
McCaffrey, promises to reorganize his office into &quot;a more
effective mechanism.&quot;  But the drug war needs more than a
reshuffling of the czar's deck chairs.  He should be subordinate
to the Attorney General like the Surgeon General falls under the
Secretary for Health and Human Services.  That would eliminate
redundancies and improve the use of taxpayer dollars. He should
coordinate America's drug interdiction effort and speak out against
abuse.  Let local communities do the rest.  They can do a far
better job than the federal government.

<p>

<li><b>It needs focus on faith-based treatment programs.</b>
Let faith-based organizations tailor prevention and treatment
to local needs.  The best drug abuse prevention and treatment
programs are faith-based, yet they are often denigrated by federal
bureaucrats.

</ul><p>

To desert the war in the face of rising drug abuse is wrong.
Instead, the drug war must refocus on committed leadership, government
interdiction and prevention, and faith-based treatment programs.

<title>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA ABUSE GOES HIGHER</title>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA<br>
ABUSE GOES HIGHER</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
According to the 1994 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA),  marijuana use among 12-17 year olds nearly doubled from
1992 to 1994.  The number of teenagers who believe they risk harm
by using marijuana has decreased.[1]
<p>
Four-fifths (10 million) of current illicit drug users use marijuana
and the highest rate of drug use is now among persons 16 to 21
years old.  They tend to be unemployed and lack a high school
diploma. 
<p>
Since the 1970's, the NHSDA has been the primary source of statistical
information on the use of illegal drugs in the United States.
 It is based on a nationally representative sample of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population age 12 and older. 
<p>
Similar results were found in a 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  It found that marijuana use among 8th graders
rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar
trend was evident among 10th and 12th graders.[2]
<p>
Both 1994 surveys found declines in the proportion of adolescents
who believe they risk harm by using marijuana occasionally has
decreased.  But White House Drug Policy Director Lee P. Brown
said, marijuana is &quot;a very dangerous drug that can cause
you to fight for your health and your life.&quot;[3]
<p>
Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[4]
<p>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  The
drug can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving and forming concepts.
<p>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence
that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous
effects.&quot;[5] More than 10,500 published scientific papers show
that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect
reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn
baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.

<h2>DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION:<br>
HOW TO KEEP KIDS DRUG FREE</h2>

<p>
The recent dramatic rise in drug abuse is fueled by a pro-drug
culture, generational forgetfulness and crippled prevention programs.
 The problem demands renewed grassroots attention by parents,
community involvement and aggressive, private and public, national
anti-drug leadership.
<P>
Drug abuse is symptomatic of  numerous social pathologies such
as rampant fatherlessness which afflicts 18 million American children.
 And abuse has personal and cultural consequences:  increased
crime, poorer health, lowered productivity, and significant costs
to the nation in health and welfare support.  Curbing this scourge
must become a national priority.
<P>
This paper will profile the drug abuse problem, the culture's
contribution to that problem, the parents' role and the history
and future of organized, drug prevention programs.
<P>
<center><h3>A RISE IN DRUG ABUSE PORTENDS MORE VIOLENCE</h3></center>
<P>
A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in
1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar trend is evident among
10th and 12th graders.  Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD is also rising.[1]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) reports
that the U.S. is in the midst of a new wave of adolescent drug
abuse.  Associated with this increase is more violent behavior.
 PRIDE found that children who use alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens,
and/or cocaine are significantly more likely to carry a gun to
school, take part in gang activities, attempt suicide, threaten
to harm another, and get in trouble with the police than children
who abstain from drugs.[2]
<P>
The Supreme Court agrees that there is a relationship between
drug abuse and juvenile crime.   On June 26, 1995, in the case
of <I>Vernonia School</I>
<I>District v. Acton,</I> the court decided  that school-sponsored
drug testing is constitutional, giving local officials a tool
to fight the problem.[3]
<P>
The Vernonia School District told the high court that disciplinary
problems had reached &quot;epidemic proportions.&quot;   The school
administration concluded that rebellion in the classroom was fueled
by alcohol and drug abuse and that student athletes were the leaders
of the drug culture.   
<P>
After a parent &quot;input night&quot; to discuss a proposed drug
test policy for athletes, the parents present gave unanimous approval.
 The policy's purpose is to &quot;prevent student athletes from
using drugs, to protect their health and safety, and to provide
drug users with assistance programs.&quot;  The high court okayed
athlete drug testing. 
<P>

&quot;</I>There is ... an undeniable
relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug addiction can both
lower inhibitions among offenders and spur them on to other crimes
to finance their dependency.&quot;  He argues that in spite of
the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts cannot conclude that
drugs cause crime.  In fact, drugs &quot;do not ingest themselves
... Drugs reach their human hosts only after being invited.&quot;
  What then leads children to use drugs?[4]
<P>
James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
told delegates at the May 1995 American Cities Against Drugs Convention
in Atlanta that in 1962 there were fewer than four million people
who tried illegal drugs.  By 1993, this number had grown to 80
million who had tried drugs, with six million in various stages
of addiction.[5]
<P>
According to Burke, attitudes drive drug abuse:  &quot;In the
last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers] have gone up dramatically.
 We allowed it to happen.  We were going in the right direction.
 We took our eye off the ball.  Kids [today] view illegal drugs
as less dangerous and more acceptable.&quot;[6]  Burke attributes
the attitude shift to fewer news stories about the risks of drugs,
more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions, and
reglamorization of drugs by the music industry.
<P>
A national survey released by the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University supports Burke's contention.  It
found that 76 percent of adolescents and 67 percent of adults
blame the popular culture -- television shows, movies, magazines,
and popular music -- for encouraging illegal drug use.  One-third
of the adolescents also said that drugs are the most important
problem facing them.[7]
<P>
The Washington pollster who did the survey, Frank Luntz, explains,
&quot;It's not parents talking about children.  It's kids talking
about themselves.&quot;  The polls show that respondents feel
that the entertainment industry helps to create an environment
in which drug use is not stigmatized.[8]
<P>
Other pro-drug influences are working to transform the culture.
 For example, youth clothing manufacturers like Adidas produce
shoes called &quot;Chronic,&quot; which are made from hemp and
named after the slang term for a marijuana-packed cigar.[9]
<P>
Cultural icons like baseball star Darryl Strawberry undercut anti-drug
messages. Strawberry is an admitted cocaine addict and alcoholic
who has been jailed for spousal abuse and convicted of fraud.
 Although his former manager, Tommy Lasorda of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, said Strawberry ought to be in jail, not playing baseball,
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner recently signed Strawberry
to a new contract.  Lee Brown, Office of National Drug Control
Policy director, said that Steinbrenner's decision tells our youth,
&quot;If you use drugs, you can be rewarded with big money in
big-time sports ... It is no wonder kids may think that star athletes
are into drugs and there are no real penalties.&quot;[11]
<P>
Even television news programs have taken up the pro-drug banner.
 ABC aired &quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
on April 6, 1995.  It includes a litany of distortions such as
the unproven notion that legalizing drugs will reduce crime  and
that drug treatment is a better alternative than enforcement.[12]
<P>
Former CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite hosted a <I>Discovery Channel</I>
program entitled &quot;The War on Drugs.&quot;   The June 20,
1995 documentary sympathetically profiles the plight of jailed
drug offenders, declares the drug war lost, and calls on President
Clinton to form a bipartisan commission with sweeping powers to
reappraise the war.
<P>
<I>NBC Nightly News</I> profiled a commentary by marijuana advocate
Dr. Lester Grinspoon which appeared in the June 1995 <I>Journal
of the American Medical Association</I>.[13]  The NBC &quot;Health
News&quot; segment by Robert Bazell interviewed many people who
claim marijuana helps them with medical problems that include
AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and cancer.  NBC ignores more
than 10,500 scientific studies which chronicle the adverse consequences
of marijuana use.[14]
<P>
<center><h3>GENERATIONAL AMNESIA</h3></center>
<P>
The drug crisis of the 1970s was reversed by the parents of the
1980s who took charge.  They became involved in their children's
lives, forced schools and community organizations to join the
fight, and supported efforts by President and Mrs. Reagan, who
promised to make drug fighting a national priority.
<P>
Gary Fields, school superintendent in Zion, Illinois, believes
that today's teens are being raised by &quot;drugged parents&quot;
who struggle with their own abuse history and often enable their
children.  He says these parents must stop denying the problem
and he encourages them to give their children a strong anti-drug
message at home.  Otherwise, he says, school-based prevention
programs won't work.[15]
<P>
Southern Methodist University professor Robert Hampson studies
child and adolescent behavior.  He says that parental involvement
in drug-abuse prevention is critical to helping children stay
drug free.  &quot;A healthy family,&quot; he explains, &quot;is
one in which the children respect their elders, older siblings
serve as strong role models, communication lines remain open and
parents remain open, and parents feel empowered to shape their
children's lives.&quot;[16]
<P>
Deborah Cohen of Louisiana State University Medical Center led
a study to identify specific parenting behaviors associated with
the onset of alcohol and tobacco use.  Cohen's 1994 study, published
in <I>Pediatrics,</I> found that children who reported that parents
spent more time with them and communicated with them were less
likely to use alcohol and tobacco.[17]  Another 1994 study in
<I>Pediatrics</I> found that parental monitoring is an effective tool 
in the prevention of drug use.[18]
<P>
Research has identified numerous risk factors that contribute
to adolescent drug abuse.  They include:  availability of drugs,
family and community mobility, community safety, parental drug
use or attitude toward drugs, and level of supervision.
<P>
The Virginia Council on Coordinating Prevention found that most
children who defy the odds of becoming drug abusers &quot;have
had the opportunity to establish a close bond with at least one
person who provided them with stable care and from whom they received
adequate and appropriate attention during the first year of life.&quot;
 A caring and supportive relationship remains the most critical
variable throughout childhood and adolescence.  In fact, even
for those from a troubled home environment, &quot;a good relationship
with one parent&quot; provides a substantial protective effect.[19]
<P>
Rosemary Hinojosa recognizes the need to empower parents to rear
resilient children.  She is the executive director of La Familia
Fuerte [Strong Family], a drug abuse prevention program for Mexican-American
children in Dallas, Texas.  Her program takes a holistic approach
which involves parents in keeping children drug free.  She educates
parents on child-rearing, health, and substance abuse issues.[20]
<P>
&quot;We're trying,&quot; Hinojosa says, &quot;to help the families
draw from their own strengths and allow them to see they have
those strengths, so when we're gone, they can fall back on them.&quot;[21]
<P>
Hinojosa's focus on the home is proper, but some children don't
have parents who are willing or prepared to guide them away from
drugs.  In these cases, when parents fail, government has become
a poor substitute.
<P>
<center><h3>HISTORY OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
Drug abuse is an international problem.  For example, in the 1960s,
then-Chinese Premier Chou En-lai told Egyptian President Gamal
Abdel Nasser, &quot;We are getting back at the West now.  We are
helping the Vietnamese make drug slaves of the American GIs with
heroin and hashish.&quot;[22]
<P>
Chou En-lai blamed the 19th-century British [translated &quot;the
West&quot;] for smuggling opium into China, leaving 90 million
opium addicts.  Hoping to curb the opium supply, the Chinese &quot;illegally&quot;
disposed of tons of British opium.  The British responded by starting
the First Opium War, which was settled in their favor after China
ceded Hong Kong.  
<P>
The Chinese opium plague wasn't resolved until the 1950s and only
after unprecedented public health efforts.   Neighboring Japan
fought an amphetamine epidemic that began during World War II
with government encouragement in order to keep war factories producing
and men fighting.  They were sold without prescription for &quot;elimination
of drowsiness and repletion of the spirits.&quot;
<P>
In 1951, the Japanese government passed the Awakening Drug Control
Law to deal with the nearly two percent (750,000) of the population
who were abusing amphetamines.  The law began a successful three-year
campaign to eradicate the abuse through treatment, education and
stiff penalties.[23]
<P>
Singapore had a heroin epidemic in the late 1970s.  Poh Geok Ek,
director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, states, &quot;The situation
called for immediate action; otherwise, heroin, like an infectious
disease, would spread like wildfire.&quot;[24]
<P>
Singapore adopted harsh laws that called for the death penalty
for trafficking more than 15 grams.  Between 1980 and 1985, 15
people were hanged.   That country also embraced large-scale and
mandatory &quot;cold-turkey&quot; drug rehabilitation.  Poh explained:
 &quot;Our aim is to persuade the addict that he no longer needs
the drug and finally to give him an incentive to replace the drug
with a more satisfying way of life.&quot;
<P>
The Singaporean rehab model includes indoctrination and a military-style
exercise regimen, followed by six months in a halfway house and
two years of close drug supervision.  Today, Singapore has one
of the lowest drug abuse rates in the world.
<P>
 The American Civil War (1861-1865) created a morphine epidemic.
 Many soldiers who were treated with morphine for battlefield
wounds became addicted.  After the war, local drugstores and mail-order
firms like Sears Roebuck legally sold opium or morphine, and by
the beginning of the 20th century, one percent of the U.S. population
were opium addicts.[25]
<P>
The U.S. has fought the opium trade for most of two centuries.
 America signed a treaty with Siam in 1833 acknowledging the need
to curb the flow of opium.  President Teddy Roosevelt organized
the 1909 Shanghai Convention to control the production, manufacturing,
export, import, and distribution of narcotics.[26]
<P>
The U.S. pushed for an international meeting in the Netherlands,
which produced the Hague Opium Convention in January 1912.  That
treaty included, for the first time, control over cocaine.  The
Hague Treaty provided the basis for the 1914 Harrison Narcotics
Bill, which committed the U.S. to controlling drug trafficking.
<P>
After World War II, heroin emerged as a major problem in America's
inner cities.  The government responded by embracing treatment
modalities, including methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities,
and outpatient care.  Politicians passed abstinence laws and created
a phalanx of anti-drug forces.  Meanwhile, educators joined the
fray by stressing information about types of drugs and the negative
consequences from their use.  Proponents of this approach argued
that teens used illicit drugs because they were ignorant of their
harmful nature.  
<P>
This scare tactic approach was replaced by values clarification
(teaching social and personal skills). Today, most programs are
characterized as risk based protective factor type approaches.
<P>
School-based programs designed to prevent drug abuse have been
an integral part of the nation's anti-drug effort for more than
two decades.  Drug education is a $2 billion industry replete
with teachers' seminars and anti-drug texts.  Most of the money
comes from block grants for counseling, and social work.  Yet
there is conflicting evidence whether these programs really make
a difference.
<P>
The President's 1995 National Drug Control Strategy paper concludes
&quot;that only prevention efforts can bring about a long-term
solution to the problem of illicit drug use and its consequences.&quot;[27]
 The paper argues that there has been significant progress since
1979 in reducing casual use of illicit drugs -- from 24 million
to 12 million users -- and that prevention programs have played
a critical role.  
<P>
The National Structured Evaluation (NSE) of Alcohol and Other
Drug Abuse Prevention, sponsored by the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, recently concluded an analysis of hundreds of prevention
efforts.  The NSE found that effective programs emphasize personal
skill development, provide social sanctions and rewards that discourage
drug use and for adolescents at risk, provide professional individual
and family counseling.
<P>
 According to the NSE, there are seven typical prevention approaches.[28]
<UL>
<LI>Positive decisionmaking:  Helps develop personal skills for
preadolescent children.  It is in a quarter of all programs and
is a common school-based program.
<LI>Safety/health skills:  The least common, it provides skills
development and drug lectures.
<LI>Psychosocial skills:  Focuses on personal skill development
without fact-based drug lectures.  Accounts for 10 percent of
the programs.
<LI>Counseling intensive:  Provides individual and family intervention
and drug information.  Accounts for 10 percent of the programs.
<LI>Case management:  Focuses on individual needs to include health
care and addiction counseling.  Accounts for 7 percent of the
programs.
<LI>Multidirectional:  Combines many activities, personal skills
development, skills training, drug information lectures, and alternative
drug-free recreation.  Accounts for 13 percent of the programs.
<LI>Environmental change:  Provides training, changes law or enforcement
patterns, and alters the physical setting.  Accounts for one-third
of the programs.
</UL>
<P>
<center><h3>DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS</h3></center>
<P>
The Federal Government funds and oversees drug prevention through
efforts like the Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Program.   One of the best known is Project
D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education).  
<P>
DARE is distinctive because of its widespread adoption nationwide;
its use of uniformed policemen teaching in local schools; and
its local control.  
<P>
DARE was created in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department
for grades K-12.  It uses a core curriculum consisting of 17 hour-long
weekly lessons, usually offered in 45- to 60-minute blocks.  DARE
focuses on teaching skills to resist social pressures to use drugs,
making decisions, building self-esteem, and choosing healthy alternatives
to drug use.  The programs for high school students address additional
topics like conflict resolution, gang prevention, parent education,
and after-school recreation.
<P>
The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in cooperation with the
National Institute of Justice studied DARE's effectiveness.  Their
study found that DARE is popular and that many DARE  coordinators
plan to expand the program.  Many districts without the program
want to adopt it.
<P>
But RTI's meta-analysis found that DARE does not reduce drug use
despite its success in increasing student knowledge about substance
abuse and enhancing their social skills.[29]  William Midzelski, a
U.S. Department of Education drug education specialist, said,
&quot;It's well established that DARE doesn't work.&quot;[30]
<P>
Phyllis Ellickson, a Rand Corporation researcher, states, &quot;DARE
has a following and sales force that is extremely powerful in
fighting for scarce resources.  But its growth is totally out
of scale to its effectiveness.&quot;[31]
<P>
The Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) hosted a conference in Washington,
D.C. in November 1994.  A seminar entitled &quot;Truth or DARE&quot;
featured two activist parents critiquing DARE.  Richard Evans
of  Northhampton, Massachusetts, says DARE does not define drug
abuse and relies on values clarification.  According to Evans,
teachers like DARE because it gives them a free hour each week.
 Local police like DARE because it gets them into the lives of
children.  And politicians like DARE because it makes them look
like they are doing something.
<P>
The other DPF panelist was Steve Wallace of Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, who complained that DARE officers scare kids.  He said
that DARE consumes $600 to $700 million each year but doesn't
help children learn.
<P>
Despite the fact that the program has demonstrated limited success,
DARE has many supporters.  Glenn Levant, DARE's executive director,
states, &quot;Scientists will tell you bumble bees can't fly,
but we know they can.&quot;  Steve Rusiniak, a youth-bureau detective
in Wayne, New Jersey who has taught DARE classes for three years
states, &quot;I do know, because I've heard back from many kids
and their families, that DARE has established a good rapport.
 DARE has done something.  I'm not claiming that DARE is the answer,
but it's part of it.&quot;[32]
<P>
Less publicized prevention programs have shown promising results.
 Project Smart, founded in 1981, teaches children to resist peer
pressure, to interpret advertisements for alcohol and cigarettes,
and to practice saying no to drugs through role playing.[33]
<P>
Drug Strategies president Mathea Falco touts the successes of
Project Star.  She claims in her 1992 book, <I>The Making of a
Drug-Free America,</I> that there was a 30 percent drop
in drug abuse among adolescents in a Kansas City test.[34]
<P>
High-Scope curriculum advocates claim that 70 percent of their
inner city graduates stay away from drug dealing compared to peers
who hadn't participated.  This program includes a weekly 90-minute
home visit from counselors who focus on teaching parents how to
parent.[35]
<P>
The Archdiocese Drug Abuse Prevention Program (ADAP) is based
in the Bronx.  The curriculum focuses on group prevention counseling.
 According to executive director Sally Ann Shields, &quot;Information
does not change behavior.  It's the development of skills and
the relationships with counselors [that change behavior].&quot;[36]
<P>
ADAP is recognized by the federal government's Center for Substance
Abuse Prevention (CSAP) as one of the nation's best prevention
programs.  ADAP claims that 91 percent of participants significantly
reduced or eliminated drug and alcohol use and 79 percent of the
adolescents improved their grades and behavior at school.[37]
<P>
The President's National Drug Control Strategy states, &quot;America's
faith community can play an important role in finding solutions
to the related issues of drugs and violence.&quot;[38]  In fact, ONDCP
has called for a meeting of faith community leaders before the
end of 1995.
<P>
Religion-based drug treatment and prevention programs have been
especially successful.  Freddy Garcia, an ex-addict, has spent
the last 30 years helping inner city children fight drug addiction.
 He claims a 60 percent success rate using teaching on marriage
and the family, practical Christian living, Biblical counseling
skills, and love.  His staff includes ex-addicts, because, as
Garcia says, &quot;The man who has come back from the precipice
can best show others the way.&quot;  Garcia's &quot;Victory Mission&quot;
has 60 branches and has treated over 13,000 substance abusers.[39]
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich named Garcia to a citizens' group
to recommend solutions to problems like poverty, crime, substance
abuse, and teen sex.  He said of Garcia, &quot;Freddy Garcia has
achieved results that are almost unheard of ... rather than studying
him, all too often the bureaucracy has tried to put folks like
Freddy out of business because they don't have a Ph.D. or they
don't fill out the paperwork right.&quot;[40]
<P>
Teen Challenge is a religion-based drug treatment and prevention
program that claims that 86 percent of individuals who go through
their program remain drug free.[41]  The basic philosophy is, &quot;We
believe that sincere faith in Christ is the motivation needed
to extract the deep-rooted symptoms that cause dependence on narcotics.&quot;
[42]
<P>
Characteristics shared by successful programs include parental
involvement, knowledge of drugs and their dangers, positive social
activities, positive role models, rewards and recognition for
youth interests, and an overall caring and supportive environment
in communities with integrated health, social service, and educational
systems.
<P>
<center><h3>THE FUTURE OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
The Oakland, California based &quot;Just Say No&quot; International
called on the Clinton Administration to look at youth drug-abuse
prevention as an economic issue as well as a social health issue.
 It found that over one-third of America's youth are at risk of
succumbing to drug use.[43]
<P>
Volunteer chairman and Hewlett-Packard executive Jack Brigham
cites his organization's survey of 6,404 youth educators, administrators
and other service providers, stating, &quot;The survey findings
confirm that youth drug-abuse prevention must be viewed by the
federal government not only as a social health issue, but as an
economic issue critical to the long-term economic health of this
nation.&quot;[44]
<P>
But Shirley Higgins, a communication specialist with the anti-drug
organization InTouch, told Speaker Newt Gingrich in a recent letter,
&quot;While the federal government has a vital role to play, we
have got to stop engaging in the fantasy that the federal government
can rescue us from our addictions, our community apathy where
it exists, our lack of self-responsibility and our lack of a vision
of a future that goes beyond the next five years.&quot;[45]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) subscribes
to three basic beliefs with regard to any future solution.  First,
it believes that parents have a strong instinct to protect their
children.  All we need to do is help parents to understand the
harmful effects of drugs, understand their child's social pressures
and help them develop an action plan.[46]
<P>
Second, our youth have a &quot;goodness of heart&quot; or a deep
care and concern for their peers.  We must help young people by
forming positive peer groups.  Finally, there is a contingent
of adults in every neighborhood.  These adults must be brought
together to network their resources and battle the scourge of
drugs.[47]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<P>
The drug debate should be an issue in the 1996 presidential campaign.
National leaders, public and private, must help rein in insidious
cultural influences and government must increase -- not ease up
-- pressure on drug traffickers.  It must also abandon &quot;feel
good&quot; strategies and embrace drug prevention programs that
work.
