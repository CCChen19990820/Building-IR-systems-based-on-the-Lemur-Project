<h2>
The Road Map To Real Reform In Education 
</h2>

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
Every now and then a book comes along, such as Rachel Carson's "Silent 
Spring" or Ralph Nader's "Unsafe At Any Speed," that dramatically alters 
the focus of an entire industry. "Teaching Our Children to Read" by Bill 
Honig can be such a book. It could change our entire educational system, 
not because the book will be a best-seller, but because of the author's 
credibility among educators. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig is no hero to conservatives, or to disaffected parents demanding 
school choice, or even to critics demanding school "standards" and 
"reform." He was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for California, 
1983-1993, where he presided over a school system that exemplified all the 
failures and abuses we've been complaining about for years. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apparently, when he left office two years ago, Honig sincerely set about to 
find out why public schoolchildren are not learning how to read. He started 
from the reasonable assumption that "the first and foremost job of 
elementary school is to teach children to read." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most important point Honig makes, repeated at least a dozen times, is 
that a child absolutely must be "reading beginning books by mid-first 
grade." Honig emphasizes that those who miss out in the early first grade 
need "organized intervention" immediately, because otherwise they "almost 
never recover." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reading success depends on the child developing the ability to pick out the 
smallest "sound chunks" that make up words. Honig says that "the amount of 
time a student is engaged in phonics instruction is highly predictive of 
subsequent reading achievement." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The discipline manifested in Honig's book is extraordinary. It contains no 
confessions, no mea culpas, no I-told-you-sos, no recriminations, no 
put-downs, no pejoratives, no assessing of credit or blame, no targeting of 
enemies, no sanctimonious self- righteousness. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig's book is just a straightforward explanation, based on voluminous 
research and empirical evidence, of how children can and should be taught 
to read. It's a fair inference that its message is a plea for the schools 
to get going on this task because, if the schools fail in this preeminent 
mission, nothing else matters. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A Great Debate has been going on for years between the advocates of phonics 
(i.e., teaching the child to sound out the syllables of the English 
language and put them together like building blocks) and the advocates of 
Whole Language (i.e., teaching the child to guess at the words by looking 
at the pictures and to substitute words that fit the context of the story). 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig calls the phonics-Whole Language debate a "destructive controversy," 
asserts that it should not be an "either/or" question, and recommends a 
"balanced" approach. This is a skillful way of assuring that semantics do 
not screen out the meat of his presentation. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He bows to the Whole Language movement, crediting it with introducing 
children to "good literature." But Honig reminds us that exposure to good 
literature "only works if the student actually reads the words correctly -- 
making mistakes doesn't help." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, Honig exposes the Whole Language myth that the child will learn 
"naturally," without explicit instruction in skills, in the same way that a 
child learns to talk. He says this false belief is far too prevalent and 
has had the "disastrous" result that 30% to 40% of urban children can't 
read at all and more than 50% can't read at their grade level. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig explains that "bad habits of guessing" make learning to read much 
more difficult, and these bad habits cannot be remedied by a sporadic, 
unsystematic use of phonics. He says that "beginning readers who rely too 
heavily on contextual clues, such as pictures or the connection of other 
words in the passage, are distracted from looking at the letters in a word 
and connecting those letter patterns to words in their minds." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Honig argues for teaching children to write and to spell accurately in the 
first grade, too. "Inventive spelling" shouldn't be allowed past mid-first 
grade; children's misspellings should be corrected so erroneous patterns 
are not reinforced. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How widespread are wrong teaching methods in public schools today? Honig 
says that "very few instructional programs currently in use provide 
children with materials designed specifically to connect with systematic 
and sequenced skills development. In some cases, state, county, district, 
or university leaders are overtly or subtly antagonistic to the skills 
components and discourage phonics teaching." 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This isn't a book for parents. Honig obviously thinks that parents have no 
direct role in the mechanics of teaching children to read because that's 
the job for the public school. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, most parents won't be able to cope with his endless educrat 
jargon: phonological awareness and processing, phonemic segmentation, 
explicit skill development strand, word-attack skills, alphabetic 
principle, orthographic phase, syntactic awareness, and metacognitional and 
strategic assistance. 
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this highfalutin way of talking about phonics is just right for 
teachers, administrators and policymakers. It's a road map to get them back 
on the track of teaching children how to read, which should be the schools' 
number-one mission.

<title>Schlafly: The Feminists Seek Unfair and Unattainable Goals -- 2/15/96</title>

<h2>
The Feminists Seek Unfair and Unattainable Goals
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
The aging feminist leaders gathered in Washington earlier this month amid
self-doubts about whether they are relevant any more. "We want to end this
discussion about the death of feminism," proclaimed the organizer of this
Feminist Expo '96 and its most voluble spokesperson, Eleanor Smeal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Feminism is in its death throes because it seeks unattainable goals at
variance with reality, common sense, and fairness. In the 1970s and 1980s,
the feminists sought a "gender-neutral" society; their goal was to be
treated exactly like men.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminist "party line" today is obsessed with victimology as the problem
and affirmative action as the solution: they see the world as one gigantic
male conspiracy against women. The feminists' goal is reverse
discrimination quotas for women in hiring and promotions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We hear endless whining about "equal pay for equal work," but that's been
the law of the land for 33 years. What they really want is reverse
discrimination quotas to give women equal pay for unequal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists use "Glass Ceiling" as a code word for quotas for
professional and executive women, and "comparable worth" as the code word
for quotas for skilled white and blue collar jobs. (Unskilled jobs are
never on the feminists' radar screen.)
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' mantra is, "a woman earns only 72 cents for every dollar a
man earns." That statement is false on its face, first, because of the
dishonest use of the word "every." It might be correct if the sentence
read, "The average woman earns 72 percent of the earnings of the average
man," but that would be meaningless because it's unrelated to how much work
the average man or woman does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans don't believe in equal pay for everyone (that's a Marxist
notion). We believe in equal pay for equal work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you relate earnings to work performed, male and female gender profiles
are very different. A recent research paper by the Pacific Research
Institute of San Francisco provides overwhelmingly persuasive
documentation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The slogans "wives have to work" and "it takes two incomes to support a
family today" obscure public understanding of the powerful effect that
marriage has on workforce earnings, and 81 percent of women do marry. As
the scholar Thomas Sowell has shown, marriage has exactly the opposite
effect on the earnings of men and women.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Married men with children earn the most, while married women with children
earn the least. As the number of children increases, a married man works
more hours in the workforce and a married woman works fewer hours.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994 only 55% of women worked 40 or more hours a week compared to 75% of
men. While 16% of men worked 55 or more hours a week, only 6% of women did.
It's ridiculous to compare earnings without relating them to whether
produced by full-time or part-time employment.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the benefit of feminists who need to have the obvious stated: people
who work more earn more, and they should. The principal income gap is not
between women and men, but between married women and everyone else, and
that is primarily the result of a voluntary domestic division of labor, not
labor-force discrimination by a conspiracy of men. Women who remain single,
invest in education, stay in the labor force, and work long hours fare
about as well as men in the labor market.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The feminists' next line of attack is to assert that, even when you compare
levels of education, or highest college level attained, Bureau of Labor
Statistics figures show a sizeable differential (they call it
discrimination) between men's and women's earnings. But comparing incomes
by the highest degree earned reveals individual choices made by women, and
correlation does not prove cause.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1992, one out of four women who earned Ph.D.s did so in education,
whereas one out of five men earned a Ph.D. in engineering. The mean monthly
income of education majors is $3,048, and of engineering graduates is
$4,049 (a third higher). Personal choices produced those results; no
gestapo forced women to major in fields that pay less.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at master's and doctor's degrees conferred in 1992, we find that
women earned 75% of the advanced degrees in education, 65% in English
literature, and 63% in ethnic and cultural studies. Men earned 85% of the
advanced degrees in engineering, 75% in physical sciences and science
technologies, and 60% in mathematics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As of 1990, women held 73% of all college degrees in education, 61% of
degrees in liberal arts and humanities, and 81% of degrees in nursing and
pharmacy. Men held 91% of degrees in engineering, 74% in physical and earth
sciences, and 67% of degrees in mathematics and statistics.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All professions have costs and benefits, pluses and minuses. Investment
bankers make more money than school teachers, but teachers have frequent
and much longer vacations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proper role of government is to provide equal protection of the laws
and opportunity, not preferential treatment based on warped social theory,
especially when that theory is so demonstrably false.

<title>Schlafly: Games and Tricks of the New World Order  -- 2/22/96</title>

<h2>
Games and Tricks of the New World Order
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly
.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
It's becoming clear that "New World Order" is not just a fantasy of 
conspiracy-minded rightwingers. President George Bush popularized its use 
in 1990 in order to legitimize the Gulf War by resuscitating the 
then-moribund United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like Saddam Hussein, the New World Order concept survived the Gulf War 
intact, and now we're seeing the unintended consequences. New World Order 
is a handy label to describe the various policies that are challenging our 
sovereignty, trying to bore into our bank account, and turning over U.S. 
service personnel to the U.N. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The World Trade Organization (WTO), which the United States officially 
joined when Congress ratified the GATT treaty in its lame-duck session in 
December 1994, recently ruled against the United States in its first case. 
Why is anybody surprised! This result was widely predicted. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The adverse WTO ruling is embarrassing to President Clinton and his U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who had promised the liberals that the 
WTO would never diminish our environmental regulations. It's just as 
embarrassing to the Republican leadership in Congress who promised 
conservatives that such an attack on our sovereign right to make our own 
laws would never happen. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At issue was the Clean Air Act's strict limits on pollutants in gasoline, 
which Venezuela and Brazil were unable to meet. In the name of "free 
trade," they took their complaint to the WTO and won. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since the United States does not export gasoline to Venezuela or Brazil, in 
the name of "free trade" the WTO can now order "cross- retaliation" trade 
sanctions against other U.S. industries that are wholly unrelated to the 
gasoline industry or the EPA regulations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It was the 1994 GATT treaty that made this adverse ruling and unfair 
punishment possible. The old GATT did not allow it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The second New World Order item is the announcement by UN Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali in London that he wants to finance the nearly 
bankrupt United Nations by imposing a global tax on foreign exchange 
transactions. A tiny rate of 0.5 percent would produce an incredible $1.5 
trillion, while a minuscule rate of 0.05 percent would produce $150 
billion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another global tax he is toying with that would produce billions of dollars 
is a surcharge of $1.50 on all international airline tickets. It turns out 
that one of the chief promoters of these far-out notions is the 
Clinton-appointed administrator of the UN Development Program, James 
Gustave Speth. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some claim that Boutros-Ghali is floating the global tax in order to shame 
the United States into paying the $1.4 billion the U.N. claims we owe. Some 
are suggesting that, if we don't pay up, the U.N. should cut off our U.N. 
voting rights, hit us with late- payment charges, and impose a ban on 
hiring U.S. citizens for U.N. jobs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Americans don't think they are getting their money's worth from our 
payments to the U.N. Our assessments are 25 percent of the regular U.N. 
budget and 31 percent of the peacekeeping costs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The third New World Order item is the court-martial and conviction of an 
American soldier, Army Specialist Michael New, for refusing to wear the UN 
uniform on a so-called "peacekeeping" expedition to Macedonia. The other 
550 servicemen in his unit donned UN helmets, replaced their U.S. I.D. card 
with a U.N. I.D. card, and dutifully marched off to Macedonia, where 
Americans have no business being in the first place. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When Specialist New's commander gave the U.N.-uniform order to the 550 
troops on October 2, 1995 in Schweinfurt, Germany, the only authority he 
cited consisted of "UN guidelines," "National Command Authority," "UN 
Charter," "Domestic Law," "Commander in Chief," and "UN Security Council 
Resolutions." He mocked objections to the U.N. baby-blue helmets by saying, 
"They look fabulous." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, the baby-blue UN helmets don't look either military or masculine. 
Maybe that's why they have been seen only very fleetingly on American 
television. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
New argued that the order to alter his uniform was a violation of the 
Army's regulation against wearing any unauthorized insignia, decoration, 
medal or uniform. He said, "I am not a U.N. soldier. I am an American 
soldier." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
You have to wonder why the Clinton Administration didn't simply reassign 
New to some other duty, since the twice-decorated soldier has an exemplary 
record and was willing to obey any order to go anywhere in the world so 
long as he could wear a U.S. uniform. But no, Clinton was determined to 
carry out this first step in transforming American soldiers into U.N. 
soldiers and wouldn't let one soldier stand in his way. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Congressman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) calls Specialist New an American hero 
and has been joined by at least 60 other Congressmen in co- sponsoring a 
bill to declare it unlawful to require a member of the U.S. Armed Services 
to wear insignia, indicia or headgear indicating any allegiance to or 
affiliation with the United Nations. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
All the Republican Presidential candidates should be addressing these New 
World Order issues.

<P>  
The Inside the Beltway pundits and others who think they are movers and
shakers of the establishment are wracking their brains to try to figure out
why Pat Buchanan has such an enthusiastic following. His social
conservatism is part of the reason, but there is another part they don't
understand.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The day after the Iowa caucuses, I received a subscription appeal from the
Wall Street Journal. Let me share it with you.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"On a beautiful late spring afternoon, 25 years ago, two young men
graduated from the same college. They were very much alike, these two young
men. Both had been better than average students, both were personable, and
both were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Recently, these men returned to their college for their 25th reunion. They
were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had three
children. Both had gone to work for the same midwestern manufacturing
company after graduation, and were still there.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small
department of that company. The other was its president.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The letter's sales talk conveyed the impression (although it didn't say so)
that the difference between the one man's mediocre job and the other man's
rise to the top was that he had the benefit of the information in the Wall
Street Journal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president of the company reads the Wall Street Journal for all the
business news he needs on technology, competition and marketing around the
world. He can track his investments on easy-to-scan market quotations.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal speaks to and for those successful businessmen, and
it should. Entrepreneurs are great people; they make America prosperous by
investing their savings in plant expansion and in creating new jobs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be that the guy who didn't rise any higher than middle management,
or who is a blue-collar worker, had less smarts or opportunity or energy or
perseverance, but he is an American, too, and he expected to share in the
American dream of a rising standard of living. But his real wages haven't
risen in ten years, and now he lives in fear and dread of losing his job
altogether if his manufacturing plant is relocated overseas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are tens of thousands more of these guys than there are of the
bosses. The Wall Street Journal doesn't speak for them, but Pat Buchanan
does.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, he is the only presidential candidate of either party who speaks
for them (Bill Clinton, who never had any contact with real life in the
working world, is bragging about the rise in the stock market), and that's
why Buchanan's campaign is rising like a rocket. He is changing the
Republican Party from Wall Street to Main Street.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before the Iowa caucuses, the other presidential candidates never appeared
to care about or want this immense constituency of working Americans.
Chanting the mantra "free trade,'' their attitude toward displaced workers
was, "Tough! That's the breaks in a free market. We live in a global
economy, and you need to look for another job.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The other Presidential candidates, as well as the Republican leadership in
Congress, all backed Clinton on NAFTA, GATT, the Mexican bailout, and
sending American troops to Bosnia. It is ridiculous to think that any
Republican who agrees with Bill Clinton on those gut issues about jobs and
American sovereignty can defeat him in November.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whoever advised the 
Republican leadership in Congress to make "a balanced
budget in seven years with CBO numbers'' and government- regulated HMOs for
Medicare the 1995-96 Republican legislative goals must have been a
double-agent for Bill Clinton. The former is unintelligible to the voters
and the latter is unacceptable to seniors, so adopting those as goals
served up an immense public relations victory to Clinton.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Wall Street Journal and conservative publications that like to give
advice to Republicans are saying that the Party must "integrate the views''
of the two blocs in the conservative movement, the social and the economic
(a.k.a. the balanced budget bloc). They have it all wrong; the balanced
budget is irrelevant at the grass roots.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To win against Clinton, the Republican candidate must get the votes of the
Reagan Democrats, those pro-life, pro-family, working-class Democrats who
voted for Reagan, whom George Bush kicked away. To win against Clinton, the
Republican candidate must get the votes of the Perot voters, the
independent voters who oppose NAFTA and GATT and favor term limits and
campaign reform.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The conservative publications that supported NAFTA, GATT, the failed
balanced-budget strategy, and Clinton-lite health care "reform,'' feel
threatened by Buchanan's success. That's why they have started a campaign
of invective and epithets on a scale unseen in American politics since the
Barry Goldwater campaign of 1964.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Bob Dole got to New Hampshire, he ran negative TV ads attacking
Buchanan at the same time that he adopted Buchanan's winning rhetoric when
talking to the voters. Dole attacked the reduction in real average hourly
wages and tax increases on family income and said, "Corporate profits are
setting records and so are corporate layoffs.''
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Buchanan knows where the votes are. The others are just starting to find
out, but they are hopelessly compromised by their long record of supporting
Clinton's disastrous foreign and domestic policies.

<title>Schlafly:  Look Out For Union Politicking In Congressional Campaigns  -- 3/7/96</title>

<h2>
Look Out For Union Politicking In Congressional Campaigns
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<P>  
The theater of the presidential primaries is tending to obscure the fact 
that the fight is already on in earnest for control of the next Congress. 
The victory of a liberal Democrat for U.S. Senator from Oregon to fill the 
seat vacated by Bob Packwood may prove anew the truth of the old adage that 
&quot;Coming events cast their shadows before them.&quot; 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political director of the AFL-CIO bragged that his union had sent 37 
full-time campaign workers to Oregon to work for Democrat Ron Wyden and to 
attack the Republican on key issues such as Medicare. The union made more 
than 230,000 phone calls and sent out more than 350,000 pieces of mail on 
behalf of the Democratic candidate. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't just the AFL-CIO. At least eleven other individual unions joined 
forces to bring in $183,000 in political action committee donations. That 
made a mighty big presence in one targeted campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
PAC spending is only part of what the unions are doing in Congressional 
races. The unions' phone banks, direct mail, paid advertising, and 
grassroots organizing are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than 
the direct donations reported to the Federal Election Committee. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much of this union politicking is financed through mandatory worker dues, 
and much is unreported and unregulated by federal election laws. To use a 
favorite political metaphor, union support is a ten-ton gorilla in 
Congressional elections. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Oregon race is the start of a massive campaign to use leftwing, liberal 
political muscle in targeted races in order to undo the Republican 
victories of 1994. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO has announced plans to spend $35 million to defeat 75 
Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections. This is seven times 
more than the union usually spends in federal elections and does not even 
include the millions more spent by individual unions, or the so-called 
&quot;soft money&quot; and the &quot;volunteer&quot; political campaigning done by union 
members. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unions have suffered many years of declining influence. John Sweeney 
won election as AFL-CIO President last year by promising not only an 
aggressive campaign to increase union membership, but also a vocal 
political campaign to promote the union's liberal agenda. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association (NEA), one of the most powerful of all 
the individual unions, has targeted 42 Republican Congressmen for defeat. 
According to the NEA's own press release, the NEA will run &quot;a grassroots 
organizing drive&quot; and a media ad campaign accusing these Congressmen of 
&quot;cutting off our children's future.&quot; 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NEA has already spent $4.75 million on a multi-media ad campaign 
designed to scare voters about Medicare and Goals 2000 reductions. This 
lavish campaign was targeted in 55 Congressional districts and included 
press conferences, leafleting, and phone banks. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's unfortunate that Congress, by a slight margin, failed to abolish the 
preferential property tax exemption enjoyed exclusively by the National 
Education Association. No other union has this unique financial advantage. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The polls indicate that the public is blaming the Republican Congress for 
not getting much of anything done last year. In fact, President Clinton 
deserves most of the blame because he vetoed a perfectly reasonable 
Balanced Budget Act and also a perfectly reasonable compromise welfare 
reform bill. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The members of Congress most at risk from the AFL-CIO assault are the 
freshmen who came to Washington determined to cut government down to size. 
They are our hope for a conservative Congress in the future. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is a freshman Congressman who is leading the battle to abolish the 
Department of Education. It is a freshman Congressman who is championing 
the cause of the brave U.S. soldier (Michael New) who refused to wear a 
United Nations uniform. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was a freshman Congressman who dared to push for a vote on the Mexican 
bailout. It was a freshman Congressman who stopped the totalitarian 
anti-terrorism bill (to give Janet Reno the power to wiretap all our 
telephones.) 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was freshmen Congressmen who voted against Clinton's unconstitutional 
sending of U.S. troops into the war in Bosnia. It is freshmen Congressmen 
who are working for campaign spending reform and term limits. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These are the Congressmen you will hear the media complaining about as 
&quot;obstructionists&quot; and &quot;extremists.&quot; That's because they are daring to 
challenge business as usual and have a real dedication to doing what the 
voters sent them to Washington to do. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You can bet that the freshmen members of Congress will be the ones targeted 
for defeat by the big money and organizational muscle of the liberal 
unions.

<title>Schlafly: The Great Awakening About Jobs -- 3/14/96</title>

<h2>
The Great Awakening About Jobs
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
When Bob Dole said in New Hampshire, "I didn't realize that jobs and trade 
and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days 
of this campaign," he revealed the cloistered mindset of government 
officials who have relative job security backed up by a golden parachute. 
Now, the New York Times has had a similar epiphany, reporting the same 
discovery to its readers in a five-newspaper-page article starting with 
five columns on the front page. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To most families across America, it's old news that jobs are the premier 
issue. The media only discovered it when it became a factor in the 
presidential campaign. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Times now admits that nearly three quarters of all households have had 
a close encounter with layoffs since 1980. One-third of American households 
have had a family member who lost a job, and another 40 percent know a 
relative, friend or neighbor who was laid off. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Doesn't it strike you as remarkable that the elite press is just 
discovering something that is an issue with three-fourths of American 
families? Maybe the media were just snowed by President Clinton's bragging 
in his State of the Union Message that our economy is "the healthiest it 
has been in three decades." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Actually, newspaper headlines have been spelling out the news for several 
years: 123,000 laid off by AT&T, 18,800 by Delta Airlines, 16,800 by 
Eastman Kodak, 50,000 by Sears, 20,000 by DEC. It isn't just blue-collar 
manufacturing jobs that are disappearing, it's white-collar and 
middle-management jobs, too. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In an earlier generation, most people who were laid off found jobs that 
paid roughly as well as their old jobs. That doesn't happen, now. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Prior to the New Hampshire primary, the attitude of most presidential 
wannabes, politicians, pundits had been to recite the mantras "Free trade 
is wonderful; we have to complete in a global economy; and get yourself 
retrained for a new job." It's now clear that competing in a global economy 
does not improve our quality of life in America but lowers it, and buying a 
cheaper computer can't compensate for losing your job. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The politicians have been saying that the answer to layoffs, as well as to 
the fact that the median wage in America today, adjusted for inflation, is 
nearly three percent below what it was in 1979, is "training and 
education." That's become a code word for creating more taxpayer-financed 
"job-training" programs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But many of the victims of large layoffs are fully educated and trained. 
The majority of those laid off have at least some college education. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Lockheed, Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas have been laying off aerospace 
engineers. IBM, Compaq and Apple have been laying off systems analysts and 
software programmers. The automobile industry has been laying off skilled 
machine tool operators and automotive engineers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of these men and women will never find another job in their area of 
expertise or at anywhere near their past salaries. If education and 
re-training are the answer, what should they be trained for? Half of those 
who received Ph.D.'s in mathematics last year did not find fulltime 
employment within a year of graduation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And, if these educated workers cannot find meaningful re- employment in 
their industries, prospects are even bleaker for blue-collar workers and 
others without marketable skills. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition to the financial setback, there is an enormous human cost of 
layoffs when there is no prospect of a new job anything on a par with the 
old one. This includes acute humiliation in front of your loved ones and 
friends, marriage breakup, withdrawal from volunteer community service, and 
being uprooted from your home town and forced to move elsewhere. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Technological progress is the cause of many of these layoffs. Of course, we 
have to progress from horse and buggies to automobiles, from kerosine lamps 
to electric appliances, and from typewriters and carbon paper to computers 
and copy machines. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But more and more people have realized that another major cause of this 
disruption and downsizing is the incessant and orchestrated demand that 
America compete in a global economy with hundreds of millions of unemployed 
and under-employed people around the world who are willing to work for 25 
cents an hour. That's what "free trade" means, and there's nothing fair 
about it.

<h2>
Political Slush Funds
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly
.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
The media are persistently presenting us with reports that voters are 
"angry," usually with the implication that this condition is the voters' 
fault and is some kind of a national problem like a social disease. The 
Heritage Foundation, in a document called "Top Ten Political Slush Funds," 
has now given us chapter and verse to justify plenty of anger on the part 
of the voters. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Heritage document sets forth dozens upon dozens of private groups that 
are on the federal dole for millions of dollars of our taxpayers' money, 
part of which they use to lobby and politic for their own special-interest 
causes. Just to call the roll makes anybody angry at the way Congress, over 
the years of one-party Democratic rule, has extorted our hard-earned money 
through income taxes and distributed it among their liberal friends. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Efforts to restrict this welfare for lobbyists last year through the 
Istook-McIntosh Amendment were drowned under the hysterical lobbying of 
these corporate welfare recipients. Their advocacy of bigger government, 
higher spending, and increased government regulation has continued 
unabated. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) has been giving away our 
money for many years to a long list of liberal and feminist outfits, of 
which the most egregious was NEH Chair Lynne Cheney's $2 million grant to 
UCLA that produced the notorious leftwing revisionist National History 
Standards. The NEH has given other taxpayer grants to such special-interest 
groups as the American Bar Association, the American Library Association, 
and the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The current NEH Chair, Sheldon Hackney, has started a stream of tax dollars 
flowing to something called "National Conversation." Only an ivory-tower 
liberal could, with a straight face, argue that Americans need federal 
funding and intervention in order to engage in "conversation," so you can 
bet in what political direction this conversation will be led. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Market Promotion Program gives taxpayer handouts to trade organizations 
to advertise U.S. products in foreign countries. Of course, parts of their 
grants are used to lobby against reductions in agricultural subsidies, all the while they are mouthing the mantra "free trade." 
Here is a tiny sampling of these taxpayer grants: $7 million to the Meat 
Export Federation, $6 million to Cotton Council International, $5 million 
each to the Poultry and Egg Export Council and to the Wine Institute, $4 
million to Florida Citrus, $3 million to the California Almond Board, $2 
million each to the Pillsbury Company and the Mink Export Council. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funnels 400 million federal tax 
dollars to 323 private groups around the country, most of which engage in 
political and lobbying activities. These tax-paid lawyers file lawsuits, 
engage in political advocacy, and work in referendum campaigns to prevent 
welfare reform, to promote racial preferences, to provide tax benefits to 
illegal immigrants and felons, and even to prevent the eviction of drug 
dealers from public housing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The taxpayers are forced to fund Planned Parenthood to the tune of at least 
$189 million. Much of this money goes in direct grants to state chapters of 
Planned Parenthood that typically deal with abortion and engage in 
legislative and political advocacy. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Numerous liberal lobbying organizations that pretend to advocate the 
interests of seniors have figured out to get themselves on the dole for 
large amounts of taxpayers money. These include $69 million to American 
Association of Retired Persons (AARP), $61 million to the National Council 
of Senior Citizens, and $38 million to the National Council on Aging. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
AARP is one of the country's largest and wealthiest private lobbying 
organizations and doesn't need tax-funded charity. It lobbied actively for 
Clinton's socialized health care bill in 1994, even though AARP's internal 
surveys showed that most seniors opposed it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Grants to an endless list of private organizations are concealed in the 
fine print of the federal budget under such high sounding titles as Senior 
Environmental Employment Program ($45 million), Superfund Worker Training 
Program ($32 million), HHS Discretionary Aging Projects ($26 million), and 
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance ($25 million). 
These political slush funds include handouts to some of the richest 
advocacy organizations in the country, including the American Bar 
Association and the American Medical Association. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some of the wealthiest national unions are on the gravy train, too. The 
Laborers Union gets $8 million, the Carpenters $4 million, the Chemical 
Workers $3 million, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers $3 million, the 
Operating Engineers and the Teamsters each get $2 million, and the Auto 
Workers $1 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Americans are tired of hearing talk about the goal of "a balanced budget in 
seven years," and tired of the bleeding-heart Democratic rhetoric 
complaining that "budget cuts hurt seniors and children." It is an outrage 
that Congress has failed to eliminate all welfare to private advocacy 
groups of all kinds.

<h2>
Why Do They Call It "Free Trade"?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>
Why do some people persist in mouthing the mantra "free trade" when foreign 
countries can and do engage in all sorts of dishonest tactics that 
interfere with trade, such as devaluation or other manipulation of the 
value of their money, confiscation (or nationalization) of U.S. property, 
refusing to live up to the contracts and agreements they sign, stealing our 
patents and copyrights, and counterfeiting our money? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Chinese government is engaging in massive piracy of American patented, 
copyrighted and trademarked materials. The U.S. intellectual property 
stolen by the Chinese includes a wide array of products including computer 
programs, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, musical recordings, 
videos, and automotive designs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Collectively, these products are one of the greatest strengths of the U.S. 
economy and are the envy of the world. The United States exports many 
billions of dollars worth of these products each year. China simply finds 
it easier to illegally copy these products than to buy them from us or 
build competitive products, so China steals them on a gigantic scale. Some 
30 Chinese factories daily turn out thousands of illegal compact discs and 
sell them all over the world, and illegally copied recordings, films and 
computer programs are widely available all over China. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Experts estimate that China's piracy in intellectual property amounts to $1 
billion per year in lost U.S. exports. According to the Commerce 
Departments rule-of-thumb, this means that 20,000 American jobs have been 
displaced by the $1 billion in lost U.S. exports. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Just a year ago, U.S. and Chinese negotiators signed a second agreement to 
end this piracy of intellectual property, but these agreements have had no 
effect on the Chinese. China has failed to comply with every major trade 
agreement it has signed with the United States in recent years. The United 
States has threatened China with trade sanctions a half-dozen times, but 
such threats have no effect on China's stealing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
McDonnell Douglas's dealings with the Communist Chinese offer a good 
example of how they deceive American businessmen in order to steal U.S. 
technology and equipment. By dangling the prospect of a large order for 
passenger planes which was later largely cancelled, the Chinese acquired at 
bargain-basement prices a tremendous quantity of U.S. equipment that is 
building up Chinese military power to threaten other countries. China is 
even sharing our technology with Iran. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office told Congress on February 27 that Middle East 
counterfeiters are flooding overseas markets with "the highest quality of 
counterfeit $100 U.S. bills Treasury officials have ever seen." Our 
government is sure that a foreign government supports the printers. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This situation is not new. The House Republican Research Committee's Task 
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare declared four years ago that 
billions of "superdollars" are being produced on "high-tech, state-owned 
presses with paper only acquired by governments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On March 2, U.S. negotiator Ira Shapiro said that Japan has failed to carry 
out an agreement it signed in October 1994 to open up its insurance market 
to us. Shapiro said that other areas where Japan remains unwilling to open 
its markets are semiconductors, photographic film, and civil aviation. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Foreign countries impose all kinds of tariffs as well as an endless variety 
of tariff- alternatives, such as limiting the number and kinds of U.S. 
products that may enter their country and forcing U.S. products to meet 
unreasonable requirements. Just ask any of the many companies that have 
tried to sell their products in Japan and have run into one bureaucratic or 
regulatory roadblock after another. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many foreign countries have governments that are totally corrupt. 
Corruption and bribery are accepted ways of doing business in many foreign 
countries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Far from being the "free trade" that the NAFTA and GATT treaties promised, 
they have subjected the American economy to new international 
bureaucracies. After Sprint closed a telemarketing plant in San Francisco 
because it was losing money, it not only faced a challenge from the union, 
but on February 27 was subjected to a NAFTA challenge from tri-national 
representatives of Mexico, Canada and the United States. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is dishonest to eliminate U.S. tariffs and call it "free trade" when any 
or all of the above tactics are used against us. We are fools to seek "free 
trade" with countries that engage in organized theft of our property and 
counterfeiting of our money, or which renege on their agreements and 
contracts. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the Clinton Administration calls NAFTA and GATT "free trade," we 
should remember that those were the same people who called taxes 
"contributions," and who called government social spending "investments." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But aren't low-tariffs or no-tariffs a good thing? That depends -- on the 
industry, on the source country, on the timing, on the reciprocity. Tariffs 
should be individually determined, and all tariff-alternatives and other 
government restrictions used by other countries should be on the table 
during the negotiations. The guiding principle should be the overall best 
interests of the American people -- not the rulings of foreign bureaucrats.

Reading, Writing, 'Rithmetic, and Ritalin
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

</a>

<P>
Can it be a disease if no X-ray, CT scan, blood test, laboratory 
analysis, MRI, or any other medical test can confirm its existence?  
Can it be a disease if diagnosis can be made by anon-physician 
checking any 8 of 14 items on a behavior checklist such as 
inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, or short attention span?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, an estimated two million children (three times as many boys as 
girls) have been labeled with this disease and are taking a powerful 
drug to treat it.  That's four times as many as in 1990.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The disease is Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the most widely used drug to treat 
it is methylphenidate, known as Ritalin.  A powerful stimulant, it 
juices up the central nervous system, takes effect in 30 minutes, and 
peters out in three to four hours.  Ritalin is classified as a 
Schedule II controlled substance in the same category as cocaine, 
methadone and methamphetamine.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It may be coincidence, but in 1991 the U.S. Department of Education 
formally recognized ADHD as a handicap under the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation 
Act.  After the Department directed all state education officers to 
ensure that local school districts establish procedures to screen and 
identify ADHD children and give them special educational and 
psychological services, generous funding suddenly began to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Public schools have learned how to tap into free-flowing federal funds 
from Medicaid.  Letters sent home to parents brag that the schools 
"will use this new revenue to add more services for children who 
require specialized health care, social services, mental health care, 
speech therapy, counseling, and psychological services."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Capital Research Center has exposed how Goals 2000 is used as a 
cover to authorize programs in health care and create a system in 
which children selected by teachers are regularly tested for 
emotional, social, mental, and physical disorders (such as ADD and 
ADHD) in clinics inside the public schools.  Once children are 
diagnosed and labeled with one of these conditions, school health 
officials have the authority to treat them by prescribing and 
administering such medications as Ritalin, Valium, Lorazepam and 
Prozac.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Schools are starting to administer medical treatment to children under 
new, looser prescription-writing standards developed under Robert Wood 
Johnson Foundation initiatives.  These new rules allow nurse 
practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe drugs.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Goals 2000 proposals receive funding from the Department of Education, 
Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health (Title X) blockgrants, state 
programs, and private foundations.  Private foundations and government 
agencies have teamed up to develop, coordinate and support a variety 
of public school systems to govern the health and behavior of 
children, sometimes under the name Children's Initiative.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A Pittsburgh-based foundation that will not allow its name to be 
disclosed provided grants for two projects named "Pharmacological and 
Psychosocial Treatment of ADHD" and "Community-Based Treatment for 
ADHD: Summer Treatment Programs and School-Wide Interventions" to be 
operated by the University of Pittsburgh and the Gateway School 
District in Pennsylvania.  The grant funds were matched by taxpayers' 
money from the federal National Institutes of Mental Health.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One portion of this project, called the "Pittsburgh School Wide 
Intervention Model," uses a procedure called sociometrics, in which 
children are asked to answer a lot of nosy questions about the other 
kids in their class, such as who they do not want to befriends with.  
The children are instructed not to discuss the questions and answers 
with anyone else.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education 
Programs, under contract HS 92017001, gave the Chesapeake Institute of 
Washington, D.C. the funding to produce two slick videos:  "Facing the 
Challenges of ADD" featuring actress Rita Moreno, and "One Child in 
Every Classroom" with Frank Sesno as moderator.  Parts of the videos 
sound like an infomercial for Ritalin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a PBS documentary following eight months of investigation, a 
Department of Education spokesman was asked if he was aware that the 
parents who spoke so enthusiastically about Ritalin on the videos were 
board members of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder 
(CHADD), and if he knew that CHADD has received cash grants of 
$900,000 plus in-kind services from Ciba-Geigy, the manufacturer of 
Ritalin.  Obviously embarrassed, the bureaucrat denied such knowledge.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's clear that the Department of Education does not adhere to 
professional standards of disclosure.  When anything is published in 
the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, the 
author must sign a statement in which he reveals "any affiliations 
with or financial involvement in any organization or entity with a 
direct financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed 
in the manuscript."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
John Merrow, executive producer of the PBS documentary, reported that 
Ritalin is so plentiful that a black market has developed on the 
school playground.  Ritalin can be crushed and snorted for a cheap and 
modest buzz, and it has become a "gateway drug" in junior high school, 
the first drug a child experiments with.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Parents of a child who is diagnosed, labeled, or treated by school-
paid personnel would be well-advised to seek an independent, unbiased 
medical opinion.

<h2>
The Dumbing Down Of America's Colleges 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>
<P>
The 1996 Governors Education Summit at Palisades, New York, spent 
two days discussing &quot;standards&quot; for what students should learn in 
public schools.  Longtime American Federation of Teachers 
president Al Shanker gave this concept a reality check. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
He said, when as a teacher he assigned homework to his class, the 
pupils invariably responded in chorus, &quot;Does it count on our 
grade?&quot;  He pointed out that standards aren't going to make any 
difference if, no matter what students learn or don't learn, they 
can still get admitted to nearly all U.S. colleges and 
universities. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The National Association of Scholars (NAS), the nation's leading 
higher-education reform organization, has just published a 
devastating 65-page report on the dumbing down of the 50 top 
undergraduate colleges and universities.  The NAS used U.S. 
News & World Report's annual listing of &quot;America's Best 
Colleges&quot; (including both private and public) and compared the 
years 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The NAS concludes that students no longer learn the common core 
of knowledge once taken for granted as essential to a liberal- 
arts education.  The universities have simply purged from the 
curriculum many of the required courses that formerly taught 
students the historical, cultural, political and scientific 
basics of our society. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The number of mandatory courses has been dramatically reduced 
from an average of 9.9 in 1914, to 7.3 in 1939, to 6.9 in 1964, 
and to 2.5 in 1993.  The formerly universal requirement that 
students take a basic survey course in several important areas 
has virtually vanished. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Universities now offer very few courses that require 
prerequisites, which means that very few college courses now 
require any advance knowledge or preparation.  In 1914, 
universities offered an average of only 23 courses per 
institution that did not require a prerequisite course; in 1964 
the figure had risen to 127; today, the number is 582. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Only 12 percent of universities now require a thesis or 
comprehensive examination to get a bachelor's degree.  As late as 
1964, more than half of universities did. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The college year has been shortened by about one-fourth (leaving 
more time for spring break and other frivolities, but, of course, 
without any reduction in tuition price or professors' salaries).  
In 1914, college classes were in session an average of 204 days a 
year; by 1939 the number had dropped to 195; in 1964, to 191; and 
today students and teachers are expected to show up in class only 
156 days per academic year. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why young people can't write good English is 
that so few colleges teach writing any more.  In 1914, nearly all 
universities had required courses in English composition; by 1964 
the figure was 86 percent; today, it's only 36 percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ditto for math.  In 1914, 82 percent of the universities had 
traditional mathematics requirements; by 1964 only 36 percent 
did; now, only 12 percent do.  In 1914, 1939 and 1964, more than 
70 percent of the institutions required at least one course in 
the natural sciences; that figure has now fallen to only 34 
percent. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Maybe the reason why the taxpayer-financed federal guidelines on 
the teaching of American history turned out to be such a travesty 
was that most college graduates haven't studied any history.  In 
1914, 90 percent of our elite colleges required history; in 1939 
and 1964 more than 50 percent did; but now only one of the 50 
schools has a required history course. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Literature courses were required at 75 percent of the 
institutions in 1914, and at 50 percent in 1939 and 1964.  Today, 
not one of the &quotbest&quot; institutions has a literature requirement. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, the total number of courses offered at undergraduate 
institutions has increased by a factor of five since 1914, and 
has doubled since 1964, but that doesn't offer more opportunities 
to become an educated citizen.  The majority of these additional 
courses are on narrow and idiosyncratic subjects of interest to 
the professors but almost worthless to the students. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many courses are not college courses at all; they are designed to 
teach students what they didn't learn in high school.  Sometimes 
these courses are called &quot;remedial,&quot; but the institutions prefer 
euphemisms such as &quot;second tier&quot; and &quot;sub-freshman.&quot;
Unheard of prior to 1939, today such non-college courses are offered in 70 
percent of the elite universities, and most of them award college 
credit. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California state legislators have recently discovered the high 
cost to the taxpayers of the remedial education courses given at 
the state universities.  Last year, 60 percent of new students 
needed remedial help. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
California legislators assert that students have been the victims 
of consumer fraud perpetrated on them by the high schools that 
gave them high grades.  The legislators want to send the invoice 
for the cost of the remedial courses to the high schools that 
deceived their students by giving them a 3.8 or higher grade- 
point average. <br>
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NAS concludes that our best colleges and universities no 
longer turn out graduates who have even an elementary knowledge 
of our civilization and its heritage.  They do not learn the 
basic facts of our country's history, political and economic 
systems, philosophic traditions, and literary and artistic 
legacies, and the result is that we are in danger of losing the 
national cohesion of a known and shared American heritage.

<h2>
MSAs Are The Republicans' Best Issue
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
What are Republicans going to do about the top election-year issue, 
which is jobs, wages and income?  Real (inflation-adjusted) weekly 
wages have dropped almost 5 percent since 1979.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Business spokesmen are trying to downplay this data by arguing that 
employee fringe benefits have risen from 17 percent of total 
compensation in 1955 to 40 percent in 1994.  Total compensation equals 
take-home pay plus fringe benefits, of which health care is a large 
component.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Workers aren't buying this argument because, while the employer's cost 
to provide the health-care benefit has risen, the value of the health 
care benefit to the employee has declined.  Whereas in 1979, the 
employee's health-care package allowed him to go to any doctor or 
hospital of his choice, now employees are being herded into HMOs where 
they are at the mercy of gatekeepers.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
HMOs suffer from a built-in conflict of interest; the gatekeepers and 
the CEOs make more money if they deny your right to see a specialist.  
That's why opposition to the tactics of the HMOs,and to the windfall 
profits these tactics produce for CEOs and stockholders, is bubbling 
over, and an anti-managed care march is planned for Washington in May.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congressional Republicans have a good answer to these problems, if 
they will only use it.  It could put extra money in the pockets of 
workers whose real wages have declined, and it could ease the strain 
of downsizing by allowing them to take some of their benefits with 
them when they leave the company.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This solution is Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), which most House 
Republicans campaigned on in 1994.  The Congress passed Rep. Bill 
Archer's excellent MSA bill in the Balanced Budget Act, which Clinton 
vetoed; and then the House passed it again in its health care reform 
bill, now pending.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But President Clinton and the Washington press corps are trying to 
bamboozle the Dole-Gingrich Congress into passing the Kennedy-
Kassebaum bill without MSAs, which would take us a long way into the 
Clintoncare system we thought we had buried in 1994.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Medical Savings Accounts are the best solution to all the problems 
connected with health care:  the high cost, preserving your right to 
choose your own doctor, portability, pre-existing conditions, job 
lock, uninsured Americans, gatekeepers, capitation, deductibles, co-
payments, paperwork, long-term care, Medicare going bankrupt, and even 
the decline in real wages. Here is how MSAs would work.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who are in a company plan, the employer would buy you a 
high-deductible policy and pre-pay your deductible (up to $2,000 per 
year for singles and $4,000 for families) by putting it each year into 
your individual Medical Savings Account.  You can use this ready cash 
for your medical costs with the doctors, hospitals and clinics you 
choose, and the high-deductible policy covers you for additional 
expenses.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You would own your own MSA (just as you now own your automobile 
insurance).  That means you can take it with you when you change jobs, 
thus solving the problems of portability, pre-existing conditions, and 
job lock.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What if you are self-employed, a part-timer, or are not in an 
employer-paid health plan?  In those cases, you can set up your MSA 
and your high-deductible policy with your own money.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Archer bill would give MSAs pretty much the same tax-deductibility 
that is now enjoyed exclusively by company-paid plans.  Our present 
system is unjust, unfair and intolerable because it grants tax-
deductibility only to plans owned by employers, but not to plans that 
allow individual employees to own their own health insurance, control 
their own health care spending, or set up their own plan.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That is probably the most discriminatory feature of the entire federal 
legal system.  The officers of big corporations enjoy gold-plated 
health insurance paid for with tax-deductible dollars, but the 
waitress, the part-timers and the self-employed can buy health 
insurance only with after-tax dollars (which means it costs double).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The sweetest part of MSAs is that whatever you don't spend will stay 
in your MSA and build up as a tax-free, interest-bearing savings 
account (only 11 percent of all insured individual Americans spend 
more than $2,000 a year on health care).  That will bring down health 
care costs dramatically because MSAs will put consumer discipline into 
the marketplace and provide incentives to save.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Your MSA will grow as you or your employer puts in a new payment every 
year.  MSAs will be available now and in the future for many medical 
expenses often not covered by company plans (such as eye glasses, 
dental care, or preventive care) or by Medicare (prescriptions and 
long-term care).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should reject the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, ignore the HMO 
lobbyists, and instead give workers the MSAs that the Republican 
majority in Congress promised.

<title>Schlafly: The Tide Is Turning Against Federal Education Bills -- 4/25/96</title>

<h2>
The Tide Is Turning Against Federal Education Bills 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly
.html">
Phyllis Schlafly
</a>

<P>
 
 
We've heard a lot about Republican plans to return power to the states. 
Bob Dole, in his stump speech, ostentatiously pulls a copy of the Tenth 
Amendment from his pocket, reminding us about the powers that are 
"reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing in the Tenth Amendment, however, authorizes the devolution of 
power to the Governors of the various states. Yet, under the bipartisan 
education bills now moving through Congress, the Federal Government 
would collect taxes, issue new federal regulations about the public 
schools (an area that should be "reserved to the states"), and then 
give the money and the power to the Governors, bypassing state 
legislatures altogether.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This massive legislation, which seeks to restructure public schools 
throughout all 50 states, builds on the Goals 2000 Act and the School-
to-Work Act, both passed in 1994 and signed by President Clinton. 
H.R.1617 (known as the CAREERS bill) passed the House last September by 
a vote of 345 to 79, and its companion S.143 (the Workforce Development 
Act) passed the Senate in October by 95 to 2.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One might think that such large majorities would mean that the bills 
are not controversial. Actually they've stirred up a hornet's nest.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Speaker Gingrich has just received a letter signed by 63 Republican 
members of the Missouri House objecting to the fact that H.R.1617 
"centralizes unprecedented powers at the federal level" and "supersedes 
state laws and further takes us, the local elected officials of the 
people of this state, out of the process of education." These 
legislators specifically object to the way that the CAREERS act "amends 
out the state legislature, replacing it with the Governor."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since Missouri has a liberal Democratic Governor, Mel Carnahan, it's 
easy to see why Republican legislators think this is a very bad idea. A 
similar letter was signed by 13 Republican Missouri State Senators.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The letter from the 63 Missouri State Representatives asserts that 
"this practice of avoiding the Legislature is unacceptable and flies in 
the face of the principle of local control of education."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Missouri letter also describes the devious additional ways that 
real power over school curriculum is being gathered into the hands of 
unelected bureaucrats, bypassing all elected officials such as state 
legislators and school boards. This is accomplished through the grant 
application which each Governor must submit in order to access federal 
money under the 1994 laws, as well as under the new legislation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These grant applications bind the states to conform to "standards" and 
"assessments" that are written by unelected federal or state 
bureaucrats and over which no elected representative or parent had any 
authority. In addition, the grant applications bind the states to spend 
money that the legislature had not appropriated.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Republican Congressmen who voted for H.R.1617 have made a strenuous 
effort to allay the fears of their constituents by asserting that these 
are "Republican" bills. That's not true.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fact is that the Senate bill was largely written by a Senator Ted 
Kennedy staffer, the late Steve Spinner, who worked on it for three 
years. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, both Kennedy and Senator Nancy 
Kassebaum paid tribute to Spinner as the principal author of the bill 
and of the whole concept of using the public schools to carry out "work 
force education and employment functions" and turn schools into "a 
comprehensive one-stop delivery system."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The micromanaging of public school curricula that will be exercised by 
the federal bureaucrats is evident from a letter in which the U.S. 
Departments of Labor and Education rejected the State of California's 
grant application for funds from the School to Work Law. The letter 
charged that California showed "a lack of systemic methods within the 
State to integrate vocational and academic curricula" and that 
California had failed to develop "Certificates for Foundations Skills 
and Career Entry."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A letter signed by 14 California State Senators called on Congress to 
"kill" H.R.1617. Among the many reasons cited were the awesome 
provision that would strike "a State" from certain federal laws and 
substitute "the Governor of the State," the extraordinary powers given 
to all Governors, and the setting up of a "National Electronic Data 
Base."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), who voted for the CAREERS bill last year, has 
changed his mind and recently circulated a "Dear Colleague" letter 
urging the repeal of Goals 2000 and the School to Work Act, as well as 
the defeat of H.R.1617 and S.143. He pointed out that they are all 
designed to implement the plan laid out in an 18-page letter written by 
Marc Tucker to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, to make 
schoolchildren "guinea pigs who will become the human resources for the 
global labor market."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is clear from the writings of Marc Tucker, Ira Magaziner, Hillary 
Clinton, Robert Reich, and the legislative history of H.R.1617 and 
S.143 that the goal is to transform public school curricula into 
specific workforce tracks determined by local workforce development 
boards. The proper name for this is National Economic Planning, a.k.a. 
Socialism, a system that has failed all over the world.

<title>THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<center><i>July 7, 1995</i>
<hr>
<center></h2><b>The Legal Services Corporation Should be Abolished</b></h2></center>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is the acid test to
demonstrate whether or not the new Republican majority really
intends to reform and reduce Big Government.  If the Republicans
merely play around with smoke and mirrors, pretending to correct
abuses, but leave the money faucet turned on, they will have
betrayed their mandate from the 1994 election and left their
enemies with a gun pointed at their head.
<p>
Budget leader Rep. John Kasich (R-OH) has scheduled LSC for
termination, except for some shut-down expenses.  Sen. Phil
Gramm (R-TX) is trying to get the Senate to agree. 
Unfortunately, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-FL) is working with the
Democrats to reauthorize (i.e., to save) LSC under the euphemism
of "reform."
<p>
The ideological incompatibility of the LSC with the new
Republican regime is indicated by the fact that Hillary Rodham
Clinton used to be its chairman of the board.  LSC has continued
to be peopled with leftist activists who share her class-warfare
ideology and socialist goals.  The record of LSC shows that it
functions not to provide services to the needy, but to serve as
a pot of gold for leftwing activists to litigate and lobby for
radical causes.
<p>
LSC has spent $5 billion since 1974.  If the leftwing lawyers
had merely torched the money, that wouldn't have been nearly as
destructive as spending the money the way they did.
<p>
In fact, they spent the money to litigate and lobby to increase
entitlements (for welfare, aliens, criminals, etc.) that are the
chief cause of federal deficits.  Howard Phillips, who has been
monitoring LSC since 1970 when President Nixon appointed him to
a position that included that responsibility, asserts that LSC
activism has added $2 trillion to the national debt.
<p>
The LSC lawyers have constructed for themselves such a
Byzantine, self-perpetuating infrastructure and grant-making
mechanism that they are accountable to no one:  not to Congress,
or to the Administration, or to the people they serve, or to the
taxpayers who foot the bills.
<p>
When most people think of legal aid services for the poor, they
think of helping victims, especially women and children. 
Instead, LSC works for such causes as preventing the eviction of
drug dealers from public housing, shielding violent offenders'
criminal records from the public, getting perks for prison
inmates, and releasing mental patients (who often then join the
ranks of the homeless).
<p>
When LSC lawyers talk about conducting "research" and
facilitating "training," they are using euphemisms for political
organizing and lobbying for pro-abortion, pro-gay rights,
pro-welfare entitlement, pro-criminal, pro-drug, and pro-illegal
alien causes.
<p>
LSC's litigation deserves a large share of the blame for the
out-of-control, failed welfare crisis we have today.  LSC
initiated the case, King v. Smith, in which the
Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that the behavior of welfare
mothers, including cohabiting with wage-earning males, could not
be considered when determining eligibility for benefits.
<p>
In Shapiro v. Thompson in 1969, LSC got the Supreme Court to ban
the one-year residency requirement for welfare eligibility.  In
1970, in Goldberg v. Kelly, LSC persuaded the
Supreme Court to require a hearing process before benefits can
be cut off for any reason.  As a result, hardly anyone is ever
cut off.
<p>
The theory behind these cases, invented by LSC tax-funded
lawyers, is that welfare recipients have a property right in
their benefits, just like the rest of us have a property right
in our houses or automobiles.  This off-the-wall rationale has
become the cornerstone of the welfare rights movement, which has
changed our laws and picked the pockets of taxpayers.
<p>
Another favorite LSC constituency is incarcerated convicted
felons.  LSC's class action suit against the North Carolina
prison system resulted in a requirement that each of 13 prisons
provide softball and basketball equipment for two teams, a
piano, a set of drums, three guitars, and five frisbees. 
Another LSC victory was to establish Chicago prisoners' rights
to cable television and expensive weight rooms.
<p>
Other exotic LSC lawsuits included representing transsexuals in
an effort to overturn Georgia's prohibition on Medicaid
reimbursement for sex change operations, forcing public housing
officials to rent apartments to unemancipated minors, and trying
to define opium and alcohol addiction as a disability under the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
<p>
LSC's current president, Alexander Forger (best known as
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's lawyer), was questioned in April by
a Congressional committee about the imposition of certain
limitations on the way LSC funds are spent.  He impudently
replied:  "There is a legal case, if we choose to assert it,
that the [House] Committee does not have the authority to make
that decision."
<p>
Radical leftwing activism is part and parcel of LSC.  It is a
fraud on the public to pretend it can be reformed.  It must be
abolished.

<title>EDUCATION REFORM, TED KENNEDY-STYLE</title>

<center><h2>Education Reform, Ted Kennedy-Style</center></h2>
<p>

<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html"> Phyllis Schlafly</a> 
</center><hr><p>
<p>
Here's a multiple-choice question for you.  Will the new
conservative Republican majority in Congress 
<p>
(a) terminate federal functions for which there is no
constitutional authority, e.g., education; 
<p>
(b) reduce the size of government by abolishing agencies, e.g., the
Department of Education; 
<p>
(c) reduce the power of the Federal Government to micro-manage our
lives, e.g., stop mandating school curriculum; or 
<p>
(d) adopt a Ted Kennedy blueprint to manage individual behavior
from the schoolroom to the workplace?   
<p>
If you picked (d), you are on to the plan of the "moderate" House
Republicans to use the current momentum for education reform to put
America into the harness of National Economic Planning, a.k.a.
socialism.  Their plan is to use the school system to prepare
children, individually and collectively, only for jobs that are
designated and determined by the planners. 
<p>
One bill, sponsored by two senior Republicans, Steve Gunderson (R-
WI) and Bill Goodling (R-PA), is called "A Proposal for the
Establishment of the Department of Education and Employment." 
Riding the tide of the movement to abolish the Department of
Education, their bill would simply consolidate it with the
Department of Labor and put Robert Reich in charge.
<p>
This bill would convert public schools into "Workforce Preparation"
centers "to meet the challenges of a competitive global economy in
the 21st century."  Schoolchildren would be trained, rather than
educated, and schools would become "efficient delivery systems" to
serve the global economy.
<p>
A variation of this same goal, called the "Consolidated and
Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act"
(H.R. 1617), known by its acronym CAREERS, was introduced on May 11
and speedily passed out of committee on June 22.  Sponsored by Rep.
Howard McKeon (R-CA), it is actually modeled on a bill introduced
earlier this year by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) called the
"Workforce Development Act" (S. 180).
<p>
H.R. 1617 was designed to deceive conservatives by repealing last
year's "Schools-to-Work" Act and some other cumbersome and
redundant jobs and education programs.  However, H.R. 1617's 233
pages contain much more dangerous replacements.
<p>
Three key provisions in the Republican CAREERS bill parallel the
key provisions of Kennedy's "Workforce" bill.
<p>
The first key provision is that both bills give government the
responsibility for job placement and development through a
"Workforce Development Plan."  Kennedy's "Workforce" bill would
implement this through federal, state and local boards.  McKeon's
CAREERS bill specifies that the Governor shall submit "a strategic
state workforce development and literacy plan to provide policy
guidance with respect to workforce development progress" that meets
the requirements of the U.S. Secretaries of Education and Labor.
<p>
The second key provision of both "Workforce" and CAREERS is a labor
market information system (LMIS).  "Workforce" calls for a
"comprehensive, integrated labor market [information] system to
assure that workforce development programs are related to the
demand for particular skills in a local labor market."  CAREERS
would amend the 1933 Wagner Act to enumerate the information that
will be collected, managed and shared between the private and
public sectors.
<p>
CAREERS sets up a "comprehensive and coordinated labor market
information system" that will "project employment opportunities and
trends" based on "profiles of employers" and the "education and
training of job seekers."  The data collection system will record
how well the schoolchild did on the "performance assessments" of
the state's "goals and objectives" that are part of "Goals 2000,"
and be so thorough that even the "level of satisfaction of the
participants" will be measured and recorded.
<p>
The premise of the LMIS is the assumption that government
committees know what is best for the individual and for the
economy.  This is the structure under which the Soviets managed
their planned economy for so many decades, with Five-Year and Ten-
Year Plans that always failed.
<p>
Government economic planning is an abysmal failure worldwide, and
it's hard to think of anything that would be a bigger detriment to
future economic growth.  Can you imagine, for example, that any
government planning board would have decided in the 1980s that
workers needed to be trained for the immense computer and
communications industry that has arisen since then?
<p>
The third key provision in both Kennedy's "Workforce" bill and
McKeon's CAREERS bill is "one-stop career centers" (probably
located at public schools).  This is where the individual comes in
contact with the national economic planning system.
<p>
Based on economic projections by the different tiers of boards and
the vast collection of data on individuals, the "one-stop career
center" will train individuals for designated job slots.
<p>
The bottom line of these bills is to give the Federal Government
the power over every individual's ability to earn a living.  If we
let the government decide what jobs are "needed," what jobs young
people may be trained for, what performance and "outcome" standards
may be enforced on schoolchildren, and what certificate qualifies
them to be hired, and then track each individual's performance and
behavior in school and through the workforce on a national computer
data base, we will have lost freedom in America.

<title>Anniversary of the LifeSaver Bomb</title>

<center><h2>Anniversary of the LifeSaver Bomb</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly August 10, 1995
<p>
<p>
Ever since the Smithsonian Institution earlier this year tried to
give us all a guilty conscience about the B-29 named Enola Gay,
we've been inundated with a torrent of breastbeating about the
dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima.  The 50th anniversary of
August 6, 1945 is supposed to make us all hang our heads in shame.
<p>
Newsweek accompanied pages of ugly pictures with a poll reporting
that Americans now think dropping the bomb on Japan was "wrong." 
But the poll demographics tell a different story.  The senior
citizens whose lives were on the line in World War II approve of
the bombing, while the younger generations that don't remember
World War II have the luxury of sanctimonious second-guessing.
<p>
For the men who fought World War II, the atom bomb was a lifesaver
in every meaning of the word.  Dropping the bomb on Hiroshima meant
the difference between life and death to hundreds of thousands of
our best and brightest young men.
<p>
Dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima meant that those fine young
American men could come home, grow up to live normal lives, marry
and raise families, instead of dying a tortured death 5,000 miles
away.  The lucky ones would have identifiable graves.
<p>
What the Hiroshima bomb accomplished was to preempt General George
Marshall's horrendous plan to defeat Japan:  an island-by-island
invasion at a projected cost of a half million American deaths.
<p>
The first phase, called Operation Olympic, would have sent 650,000
American servicemen starting November 1, 1945 to try to capture the
island of Kyushu.  It would have been a slaughter because the
Japanese were prepared to defend Kyushu with 540,000 troops and
5,000 kamikaze planes.
<p>
The follow-up invasion, called Operation Coronet, was scheduled to
start the drive toward Tokyo on March 1, 1946.  U.S. plans
projected an invasion force of two million men.
<p>
Marshall couldn't have had any illusions about the hideous human
cost of such an island-by-island invasion.  Iwo Jima had given us
a preview.
<p>
On February 19, 1945, 30,000 Marines landed on that little five-
mile island, and five days later planted the U.S. flag, an event
immortalized in the most famous war photograph in history.  When
the Iwo Jima battle ended a month later, the price we had paid for
raising our flag was 26,000 casualties including more than 6,800
dead (including three of the six men in the photograph).
<p>
Japanese soldiers were tough fighters.  Under orders not to be
captured alive, only 1,000 were taken prisoner while 22,000 died
defending Iwo Jima.
<p>
With those kinds of casualty figures, only a reckless disregard of
American lives could cause a U.S. leader to send American troops to
invade Japanese home islands.  But that was the Marshall plan, even
though he knew from the coded messages we had intercepted that
Japan planned to defend its home islands with 2.3 million troops,
another four million Army and Navy employees, and an armed militia
of 28 million, all sworn to fight to the death.
<p>
Admiral William D. Leahy, Truman's military adviser, predicted that
30 to 35 percent of U.S. soldiers would be killed or wounded during
the first 30 days of an invasion of Japan.  The Hiroshima bomb
saved those lives, as well as those of about 400,000 Allied
prisoners of war and civilian detainees held by the Japanese, whom
Japan had planned to execute in the event of an American invasion. 
<p>
President Harry (the buck stops here) Truman didn't have any
difficulty making the atom bomb decision, and he shouldn't have. 
He told reporters in 1947 that "I didn't have any doubts at the
time" because the decision saved 250,000 to 500,000 American lives.
<p>
"I'd do it again," Truman said in 1956.  In 1962, he added, "I knew
I'd done the right thing."
<p>
Nor did other Americans at the time have any qualms about the loss
of life in the country that had started the war with a sneak attack
on Pearl Harbor.  Newsweek, for example, cheered the fact that
"perhaps one million persons were made homeless" by our firebombing
of Tokyo.
<p>
The argument is made today that we should not have dropped the bomb
because "Japan was already seeking to surrender."  In an interview
with veteran journalist Philip Clarke in 1962, Truman answered,
"The bombs were dropped after Japan had been warned that we had
discovered the greatest explosive in the history of the world and
then we asked them to surrender.  They did not do it."
<p>
Japan didn't even surrender after the Hiroshima bomb was dropped. 
It took the second atom bomb at Nagasaki, three days later, to
induce Japan to surrender.
<p>
Instead of being haunted by the ghosts of Hiroshima, Americans
today should remember the American heroes of Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal,
Midway, and Okinawa, and rejoice that the survivors of those bloody
battles lived to come home to America instead of being killed on
the beaches of Japan.

<title>LET'S ABOLISH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<center><h2>Let's Abolish The Department of Education</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
By Phyllis Schlafly  August 17, 1995
<p>
<p>
Abolishing the Department of Education was one of Ronald Reagan's
campaign promises when he ran for President in 1980.  Fulfilling
that promise is long overdue, and the time to do it is now.
<p>
Education is not a department that has always been with us like
State, Treasury, and Justice.  The Department of Education was
created as a payoff to the National Education Association (NEA) for
its early endorsement of Jimmy Carter's presidential candidacy in
1976.
<p>
That NEA endorsement was a significant factor in giving Carter
national visibility and momentum.  At that time, the little-known
one-term Governor of a southern state was considered a long shot by
most observers.
<p>
The NEA has the same symbiotic relationship with Bill Clinton.  On
his way to the 1992 Democratic National Convention that nominated
him, he stopped off for a visit with Keith Geiger, then NEA
president, and promised to invite him to sleep in Abe Lincoln's bed
at the White House. 
<p>
Contrary to the gloom-and-doom fearmongering of the education
lobby, U.S. public schools will not collapse if the Department of
Education is abolished.  Public schools flourished before there was
any Department of Education (and academic standards were much
higher), and public schools will continue to exist if the
Department is abolished.
<p>
Federal spending in public schools amounts to only about six
percent of their total budget.  Every week we read about
corporations successfully downsizing their workforce and thereby
achieving greater efficiency, so public schools should have no
difficulty downsizing by six percent.  Their top-heavy and
redundant administrative bureaucracy is a scandal, anyway.
<p>
Congress doles out 70 billion federal tax dollars per year on what
is euphemistically called education.  The mere listing of the
programs is awesome and depressing.
<p>
The Department of Education spends $33 billion a year of this
amount administering 244 different programs.  The remainder of the
$70 billion is spent by 30 other federal agencies on 308 programs,
which the General Accounting Office says "often are duplicative and
overlapping."
<p>
More than 90 federal preschool and child care programs are
administered through eleven federal agencies and 20 offices that
target children of similar ages and provide similar services. 
There are 86 federal programs in nine federal departments that
offer teacher training.
<p>
At least 46 federal programs administered by eight federal agencies
are working on what is called youth development.  Fourteen
different programs provide food and food-related assistance.  At
least 163 federal programs, spread out among 15 departments and
agencies, say they are providing employment and training
assistance.
<p>
This federal spending imposes a costly paperwork burden on local
schools.  A 1991 survey of Ohio school districts reported that
schools must complete 173 federal reports and forms.  
<p>
We should face the fact that, like welfare, our 30 year experiment
in federal spending on education has failed.  Illiteracy has
reached epidemic levels and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have
dropped 73 points since 1960.
<p>
Incidentally, the decline in SAT scores is now going to be
concealed from the public starting this year by the simple device
of raising every test score nearly 100 points.  They call this
"centering," but another word for it is cheating.
<p>
The 1994 election sent a strong message to Congress:  cut federal
spending, reduce government, eliminate agencies.  Unfortunately,
some Congressmen seem to think they can pretend to abolish the
Department of Education while merely shifting the functions and the
spending to other agencies.
<p>
It is a bafflement how any Congressman could think that the
constituency eager to abolish the Department of Education could be
appeased by transferring the functions and the spending to Labor
Secretary Robert Reich or Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala.  Yet those are the most discussed proposals for education
"reform." 
<p>
Out across America, the mood of the people is just the opposite.  
Three states this year actually rejected federal funding for Goals
2000, a truly remarkable reaction to the offer of goodies from the
federal treasury.
<p>
The U.S. Constitution doesn't mention education, and there is no
authority in the Constitution for the Federal Government to meddle
in local schools.  Education is not a proper federal function.
<p>
If the Federal Government has no constitutional authority to ban
guns from schools (which the Supreme Court ruled in this year's
Lopez decision), then it follows a fortiori that the Federal
Government has no authority to impose curricular requirements or
hand out funds according to the whims and the politics of federal
officials.
<p>
Public schools in America were vastly superior before the Federal
Government turned on the funding faucet.  It's time to write finis
to federal aid to education and return that $70 billion per year to
the American people in tax cuts.

<h3>WHY ARE REPUBLICANS PROMOTING MANAGED CARE?</h3>
By <a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Republicans spent two years attacking the totalitarian Clinton
Health Plan because it would put all Americans into Managed Care,
allow medical care only as permitted by Gatekeepers, deny our right
to choose our own doctor, limit access to specialists, and force us
to enroll in Regional Alliances with more government control and
price fixing.  Republicans won the argument, defeated all versions
of Clintoncare, and used Clinton's Health Plan as a central issue
in winning a Republican majority in Congress.<p>
Now, it's hard to believe, but the Republican Congressional
leadership has warmed over the same bad ideas and is touting them
as Medicare reform.  If Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole think they can
sell the same bad product that Bill Clinton failed to sell, they
are out of touch with the real world.<p>
Drafts of the Republican Medicare reform that have leaked out 
indicate that it is based on herding seniors into Managed Care
(HMOs).  The Managed Care lobby reputedly has $9 billion (not
million) in cash reserves to soft-sell its propaganda, so it's not
surprising that Republican spokesmen are suddenly praising Managed
Care.<p>
Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) is appearing on television as a spokesman
for the Republican Medicare plan.  Using data provided by the Group
Health Association of America, the HMO trade group, he claims that
people just love HMOs.<p>
The Managed Care lobby has succeeded in making Rep. Bill Thomas (R-
CA), chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, their
chief Managed Care advocate in the House.  His statements on
managed care on a PBS special to be aired in September are truly
incredible, according to one reporter who has previewed it.<p>
Thomas was asked to address the complaint of a person who can no
longer choose his doctor because his company switched to an HMO. 
Thomas repled, "I'd ask you a couple of questions.  How did you
find your first doctor?  Well, the answer is that it was probably
a friend of a friend, or you looked in the Yellow Pages."<p>
"And this," he exclaimed, "is the sacred system that someone wants
to defend! Now, you created a personal relationship, which you
don't want to change.  There's no reason in the world why that
personal relationship couldn't be recreated."<p>
Sorry, Bill, seniors are not going to let you "recreate" personal
relationships with their doctors.  Seniors are not dumb and they
vote, so they may decide to "recreate" their relationship with
their Congressman and elect one who will stand up for the right to
choose your own doctor.<p>
Republicans claim that their Medicare plan would offer seniors more
"options" among "plans."  That's an illusion.  The only option that
matters is the option to choose your specialist and your treatment
when you are sick.  HMOs put those choices in the hands of
Gatekeepers who receive increased pay for limiting access.<p>
Republicans made a terrible blunder in letting Medicare become the
number-one issue of the 1995-1996 campaign.  It's a losing issue
for Republicans, and their arguments are not selling at the
grassroots.<p>
The Gephardt line is powerful:  "Republicans are cutting the
benefits and raising taxes on the elderly in order to give tax
breaks to the rich."  As top Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said: 
"Linking Medicare reforms to tax cuts is a potent line of attack. 
Hurting beneficiaries is what matters."<p>
The Republican leadership must change its strategy and make Medical
Savings Accounts for today's workers (i.e., H.R. 1818) the
centerpiece of health care reform.  Go for the votes of the 30-55
year old age group and tell the truth:<p>
"Medicare as we know it is not going to be there when you are
age65.  We Republicans are going to make sure you have health care
by allowing you to set up your personal tax-deductible Medical
Savings Account (MSA) so that you will have your own money to
provide your health care needs.  With MSAs, you can choose your own
doctor, save for health care in retirement and long-term care, and
avoid HMO gatekeepers."<p>
Medicare was the crown jewel of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. 
The underlying premise is that today's workers should be taxed to
pay for the health care of the elderly.  It's a Ponzi scheme that
only works as long as more people are paying into the system than
are receiving benefits.  When the baby boomers reach 65, the Ponzi
scheme will totally collapse, with or without Medicare HMOs.<p>
Liberal Democrats know that MSAs represent a direct challenge to
their generation-transfer scheme.  They hope that Republicans
continue to expend their political capital in politically fatal
Medicare ""reform'' rather than giving baby boomers a personal
medical savings account, which would liberate them from socialized
medicine in retirement.<p>
Medical Savings Accounts are not only smart politics, but they are
the best long-term solution for financing our health care system. <p>

<h2>Is the Government Planning Your Child's Career?</h2> <P>
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center><P>

<hr><P> 
Republican Presidential candidates criss-crossing the country have 
discovered that one of their best hot-button applause lines is "I 
promise to abolish the Department of Education." Out in the byways of 
America, parents know that public schools are a disaster area and that 
Federal Government spending has hurt, not helped, the situation. 
 <p>
So it is a puzzlement why the Republican House just passed an 
education bill that increases federal control and involvement in the 
public schools rather than reducing it. Called the "CAREERS" bill, it 
uses federal dollars to expand and institutionalize one of the worst 
Clinton bills passed last year, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. 
 <p>
Republican Congressmen who voted for this bill are sending six-page 
handouts to their constituents purporting to show how amendments have 
"answered parents' concerns." But opponents of CAREERS didn't merely 
have "concerns" about the CAREERS bill; they recognize it as the 
philosophy we thought we defeated in the 1994 election. 
 <p>
When one takes time to read the CAREERS bill, it is obvious that it is 
the legislative implementation of an 18-page letter written by Marc 
Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, 
to Hillary Clinton on November 11, 1992, just after the Presidential 
election. This letter states that it was the result of a meeting in 
David Rockefeller's office, at which those present were "literally 
radiating happiness" at Clinton's victory. 
 <p>
They were celebrating their plans for what "you [Hillary] and Bill 
should do now about education, training and labor market policy." 
Tucker's letter laid out their master plan to "remold" the public 
schools into a "national human resources development system," which 
would be "guided by clear standards that define the stages of the 
system for the people who progress through it, and regulated on the 
basis of outcomes that providers produce for their clients." 
 <p>
Tucker's vision is aggressively ambitious. His letter called for "a 
seamless web" that "literally extends from cradle to grave and is the 
same system for everyone -- young and old, poor and rich, worker and 
full-time student." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" includes a national employment service in 
which "all available front-line jobs, whether public or private, must 
be listed in it by law." Then, "a system of labor market boards is 
established at the local, state and federal levels to coordinate the 
systems for job training, postsecondary professional and technical 
education, adult basic education, job matching and counseling." 
 <p>
Tucker's "seamless web" calls for government to be in the drivers' 
seat at every stage of the "human resources development system." The 
"labor market boards" will decide what jobs may be allowed, and the 
schools will "train" students (the human resources) for jobs selected 
by the "labor market boards." 
 <p>
The "new general education standard" (i.e., a state-certified 
"certificate of mastery" rather than a diploma) will become a 
"prerequisite for enrollment in all professional and technical degree 
programs," as well as for all hiring. Tucker's letter lays out how, 
under his system, schools will be required to provide information "to 
government agencies in a uniform format." 
 <p>
Tucker's letter makes it clear why so much of the discussion about 
Congressional appropriations for education includes references to the 
Department of Labor. Tucker and his friends have been planning to meld 
Labor and Education functions ever since Lynn Martin, Secretary of 
Labor in the Bush Administration, published the SCANS report. 
 <p>
Much of Marc Tucker's ambitious plan is already in place. Last year, 
Clinton signed the Goals 2000 Act, which requires schools to adopt 
"standards," and the School-to-Work law, which lays the groundwork for 
using high schools to train students for occupations selected by the 
local labor market boards. 
 <p>
The CAREERS bill expands on School-to-Work and perfectly tracks the 
Tucker letter. The CAREERS text states that the Governor of each state 
(if he wants the funds) shall "designate" the establishment of "a 
local workforce development board" in each local area. In the House 
debate on CAREERS on September 19, Education Opportunities Committee 
Chairman William Goodling (R-PA) stated that the bill requires that 
"training be tied to occupations in demand in the local community." 
 <p>
CAREERS makes it clear that government will now assume the power to 
set up workforce development plans, with a comprehensive and 
coordinated labor market computer system, and that students will be 
trained only to work in the occupations prescribed by the government. 
<p> 
In the House debate, Goodling boasted that the White House is pleased 
with this legislation. He admitted that the CAREERS bill has been in 
preparation "for 2 years," which places the date at long before 
Republicans became a majority in the House. 
 <p>
When you combine this workforce system with the schools' obvious 
failure to teach children to read and the dumbing down process called 
Outcome-Based Education, the result will be a Third World education to 
accustom Americans to Third World wages. The "powers that be" want 
public school graduates to be content to compete with workers in 
foreign countries who work for 1/40th of American wages. 
<p> 
Think about that every time you hear politicians, businessmen, 
educators and bureaucrats talking on television about "competing in 
the global economy" and becoming "citizens of the world."

<h2>Beware of Global Taxes for Global Entitlements </h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"It's not sustainable for member states to enjoy representation 
without taxation," Prime Minister John Major told the United Nations 
at its birthday celebration. He thought he was demonstrating British 
wit in making a play on the great slogan of the American Revolution. 
We are not amused. 
<p> 
The United Nations has a big problem: the tax-cutting Republican 
Congress is disinclined to continue financing those overpaid foreign 
bureaucrats in the lavish style to which they have become accustomed. 
So their solution is to impose a global tax that would produce 
billions or even trillions of dollars without any Congressional 
action. 
 <p>
The so-called Independent Commission on Population and Quality of Life 
has issued a report listing dozens of innovative global devices to tax 
people, corporations, and international business activities. These 
include taxes on aviation traffic and freight, ocean freight and 
cruises, aviation fuel, telecommunications frequencies, communications 
satellites, international postal items, and trade in goods and 
services. 
 <p>
The global tax idea was first publicly launched at the UN World Summit 
for Social Development, held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995. 
James G. Speth, the Clinton-appointed head of the UN Development 
Program, called for a global tax on speculative movements of 
international funds, the consumption of non-renewable energy, 
environmental permits, and the arms trade. 
 <p>
James Tobin, 1981 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, has called for a 
tax on spot transactions in foreign exchange. The UN bureaucrats are 
licking their chops at Tobin's prediction that "the revenue potential 
is immense, over $1.5 trillion a year," and they are now 
enthusiastically using Tobin's prestige to advocate what they call the 
"Tobin tax." 
 <p>
The Commission on Global Governance, a "private" group with government 
and foundation funding, published a volume this year entitled "Our 
Global Neighborhood." Stating that "it is time for a consensus on 
global taxation for servicing the needs of the global neighborhood," 
this report calls for taxes on flight-lanes, sea lanes, and ocean 
fishing areas. 
 <p>
This report also brags that "the idea of safeguarding and managing the 
global commons, particularly those related to the physical 
environment, is now widely accepted. And the notion of expanding the 
role of the United Nations is now accepted in relation to military 
security." 
 <p>
Another model for a global tax is hidden in the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, a UN treaty the Clinton Administration is trying to 
get the Senate to ratify. This treaty sets up a global taxing 
authority called the International Seabed Authority to collect fees 
and royalties imposed on American mining firms. 
 <p>
An outfit called Worldwatch Institute issued a report this year called 
"Partnership for the Planet." It calls for a global tax to finance 
"the transition to a sustainable society -- including environmental 
programs, social initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts." 
 <p>
Just as the new Republican Congress is trying to put a lid on welfare 
and Medicare entitlements, the UN is planning to saddle U.S. taxpayers 
with global entitlements. The Oxfam Poverty Report proclaims that 
"international aid should be seen as a financial entitlement, and as 
part of a compact between citizens in the industrial and developing 
worlds." 
 <p>
UN bureaucrats and advocates must be having lots of fun dreaming up 
ways to tax Americans to support their notions of "global 
neighborhood" and "sustainable human development." The Ford Foundation 
produced a study last year called "Renewing the United Nations 
System," which advocates an annual "United Nations lottery, 
administered by a special authority under the Secretary-General." 
 <p>
The Ford Foundation also financed a report called "The United Nations 
in Its Second Half-Century," which calls for allowing the UN to have 
Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund. 
Rationalized as a "levy on the utilization of the global commons," 
this proposal would enable the UN to bypass Congress in accessing U.S. 
taxpayers' money. 
 <p>
Other wealthy liberal foundations that have helped orchestrate the 
demand for a global tax include the MacArthur and Carnegie 
Foundations. The World Federalist Association, now headed by former 
presidential candidate John B. Anderson, weighs in with a 
recommendation for UN taxes on international travel and postal 
service. 
 <p>
Bella Abzug, who was so visible in the recent UN Women's Conference in 
Beijing, also serves as a member of the advisory council of the Global 
Commission to Fund the United Nations. It comes as no surprise that 
she endorses global taxes as a way to finance and enforce the radical 
feminist agenda that she presented at the UN conferences on population 
and women's issues. 
 <p>
Americans had better wake up and expel the UN before it succeeds in 
any of its arrogant global taxing plans. Congress should hold hearings 
on the outrageous global tax schemes exposed by researcher Cliff 
Kincaid for Americans for Tax Reform.

<h2>Don't Turn the Clock Back to Rockefeller Republicanism</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
Ever since the four-term phenomenon of Franklin D. Roosevelt, two very 
different factions have wrestled for control of the Republican Party. 
On the one hand are the grassroots Republicans, Main Street Americans, 
who labor in the precincts to elect candidates they hope will be 
faithful after election.
<p> 
On the other hand are the powerful people who fancy themselves as 
kingmakers, the wheelers and dealers of the proverbial smoke- filled 
rooms, also known as the New York or Wall Street or eastern liberal 
establishment. They include the multinational corporations (whose most 
recent accomplishment was the Mexican bailout) and the Business 
Roundtable types, whose fingers of control slither through what is 
called the media elite. 
<p>
These kingmakers are Big Government Republicans. They seek to maintain 
the current high level of federal spending, and they want to control 
how the money is spent. They are liberals, but their favorite word to 
identify themselves is "moderate." 
<p>
In 1940 the New York kingmakers created the 60-day wonder named 
Wendell Willkie. He was a registered Democrat, but the kingmakers 
manufactured a new image for him through a media blitz and made him 
the Republican nominee for President. 
<p>
In 1944 and 1948, the kingmakers forced the Republican Party to 
nominate the man who brought the expression "me too" into the 
political lexicon. Voters opted for the real Democrat in 1944 and 
1948, not the carbon copy. 
<p>
In 1952 the New York kingmakers felt threatened by the rise of the 
conservative movement led by Senator Bob Taft. The issue was clear: 
Taft had pledged to reduce the level of federal spending 
significantly, so the liberal Republicans set out to defeat him at all 
costs. By the narrowest of margins, the New York kingmakers stole the 
1952 Republican National Convention for a military hero, Dwight 
Eisenhower. 
<p>
During Ike's two terms, the liberals initiated all kinds of big 
federal spending programs that have plagued us ever since, such as 
federal aid to education. It was no surprise that Republican seats in 
Congress steadily declined. 
<p>
In 1964, the New York kingmakers tried to force Republicans to 
nominate Nelson Rockefeller, a Big Government, internationalist 
Republican Governor who raised taxes, engaged in profligate spending 
of the taxpayers' money, and me-tooed the liberal Democratic policies. 
They failed; grassroots conservatives asserted their majority position 
in the Republican Party by nominating Barry Goldwater and repudiating 
Rockefeller Republicanism. 
<p>
The Rockefeller cabal then cooperated with the media moguls in a 
campaign to defeat Goldwater that was marked by unprecedented hysteria 
and vicious smears. The result was Lyndon B. Johnson and the 
exponential expansion of Big Government under the Great Society. 
<p>
In the following years, conservatives were cowed by a constant 
refrain. "You conservatives had your chance with Barry Goldwater. His 
defeat proves America will never elect a conservative, so the best you 
can hope for is Richard Nixon." 
<p>
The Nixon regime proved that conservatives are fools to accept half a 
loaf. In foreign policy, his appointee Henry Kissinger continued the 
disastrous McNamara policies of abandoning our strategic superiority 
to the Soviets. In domestic policy, Nixon admitted he was a Keynesian 
and even inflicted price controls on us. 
<p>
In 1976 the fainthearted persuaded a scant majority of Republicans to 
stick with the "moderate," Gerald Ford. However, even that "moderate" 
Republican National Convention was unwilling to take Rockefeller as 
Ford's running mate. 
<p>
Finally, in 1980, Ronald Reagan mainstreamed conservatism as the 
vision and the values of Middle America. He drew conservative and pro-
family Democrats and independents into the Republican Party. 
<p>
Reagan's vision of conservatism consists of four specific elements: 
limited government with lower taxes; personal responsibility with a 
disdain for taxpayer handouts for personal or social causes; military 
superiority so our armed forces can protect our independence 
(specifically including SDI); and respect for life and family values. 
<p>
Each of these four elements of Reagan's conservatism has a large 
constituency among the American people. The coalition produced the 
greatest Presidency and the biggest Republican victories of our times. 
This Reagan coalition is the model for the future of the Republican 
Party, and casting off any of them would spell defeat for Republicans. 
<p>
It is a puzzlement why Colin Powell identified himself as a 
"Rockefeller Republican," when Nelson Rockefeller was the 
quintessential representative of the eastern liberal establishment. To 
the grassroots conservatives who are now the dominant majority in the 
Republican Party, Rockefeller Republicanism means "in your face" Big 
Government liberalism. 
<p>
To nominate a Rockefeller Republican in 1996 would be turning the 
clock back to 1964 when that crowd lost the watershed battle between 
grassroots conservatives vs. the establishment. It would be as foolish 
as refighting the Civil Rights Act, the other defining battle of 1964. 
<p>
The Reagan model teaches us that authentic conservatism is the road to
 victory. Conservative Republicans don't have to settle for a me-tooer 
or a liberal or a "moderate" masquerading as a conservative because 
conservatives have the votes to demand the real thing. <p>

<h2>Republicans Want Answers From  
                          Presidential Candidates</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>                    
  

We can debate whether or not the media really tell us what to think, 
but they surely tell us what to think about. The 1996 presidential 
election is still almost a year away, but the media have been forcing 
us to think about it since the beginning of 1995. By the time it is 
over, it will have been nearly a two-year stretch, and we are already 
tired of it. 

Despite the persistent pressures from the perennial pollsters, 
Republican voters are a stubborn lot and a big percentage simply 
refuses to make a choice. Most presidential hopefuls are still 
clustered in single digits. 
<p>
The fact that Ronald Reagan was in single digits at this point before 
his first election doesn't dissuade the media from their demands. The 
abrupt departure from the race of Pete Wilson and then Colin Powell, 
both supposedly ten-ton gorillas, didn't pry Republican voters loose 
from the category of "undecided." 
<p>
Bob Dole's substantial lead is probably the result of, as Morton 
Kondracke has pointed out, the Republican Party's preference for 
primogeniture. As the senior pol, Dole's in line; he's been in office 
so long he deserves it, or so the thinking goes. 
<p>
But political parties aren't hereditary. Voters usually select their 
candidates on the basis of their likability, their articulation of a 
mix of views on issues that voters care about, and the vision and 
leadership they manifest. 
<p>
Most of the presidential political discussion seems to be along the 
following lines. Who wins straw polls among other politicians? Who 
raises the most money? Who has held more important government jobs? 
<p>
Maybe the voters just dont care about those factors, and thats why 
they are holding back. So what issues do the voters care about? 
<p>
What are called the sovereignty questions are the preeminent issues 
that presidential candidates should talk about because they concern 
national integrity and survival. Voters want the answers to a whole 
cluster of questions like these. 
<p>
Do you support barring President Clinton from sending American troops 
to Bosnia by cutting off all taxpayers' money? Where do you stand on 
the prospective Army court-martial of a U.S. soldier for refusing to 
wear the United Nations uniform? 
<p>
Will you stop sending American money to the UN to involve us in 
foreign wars, a practice dishonestly described as "peacekeeping"? Will 
you oppose all efforts to allow the UN to grab any kind of taxing 
power, and will you cut off all money to the World Bank if it diverts 
any of its funds to the UN? 
<p>
Will you oppose the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (as Ronald 
Reagan did) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (promoted 
by Hillary Rodham Clinton)? 
<p>
Will you candidly admit that NAFTA has cost tens of thousands of 
American jobs and take steps to remedy the manifold injuries to 
American workers and taxpayers? Will you get us out of the World Trade 
Organization? 
<p>
What are you going to do about the Mexican bailout? Do you pledge that 
you will never again allow U.S. taxpayers' money to be used to shore 
up foreign currency? 
<p>
What is your plan to stop illegal immigration and to cut off all 
taxpayer benefits to the illegal aliens who are already in this 
country? Will you support a moratorium on legal immigration until we 
deal with the illegal immigration problem? 
<p>
Do you support making English our official language? Will you cut off 
all taxpayer support of foreign language ballots and the language 
apartheid enforced on public schoolchildren in the name of "bilingual 
education"? 
<p>
What is your stand on term limits, secret pay raises for Congressmen, 
and Congressional pensions? Will ou cut off taxpayers' handout to 
wealthy organizations such as Planned Parenthood and AARP? 
<p>
Are you going to cancel all federal regulations that impose 
affirmative action quotas or set-asides? 
<p>
Education and crime are certainly two hot-button concerns, but they 
are not primarily federal issues. Most of what the Federal Government 
is doing in those areas does not address the real problems, and some 
of what the Federal Government is doing is downright detrimental. 
<p>
It's not the job of the President to reform public schools or see that 
the children are taught how to read and write, but it would be helpful 
if presidential candidates would promise to eliminate federal control 
by abolishing the Department of Education and Goals 2000. 
<p>
Likewise, crime control is and should be primarily a state and local 
matter. But it would be helpful if the Federal Government would get 
moving with prosecutions for the killings carried out by federal 
agents at Ruby Ridge and Waco. 
<p>
Voters want their candidates to address the fact that so many 
Americans feel that government is their enemy, not their protector. 
They want candidates to address specifics such as the government's 
taking of private lands at the behest of the environmental extremists 
and proposals to allow Janet Reno to wiretap the phones of every 
American. 
<p>
Many voters are likely to remain undecided as long as the candidates 
dodge the issues they really care about. <p>

<h2>America Has No Business In Bosnia </h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>

<p><hr><P> 
                      
  
 
So President Clinton wants to send 20,000 American soldiers to Bosnia. 
The man who ducked out of serving in the Vietnam War now says it's our 
duty to send other men's sons to fight a foreign war. 
<P>
Clinton says he has already committed 20,000 troops and now an 
unsuspecting nation is told we must go along because "he gave his 
word." But Clinton made that rash and casual promise on his own; the 
rest of us are not a party to the deal. And since when is "his word" 
inviolate? 
<P>
Clinton is trying to tell Americans that going to Bosnia is our moral 
duty. But he is no oracle of moral law. We didn't start the war, it 
isn't our obligation to stop it, and foreign policy should not be used 
for social work. 
<P>
Unable to show any vital national interest, the Clinton spin salesmen 
have instructed all Administration spokesmen to say that troops are 
needed in Bosnia to protect our "values," although they never say what 
values they are talking about. The word has no meaning in relation to 
the Bosnia decision; its use is just a cheap attempt to paper over the 
Administration's lack of any reasonable argument. 
<P>
Clinton says we must assert American leadership in the world. But the 
kind of leadership America should assert is political leadership in 
showing the superiority of freedom over totalitarianism, and economic 
leadership in demonstrating the superiority of the free market over 
socialism and government planning. 
<P>
Clinton asserts that it is his prerogative as Commander-in-Chief to 
send troops to Bosnia. But his constitutional authority to dispatch 
troops is only for the purpose of defending Americans or vital 
American interests, not to rush out and join a war that is none of our 
business. Only Congress has the constitutional power to go to war. 
<P>
Clinton argues that we should go into Bosnia to keep the fighting from 
spreading into a bigger war. But he's got it exactly backwards. It is 
U.S. involvement and casualties that turn a local fight into a world 
event. 
<P>
Clinton says our troops will be "peacekeepers." But there is no peace 
in Bosnia; all sides hate each other and one of the warring parties 
has refused to ratify the Dayton accord. Nor can the United States 
pretend to be neutral so soon after we bombed the Serb secessionists. 
<P>
Even if there were peace, U.S. servicemen are not policemen and should 
not be forced to assume that role. Policemen and soldiers are trained 
for different missions, and those purposes should not be blurred. 
<P>
It's not at all clear that anyone can stop the fighting. Balkan 
nations have fought each other for over 500 years, and too much blood 
has been shed over little pieces of land for the enmity to disappear 
in the 12 months of our projected deployment there. 
<P>
The Dayton agreement creates a new Bosnian state with indefensible 
borders and a collective presidency with, in rotation, a Muslim, a 
Serb and a Croat as chairman. Under this inherently unstable 
arrangement, each side will have its own army! 
<P>
If it is truly in the vital interest of Europe to stop the 
bloodletting in the former Yugoslavia, let the European countries send 
whatever troops are necessary. Europe has plenty of money and manpower 
to take on the task. 
<P>
Despite the lack of a clear mission as to why we are going in, what 
good we can accomplish, and when we will get out, the entire liberal 
and internationalist establishment plus the media elite are lining up 
to support Clinton's expedition into Bosnia. Let's look at the reasons 
for this curious propaganda push. 
<P>
They want to give NATO something to do before the American people 
realize that NATO has completed its mission of stopping the Soviets 
from invading Europe and now ought to be retired. The Warsaw Pact is 
already "history," but NATO careerists want to keep their bureaucracy 
going through "mission creep." 
<P>
The internationalists remember how hard it was to get the United 
States involved in World Wars I and II. They think that, if they can 
just keep U.S. troops constantly marching around in Europe on any 
make-work project, America will be caught right in the middle if and 
when another big war starts. 
<P>
The internationalists want to get the United States in some kind of 
world government and, since the United Nations is in such disfavor, 
NATO can serve as a useful stepping stone. Using NATO instead of the 
UN will avoid the criticisms about U.S. servicemen wearing UN uniforms 
or serving under foreign commanders. 
<P>
The American people are looking for a leader who will stand up to 
Clinton and say "NO, we are not going to let you drag our nation into 
a foreign war that is none of our business." We are looking for a 
Senator and a Representative who will lead the battle in Congress to 
<P>
cut off all money for use in Bosnia, which Congress has every right 
and constitutional authority to do. 
<P>
And one more thing: "OK with conditions" is not acceptable. We want a 
leader to "just say NO."

<h2>Bilingualism Is The Wrong Way To Go</h2> 

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
For the last five years, Political Correctness has forced the academic (and  
much of the political) world to pay homage to the new sacred cows called  
multiculturalism and diversity. Those are usually used as code words to  
challenge the assumption that Western Civilization is the basis of what we  
call the American system, and to pretend that all cultures are equal and  
contributed equally to the America we know.  
 <p> 
This fad seems to be trying to get us to change our national identity from  
E pluribus unum (From the many, one) to E uno plures (From the one, many).  <p>
Indeed, Vice President Al Gore's goof last year indicates that he has  
already made that transition.  
 <p> 
But cultures are not so easily rationalized. Cultures are grounded in  
deeply held emotions, history and relationships that defy logical analysis.  
The separatist movement in Quebec and the fighting in Bosnia are two recent  
evidences of how inherited cultures cause bitter, current problems.  
  <p>
The United States is the world's most stunning example of a nation that has  
peaceably and successfully assimilated people from many disparate cultures.  <p>
So why are some people trying to separate us into factions, emphasizing  
what divides us instead of what unites us?  
  <p>
The $8 billion bureaucratic failure called "bilingual education" keeps more  
than two million immigrant children in a three-to-five year program where  
as much as 90 percent of their school day is spent in their native  
language. Sometimes their teachers speak almost no English.  
  <p>
New York City students are taught in 82 languages, including Kpelle,  
Nyanja, Twi, Gurma, Ewe, Cham, and others most Americans have never heard  
of. The bureaucrats try to put all children with Hispanic-sounding names in  
bilingual education programs even though they may be fully English-speaking  
and come from English- speaking homes.  
  <p>
The term bilingual education is a complete misnomer because there is no  
requirement that children in bilingual programs ever become fluent in  
English. Our tax dollars are used to promote unilingual education in the  
immigrant's native tongue, and this is nurturing a permanent,  
non-English-speaking subculture.  
  <p>
Without any proof that bilingual classes promote their announced purpose,  
and despite the opposition of the majority of those the program is supposed  
to serve, the bilingual education lobby has shifted its objective. It is  
now trying to make foreign language and culture an integral component of  
American society.  
  <p>
Some advocates see bilingual education as the first step in a radical  
transformation of the United States into a nation without one common  
language or fixed borders. Josue Gonzales, director of bilingual education  
during the Carter Administration and now a professor at Columbia University  
Teachers College, says that Spanish "should no longer be regarded as a  
foreign language" but should be considered "a second national language."  
  <p>
Some in the bilingual lobby have even more extreme views. At the annual  
conference of the National Association for Bilingual Education in Phoenix  
in February 1995, several speakers challenged the very idea of U.S.  
sovereignty and promoted the notion that the Southwest and northern Mexico  
are really one cultural region, which they call La Frontera.  
  <p>
Eugene Garcia, head of bilingual education at the U.S. Department of  
Education in the Clinton Administration, told the conferees that "the  
border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that  
border shall be nonexistent." His rhetoric was greeted by thunderous  
applause.  <p>
  
The November 1994 meeting of the Texas Association for Bilingual Education  
in Austin featured both the Mexican and American flags on the stage. The  
teachers and school personnel in attendance stood for the singing of the  
national anthems of both countries. The political battle over California's  
Proposition 187 in 1994 featured a huge demonstration of people marching  
with Mexican, not U.S., flags.  
  <p>
The bilingual movement should be stopped before it causes any more damage  
to our national fabric. At least it should be stopped insofar as this lobby  
is financed by the taxpayers, and those who work for separatist causes  
should do so on their own dollar, not ours.  
  <p>
Rep. Toby Roth (R-WI), with 91 co-sponsors, has introduced a bill to make  
English our official language. It would end the government's multilingual  
policies, including bilingual education, voting ballots in languages other  
than English, and foreign language citizenship ceremonies.  
  <p>
You can't be an American if you don't speak English. Our public schools  
should be mandated to teach all children in English.  
  <p>
President Theodore Roosevelt said it best: "The one absolute certain way of  
bringing this nation to ruin would be to permit it to become a tangle of  
squabbling nationalities. We have but one flag. We must also have but one  
language, and that language is English."

<h2>The Health Care Dilemma of Patients Who Can't Read</h2>

<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
"Our health care system requires that patients be able to read." That 
ought to be a self-evident truth that is silly to enunciate, but it is 
actually the sensational revelation of a major problem just made 
public in the December JAMA (Journal of the American Medical 
Association). 
<p>
The JAMA article reports on the first study ever made to test literacy 
using words combined with numbers that are in common use in health 
care. It was a cross-sectional research project conducted at two urban 
hospitals, one in Georgia, the other in California. 
<p>
The massive National Adult Literacy Survey made by the U.S. government 
in 1993 concluded that 40 to 44 million adults are functionally 
illiterate and that another 50 million are only marginally literate. 
This new health literacy study specifically measured the ability of 
patients to read and understand medical instructions and health care 
information according to a test called TOFHLA (Test of Functional 
Health Literacy in Adults) and discovered that 33 percent of patients 
did not understand instructions for common procedures written at the 
fourth grade level. 
<p>
This health literacy study measured the ability of patients to perform 
such tasks as reading labels on prescription bottles, instructions 
about how often to take medication, notices about when is the next 
doctor's appointment, informed consent forms, instructions about 
diagnostic tests, and how to complete insurance forms. The depressing 
conclusion is that a high percentage of patients simply can't read 
well enough to function in our health care system. 
<p>
People with inadequate literacy skills are unable to read a 
thermometer, write down instructions by telephone, or read common 
medical terms such as "orally," "teaspoon," and "hours." <p>They can't 
access useful messages from newspaper and magazine articles, 
educational materials, posters in supermarkets, or billboards about 
the importance of screening procedures or flu shots. 
<p>
Health care standards require hospitals to provide patients with 
understandable health instructions, but do not require that the 
instructions be understood. Hospitals assume they are complying if 
they give patients a readable document, but a written instruction 
assumes that the patients can read. 
<p>
Patients who can't read informed consent forms present doctors and 
hospitals with what the researchers call "a troubling ethical issue." <p>
Even if an effort is made to simplify the forms to the sixth grade 
level, that still will not reach the many who are functionally 
illiterate. 
<p>
This health literacy project turned up other new and useful 
information not hitherto unearthed by previous literacy surveys made 
by educational institutions. 
<p>
Neither appearance nor years of schooling adequately predicts 
illiteracy. This means that illiteracy is not just a problem for 
minority dropouts or recent immigrants, but is a handicap suffered by 
all races and classes of people who have no visible signs of 
disability and have spent many years in school. 
<p>
Many illiterates do not realize that they have a problem. They are 
like myopic children who don't know that they are simply not seeing 
details that others see. 
<p>
Ronald Reagan tells in his autobiography how, as a young boy riding in 
the back seat of an automobile, he picked up someone else's glasses 
and tried them on. Suddenly he was able to see the leaves on the trees 
and other landscape details for the first time. Until that moment of 
revelation, he hadn't known that other children had been seeing so 
many things that he did not see. 
<p>
The predicament of illiterates is similar. Never having been able to 
communicate with the printed word, they have no comprehension of the 
vast world from which they are excluded. 
<p>
Even more prevalent is the pervasive problem of shame. People with 
limited literacy skills try to hide their inability to read. The large 
majority of illiterates describe themselves as reading and writing 
"well" or "very well." 
<p>
The health literacy study shows that, among patients with low literacy 
skills, 67.2 percent have never told their spouse, 53.4 percent have 
never told their own children, and 19 percent have never told anyone 
at all. 
<p>
I can confirm this from my own experience. In counseling adults, I 
frequently hear such confessions as "I can't read big words" and "I 
just discovered that my husband can't read." 
<p>
The health literacy study admits that patients' noncompliance with 
their medical instructions has been generally assumed by physicians 
and hospitals to be caused by poor motivation or different personal 
values. The study calls for a reevaluation of patients who have been 
labelled "uncooperative"; it is more likely that doctors and hospital 
personnel, to whom reading is as natural as breathing, never imagined 
that the patients just couldn't read their instructions. 
<p>
The JAMA article recognizes that illiteracy is not a disease and its 
solution cannot be medicalized. Since doctors and hospitals can't 
provide the solution, and the schools have obviously failed in the 
task, parents will have to take on the responsibility of teaching 
their children how to read.

<h2>
AMERICA LATINA: MAS MITOS QUE METAS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Luis Aguilar Len*
</a>

<P>
MIAMI (AIPE).-  Proclamar que la Amrica Latina est en crisis implica un
cierto simplismo. La Amrica Latina vive en crisis. Desde la batalla de
Ayacucho hasta nuestros das, la historia de la Amrica Latina es la
historia de una crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En ocasiones la crisis estalla en revoluciones y golpes de estado;
usualmente se desarrolla con reprimida violencia, ltimamente, cuando la
democracia ha asomado su vendada cabeza en el continente, flotan los ecos de
enormes deudas externas, guerrillas con mscaras de narcotrfico (o
viceversa), roces fronterizos y, sobre todo, una corrupcin oficial que,
como una ola de mugre, se abate sobre el continente derribando presidentes,
ministros, partidos y debilitando al propio sistema democrtico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cabe preguntarse: Hacia dnde va la Amrica Latina?  Dnde estn los
planes de futuro?, cules son las metas reales?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las respuestas podran comenzar sealando que la Amrica Latina vive tan
intensamente algunos mitos que apenas si se preocupa por sealarse metas.
Hace ms de 150 aos, por ejemplo, nos proclamamos jvenes y, hasta hace muy
poco, excusbamos todo tropiezo como natural error de la inexperiencia. Nada
aprendimos de aquella irona de Oscar Wilde: "La juventud de Amrica es una
de sus ms viejas tradiciones".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Despus surgi el mito de nuestra latinidad, una frmula defensiva de una
elite criolla en busca de una identidad rasgada por aquel comentario de
Bolvar: "Si no somos ni indios, ni negros, ni europeos, qu somos?". Las
minoras cultas dieron con una respuesta luminosa: somos latinos. Y as de
golpe, a pura voluntad, nos adscribimos a un terico mundo latino, a la
vieja Roma y, sobre todo, a nuestra amada Francia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El amor de los latinoamericanos por Francia es uno de los fenmenos ms
curiosos de la historia. Francia nunca se ocup mucho de la Amrica Latina,
excepto para enviar tropas a Hait, a Mxico y la marina de guerra a la
Argentina. Pero todo se le perdonaba a la madre Francia, tierra de poetas
egregios, "maestra de la vida risuea", cuyo Pars los latinoamericanos
sentan como suyo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En las casas de las elites cultas no podan faltar grabados y libros
franceses. Los latinos aprendan La Marsellesa antes de aprender los himnos
nacionales. El genio de Vctor Hugo produca vrtigos. Tan apasionada
admiracin no hubiera sido daina, que Francia mucho nos poda ensear, si
no hubiera desembocado en una ms deletrea exageracin: el culpar a los
yankees por todos los males del continente.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1898, sacudidas por la derrota de Espaa y por la evidencia del
podero norteamericano, las minoras latinoamericanas exacerbaron ese otro
rostro del mito. Casi sin quererlo, el uruguayo Jos Enrique Rod esboz la
frmula. Los gringos son ricos, poderosos, industriales y trabajadores, pero
son como Calibn, les falta alma, no tienen verdadera cultura, no son
espirituales. En cambio los latinos son como Ariel, los anima el espritu,
son los hijos y descendientes del imperio romano y de la inmortal Atenas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como siempre, el mito estrangul la meta. Saltando sobre la realidad
histrica, olvidndonos de que, como descubri ms tarde Benito Mussolini,
los italianos de hoy no son descendientes de los romanos de Csar, los
latinoamericanos nos dedicamos a solazarnos en nuestra espiritualidad y a
maldecir al pujante yankee, el Mr. Danger de Rmulo Gallegos, que nos
despreciaba. En vez de aprender por qu el Norte era poderoso para, como
aconsejaba Sarmiento, encontrar el camino del xito, se nos ense que era
peligroso volvernos "materialistas", embijarnos con la industrializacin,
estudiar y adoptar urgentsimas reformas. Ariel, con su alada visin del
mundo, no tena que preocuparse de tales bajos menesteres, le bastaba
alimentarse de sueos y retrica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante tal desmesuramiento del mito de nuestra latinidad, se explica el
sarcasmo del peruano Manuel Gonzlez Prada:
<blockquote>"Aqu yace Carlos Oblongo,
de pura estirpe latina...
la madre lleg del Congo,
y el padre vino de China..."</blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las dos guerras mundiales, y la tajante realidad de un mundo dividido en
pueblos desarrollados y subdesarrollados, ayudaron a disipar algo el sueo
de la espiritualidad latina. Pero para entonces el mito haba contribuido al
dao colectivo. Nos habamos quedado a la zafa de la industrializacin. Y
dentro de nuestro hipottico mundo latino, masas empobrecidas reclamaban su
derecho al progreso.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a tal ineludible realidad, las minoras latinas revitalizaron tres
viejos mitos: la hermandad latinoamericana, el indigenismo, y la obligacin
del Estado de ser padre y protector de todos los ciudadanos. Los pases de
poblacin india cantaron al mestizaje, lo cual era bien justo, y proclamaron
la superioridad de las culturas precolombinas sobre la espaola, lo cual es
bien discutible. Y todos los gobiernos, dictaduras o democracias,
continuaron el paternalismo estatal, padre de parlisis y de corrupcin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ah est, entre muchos problemas, la corrupcin poltica que debilita y
mina todo esfuerzo. Y por qu no buscamos mtodos para embridarla? Con
cul mito vamos a encubrir nuestra responsabilidad colectiva?

<title>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA -- 11/14/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA
</h2>
Luis Aguilar L.*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Me comentaban no hace mucho unos viajeros argentinos que el
presidente Menem est haciendo un vigoroso esfuerzo por podar las ramas de
la frondosa burocracia argentina. "Usted sabe", me decan "que hasta hace
poco conseguir un telfono en Buenos Aires era tan problemtico como viajar
a la luna". Claro que lo saba. En el Buenos Aires de antao la tardanza era
a veces tan dilatada que, cuando llegaba el telfono, era depositado
respetuosamente en la tumba del fallecido aplicante.
<p>
Las palabras no mitigaban mi escepticismo. La burocracia es como un ave
fnix que brota ms vigorosa de sus propias cenizas. Ahora, por ejemplo, ha
llegado la burocracia telefnica. Esa metlica voz invisible que, si uno
llama al hospital, le dice "si usted est grave apriete el dos, si ya se ha
muerto apriete el tres, que es la funeraria".
<p>
Es bueno recordar que la palabra "burocracia" tiene la misma raz latina
que "burla" y que "bur". Un burcrata es, por tanto, un seor que desde su
"bur" se burla de la gente que espera por su atencin. La especie, mucho
ms visible en los pases del Tercer Mundo, se extiende por todo el globo.
<p>
En el mundo socialista la burocracia asfixia. Siempre he mantenido que a la
Unin Sovitica la hundi una burocracia cada vez ms fuerte y un vodka cada
vez ms dbil. Por su parte, a Fidel Castro le humean las barbas cuando
habla de la burocracia cubana. "Aqu no se puede hacer nada sin firmar diez
mil papeles", grit una vez el lder iracundo. "Y cada vez que nombro una
comisin para erradicar el problema, la comisin crece, se expande y se suma
al monstruo burocrtico".
<p>
Conozco el caso de un brasileo que se cas en Sao Paulo con una
portuguesa. En esa poca la ley exiga que todos los documentos expedidos en
el extranjero tenan que ser traducidos por una institucin oficial.
Portugal no haba sido excluido. Como consecuencia, mi amigo tuvo que llevar
al Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores todos los documentos de su futura
esposa para que fueran "oficialmente" traducidos del portugus al portugus.
<p>
En Espaa, el genial Wenceslao Fernndez Flores ilustraba la situacin con
un cuento travieso. Un da, un cientfico espaol descubri un mtodo
revolucionario de enlatar sardinas. Sabiendo que la exportacin de sardinas
era vital para Espaa, el inventor corri al Ministerio de Industria. Fue
recibido con la usual impasibilidad. Se le dijo que la aprobacin del
Ministerio de Economa era indispensable. All vol el anheloso inventor. Le
pidieron pruebas de la patente; lo enviaron a otros departamentos; le
exigieron sellos, firmas, declaraciones de planos y documentos de confirmacin.
<p>
Exasperado ante tales murallas de papel, con menos libras y ms canas, el
inventor retorn al Ministerio de Industria. "Pero es que ustedes no se dan
cuenta de que tengo en mis manos la prosperidad de Espaa?", se quej; "Es
que no se dan cuenta de que mientras aqu perdemos tiempo entre registros y
pruebas, algn extranjero puede descubrir la frmula y regalarle a su pas
la prosperidad que yo le ofrezco a Espaa?".
<p>
El empleado de turno no se inmut. "Clmese amigo. No lo tome a pecho. Aqu
todo requiere tiempo. Ve usted aquel viejito sentado en ese banco?". El
inventor le tir una ojeada a un venerable anciano de luengas barbas blancas
que fumaba plcidamente. "Pues bien", prosigui el empleado, "ese seor
descubri hace setenta aos cmo construir aviones de propulsin a chorro.
Era entonces un joven fogoso como usted y luch hasta el final. Hace diez
aos, el ministerio le otorg permiso de fabricacin. Claro que ya ni la
patente tiene sentido ni l se acuerda del invento, pero, despus de tantos
aos, sigue viniendo a visitarnos a fumar y a conversar. Este ministerio es
su casa".
<p>
Podra multiplicar ejemplos, hay algunos de una cierta delirante
originalidad. Como pasar por Guatemala cuando se inaugur el Ministerios de
Asuntos Especficos. Lo cual me dej pensando: qu tipo de asuntos se
tratan en otros ministerios, asuntos metafsicos? Pero prefiero terminar con
la aventura de un empresario en Francia.
<p>
Una vez, en Pars, un hombre de negocios norteamericano lleg jadeante y
presuroso a un ministerio de algo. Eran apenas las cuatro de la tarde y el
ministerio estaba desierto. "Qu es esto?", le pregunt atnito a un viejo
empleado que trapeaba lnguidamente los pisos. "Es que aqu no se trabaja
por las tardes?". Interrumpiendo su labor, y con una irona volteriana, el
francs le explic la situacin: "Aqu mon ami, los empleados no vienen por
la tarde y no trabajan por la maana... tu comprend?". Y prosigui su
metdica limpieza del piso.

<h2>
CAUSA COMUN DE LIBERALES Y CATOLICOS
</h2>

Manuel Ayau*

<P>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA  <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Las antiguas diferencias existentes entre la
Iglesia Catlica y los liberales en Amrica Latina siguen teniendo
resultados desastrosos. Hay alguna esperanza de reconciliacin? Pienso que s.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando a los 13 aos ingres a un colegio catlico interno en California,
me impresion la notable diferencia de los catlicos en Norteamrica. Quizs
el hecho que en el Nuevo Mundo hispnico el catolicismo gozaba de una
posicin predominante con respecto a otras religiones explicaba esa posicin
altanera y arrogante que no era el caso en Estados Unidos, donde al tratarse
de una minora era ms abierta y tolerante. Esa mayor tolerancia de los
catlicos anglosajones abarcaba tambin una filosofa econmica y poltica
ms liberal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, la Iglesia Catlica en Amrica Latina hered de Espaa un
prejuicio antiliberal y su antagonismo hacia el sistema capitalista, aunque
hay que aclarar que no hubo tal antagonismo contra los capitalistas mientras
estos formaban parte del sistema mercantilista, en el que la misma Iglesia
Catlica jugaba un papel protagnico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El mundo anglosajn tom el camino capitalista, alejndose del
mercantilismo criticado en lo moral y en lo econmico por Adam Smith,
provocando mejoras sin precedentes en las condiciones de la humanidad. Los
catlicos anglosajones se beneficiaron del liberalismo econmico y de la
Revolucin Industrial, mientras que en Estados Unidos el federalismo -que
significa la descentralizacin del poder y el libre comercio entre los
estados- represent la creacin del ms grande y duradero mercado comn de
la historia moderna. Es difcil ser anticapitalista con una experiencia tan
exitosa, aunque algunos sigan tratando. En el mundo anglosajn el trmino
liberal se asociaba con virtud y compasin, por lo que el apelativo fue
raptado por los defensores del colectivismo, del paternalismo y de la
sociedad irresponsable. Por el contrario, en el mundo hispano la palabra
liberal sonaba impa, anticlerical y mezquina.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A pesar de los esfuerzos del Papa Juan Pablo II, la alta jerarqua de la
Iglesia en Amrica Latina no ha hecho un esfuerzo sincero en comprender la
esencia de la controversia ni en dejar atrs las actitudes del pasado. Sus
acciones indican no estar interesados en un anlisis intelectual riguroso y
honesto, por lo que sigue prevaleciendo su condena generalizada contra todo
lo que suena a liberal o neoliberal. Hay excepciones, pero estas son ms
raras a medida que se sube en la jerarqua de la Iglesia, lo cual tiende a
alejar de ella a los catlicos liberales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como la mayora de la poblacin latinoamericana sigue hundida en la
pobreza, los sacerdotes deberan estudiar economa, comenzando con la
Escuela de Salamanca, para que sepan diferenciar entre el mercantilismo y el
capitalismo que ellos llaman, con desprecio, "neoliberalismo".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tan feliz como soy con la prosperidad creada por las privatizaciones y por
economas ms abiertas, me decepciona que la actual transicin hacia el
capitalismo es ms bien pragmtica, desposeda de principios ticos. La
palabra clave suele ser "eficiencia". Privatizar y desmonopolizar para
obtener mejor gerencia e ingresos fiscales, no como un acto de respeto hacia
los derechos de la gente de adquirir y vender su propiedad y de ejercer la
libertad de servir a los dems con su trabajo e ingenio. Abrir las fronteras
para hacer la economa ms eficiente, no en reconocimiento del derecho de
los ciudadanos a intercambiar lo que es suyo, sin tener que ver con dnde
viven los compradores o vendedores. Evitar la inflacin porque es
econmicamente ineficiente y no porque se trata de una prctica deshonesta
de los gobernantes. Llego a pensar que si el socialismo hubiera resultado
econmicamente eficiente todava seguira siendo respetable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo que todava muchos ignoran es que el mercado, como bien lo dijo Hayek,
se fundamenta en un sistema de reglas generales de justa conducta para
proteger los derechos individuales y el cumplimiento de contratos. Esa
generalizada desconfianza en el mercado se manifiesta en los intentos de
"regularlo", como si ya no estuviese regulado por reglas abstractas que
protegen la vida, la libertad y la propiedad. La bsqueda de un objetivo
comn es el camino a la reconciliacin entre catlicos liberales y
antiliberales. Todos aspiramos a una sociedad ms virtuosa, caritativa y
responsable, a una sociedad moral y antimercantilista.&copy; <p>

DESTELLO DE LIBERTAD

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- La noche del 11 de abril, Lady Thatcher fue la oradora
durante la celebracin del 50 aniversario de la Fundacin para la Educacin
Econmica (FEE) en el Waldorf-Astoria. Prcticamente todos los defensore del
libre mercado, los derechos de propiedad y la libertad individual alrededor
del mundo han sido influenciados por la labor pionera de Leonard Read
(1898-1983) y por FEE, la institucin por l fundada en 1946 para promover
la libertad, incrementar la comprensin pblica de la economa de mercado y
reconocer lo perverso y nocivo de la intervencin gubernamental.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Read naci en una granja en Michigan y deca que su entrenamiento
econmico comenz a los ocho aos: "Mi padre me puso a ordear vacas desde
temprana edad y as aprend la relacin entre el trabajo y un litro de
leche. Todo lo dems en economa son aditamentos a esa leccin bsica".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando Read era director ejecutivo de la Cmara de Comercio ms grande de
Estados Unidos, en Los Angeles, invit al profesor Ludwig von Mises a dar
una serie de conferencias en 1944. Mises pensaba que lo que "realmente
importa es el resultado de la lucha intelectual entre los partidarios del
socialismo y los del capitalismo". En 1946, Mises ingres a FEE, dictando
conferencias anuales a maestros, periodistas y estudiantes en la sede de
Irvington-on-Hudson.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La libertad siempre es una vctima de la guerra. Entonces la
"reconstruccin" estaba siendo planificada por los nuevos burcratas
internacionales. Las virtudes del Estado Bienestar, del Plan Marshall, de
los controles de precios y salarios se debatan apasionadamente. Mi primer
viaje a Estados Unidos fue en 1945; adems del Empire State, lo que ms me
impresion fue que mi madre no poda comprar zapatos sin un cupn del
gobierno y que a pap le servan su caf con una diminuta bolsita de azcar.
Yo era demasiado joven para darme cuenta que el racionamiento y la escasez
son los resultados inevitables del control gubernamental sobre la economa
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El ao anterior, Friedrich von Hayek haba publicado "Camino de
servidumbre", mostrando que la barbarie es la consecuencia no intencional
del fascismo, del comunismo y de la social democracia. Esa obra marc el
renacimiento del liberalismo clsico y tuvo gran influencia en Estados Unidos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard Read fue uno del selecto grupo de intelectuales invitados por Hayek
a reunirse en la aldea suiza de Mont Pelerin, en abril de 1947, donde se
fund una sociedad para unir los entonces desperdigados esfuerzos por la
libertad. Seis miembros de FEE asistieron a esa conferencia y se
convertiran en frecuentes colaboradores de la revista The Freeman. Adems
de Hayek, Mises y Read, otros distinguidos economistas, politlogos y
periodistas estuvieron en Mont Pelerin: Karl Popper, Milton Friedman, Lionel
Robbins, George Stigler, Fritz Machlup, Henry Hazzlitt, F.A. Harper,
Bertrand de Jouvenel, W. Rpke, Frank Knight, Walter Eucken, Aaron Director,
John Davenport, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Read, FEE y su revista tuvieron una extraordinaria influencia en el
surgimiento de instituciones liberales por todo nuestro hemisferio,
especialmente en la Argentina, Mxico y Guatemala. Alberto Benegas Lynch,
presidente de la Cmara de Comercio de Buenos Aires, conoci a Read, Mises y
Hayek durante un viaje a Nueva York en 1950. Benegas, quien a los 86 aos
sigue siendo un incansable luchador por la libertad, fund en 1957 el Centro
de Estudios sobre la Libertad y una revista similar a la de FEE. Su hijo
Alberto recibi en 1968 una beca de FEE para completar su tesis de doctorado
en Estados Unidos y hoy es director de la Escuela Superior de Economa y
Administracin en Buenos Aires.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alejandro Chafun es otro de varios argentinos becados por FEE. Se cas y
se qued a vivir en Estados Unidos, conociendo a Sir Antony Fisher, fundador
del Institute of Economic Affairs en Londres, la institucin que hizo
posible la revolucin thatcheriana en Inglaterra. Sir Antony haba visitado
FEE en 1952, quedando impresionado por la forma de popularizar la economa
de mercado, a travs de programas educacionales. Despus de fundar lo que
hoy es el Manhattan Institute, Sir Antony estableci el Atlas Economic
Research Foundation para apoyar la labor de instituciones liberales por todo
el mundo. Chafun es hoy presidente de Atlas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FEE tambin sirvi de modelo a los pioneros liberales en Mxico: Luis
Montes de Oca, Gustavo Velasco y Agustn Navarro, fundadores del Instituto
de Investigaciones Sociales y Econmicas, financiado principalmente por Hugo
Salinas Rocha. Montes de Oca haba sido Secretario de Hacienda y presidente
del Banco Central. Velasco, profesor de leyes, era presidente de la
Asociacin Bancaria, mientras que Navarro era el ms distinguido periodista
independiente, cuando el PRI ejerca su frreo control sobre la prensa y el
suministro de papel. Ellos invitaron a Mises a Mxico en 1942, 1946, 1949 y
1958. Hoy, Agustn Navarro hijo escribe una columna semanal para AIPE y es
presidente del Centro Mises. El nieto de Salinas, Roberto Salinas Len, es
director ejecutivo del Centro de Estudios sobre la Libre Empresa y en enero
de este ao organiz la primera reunin de la Sociedad Mont Pelerin
realizada en Mxico.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La directiva de FEE y Lady Thatcher entregaron durante la ceremonia del 50
aniversario una medalla a Manuel Ayau, de Guatemala, fundador en 1972 de la
Universidad Francisco Marroqun. Sus 12.000 estudiantes, no importa la
carrera, deben completar una instruccin bsica en economa para graduarse.
Segn Ayau, "el xito debe depender de lo bien que se complazca a los
consumidores en el mercado y no de complacer al gobierno la labor de los
amantes de la libertad est en la lucha contra el privilegio".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Durante medio siglo FEE ha cambiado nuestras vidas promoviendo la libertad
en nuestro hemisferio y ms all.

<h2>
EL SUICIDIO DE UN ALMIRANTE
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*
<P>
MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Algo anda muy mal, cuando se pega un tiro el comandante en
jefe de operaciones navales de Estados Unidos, responsable por un milln de
uniformados. Los debiluchos de carcter e inseguros de s mismo no alcanzan
esas posiciones y el historial del almirante Jeremy (Mike) Boorda indica
todo lo contrario. Se trataba de un hombre excepcional, el primero en la
armada de este pas que comenz como simple recluta para alcanzar la ms
alta posicin de las fuerzas navales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La noticia del jueves 16 de mayo fue que el almirante de 57 aos se haba
suicidado en su casa, dejando una corta nota dirigida "a los marineros",
cuyo texto no ha sido todava revelado. La razn dada fue el acoso
periodstico por parte de la revista Newsweek que cuestionaba la utilizacin
de dos diminutas letras "v" (por valor en combate) en un par de
condecoraciones de Vietnam, cuando Boorda tena el rango de teniente. En
efecto, esa tarde estaba pactada la entrevista -nunca efectuada- con un
reportero de la revista en su despacho, pero se debe aclarar que su
comandante en Vietnam, el almirante Elmo Zumwalt, afirm que Mike Boorda s
tena derecho a lucir esas condecoraciones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata del ms dramtico acontecimiento en una escalada de ataques contra
la naval que comenz con la ya famosa convencin Tailhook de aviadores de la
armada en 1991, donde luego de seminarios y conferencias sobre temas navales
un grupo de oficiales de ambos sexos terminaron en borracheras y orgas. El
escndalo fue magnificado por las fuerzas feministas que consideran la
cultura de "hombres machos" que predomina en la naval como algo con lo cual
hay que terminar, de manera que las mujeres puedan gozar de algn tipo de
"accin afirmativa" dentro de la armada que les asegure compartir las ms
altas posiciones en responsabilidad y en combate. Las feministas
consiguieron todo el apoyo de las altas esferas polticas en Washington, lo
cual convirti un incidente lamentable en la mayor derrota sufrida por la
marina de Estados Unidos desde la Segunda Guerra, costndole la carrera a
docenas de distinguidos oficiales a quienes ni siquiera se les comprob
haber tomado parte en la fiesta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una de las vctimas de Tailhook fue el antecesor del almirante Boorda, a
quin se oblig a adelantar su jubilacin. Se trat de una cacera de
brujas, donde los condenados no tuvieron la oportunidad de defenderse y la
hoja de servicio de valientes oficiales que dieron los mejores aos de su
vida a la defensa de la patria fue emborronada y destruida por las fuerzas
predominantes de la "poltica correcta", para quienes ser homosexual es "un
estilo de vida", pero silbarle a una mujer bonita es imperdonable.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dos de los hijos y una nuera del almirante Boorda son oficiales navales.
John Lehman, Secretario de la Naval en tiempos de Reagan, mantiene que Mike
Boorda fue "acorralado y linchado por una turba". Lo preocupante es que
muchos de aquellos sucios y melenudos pacifistas de los aos 60 hoy tienen
cargos claves en el gobierno del presidente Bill Clinton, quien en su
juventud presuma de "odiar" a los militares. Segn Lehman, los que hasta
hace unos das difamaban al almirante Boorda son los mismos que antes
alababan la economa sovitica, culpaban a Estados Unidos de la Guerra Fra
y despotricaban contra los esfuerzos del presidente Reagan en construir la
armada ms efectiva y poderosa de la historia de la humanidad, capaz de
mantener la paz.&copy;<p>

BENEFICENCIA CORPORATIVA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En Amrica Latina no nos sorprende encontrar a empresarios
que defienden fervientemente la economa de mercado, siempre y cuando no se
aplique a sus negocios; pero s  exigen todas las ventajas y todos los
privilegios que tradicionalmente han recibido de sus contactos polticos.
Pues resulta que en la gran democracia del norte la forma es algo ms
circunspecta, pero el fondo es muy parecido.
<dd>	El gobierno de Estados Unidos gasta $75.000 millones en subsidiar a
empresas privadas a travs de 125 programas federales diferentes. El gran
debate poltico sobre la necesidad de equilibrar el presupuesto se ha
concentrado en examinar programas sociales que han crecido a una velocidad
de varias veces el aumento poblacional y de la inflacin, pero poco se habla
de la beneficencia corporativa, cuando su eliminacin reducira a la mitad
el dficit fiscal.
<dd>	La beneficencia corporativa se puede definir como la concesin de favores y
beneficios, por parte del gobierno, a empresas especficas y, al igual de lo
que sucede en Amrica Latina, los beneficiarios no suelen ser firmas
diminutas que tratan de sobrevivir sino muchas de las ms grandes y
poderosas. La beneficencia corporativa tiene mltiples formas:
transferencias directas de fondos, prstamos blandos (a tasas subsidiadas de
inters y a largo plazo), seguro de inversiones y de exportaciones a pases
riesgosos, subsidios, barreras a importaciones para proteger ciertas
industrias que de otra forma no podran competir (aumentndole el costo de
esos productos y servicios a los estadounidenses), ventajas impositivas (con
reduccin de impuestos o aceleracin de la depreciacin permitida), etc.
<dd>	El ambiente de corrupcin generado por la beneficencia corporativa es parte
integral del mal. Ha sido comprobado que muchas de las empresas beneficiadas
por programas tales como el de Tecnologa Avanzada y el Programa de
Reinversin Tecnolgica fueron tambin las que aportaron las ms grandes
contribuciones a la campaa electoral del presidente Clinton. Otras
empresas, como Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) aporta millones de dlares en
contribuciones a candidatos de ambos partidos polticos y tales
contribuciones han coincidido con subsidios a ADM por valor de cientos de
millones de dlares en los ltimos 25 aos. Hay algo indudablemente podrido
cuando los impuestos pagados por ciudadanos comunes se canalizan para
aumentar las ganancias empresariales.
<dd>	De esta manera el gobierno premia no a las empresas que mejor sirven al
consumidor sino a las que son ms hbiles en el campo poltico. Una relacin
descriptiva de la beneficencia corporativa estadounidense no cabra en la
edicin de hoy de este peridico. Entre las joyas: El programa azucarero
concede ms de un milln de dlares al ao a cada una de las 33 plantaciones
ms grandes de azcar, a la vez que duplica el costo interno del azcar. El
Programa de Promocin de Mercado del Departamento de Agricultura  ha pagado
ms de $50 millones en publicidad en el extranjero de los vinos de
California. El Programa de Tecnologa Avanzada le da casi $500 millones
anuales a empresas como Xerox, Caterpillar y General Electric como subsidio
a sus investigaciones y desarrollo de nuevos productos. La agencia de
Inversiones Privadas en Ultramar gasta $58 millones al ao asegurando las
exportaciones e inversiones en el exterior de empresas como Coca Cola y
General Electric.
<dd>	El centro neurlgico de la beneficencia corporativa en este pas es el
Departamento de Comercio, un ministerio que muchos jvenes congresistas
quieren eliminar. Tambin importante es el Departamento de Agricultura,
ministerio cuyo personal ha crecido geomtricamente a medida de que se
reduce el nmero de agricultores en el pas. El problema es que cuando esos
mismos jvenes congresistas aspiren a ser reelegidos, los ms dispuestos a
aportar fondos a sus campaas sern las mismas empresas y grupos de presin
que reciben el grueso de los beneficios magnnimamente concedidos por el
gobierno. Nada nuevo bajo el Sol. &copy

<h2>POLITIZACION Y CORRUPCION DE LA JUSTICIA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- De todas las plagas que han acosado a Amrica Latina en los
ltimos aos, la ms funesta ha sido la creciente politizacin de nuestros
sistemas judiciales, lo cual a su vez ha fomentado la corrupcin. Si la ley
no es respetable, no se acata y surge el caos.
<dd>	Es un fenmeno regional que a medida que nuestros pases se fueron
democratizando, mientras los dictadores y caudillos iban siendo desplazados
por gobiernos democrticamente electos, el nombramiento de jueces comenz a
hacerse en funcin de afiliaciones y tendencias partidistas, lo cual al
transcurrir de los aos se ha degenerado en el desprestigio de la
institucin y su exposicin a la manipulacin poltica o a la descarada
venta de fallos y sentencias al mejor postor.
<dd>	Otra influencia extraordinariamente negativa es que las ms poderosas
multinacionales que operan hoy en Amrica Latina no son ya las viejas United
Fruit y Standard Oil Company sino los carteles del narcotrfico. Y gracias a
la poltica de Washington de declarar la guerra a la fabricacin y al
transporte ms que al consumo de las drogas, el campo de batalla fue
trasladado a nuestros pases, donde el sueldo mensual de un polica o de un
juez equivale a lo que gana diariamente un vendedor al detal de drogas en
las calles de Nueva York o Los Angeles.
<dd>	Sin seguridad jurdica no puede florecer la inversin ni la creacin de
empleos. La apertura econmica en pases como Mxico, Venezuela y hasta
cierto punto Argentina, donde las privatizaciones beneficiaron
principalmente a aquellos cercanos al poder, no genera la prosperidad
general y altos niveles de empleo que rpidamente se traducen en apoyo
electoral a las reformas econmicas. Por el contrario, surgen violentas
oleadas contra el mal llamado neoliberalismo que en su versin
latinoamericana tiende slo a beneficiar a elites polticas y empresariales,
al terminar pagando el pueblo ms por los bienes y servicios de las viejas
empresas estatales ahora convertidas en monopolios privados, mientras el
producto de las privatizaciones se aplica a mantener burocracias excesivas,
a campaas electorales y a cuentas particulares de los gobernantes y sus
familiares en el extranjero.
<dd>	En Venezuela se desat una cnica persecucin poltica contra los banqueros
"prfugos" de la justicia. Entre ellos hay unos cuantos gngsters bien
conocidos, pero tambin entre esos 400 que les han dictado autos de
detencin hay muchos que no eran responsables, cometieron pecados veniales o
equivocaciones, pero que obviamente no tienen ninguna fe en un proceso
judicial totalmente politizado. Todos fueron metidos en la misma canasta
ante la desesperacin del gobierno de Caldera de encontrar culpables de la
debacle venezolana y en su campaa por desprestigiar al "capitalismo" y la
reforma econmica iniciada por Carlos Andrs Prez.
<dd>	Por otra parte, me contaba recientemente un alto ejecutivo de una
multinacional en Buenos Aires, quien antes ocup una posicin similar en
Caracas, que la corrupcin del sector privado en la Argentina est mucho ms
generalizada que en Venezuela porque para cerrar ventas importantes a otras
empresas hay que pagarles comisiones a los gerentes de compras. Es decir, el
sector privado all ya fue contagiado por las prcticas del sector pblico.
<dd>	La trascendencia del Imperio de la Ley y de la seguridad jurdica la expuso
F. W. Maitland hace ms de un siglo al escribir: "El ejercicio del poder en
forma imprevisible origina alguna de las mayores limitaciones, pues la
limitacin, cuanto menos previsible, es mayor y ms temida. Nos sentimos
menos libres cuando sabemos que en cualquier momento y sobre cualquiera de
nuestras acciones puede recaer una limitacin, y, sin embargo, no podemos
prever tales limitaciones Las reglas conocidas, por muy malas que sean,
interfieren menos con la libertad que las decisiones basadas en reglas que
no son previamente conocidas". 
<dd>	Cuando las decisiones judiciales y la interpretacin de las leyes se hacen
en funcin de los intereses polticos del momento, la supuesta libertad
poltica se convierte en un gran engao y la gente comienza a echar de menos
los mejores tiempos que se vivan bajo algn autcrata, cuando al menos
estaba claro lo que se poda o no hacer y el crculo de privilegios era
mucho ms reducido. &copy

<TITLE>Ball: Por Fin Arranca Dole -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>POR FIN ARRANCA DOLE</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El 5 de agosto en Chicago, el candidato republicano Bob Dole
comenz su discurso anunciando su plan de crecimiento econmico de la
siguiente forma: "Es estupendo estar aqu. Estupendo poder dar este discurso
antes que Bill Clinton obtenga una copia y trate de darlo l". Clara manera
de decir que desde que comenz la campaa el presidente Clinton, con
habilidad de camalen, se ha apoderado de una tras otra bandera republicana.
<dd>	
La ms importantes de esas banderas hasta la fecha haba sido la reforma de
la beneficencia pblica, ante el fracaso de una billonaria poltica que
lejos de sacar de la pobreza a los ms desdichados ha institucionalizado la
dependencia, creando consecutivas generaciones de personas que no trabajan y
de nias solteras teniendo hijos. La decisin de traspasar el dinero y la
responsabilidad a los estados, a la vez de la imposicin de un lmite mximo
de por vida de cinco aos en la dependencia de la caridad pblica significa
la aceptacin de una doctrina antagnica a la filosofa de la izquierda
estadounidense, hasta ahora consentida por la administracin Clinton. Es
ms, al presidente anunciar que no vetara -como antes lo hizo- la reforma
de la beneficencia propuesta por los republicanos, ello motiv a muchos
congresistas demcratas a apoyarla tambin, conscientes de la proximidad de
elecciones legislativas en noviembre y de que el pas entero se ha movido a
la derecha.
<dd>	
En su discurso, Dole agarr y corri con la bandera que mejor define a los
republicanos: bajos impuestos como camino hacia un gobierno ms pequeo y
limitado. Continu diciendo: "este es un discurso que Bill Clinton jams
podr dar". Y resumi su programa as:<ul>
<li>Equilibrar el presupuesto.
<li>Reducirle el peso de los impuestos a la clase media.
<li>Proveer nuevas oportunidades educativas a los americanos.
<li>Reformar el sistema fracturado de litigios y demandas.
<li>Acabar con regulaciones federales innecesarias.
<li>Y restaurar la promesa del sueo americano.
</ul><dd>	
Dole dijo que los americanos son corredores olmpicos con un peso de 50
libras en las piernas y ya es tiempo de deshacernos de cadenas y grilletes,
haciendo referencia a las mltiples ataduras impuestas por el gobierno.
Segn Dole, la "clintoeconoma" ha aplastado la clase media con altos
impuestos y bajo crecimiento.
<dd>	
As como en Amrica Latina los polticos tratan de ganarse a los pobres,
que son mayora, en este pas el grueso del voto est en la clase media y
las estadsticas favorecen a Dole porque desde que Clinton ocupa la Casa
Blanca los ingresos del gobierno federal han aumentado en $322.000 millones
(29%) y la recaudacin de impuestos federales por cada persona aument a
$5.365 o 25% desde 1992. En ese mismo perodo el ingreso por trabajador
aument slo en 10%. Dole afirma que es "increble que la familia ahora
gasta ms en impuestos que en el total por alimentos, ropa y vivienda".
<dd>	
Las medidas concretas que propone incluyen una reduccin general de 15% (en
tres aos) en las tasas de impuesto personal. Un crdito fiscal de $500 por
cada nio menor de 18 aos. Reduccin de 50% del impuesto de ganancias de
capital (de 28% a 14%) para motivar la reinversin en las pequeas empresas
que aportan tres de cada cuatro nuevos empleos. Ampliacin de las cuentas
individuales de pensiones, libres de impuestos para que la gente ahorre ms.
Y, por ltimo, insistir que el Congreso imponga una super mayora de 60%
para cualquier futuro aumento de impuestos.
<dd>
Promete no descansar hasta que todo el sistema impositivo sea reemplazado
por uno ms simple, ms justo y ms plano. Dole dijo que hoy la  opresiva
oficina del impuesto es el doble de grande que la CIA y cinco veces ms
grande que el FBI. Cumplir con las leyes impositivas requiere el trabajo a
tiempo completo de casi tres millones de personas, ms que todos los
miembros de las fuerzas armadas. "Soy optimista, creo que los funcionarios
del impuesto pueden ser entrenados para que hagan cosas provechosas... y
comenzar pasando la carga de las pruebas a los fiscales para de nuevo
presumir la inocencia de los ciudadanos hasta que se compruebe lo contrario
acabar con las auditoras tipo KGB mi administracin liberar a los
americanos de la tirana de los impuestos el objetivo es crear un
crecimiento econmico de 3,5% o ms al ao y la historia muestra que los
recortes de impuestos estimulan el crecimiento y aumentan la recaudacin".
Dole termin su discurso citando a Winston Churchill, pero oigo ms bien un
eco de las  propuestas de Steve Forbes, a quien duramente combati en las
primarias.
<dd>
Es difcil confiar en los polticos y los de Estados Unidos no son muy
diferentes. Bush prometi no aumentar los impuestos y Clinton prometi
rebajarlos. Ninguno de los dos cumpli su palabra. Pero indudablemente que
Bob Dole por fin ha logrado obtener la atencin del electorado; la campaa
se vuelve interesante y ms importante an que el nombramiento del candidato
republicano a la vicepresidencia sera que se designara a Steve Forbes como
secretario del Tesoro. Pase lo que pase fue l quien coloc a los impuestos
en el tapete. <p>

<TITLE>Ball: Jack Kemp -- 9/04/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>JACK KEMP</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A mis aos pensaba que ya no me entusiasmara ningn poltico
y menos una campaa presidencial. Pero he tenido dos sorpresas en 1996.
Primero con Steve Forbes y ahora con la candidatura de Jack Kemp a la
vicepresidencia, la cual ha mejorado radicalmente las probabilidades de que
Bob Dole sea el prximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca.<p>
	Cuando oigo hablar a los polticos, siempre me pregunto en qu me estn
tratando de engaar? Kemp y media docena de otros, como John McCain y Dick
Armey, son las excepciones. Kemp habla con el corazn y mirando a los ojos.
Cuando en medio de la Convencin Republicana en San Diego abraz y bes a su
hijo -quien lo present-, pareca que estbamos viendo a un padre latino
besando a su hijo de mediana edad en pblico.<p>
	En enero de 1995, Kemp anunci que no buscara la nominacin presidencial
de su partido para las elecciones de 1996. Las nuevas reglas de
financiamiento electoral obligan a los candidatos a dedicarse de lleno a
conseguir decenas de miles de pequeos contribuyentes, algo que le
disgustaba y, adems, todava estaba pagando las deudas incurridas en su
anterior intento. Dos meses ms tarde, en marzo de 1995, fue nombrado por
Bob Dole y Newt Gingrich presidente de la Comisin Nacional sobre
Crecimiento Econmico y Reforma Impositiva para estudiar la mejor manera de
reestructurar el sistema de impuestos, del cual todo el mundo se queja y que
ha sido no slo la principal fuente de corrupcin poltica sino el mayor
freno a la prosperidad y al crecimiento.<p>
	Jack Kemp no es el nico poltico estadounidense consciente de la necesidad
de retomar el camino del crecimiento econmico para que "la marea" levante
el nivel de vida de todos los ciudadanos, como sucedi aqu en los aos 50,
60 y 80. Pero Kemp s es el nico de ese grupo que es percibido por la
generalidad de los votantes como alguien realmente preocupado por los
pobres, por los habitantes de los barrios, por los inmigrantes y las minoras.<p>
	Hay cierto aire artificial cuando algunos de los principales lderes del
Partido Republicano se acercan a las comunidades latinas de Los Angeles y
Chicago o a los barrios negros de Detroit y Miami. Eso no sucede con Kemp.
El no est all por ganar puntos; sinceramente est en activa bsqueda de la
mejor manera de resolver los problemas que confrontan los ms dbiles de la
sociedad. Como Secretario de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano, bajo Bush,
introdujo el concepto de las Zonas Emprendedoras para promover -con bajos
impuestos- la creacin de empresas y de empleos en los barrios pobres de las
grandes ciudades, a la vez que fomentaba el traspaso de la propiedad de
apartamentos de los proyectos residenciales del gobierno a manos de los
inquilinos, sabiendo que al convertirlos en propietarios de su vivienda
adquiran la dignidad y confianza conducentes a romper las cadenas de la
dependencia en la beneficencia pblica.<p>
	Sobre la inmigracin, Kemp dijo el 18 de febrero de este ao: "Tenemos que
comprender que estamos obteniendo algunos de los mejores y ms brillantes
cerebros de todo el mundo para que inviertan sus talentos en la economa
estadounidense. Nos estamos volviendo ms competitivos y ms prsperos y,
en el proceso, no estamos desplazando ni devaluando a trabajadores americanos".<p>
	Luego de una casi total concentracin del esfuerzo de los republicanos en
equilibrar el presupuesto federal, lo cual es importante pero no enciende el
entusiasmo de los electores, Kemp (y su discpulo Forbes) argumentaron que
el dficit es la consecuencia de un mal mayor. No podemos conformarnos con
los actuales niveles mediocres de crecimiento econmico, 2 a 2,5% anual,
cuando a raz de las rebajas de impuestos de Kennedy, el crecimiento entre
1960 y 1964 alcanz 4,7% anual, y luego de las rebajas impositivas de
Reagan, el crecimiento anual promedi 3,1% de 1981 a 1988. <p>
	Kemp aspira que el Plan Dole, al cual tanto l como Gary Becker
contribuyeron, conduzca a un crecimiento de 3,5%, lo cual doblara el tamao
de la economa de Estados Unidos para el ao 2008.<p>
	En sus propias palabras: "La inmensa burocracia gubernamental que
soportamos fue creada durante los ltimos 60 aos con buenas intenciones,
pero con una filosofa redistributiva que condujo a resultados
contraproducentes. Dando la cara a esa realidad, los republicanos cometemos
un grave error cuando tratamos de ahorrar primero en los programas sociales.
Eso permite que se nos acuse de poner la carreta de la austeridad fiscal
antes que el caballo de crecimiento econmico rpido".<p>
	Kemp, adems, tiene una visin mundial que ha brillado por su ausencia bajo
Clinton y Gore, quienes han tratado de pasar responsabilidades y liderazgo a
las Naciones Unidas, con consecuencias lamentables. Luego de la Primera
Guerra, Estados Unidos le dio la espalda al mundo y sus leyes
proteccionistas aunadas a polticas monetarias constrictivas convirtieron
una recesin en la Gran Depresin que no termin sino con la Segunda Guerra.
Luego de esta ltima predomin la apertura al mundo y la expansin econmica
que condujo al triunfo en la Guerra Fra. Cuatro aos ms de Clinton, con su
desidia hacia todo lo extranjero, podra repetir los dolorosos sucesos de
los aos 30 y terminar de enterrar la visin de Reagan y Bush sobre un
continente americano integrado econmicamente, bajo un floreciente
capitalismo democrtico.<p>
	Aquellos que menosprecian la posicin de la vicepresidencia no ven que ella
colocara a Jack Kemp en el lugar clave para aspirar a la presidencia en el
ao 2000, lo cual me convierte en optimista acerca del nuevo milenio. <p>

<TITLE>LA VIENA DE MISES Y HAYEK -- 10/09/96</TITLE>

<i>October 09, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LA VIENA DE MISES Y HAYEK</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
VIENA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  Mi anterior viaje a Viena fue en 1968, cuando los venezolanos
viajbamos con una moneda dura por todo el mundo. Entonces me hosped en el
Hotel Imperial, quiz el ms bello de todos los hoteles clsicos europeos,
donde uno abre los ojos por la maana admirando increbles frescos en el
techo de la habitacin y se tira de un cordn detrs de la cama para que a
los pocos segundos aparezca un mesonero de levita preguntando qu apetece
para el desayuno.
<P>
 Los rusos ocuparon a Austria hasta 1955, pero esta capital del viejo
imperio no ha logrado despertar de un largo letargo socialista que sigue
predominando junto al fro y hmedo otoo. Se trata de un socialismo menos
ineficiente que los del Caribe: el tranva que tomo cada maana para asistir
a las conferencias de la Sociedad Mont Plerin (fundada por Hayek hace 49
aos) funciona con limpieza y precisin alemana, y jams me han pedido el
boleto porque las autoridades asumen que lo compr. Me imagino que el pasaje
est altamente subsidiado porque con 20 chelines austracos -unos dos
dlares americanos- puedo hacer todos los viajes que quiera durante un da.
Por el contrario, tomarse un caf o comerse una deliciosa torta de chocolate
es una inversin que amerita cierta reflexin previa. Adems, cualquier cosa
que uno coma lleva un impuesto de 10% y lo que se bebe 20%.
<P> 
Los economistas que miden el nivel de vida de los pueblos le asignan los
primeros puestos al Japn, Suiza y Alemania sin tomar en cuenta los precios.
El japons de clase media vive en un apartamento poco ms grande que el
clset de un hogar americano y la ama de casa alemana tiene que comprar
alimentos todos los das porque su nevera es ms o menos del tamao del
televisor que ocupa un lugar de honor en el "family room" estadounidense.
 Mi impresin de Viena se repite: una gran capital sin mucho pas para
sostenerla; edificaciones ms fastuosas que las de Pars o Londres, pero
donde predomina una triste nostalgia por el irrepetible esplendor de fines
del siglo XIX, algo no padecido con la misma intensidad en otras capitales
de viejos imperios. Me qued en casa de un pariente noble de amigos
argentinos, el palacio del prncipe Kinsky, una impresionante mansin
barroca del siglo XVIII en el centro de la ciudad, lo cual por unos das me
ha permitido asomarme a esa esplendorosa poca que termin con el retumbar
de los caones, en agosto de 1914.
<P>
 Con Carl Menger naci en Viena, en 1871, la economa moderna o neoclsica.
Fue el fundador de la escuela austraca, seguido por su brillante discpulo
Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk en la ctedra de economa de la Universidad de Viena.
El rostro de Bhm-Bawerk ilustra hoy los billetes de cien chelines. Estos
economistas austracos centraron sus investigaciones en las motivaciones del
individuo y en la forma cmo este acta en reaccin a sus propias
motivaciones, preferencias y valoraciones. Esas preferencias del consumidor
a su vez impulsan y ordenan la actividad productora de bienes y servicios,
conduciendo a los inversionistas hacia la ptima utilizacin de los
recursos. Tambin concluyeron que gastos en mano de obra y materiales no
confieren valor a los productos y servicios, sino que su valor procede
exclusivamente de las apreciaciones del consumidor. 
<P>
Estos economistas vieneses se dieron cuenta que cuanto mayor es la cantidad
de un producto menor es el valor que se le atribuye a cada unidad. Por ello
el agua y el pan son baratos, mientras que el oro y los brillantes son caros. 
 Ludwig von Mises ingres al seminario de Bhm-Bawerk en el ao 1900 y luego
procedi a avanzar la teora econmica indicando que el "precio" del dinero
(su poder adquisitivo) es determinado por el mercado en la misma forma que
se determina el precio de cualquier otro bien, en funcin de la cantidad
disponible. La gente gasta rpidamente cualquier moneda que pierde su valor
y ahorra en otra moneda que lo mantiene.
<P> 
Una estupenda ancdota de Mises se refiere a la consulta que le hicieron
durante la violenta inflacin que sobrevino en Austria luego de la Primera
Guerra. Cuando le preguntaron cmo remediarla, Mises insisti que se
encontraran con l a la medianoche en una calle de Viena. A esa hora y
rodeado de altos funcionarios dijo: "oyen ese ruido?... es la imprenta del
Banco Central imprimiendo billetes... prenla".
<P> 
No conoc a Mises, pero s a su alumno Friedrich A. von Hayek y en esta
visita a Viena convers con su hijo Laurence y su nuera Esca. No voy a
tratar de describir la obra de Hayek en un prrafo pero si algo lo defini
fue su fiel creencia en el poder de las ideas, lo cual caracteriza al
liberalismo mismo. Hayek mantena que lo que est conscientemente presente
en la mente de un hombre es apenas una diminuta parte de las ideas en que
basa su manera de pensar, de lo cual surge lo que llam "el orden
espontneo" que es la consecuencia imprevista del accionar independiente de
millones de individuos. En sus propias palabras: "sera un error  creer que
para alcanzar un grado ms alto de civilizacin tenemos simplemente que
instrumentar las ideas que ahora nos guan. Si vamos a avanzar, tenemos que
dejar espacio a una continua revisin de nuestros actuales conceptos e
ideales".
<P> 
Los palacios, museos, monumentos y estatuas de Viena nos recuerdan las
batallas y glorias del pasado, pero son Mises y Hayek quienes representan la
victoria de las ideas liberales en nuestro siglo, triunfantes frente al
cruel socialismo estatista y la empobrecedora planificacin central. Para mi
son ellos el ms grandioso legado de Viena. &copy;

<title>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA -- 11/14/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Un taciturno economista escocs de 60 aos -James Mirrless-,
profesor de la Universidad de Cambridge y otro de 82 aos -William Vickrey-,
profesor emrito de la Universidad de Columbia, quienes nunca se conocieron,
fueron conjuntamente los ganadores este ao del Premio Nobel de economa.
Vickrey, el primer canadiense que lo gana, muri el viernes 11 de octubre de
un infarto, apenas tres das despus de haber sido anunciado su galardn.
<p>
El premio, que conlleva una bolsa de $1,120.000, fue concedido por la Real
Academia Sueca de las Ciencias por el trabajo pionero de ambos en el
desarrollo "de la teora econmica de incentivos bajo informacin
asimtrica". Esto, que suena muy complicado, tiene que ver con las
decisiones econmicas que se toman cuando las partes no tienen la misma
informacin. Por ejemplo, cuando alguien pide prestado al banco, esa persona
conoce mucho mejor su habilidad de pagar el crdito que el banquero que
decidir prestar o no. Tambin, quien compra una pliza de vida sabe ms de
su propia salud que la empresa de seguro.
<p>
Esta asimetra de informacin tiene como consecuencia que el que ms sabe
aprovecha para explotar estratgicamente su mayor conocimiento. La
investigacin sobre la economa de la informacin se ha concentrado en
generar una mayor comprensin de los mercados de seguros, de crditos, las
subastas, los sistemas de impuestos, las instituciones polticas, etc. 
<p>
Ambos economistas han hecho importantes contribuciones al estudio de los
impuestos, buscando que las recaudaciones distorsionen lo menos posible los
incentivos al trabajo y al ahorro. El profesor Mirrlees, quien fue asesor
del Partido Laborista ingls, favoreca la redistribucin de la riqueza, a
travs del sistema impositivo. En 1971, cuando la tasa tope del impuesto
ingls era 83%, con la ayuda de un complejo modelo matemtico se propuso
identificar una tasa impositiva ptima que maximizara la productividad y el
esfuerzo de la gente. Mirrless no slo encontr que la tasa impositiva
debera ser 20% sino que esa debera ser aplicada por igual a todo el mundo.
El primer sorprendido fue l mismo, declarando: "Debo confesar que esperaba
que un riguroso anlisis del impuesto sobre la renta en forma utilitaria me
dara argumentos en apoyo de altas tasas impositivas. Pero no ha sido as".
<p>
Vickrey, por su parte, mantena que los impuestos no deberan desincentivar
a la gente en  producir un dlar adicional de ganancia porque si dejan de
hacerlo el gobierno no recaudar ningn impuesto sobre ese dlar de riqueza
que nunca se lleg a producir.
<p>
En 1964, Vickrey escribi: "Sigue siendo un hecho que las ganancias
producidas por el trabajo estn sujetas al impuesto sobre la renta, mientras
que el beneficio personal obtenido por el disfrute del tiempo libre no es
pechado Por ello, el impuesto sobre la renta tiende a hacer que los
individuos prefieran descansar" Vickrey deca que sus ideas respecto al
impuesto no fueron aplicadas porque hubieran dejado desempleada a la
burocracia de la oficina del impuesto.
<p>
Vickrey, en los aos 1962 y 63, trabaj en la planificacin urbana y
sistemas de transporte de la India, Argentina y Venezuela, haciendo
importantes contribuciones al mejor uso de recursos escasos, para lo cual es
necesario fijar un precio, ya que lo que nada cuesta se malgasta. Muchos
servicios como las carreteras, el transporte colectivo y la electricidad
requieren inmensas inversiones iniciales y cobrar lo mismo en las horas pico
crea congestin. Respecto a carreteras y puentes sugiri que el peaje fuese
ms caro durante las horas pico, de manera de desestimular el uso de esas
vas por personas que no tienen la necesidad de utilizarlas a esas horas. A
medida que aumenta la competencia en el servicio elctrico, los usuarios se
benefician gastando electricidad en horas en que es ms barata y las
empresas elctricas se benefician con un consumo ms estable, lo cual
aumenta la eficiencia de sus plantas.
<p>
Los amigos de Mirrlees cuentan que su nica pasin fuera de la economa y
la matemtica son las novelas de detectives. Y Vickrey, quien ni siquiera
saba exactamente cunto ganaba como profesor en Columbia, donde ense
durante medio siglo, dijo que no necesitaba el dinero pero s la tribuna que
el Premio Nobel le dara. Lamentablemente, sufri un ataque al corazn
mientras manejaba de Nueva York a Boston.

NUNCA ANTES PAGAMOS MAS  EN IMPUESTOS

Bruce R. Bartlett*
<P>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Segn los ltimos datos del Departamento de Comercio, el
inexorable crecimiento de los impuestos bajo Bill Clinton ha alcanzado un
nuevo pinculo. Para el segundo trimestre de 1996, los impuestos federales
como porcentaje del PIB han alcanzado su nivel histrico ms alto. El
gobierno federal le sac del bolsillo a los estadounidenses $1.572.500
millones, mientras que el PIB fue de $7.547.600 millones. Eso coloca los
impuestos en 20,8% del PIB.
<P>
 Para asegurarme de que los impuestos federales nunca haban sido tan altos,
calcul las contribuciones como porcentaje del PIB desde que existe esa
informacin. Las cifras del PIB anual van hasta 1929 y la informacin
trimestral desde 1946 hasta hoy. En todo ese tiempo, slo durante cuatro
aos los ingresos del gobierno federal alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB, y durante
tres de esos cuatro aos estbamos en guerra.
<P>
 Los impuestos federales alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB en 1943, en medio de la
Segunda Guerra Mundial. Llegaron a 20,6% en el primer trimestre de 1951,
durante la guerra de Corea y a 20,7% en el segundo trimestre de 1969, cuando
el recargo tributario de la Guerra de Vietnam estaba vigente. La ocasin
anterior en que los impuestos estuvieron casi tan altos como actualmente
bajo Clinton fue durante la primera mitad del ao 1981, alcanzando 20,7% del
PIB, debido a que la inflacin de dos dgitos sufrida durante la
administracin del presidente Carter elev a la gente a tramos superiores
del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
 As vemos que en ningn perodo anterior el gobierno federal agarr tanto
en impuestos como hoy lo hace Bill Clinton.
<P>
 Tanto el Departamento del Tesoro como la Oficina Presupuestaria del
Congreso creen que las cifras del segundo semestre son una aberracin
resultante posiblemente de pagos por ganancias de capital ms altas de lo
esperado, por la subida de la Bolsa de Valores. Sin embargo, el actual nivel
de contribuciones es consistente con la creciente tendencia experimentada
desde que Clinton lleg a la Casa Blanca y nos encasquet el aumento
impositivo ms grande de la historia de Estados Unidos.
<P>
 Algunos grupos, como los izquierdistas del Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, argumentan que los impuestos que pagan los individuos no han
subido porque los ingresos adicionales provienen de impuestos corporativos y
de aumentos en las primas de Medicare (el seguro estatal para los ancianos).
Eso es una ingenuidad. Los impuestos corporativos los termina pagando la
gente a travs de salarios ms bajos, precios ms altos o dividendos
inferiores. Y mayores primas de Medicare reducen el ingreso disponible de la
misma forma como lo hacen impuestos ms altos. Por lo tanto, la proporcin
de los impuestos en el PIB sigue siendo la mejor medida de la carga fiscal. &copy;

LA LIBERTAD ECONOMICA ESTIMULA EL CRECIMIENTO

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Gary S. Becker*
</a>

<P>
CHICAGO (AIPE).- El colapso del comunismo y el xito  de los Tigres del
Asia estimularon un movimiento mundial hacia la privatizacin y la
desregulacin, ya que estos sucesos parecen indicar que la libertad
econmica es mucho ms efectiva que el control gubernamental en promover el
crecimiento. Los revisionistas han cuestionado tal conclusin, pero esta
recibi un resonante apoyo de parte de un importante estudio publicado por
tres economistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La obra Libertad Econmica en el Mundo utiliza 17 clasificaciones para
evaluar el grado de libertad en los ltimos 20 aos en ms de 100 pases.
Los autores estimaron la restriccin a transacciones internacionales en
bienes y flujos de capital, los controles de precios, la incidencia de
empresas estatales, la importancia de subsidios y transferencias
gubernamentales, los niveles de impuestos, la libertad de mantener fondos en
el extranjero y la inflacin. Estos factores fueron, a la vez, combinados en
ndices de libertad econmica que clasifican a las naciones y muestran los
cambios registrados desde 1975.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Estos ndices aportan la ms convincente evidencia de que las naciones no
crecen sin considerable libertad econmica. El producto bruto per cpita de
las 10 naciones con ms libertad econmica aument en promedio a razn de
2,3% por ao entre 1980 y 1984, comparado con un miserable crecimiento de
1,3% en los 27 pases menos libres. Mientras ms libertad, mayor tendencia a
un rpido crecimiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El ingreso real per cpita tiende tambin a ser mucho ms alto en los
pases con mayor libertad econmica. La media docena de pases ms libres
gozan de varias veces el ingreso per cpita de aquellos clasificados en el
medio y de ms de 20 veces que los menos libres. Se  muestra porqu muchos
de los pases africanos ocupan las ltimas 20 posiciones. Los apologistas
culpan a la dominacin colonial por el mal expediente de Africa, pero esa no
es la razn principal. Por el contrario, luego de la independencia muchas
naciones africanas imitaron el camino errado de los pases comunistas y
socialistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como muchas naciones mantuvieron una clasificacin de libertad estable en
los ltimos 20 aos, los resultados de aquellos que abrieron sus economas
son especialmente ilustrativos. La produccin de los 10 pases con el mayor
crecimiento de libertad econmica alcanz un crecimiento promedio de 2,7%
entre 1980 y 1994, mientras que las que ms restringieron la libertad
econmica sufrieron un crecimiento negativo. Chile, Portugal, Paquistn y
Mauritania, los cuatro pases en desarrollo con mayor aumento de libertad
econmica, crecieron mucho ms que los cuatro pases en desarrollo que
sufrieron aumentos en la intervencin gubernamental: Honduras, Irn,
Nicaragua y Venezuela.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Un creciente nmero de economistas niegan que el rpido crecimiento de las
economas asiticas comprueban la importancia de la libertad econmica,
indicando que sus gobiernos dirigen la actividad econmica. Indican que
Corea utiliz a los bancos estatales para aportar capital subsidiado a las
grandes empresas, que Taiwan controlaba las importaciones y los mercados
financieros, y que Singapur subsidiaba las inversiones extranjeras.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin embargo, estos nuevos ndices confirman que a pesar de tales
intervenciones, las economas en Asia han sido mucho ms libres que en otras
partes. Ocupan los primeros puestos en la clasificacin: Hong Kong es N 1,
Singapur N 3 y Japn N10. An Taiwan y Corea del Sur (nmeros 16 y 20)
gozan de libertad de comercio comparados con el resto del mundo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lamentablemente, los polticos pocas veces estn dispuestos a tomar
medidas impopulares en la reduccin de la intervencin gubernamental. A
pesar de las altas tasas de desempleo en Europa occidental, pases como
Francia y Alemania han hecho muy poco por desregular, aparentemente porque
temen la reaccin de los electores.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Este nuevo estudio aporta evidencias persuasivas de que la libertad
econmica es esencial para el crecimiento econmico. Ciertos pases sufren
innecesariamente porque no se permite el florecimiento de su energa e
imaginacin, en un ambiente de libertad.

<TITLE>Becker: Hay que Imponer Limites al Gasto Gubernamental -- 8/7/96
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<H2>HAY QUE IMPONER LIMITES AL GASTO GUBERNAMENTAL</H2>
Gary S. Becker*<p>
CHICAGO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- No es ningn secreto que el sistema impositivo de Estados
Unidos es complejo y acosado por altas tasas. El nivel actual de los
impuestos reduce el crecimiento  y la eficiencia econmica al desviar
recursos productivos hacia esfuerzos por evitarlos y evadirlos. Por lo tanto
un sistema ms simple y ms parejo hara una gran diferencia. Pero para ser
efectiva, una reforma de los impuestos tendra que estar acompaada de
medidas que desalienten el crecimiento del gasto gubernamental.
<dd>	
Cuando se calculan los resultados de una simplificacin de los impuestos y
de reducir las tasas, a menudo se asume que el gasto gubernamental es
independiente del sistema impositivo. Recientemente, cuando el Wall Street
Journal pregunt a 12 economistas lo que pensaban de la tasa nica de
impuestos, todos la apoyaron, pero apenas unos pocos mencionamos el efecto
que tendra en los gastos gubernamentales.
<dd>	
El proceso poltico de las democracias virtualmente garantiza que el gasto
gubernamental dependa de la estructura impositiva. La mayora de los grupos
de presin tienen deseos insaciables de favores gubernamentales. El nico
freno a sus pretensiones es la resistencia de los contribuyentes. Si se
debilita esa resistencia a travs de una reforma impositiva que reduce el
costo de cumplimiento y los efectos perniciosos contra el ahorro y el
esfuerzo personal, el gasto gubernamental tender a aumentar. Mayores gastos
gubernamentales causarn ms dao que el beneficio obtenido por la reforma
impositiva.
<dd>	
El argumento que la resistencia contra impuestos ms altos es mayor cuando
la carga es ms pesada y ms transparente se comprueba por el hecho de que
los dueos de propiedades han sido los lderes de rebeliones antiimpuestos
en varios estados. Los impuestos a la propiedad  son onerosos porque son
altos y visibles. Robert Hall y Alvin Rabushka del Hoover Institution han
demostrado que las familias podran hacer su declaracin de impuestos en una
postal si el sistema actual fuese reemplazado por una tasa nica de 20%,
eximiendo del pago a los de bajos ingresos. Pero no toman en cuenta si ese
sistema ms simple y eficiente sera a la vez una tentacin para que el
Congreso y el presidente aumenten la tasa, a travs del tiempo, para
financiar viejos programas e iniciar otros nuevos.
<dd>	
Mi colega de la Universidad de Chicago Casey Mulligan y yo estamos
compilando pruebas sobre que la estructura impositiva est ntimamente
ligada al gasto gubernamental. Los impuestos al valor agregado comenzaron
con tasas mdicas en los aos 60. Hoy el IVA en Europa excede 20%. El
resultado es que el IVA ha permitido una rpida expansin del gasto
gubernamental.
<dd>	
Los impuestos del Seguro Social tienen una tasa nica aplicable desde el
primer dlar de ingresos. Comenzaron siendo muy bajos en los aos 30, pero
fueron aumentando hasta hoy, cuando los aportes del patrn y del empleado
significan 15% de los sueldos. Tales impuestos han sobrepasado 25% en muchos
pases europeos. Impuestos de tasa nica del Seguro Social han sido una
manera cmo los gobiernos han recabado inmensas cantidades de dinero. En
Estados Unidos proveen casi la misma cantidad que el impuesto sobre la renta
individual.
<dd>	
La estrecha relacin entre la estructura impositiva y los gastos
gubernamentales indica que la simplificacin tiene que ser combinada con un
mayor control del gasto pblico. Un presupuesto equilibrado puede ser un
paso en la direccin correcta, siempre y cuando el equilibrio se alcance
bajando gastos y no subiendo impuestos.
<dd>	
Ultimamente el gasto gubernamental en Estados Unidos ha sido frenado por la
recaudacin. Tanto el presidente Clinton como los miembros de ambos partidos
en el Congreso hubieran propuesto aumentos considerables a los gastos en
salud y en otros programas si el electorado no los hubiera obligado a
preocuparse del dficit. El gasto pblico de muchas naciones europeas fuera
mayor si no tuviesen que mantener su dficit presupuestario por debajo de 3%
del PIB para ser admitidos en la unin monetaria planeada para fin del siglo.
<dd>	
Pero hay que encontrar otras maneras de limitar gastos, especialmente si se
introduce la tasa nica. Se podra establecer un tope del gasto federal en
funcin del PIB, con la excepcin en tiempo de guerra u otra emergencia
nacional. O fijar como lmite el actual nivel en funcin del PIB, a menos
que una supermayora en el Congreso, de 60% o ms, vote por una proporcin
mayor.
<dd>	
A menos que se combine con mejores controles del gasto gubernamental, los
grandes beneficios de una tasa nica o de sistemas simplificados se
desperdiciaran en expansiones manirrotas, subsidiando industrias, la
agricultura, la beneficencia pblica y dems programas polticamente
atractivos. <p>

<title>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA -- 11/14/96</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA
</h2>
Gary S. Becker*<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Desde 1989, Argentina rpidamente ha introducido
revolucionarias reformas para reducir el control y las regulaciones
gubernamentales. La privatizacin de su sistema de seguridad social ha sido
el paso ms importante en los ltimos dos aos. La experiencia argentina
muestra que, aun bajo circunstancias econmicas muy difciles, una nacin
puede convertir exitosamente su viejo sistema de reparto en un plan privado
de pensiones, con cuentas individuales.
<p>
El sistema de reparto cobra impuestos a los trabajadores para pagar las
pensiones de los retirados. El impuesto combinado a trabajadores y
empleadores en Argentina haba alcanzado 50% de la nmina, una aplastante
carga que desalentaba la creacin de puestos de trabajo, por lo que el
desempleo es de 17%.
<p>
Para evitar tanto los impuestos de Seguro Social como las exageradas
regulaciones, muchos trabajadores y empresas se pasaron a la economa
informal, estimndose que casi la mitad de los trabajadores argentinos
trabaja ilegalmente.
<p>
Cuando tantos trabajadores dejaron de aportar al Seguro Social, la
proporcin de aportantes a beneficiarios lleg a ser uno a uno, la ms alta
en el mundo. As se creo un crculo vicioso de altos impuestos a la nmina
empujando a trabajadores a la informalidad, lo cual presionaba para aumentar
an ms los impuestos.
<p>
El programa de privatizacin de pensiones iniciado en 1994 le da la opcin
a los trabajadores de quedarse en el viejo sistema estatal o transferir sus
contribuciones -fijadas en no menos de 11% de sus salarios- a uno de los
muchos fondos privados. Ms del 60% han optado por los fondos privados.
<p>
Los trabajadores, con cuentas individuales, acumulan un patrimonio para su
retiro, adems de que ganan intereses y dividendos sobre sus inversiones.
Los fondos hasta ahora han invertido principalmente en bonos
gubernamentales, pero se irn cambiando a acciones y bonos de empresas
privadas a medida que se recupere la economa argentina. Estas inversiones
ampliarn el mercado de capitales y mejores rendimientos aumentarn la tasa
de ahorro. Para impedir riesgos excesivos, el gobierno argentino supervisa
la colocacin de los fondos.
<p>
Los impuestos a la nmina que pagan trabajadores y empresas han podido
reducirse en 10 puntos. El mejor rendimiento de los fondos privados
significa que los trabajadores pueden aportar menos de lo que hacan al
viejo sistema y, de todos modos, recibir pensiones mayores. Y el aporte a la
seguridad social, en el caso de los trabajadores dej de ser un impuesto
para convertirse en una inversin, por lo que algunos trabajadores comienzan
a abandonar la economa informal.
<p>
Los economistas tienden a preocuparse por la transicin de un sistema de
reparto a la seguridad social privada. Pero Argentina est confirmando lo
que Chile demostr hace 15 aos: la transicin puede ser manejada fcilmente
porque el sistema privado es tanto ms eficiente.
<p>
An as los opositores a la privatizacin mantienen que no conviene en
Estados Unidos y Europa e insisten en asustar a los pensionados diciendo que
se les recortarn los beneficios. Todo lo contrario, la transicin debe ser
mucho ms fcil en Estados Unidos y Europa por gozar de mercados de
capitales mucho ms desarrollados que en la Argentina. Pero s se har ms
difcil en la medida de que se posponga porque el nmero de retirados est
creciendo ms rpidamente que el nmero de trabajadores.
<p>
Las naciones industrializadas deben sentirse agradecidas porque los
latinoamericanos estn mostrando el camino a seguirse y han sido pioneros en
la privatizacin del seguro social. Tanto los pensionados como los
trabajadores de las naciones ricas apoyaran la privatizacin si supieran lo
exitosa que ha sido en Argentina, un pas con mayores problemas econmicos
que las ms estancadas economas europeas.

<title>Benegas: LA MAQUINA DE SUBSIDIAR -- 5/16/96</title>

<h2>
LA MAQUINA DE SUBSIDIAR
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Alberto Benegas-Lynch (h)*
</a>

<P>
BUENOS AIRES (AIPE).- A principios de siglo el economista y socilogo
italiano Vilfredo Pareto deca que es difcil  implantar la libertad
econmica porque "el privilegio, incluso si debe costar 100 a la masa y no
producir ms que 50 a los privilegiados, perdindose el resto en falsos
costos, ser en general bien aceptado, puesto que la masa no comprende que
est siendo despojada, mientras que los privilegiados se dan perfecta cuenta
de las ventajas de las que gozan". 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una vez que se abren las compuertas de los subsidios se monta una mquina
que hace que se desate una competencia por los recursos escasos de lo que se
ofrece. De este modo los empresarios desvan su atencin del mercado y la
centran en quienes otorgan subsidios. Se desata as una lucha para ver quin
saca mejor partida a expensas de los dems, ya que el subsidio
necesariamente proviene de los bolsillos de otros que resultan expoliados.
Pero aqu no se trata simplemente de una suma cero, es decir, de una
transferencia coactiva de unos a otros. La competencia por obtener se desata
debido a que los recursos son limitados. Tambin son limitados los
privilegios, aunque no se trate de una transferencia directa de recursos,
puesto que si todos son privilegiados no habra privilegiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Esa competencia se lleva a cabo en base a ofertas de uno u otro tipo que
realizan los competidores a manos de los oferentes de privilegios. No
necesariamente debe recurrirse al cohecho directo o indirecto. Pero, en
cualquier caso, para proceder en este sentido se montan sistemas de cabildeo
para acercarse al poder, sea para convencer al burcrata de la "bondad" de
la propuesta o, debido a que no hay criterio racional para otorgar el
subsidio, para concretar una oferta monetaria a los efectos de que se
resuelva el privilegio en beneficio del postulante.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Supongamos que se trata de un subsidio de $10 millones; en este caso el
empresario estar dispuesto a invertir hasta $9 millones para lograr el
subsidio de referencia, lo cual, desde la perspectiva del resto de la
comunidad significar $19 millones derrochados. Los primeros $10 millones
significan un despilfarro debido a que todo subsidio implica que se sacan
recursos de las reas preferidas por la gente hacia las reas preferidas por
los gobernantes del momento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El sustento de lo que hemos bautizado como "la mquina de subsidiar"
radica en los incentivos que generan marcos institucionales debilitados y
corrompidos. En este sentido, David Friedman seala que en regmenes de este
tipo a muy pocos se les ocurre bregar por la abrogacin de cientos de leyes
para que todos se beneficien por igual de una sociedad abierta, puesto que
resulta mucho ms expedito y fructfero pelear por una nueva ley que otorga
un privilegio. Dice Friedman que el mecanismo consiste en buscar la manera
que 20 millones de  personas paguen un dlar cada una y el beneficiario se
alce con el botn de $20 millones. De este modo slo se oir la voz fuerte
de quien busca el privilegio y no se oir la de los perjudicados que
individualmente pierden poco. Incluso, si el beneficiario contrata
pseudointelectuales y pseudoperiodistas, para que justifiquen el desmn,
lograr que los expoliados lo apoyen. Solamente se oye la voz apagada entre
tanta bulla de intelectuales que quieren quebrar un sistema en el que los
incentivos operan para que se robe al prjimo en lugar de concentrarse en la
produccin sin privilegios. Estas voces resultan anmicas en medio de una
feroz puja para que los vndalos puedan enriquecerse a costa  de los dems.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es por todo esto que se tiene la falsa impresin de que la sociedad
consiste en una batalla campal resultante de una inexorable confrontacin de
intereses. De esta visin surgen las propuestas fascistas del corporativismo
conducentes a los tristemente clebres "pactos sociales" por los que los
capitostes de cada sector deben negociar en torno a una mesa para dar la
impresin de que intereses irreconciliables se negocian en aras de una nunca
alcanzada "paz social". Esta visin no permite ver la armona de intereses
inherentes al estado de derecho y la igualdad ante la ley. Quienes comparten
esta visin no parecen capaces de entender la coordinacin libre y
voluntaria que se lleva a cabo a travs del proceso de mercado.

<h2>
ECONOMA PARA GOBERNANTES
</h2>


Carlos Boloa B.*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En Amrica Latina, los gobernantes de turno, los ministros de
Hacienda y los polticos en general no conocen -u olvidan- los principios
econmicos ms elementales, y aplican frecuentemente polticas populistas
que pueden parecer positivas por sus efectos inmediatos, pero que al final
generan profundos daos y padecimientos.
<dd>        Por ello, debemos siempre recordar a nuestras clases polticas los
fundamentos esenciales de la ciencia econmica. As, puede contribuirse a
que no se repitan los graves errores del pasado. Ojal nuestros gobernantes
comprendan y recuerden estos principios bsicos:
<dd> El bolsillo es el rgano ms sensible. Por tanto, nadie mejor que uno
mismo para cuidar su propio bolsillo.  Ello quiere decir, adems, que la
naturaleza humana responde a incentivos: los individuos prefieren tener ms
a tener menos. La gente prefiere un dlar en su bolsillo que en el bolsillo
de otro o del gobierno, salvo que reciba a cambio de ese dlar un bien o un
servicio equivalente al mismo. No es de extraar que los individuos se
defiendan cuando les intentan reducir sus ingresos. Las polticas de
cualquier gobierno que vayan en contra de la naturaleza humana fracasarn
tarde o temprano.
<dd> Nadie cuida lo que no es suyo. Este es el fundamento de la institucin y
el fortalecimiento de la propiedad privada. Otros tipos o regmenes de
propiedad -como la estatal, social, cooperativa o cualquier otra que
inventen los "ingenieros sociales"- llevan a que nadie se responsabilice de
ella. Tarde o temprano, todos tratan de sacar ventaja de ella, a costa de la
participacin de los dems.
<dd> No se puede gastar ms de lo que se tiene. Esto puede hacerse por un
tiempo, por medio del endeudamiento, pero al final las deudas se pagan. El
individuo, la empresa o el gobierno que intente romper esta regla terminar
quebrado o en la insolvencia. Al principio, deja de pagar sus deudas, luego
pierde sus activos y, finalmente, cae en la quiebra -que es sinnimo de
dejar de operar, empobrecerse y quedar sumido en la miseria-.
<dd> Los pases tambin quiebran. Este es un principio derivado del anterior.
Cuando gastan ms de lo que tienen, los pases primero caen en cesacin de
pagos con el exterior y luego optan por el camino de malutilizar el
monopolio que poseen de imprimir dinero discrecionalmente. Ello genera
inflacin, que es la forma ms hipcrita de encubrir la quiebra.
<dd> No hay almuerzos gratis. Definitivamente, las facturas siempre se pagan.
Ello no quiere decir que siempre las paga quien debe, ya que algunas veces
los grupos de inters logran pasarle la factura al resto de la poblacin. Al
recibir una ventaja del gobierno -por ejemplo, jubilarse a temprana edad o
con sueldos del personal activo, o subsidiar la produccin nacional con los
impuestos a la importacin-, hacen que estas facturas se financien con el
dinero de los dems.
<dd> Lo que no nos cuesta lo hacemos fiesta. Esta es una verdad tan evidente
que la vemos a diario. La gente no valora las cosas cuando no le ha costado
dinero o esfuerzo.  Cuando te regalan las cosas, no las cuidas ni las
consideras. Esto es cierto en el caso de un bien material, pero tambin de
un servicio como la educacin o la salud. Es preferible, por ello, que quien
reciba algo, tenga que sacrificarse tambin con algo -puede no ser dinero
sino tiempo u otro recurso que pueda aportar-.
<dd> Los precios y el empleo no se determinan por decreto. Los precios, el
empleo productivo y el crecimiento econmico no se pueden establecer por
decreto. Los precios se determinan por la utilidad y por la escasez relativa
de los bienes o servicios disponibles en un momento dado. As, el tipo de
cambio refleja la escasez o abundancia relativa del dlar; la tasa de
inters, la del crdito; y el salario, la de la mano de obra. El gobierno,
cada vez que intenta fijar o controlar precios, slo entorpece el
funcionamiento del mercado, generando escasez o abundancia artificiales
-lase mercados negros o desempleo-.
<dd> Ms gasto pblico equivale a ms impuestos. La idea de mayor gasto pblico
es apetecible cuando se piensa en aumentos salariales, gasto social o de
inversin. Sin embargo, ese gasto viene aparejado con impuestos. A alguien
hay que quitarle para pagarlo. La primera tentacin es quitarle a los ricos,
pero generalmente eso no resulta suficiente. La segunda tentacin es
endeudarse, pero toda deuda se tiene que pagar. La tercera tentacin es
generar inflacin, que resulta el impuesto ms injusto, puesto que empobrece
al asalariado, al jubilado y a la mayora de la poblacin.
<dd> La pobreza se combate creando riqueza. Quitar riqueza a los que tienen
para drsela a los que no tienen es el camino seguro para empobrecer un
pas. Igualar es sinnimo de empobrecer. &copy

<title>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION -- 11/14/96</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION
</h2>
Carlos Boloa B.*<br>
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Defino la corrupcin como "el uso del poder pblico para el
enriquecimiento privado". Ciertamente que los beneficios obtenidos
ilcitamente pueden tomar la forma de dividendos polticos, pero en este
artculo centrar la atencin en las causas y consecuencias de sus
beneficios econmicos.
<P>
La tentacin de incurrir en corrupcin depende de tres variables: 
<ol>
<li>El monto de las transacciones econmicas en las que participa el funcionario;
<li>Su duracin en el cargo; y, 
<li>La sofisticacin y complejidad de los servicios pblicos en cuya provisin participa. 
</ol>
As es que la corrupcin
suele ser mayor en las compras de armamentos y pertrechos militares; en
segundo lugar, en las compras de bienes de capital; luego, en los contratos
de ingeniera civil y compras de productos; y, finalmente, en los honorarios
por consultoras.
<p>
La corrupcin es tan antigua como la institucin del gobierno y hoy en da
es un fenmeno global, cuyo monto se estima alcanza la cifra de tres
millones de millones de dlares. Ningn pas se puede considerar libre del
mal, aunque no todos lo padecen en iguales dimensiones: la corrupcin es ms
comn en naciones con regmenes de gobierno arbitrarios, autoritarios y de
planificacin centralizada.
<p>
La necesidad de combatir la corrupcin es insoslayable, puesto tiene efectos
perversos para la vida en sociedad: socava las bases morales de la
democracia y de la economa de mercado al introducir distorsiones en la
informacin y el conocimiento que se deberan transmitir a travs de la
libre competencia de bienes y servicios polticos y econmicos. Por ello, la
corrupcin empobrece. Est demostrado que los pases que cultivan normas de
tica y moral elevados terminan creciendo ms. Un informe reciente estima en
$20 mil millones las cuentas en bancos suizos de lderes africanos.
Adems, la corrupcin genera ineficiencia en trminos de prdida o de mala
asignacin de los recursos productivos de una sociedad. Algunos estudios
sealan que los montos destinados a la corrupcin pueden representar desde
2% hasta ms de 50% de los costos totales de los bienes y servicios que
producen las naciones.
<p>
La corrupcin no slo afecta el crecimiento sino tambin a la equidad. A
travs de ella, los privilegiados se benefician de las operaciones y
transacciones corruptas a expensas de los pobres. De esta manera, se crea un
gobierno ineficaz cuyo nico objetivo es seguir corrompiendo para mantenerse
en el poder, dejando de lado las prcticas del "buen gobierno" y generando
inestabilidad poltica.
<p>
La falta de limitaciones al poder ejercido por diferentes dependencias
gubernamentales contribuye a una deficiente rendicin de cuentas y la
corrupcin infringe un grave y profundo dao moral a los ciudadanos al
premiar la conducta ilcita y castigar la honesta. Con ello genera un
ambiente de cinismo que, al difundirse, provoca la alienacin y la apata
ciudadanas.
<p>
La ecuacin de la corrupcin es la siguiente: Corrupcin = Monopolio +
Arbitrariedad - Transparencia.
<p>
La corrupcin surge de los monopolios artificiales, cuando existe
arbitrariedad o discrecionalidad sin lmites y cuando no existe
transparencia en el proceso de toma de decisiones. Por tanto, a mayor grado
de arbitrariedad y a menor grado de transparencia, mayor ser el nivel de
corrupcin.
<p>
La mala organizacin del Poder Pblico es una fuente segura de corrupcin.
Cuando los Poderes del Estado funcionan sin independencia entre s, abundan
las tentaciones de corrupcin. En ms de un pas latinoamericano, por
ejemplo, el Poder Legislativo le cobra favores polticos al Poder Judicial,
quien, entonces, no lo controla ni fiscaliza.
<p>
La pregunta es cmo reducir la corrupcin. Si se eliminan los monopolios se
reduce la arbitrariedad y se incrementa la transparencia, permitiendo as
combatir eficazmente la corrupcin. Entre las medidas concretas para lograrlo:
<ul>
<li>Aplicar cabalmente las instituciones de la economa de mercado y el Estado de Derecho, reduciendo el intervencionismo estatal en la economa.
<li>Establecer reglas generales, iguales para todos. Un arancel uniforme, sin exoneraciones, y un impuesto general a las ventas uniforme, sin excepciones, contribuiran a disminuirla.
<li>Fomentar la transparencia en las operaciones del gobierno. Convocar, por ejemplo,  licitaciones con supervisin internacional y publicacin de resultados.
<li>Simplificar al mximo los trmites administrativos.
<li>Concientizar a la ciudadana, puesto que la educacin es la clave de la transparencia.
<li>Encarcelar a algunos cuantos "peces gordos" de la corrupcin para que sirva de ejemplo y escarmiento.
<li>Crear una carrera administrativa seria, que acabe con la politiquera y el compadrazgo.
<li>Subir los costos y reducir los beneficios de la corrupcin, para demostrar que la honradez es rentable y que el ser honesto rinde sus beneficios.
<li>Aprobar normas de conducta que promuevan la rendicin de cuentas, abriendo los estados financieros de las empresas que hagan contribuciones a partidos polticos.
<li>Crear una Comisin Independiente contra la Corrupcin, bajo un esquema parecido al de Hong Kong, uno de los pocos pases que ha avanzado consistentemente en este terreno.
</ul>
Para sacar adelante estas medidas, se requerir de una frrea voluntad
poltica y de un poder moral vigoroso, que congregue a todos los sectores de
la opinin pblica.

<TITLE>Bongiovanni: Argentina: El Gran Desafio del Nuevo Ministro -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>ARGENTINA: EL GRAN DESAFIO DEL NUEVO MINISTRO</H2>
Gerardo Bongiovanni*<p>
ROSARIO, ARGENTINA (<a href ="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Roque Fernndez, el nuevo ministro de Economa,
tiene credenciales tcnicas intachables. Graduado de la Universidad de
Chicago fue uno de los creadores del Centro de Estudios Macroeconmicos
Argentinos (CEMA). El peso argentino ha sobrellevado bien la transicin,
pero ahora Fernndez tendr que afrontar el dficit fiscal que lleva ya ocho
trimestres y que se ha agudizado en los ltimos tiempos. 
<dd>
Uno de los principales problemas de la economa argentina es el persistente
aumento del gasto pblico que en  1991 fue de $47.300 millones y que se ha
disparado 74% en cuatro aos, alcanzando $82.300 millones para 1995. Es
cierto que buena parte de este aumento se explica por el reconocimiento de
deudas pblicas -como en el caso de las jubilaciones y pensiones-, pero si
se piensa que en este mismo lapso se han privatizado decenas de empresas
pblicas -casi todas ellas deficitarias-, transferido cargas al sector
privado, como el mantenimiento de rutas ahora realizado a travs de peajes,
y se han eliminado organismos y dependencias, tal incremento resulta
verdaderamente asombroso.
<dd>
Algunos ejemplos ilustran la urgencia de reformas: la Presidencia de la
Nacin, con sus diez secretaras y doce organismos dependientes tiene 20.000
personas a su cargo y un presupuesto anual de ms de $1.200 millones, casi
el doble que lo que gasta el Poder Judicial Federal.
<dd>
El nmero de secretaras y subsecretraras ministeriales no ha hecho ms
que aumentar en los ltimos aos, no obstante un decreto del ao 1990 que
limitaba su nmero. A principios de 1991 haba 10 secretaras y 55
subsecretarias; hoy llegan a 58 y 111 respectivamente. Ahora se anuncia la
decisin de eliminar algunas, pero simultneamente se crearn tres o cuatro
nuevos ministerios que seguramente compensarn dichas reducciones.
<dd>
Captulo aparte es el llamado gasto social. En Argentina los gastos
sociales representan ms del 60% del total de gastos del gobierno. Estos
dineros no llegan a quienes lo necesitan sino que se quedan en el largo
camino de la burocracia. La paradoja es que se crean organismos para ayudar
a los pobres y luego 70% de sus presupuestos se gastan en sueldos de
burcratas. La nica pobreza que as se alivia es la de los empleados pblicos. 
<dd>
Pero indudablemente donde mayor es el caos y la irresponsabilidad oficial
es en las provincias y municipios. El empleo pblico provincial pas de
580.000 agentes en 1991 a ms de 1.100.000 en 1995, un incremento de 90%. En
tanto el gasto total de las provincias y municipios creci en 82% desde 1991
a 1995, de $20.700 millones a $37.700 millones.
En algunos estados hay un burcrata provincial por cada diez habitantes. Y
en general, el rubro salarios consume entre 70% y 80% de los presupuestos
provinciales, lo que claramente es indicativo del exceso de personal.
<dd>
El gobierno nacional trata de afrontar la situacin mediante "pactos
fiscales", a travs de los cuales compromete a los gobiernos provinciales
fondos y les exige como contrapartida que avancen en las privatizaciones de
bancos, energa, agua, etc. Hasta ahora los resultados han sido mediocres
debido a que, bajo el sistema fiscal argentino, el gobierno nacional recauda
la mayor parte de los impuestos y los "coparticipa" entre las provincias,
que a su vez hacen los mismo con los municipios.
<dd>
Este sistema fiscal de "arriba hacia abajo", en donde los estados y
ciudades generan una pequea parte de su presupuesto y reciben el resto,
desalienta toda intencin de ahorrar y reformar, ya que no hay premios ni
castigos, a la vez que se aleja a la administracin pblica del control
ciudadano. En Argentina, el grueso de las funciones gubernamentales son
asumidas por el gobierno federal.
<dd>
El ministro Fernndez parece estar consciente de la necesidad de
profundizar las reformas, reducir el peso de los impuestos e imponer
disciplina y eficiencia en el sector pblico. De no lograrlo, los mercados
internacionales nos impondrn la necesaria disciplina, un escenario que no
sera muy bonito.

<h2>
LOS FUNDAMENTOS DE LA SOCIEDAD LIBRE
</h2>
Nathaniel Branden*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Poco antes del derrumbe de la Unin Sovitica fui
invitado a participar en una conferencia en Acapulco, Mxico. Otro de los
expositores era Gennady Gerasimov, entonces portavoz de Gorbachev. Comenz
su discurso con un cuento en el que la Unin Sovitica haba invadido con
xito y conquistado al resto del mundo, con una excepcin, Nueva Zelanda. Se
haba tomado la decisin poltica de no invadir ese pas. Por qu? Para que
las autoridades soviticas pudieran conocer el precio de mercado de las
cosas. Toda la audiencia solt la carcajada y yo me qued petrificado.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mi mente retrocedi 40 aos atrs, cuando Ayn Rand me guiaba en la lectura
de Ludwig von Mises, el economista que por vez primera apunt la
imposibilidad del clculo econmico bajo el socialismo, explicando que esa
era la razn por la cual el sistema socialista terminara con un colapso
econmico. Tantos aos ms tarde, un representante de la Unin Sovitica
admita pblicamente, a manera de chiste, el argumento de Mises, tratndolo
como una evidente realidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ya muy pocos creen seriamente en el socialismo como un modelo viable de
organizacin social, pero est todava lejos la victoria del capitalismo.
Instituciones como Cato, adems de acadmicos e intelectuales alrededor del
mundo, aportan crecientes evidencias que ningn otro sistema puede competir
en cuanto a productividad y nivel de vida con el libre mercado, a la vez que
se demuestra que los gobiernos no slo fracasan en resolver los problemas
sociales sino que empeoran las mismas condiciones que tratan de mejorar.
Pero como decidido combatiente por la libertad me pregunto por qu la pelea
ha sido tan larga y por qu aparecen cien cabezas cuando le cortamos alguna
al monstruo estatista?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Vivimos en una cultura que ensea que la moralidad es el autosacrificio, la
compasin y el servicio a los dems. No asociamos la moralidad con ambicin,
realizacin, innovacin ni con las ganancias. Ahora llaman egosta a quien
hace lo que quiere en vez de hacer lo que nosotros queremos que l haga.
Pero si comparamos el bien que logran los que sienten compasin por los
dems con el logrado por aquellos que inventan y alcanzan xito creando
industrias y nuevos servicios, no hay duda de que los ltimos han hecho
mucho ms por la humanidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Uno de los grandes problemas que enfrenta la sociedad libre es la
disonancia entre los valores que realmente mejoran el bienestar de la gente
y las cosas que se ensean como nobles y morales. Mientras exista tal
incongruencia, la batalla por la libertad no podr ser permanentemente
ganada. En nuestro siglo hemos sufrido rebeliones virulentas contra los
valores de la razn, objetividad, la ciencia, la verdad y la lgica de parte
de filosofas como el postmodernismo, postestructuralismo,
deconstruccionismo y el determinismo histrico. No es accidente que nuestros
contrincantes son todos estatistas, pero si no se ejerce la razn lo que
queda es la coercin.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otro valor en decadencia es la autorresponsabilidad. Asumamos que el
crecimiento normal era la progresin de la dependencia de la niez a la
responsabilidad del adulto. Uno de los fundamentos principales del
liberalismo es la premisa de que tenemos que asumir la responsabilidad por
nuestras propias vidas. No hay otra forma en que funcione la sociedad
civilizada. Y durante demasiado tiempo ha existido una animadversin contra
el empresario. Sin embargo, si entendemos que el hombre de negocios es clave
para convertir los nuevos conocimientos en formas de mejorar el bienestar de
la gente, nos damos cuenta que ser antiempresarial es un error. Pero sin la
dimensin moral y espiritual lograremos apenas ganar el debate en el corto
plazo, mientras los estatistas asumen su manto de moralidad, por ms dao
que causen sus programas. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pienso que no hay batalla ms noble que la batalla por la libertad. Y no se
trata de una batalla a favor de la empresa privada ni del mercado. Se trata
de una batalla por la propiedad sobre nuestra vida misma.&copy; <p>

<TITLE>Browne: Las Ciudades Necesitan Menos, no mas, Gobierno -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LAS CIUDADES NECESITAN MENOS, NO MAS, GOBIERNO</H2>
Harry Browne*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El gobierno no funciona. No mantiene la seguridad en
nuestras ciudades, no educa bien a nuestros hijos, la beneficencia
gubernamental es un incentivo a no hacer nada y no entrega el correo a
tiempo. Sin embargo, durante la campaa electoral oiremos mltiples
propuestas sobre nuevos programas para arreglar tales problemas, a pesar de
haber sido el gobierno quien los ha causado.
<dd>	
Examinemos los tres principales retos que enfrentan las ciudades hoy en
da: psimo sistema educativo, programas desbocados de beneficencia y
crmenes violentos. Aunque parecen ser problemas eternos son en realidad
relativamente nuevos. Estados Unidos era muy diferente en los aos 50.
<dd>	
La educacin no era perfecta, pero los graduados de bachillerato podan al
menos leer los exmenes de admisin a la universidad. La gran mayora de los
muchachos se graduaban de bachillerato con una educacin bsica en historia,
geografa, ciencias y matemticas.
<dd>
La beneficencia estatal era prcticamente desconocida. De ello se ocupaban
instituciones privadas y si acaso haba una pequea oficina en la parte
trasera de la alcalda. En tales sitios, cualquiera tena que explicar cmo
se haba metido en problemas y qu estaba dispuesto a hacer para salir de
ellos. Si su historia era creble y cumpla con sus promesas, se le ayudaba.
Debido a que no se necesitaba mucha beneficencia pblica, muchos
desconocamos su existencia.
<dd>
La estadstica de crmenes eran una fraccin de la actual. Cuando crec en
un suburbio de Los Angeles, sola caminar una milla para ir al cine, a las
10 de la noche los viernes, sin la menor preocupacin por mi seguridad. Hoy
no me siento seguro caminando las mismas calles a la 10 de la maana.
<dd>
Qu ha cambiado desde los aos 50? Mucho y el cambio ms grande de todos
ha sido la invasin del gobierno federal a nuestras ciudades y nuestras vidas.
<dd>
El patrn es el mismo en todas partes. El gobierno federal ofreci pequeos
subsidios para complementar los presupuestos municipales y estatales; luego
aument los subsidios. Una vez que el gobierno local se haba convertido en
adicto a tales subsidios tuvieron que obedecer para seguir recibiendo
dinero. Como resultado de todo esto, gran parte de las decisiones hoy se
toman en Washington. Los presupuestos locales son exageradamente altos, en
muchos casos porque el gobierno local tiene que gastar grandes sumas de su
propio dinero para calificar en la obtencin de fondos federales.
<dd>
El Congreso republicano ha respondido prohibiendo mandatos federales que no
asuman sus costos y al ofrecer traspasar a los estados fondos libres de
ataduras. Pero ninguna de las dos respuestas es suficiente. Tenemos que
quitarnos de encima todos los mandatos federales, tanto los que paga el
gobierno central como los que no. Los polticos de Washington no saben lo
que conviene a su ciudad. Y cul es la ventaja de enviar dinero a
Washington para que luego sea devuelto? Tenemos que quitarnos al gobierno
federal de encima en educacin, beneficencia y control criminal.
<dd>
Y aunque estos son los problemas ms obvios no son los nicos. Washington
hace tambin dao interfiriendo en la construccin de carreteras, en salud,
en el ambiente, etc.
<dd>
Segn el censo, el gobierno federal, estatal y local toma el 47% del
ingreso nacional en impuestos. Al tratar de resolverlo todo a travs del
gobierno, hemos agravado los problemas de las ciudades e imposibilitado a
los contribuyentes enfrentar sus propios problemas.
<dd>
Debemos empezar el camino de la recuperacin limitando al gobierno federal
a slo aquellas funciones determinadas por la Constitucin. Eso reducira el
tamao del gobierno lo suficiente como para revocar el impuesto sobre la
renta, permitiendo a las ciudades resolver sus problemas.
<dd>
Para ver el alcance de esta revolucin fjese cunto le deducen de su
sueldo en impuesto sobre la renta y Seguro Social. Entonces pregntese lo
que usted podra hacer con ese dinero. Pondra a sus nios en colegios
privados que ofrecen mejor educacin y valores? Ahorrara para abrirse por
su cuenta como siempre lo ha deseado? Se mudara a una casa mejor?
Ayudara ms a su obra de caridad preferida?
<dd>	
Usted trabaja por ese dinero y debiera poder decidir su uso. Eso no es
funcin de los polticos, quitndoselo para luego devolverle lo que les
parece, como si usted fuera un nio recibiendo una mesada.
<dd>	
Hay algn beneficio que el gobierno le da que usted no pueda reemplazar
con creces con el dinero que ahorrara en impuestos?
<dd>	
Es hora de volver a tomar posesin de nuestras ciudades, de nuestro dinero
y de nuestras vidas.

<blockquote>
WASHINGTON (AIPE).- A medida que Amrica Latina adelanta su proceso de
reforma econmica se hace ms evidente la necesidad de contar con un sistema
judicial eficaz. La democratizacin, la concentracin de la poblacin en
reas urbanas y la apertura econmica han aumentado la complejidad de la
interaccin social y, en consecuencia, la demanda por servicios judiciales
en la resolucin de conflictos. Adems, la economa de mercado exige
definiciones claras sobre derechos y obligaciones.
<p>
El sistema judicial, que incluye todos los mecanismos necesarios para
interpretar las leyes y regulaciones, es un elemento clave en el desarrollo
econmico. Sin embargo, los tribunales latinoamericanos sufren de crecientes
demoras y de corrupcin, lo cual genera desconfianza en el sistema. En casi
todos los pases latinoamericanos se observa una falta de consistencia en la
aplicacin de la jurisprudencia, lo cual unido a retrasos en resolver casos
aumenta el costo de acceso a la justicia y tambin de realizar negocios e
inversiones.
<p>
A medida que aumenta el costo de la justicia, la gente reacciona acudiendo
menos a los tribunales. Un reciente estudio muestra que la mayora de los
usuarios no se inclinan a acudir a un tribunal para resolver disputas porque
perciben el sistema como lento, incierto, costoso y de "pobre calidad". La
desconfianza en el sistema judicial es considerablemente mayor entre
empresarios pequeos y las familias de bajos ingresos.
<p>
A menudo se argumenta que se sufre de presupuestos inadecuados, pero pases
como Dinamarca, Japn y Alemania, donde el pblico tiene gran confianza en
el sistema judicial, el gobierno asigna porciones menores de su presupuesto
que Argentina, Brasil, Colombia y Mxico, las naciones cuyos tribunales
gozan de la menor confianza por parte del pblico. No se ha comprobado
relacin alguna entre la eficiencia judicial y el tamao del presupuesto
asignado a los tribunales. Encuestas realizadas en Argentina, Venezuela,
Ecuador y Per muestran que entre 55% y 75% del pblico tiene una muy baja
opinin del sector judicial. La percepcin general es que el entrenamiento
de los jueces es pobre y que no se garantiza la igualdad ante la ley.
<p>
Una pregunta clave es por qu los jueces a menudo se oponen a las reformas.
La respuesta se basa en que funcionarios gubernamentales se aprovechan de
los tribunales para obtener rentas ilcitas, lo cual en gran parte es
posible debido a la amplia discrecionalidad monoplica de que gozan los
jueces.  Por ejemplo, la costumbre de que los jueces reciben por separado a
las partes crea fuertes incentivos a la corrupcin. Como tampoco hay normas
establecidas sobre el lapso de tiempo antes de iniciar el juicio o sobre su
duracin, esto se presta a que funcionarios del tribunal cobren por agilizar
los trmites.
<p>
Otro problema es la frecuente concentracin de poder en las manos del juez,
quien asume mltiples roles en cuanto a la programacin estratgica, el
manejo de personal, la administracin de recursos, control presupuestario y
la adjudicacin de casos, todo lo cual distrae su atencin de la resolucin
de casos pendientes y abre mltiples posibilidades de corrupcin, debido a
la ausencia de mecanismos internos y externos de control.
<p>
La inercia frente a la necesidad de las reformas judiciales en parte se
explica porque los beneficios, tales como mayor inversin y crecimiento
econmico  son generales y a largo plazo, mientras que el costo es
individual e inmediato:  la desaparicin de los ingresos por corrupcin. Por
lo tanto, parte de las reformas tendran que incluir mayores beneficios a
corto plazo dirigidos a los funcionarios del sistema judicial, a travs de
generosas pensiones, promociones para los jueces y empleados de los
tribunales, nuevas instalaciones y ms amplios presupuestos.
<p>
La corrupcin implica un rompimiento del cdigo de tica colectivo que
beneficia al individuo que paga bajo la mesa para conseguir lo que desea del
tribunal, pero la sociedad se perjudica por una cada de la productividad a
travs del tiempo causada por la generalizada percepcin de que la
asignacin de recursos se hace de manera poco equitativa, al ser determinada
por prcticas corruptas. El estudio de la historia econmica prueba que la
corrupcin sistmica observada en la administracin de justicia en Amrica
Latina seguir contribuyendo al retraso econmico de la regin.

<h2>
BRASIL PICA EN PUNTA
</h2>
Alejandro Antonio Chafuen*
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Hay tres elementos claves que los ejecutivos de
empresas multinacionales toman en cuenta al decidir sobre dnde invertir:
estabilidad poltica, estabilidad monetaria y respeto a los derechos de
propiedad. Justo cuando los titulares de la prensa mundial reportan el
impasse entre Estados Unidos y China por la piratera no controlada de
pelculas, msica y programas de computacin, el presidente del Brasil,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, procedi a firmar una ley de patentes de
productos farmacuticos que puede servir de modelo al mundo y que representa
un importante paso de Brasil hacia el liderazgo econmico en nuestro hemisferio.
Brasil enfrenta tremendos retos econmicos. Debe mantener una moneda
estable, reforzar su sector financiero, liberalizar sus leyes laborales y
privatizar un gran nmero de empresas estatales. Luego de varias dcadas de
equivocadas inversiones, la reformas resultan dolorosas. Para hacer menos
traumtica esa transformacin, Brasil requiere considerables influjos de
inversin extranjera. La nueva ley de patentes har mucho ms fcil atraer
el capital requerido y debido a la debilidad de la actual legislacin
argentina en la materia, aquellas inversiones que hubieran hecho en dicho
pas las industrias de alta tecnologa ahora irn al Brasil.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     	La nueva ley brasilea es un hito en la dinmica de la
infraestructura econmica mundial para la innovacin mdica. Favorece la
medicina, la ciencia, la investigacin, el crecimiento econmico y la
atencin mdica para la gente del Brasil y el resto de Amrica del Sur. Se
trata de un nuevo ingrediente en la estrategia de liberalizacin poltica y
econmica, impulsando al Brasil hacia un verdadero liderazgo entre las
economas en desarrollo y los mercados emergentes, fijando rumbo para
alcanzar un posicin clave entre las democracias industriales  del siglo XXI.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     	Desde tiempos de Adam Smith, prominentes economistas han mantenido
que la riqueza de las naciones depende de un vasto mercado, sin trabas a la
divisin del trabajo y respeto por la propiedad privada. La inmensa riqueza
natural y humana del Brasil, junto a su nueva posicin de liderazgo en el
dinmico mercado latinoamericano, prometen ofrecer oportunidades econmicas
de excepcin. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Analistas con los ms diversos enfoques, incluyendo tanto al Vaticano como
al Valle Silicn, coinciden en que los activos ms importantes en la era de
la informacin son intangibles. La fortaleza econmica hoy depende en gran
parte de ideas, informacin y conocimientos, lo cual convierte la propiedad
intelectual en ingrediente esencial. Una buena ley de patentes, como la
recin promulgada en Brasil, es de especial importancia para la innovacin
farmacutica, al reducir el inmenso riesgo que conlleva el descubrimiento y
desarrollo de nuevas medicinas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El costo promedio de una nueva droga es de $500 millones y el proceso toma
12 aos. Lo sorprendente es que el grueso de los descubrimientos mdicos no
se logran en dependencias gubernamentales ni universidades, sino en las
empresas privadas que realizan las investigaciones. En este sentido, las
estadsticas en Estados Unidos son determinantes: 99% de las medicinas ms
frecuentemente prescritas fueron desarrolladas por la industria privada y el
equivalente al 92% de las nuevas sustancias qumicas aprobadas entre 1981 y
1990 provinieron de laboratorios privados. Sin embargo, las universidades,
los hospitales, la industria y los gobiernos forman parte del esfuerzo
conjunto de investigacin que el sistema de patentes hace posible. 
Para Brasil, el beneficio de la nueva ley ser la transferencia de
conocimientos y   tecnologas, enriqueciendo sus procesos de investigacin y
desarrollo. La empresa innovadora conoce ms que cualquier otra las
caractersiticas sobre las nuevas medicinas, por lo que juega un papel
crucial para la comercializacin y transferencia de informacin al cuerpo
mdico. Sin patentes, cualquiera puede vender las medicinas, pero se pierde
el importante aporte al tratamiento de pacientes hecho por la firma que las
desarroll, imposibilitando a su vez la creacin de centros locales de
investigacin y desarrollo. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ultimamente, un impresionante grupo de naciones -Canad, la Repblica Checa,
Corea del Sur, Mxico y Taiwan, entre otras- ha mejorado substancialmente
sus leyes de patentes y ahora Brasil se coloca a la cabeza de ese grupo. Las
naciones en este sentido rezagadas, como Argentina y la India, pagarn un
alto precio, en el retraso de sus centros de investigacin y en la salud de
la ciudadana.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La idea del hemisferio americano unido por la libertad de comercio, la
tradicin constitucional republicana y los derechos humanos sigue siendo un
sueo que slo se har realidad con la convergencia de estructuras legales
basadas en los principios que han permitido a las civilizaciones madurar y
desarrollarse. Los derechos de propiedad intelectual forman parte integral
de tales principios y la iniciativa brasilea favorece justamente esa
dinmica. <&copy;p>

<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>VENEZUELA: SUBDESARROLLO LABORAL</H2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>



CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- Los sueldos que recibe la mayora de los venezolanos no
alcanzan para vivir. Con el salario mnimo diario no se compran ni siquiera
dos Big Mac. Los polticos, quienes insisten en ignorar las races del
problema, creen que elevando el salario mnimo resolvern el problema.
Cada ao se aumenta el salario mnimo con la ilusin de proteger al
trabajador de los funestos efectos de la inflacin creada por las
autoridades monetarias. Pero atacar los sntomas, mientras se le da la
espalda a las verdaderas causas, conduce a mayor desempleo y  desconfianza.
Los obstculos que impiden mejorar el nivel de vida del venezolano son
principalmente nuestra psima a legislacin laboral, el  inmenso peso del
aparato gubernamental y la constante emisin de dinero inorgnico para tapar
huecos presupuestarios. Tan espectacular es la catstrofe econmica que
sufrimos que se comienza a generar presin popular por adelgazar al Estado,
por exigir eficacia a los polticos y burcratas, por cambiar leyes que
impiden la inversin, por reformar los corrompidos sistemas pblicos de
seguridad social y de administracin de justicia. Lamentablemente, la
probabilidad que se instrumenten reformas adecuadas en el exageradamente
politizado mbito laboral es nfima.<p>
Una de las aberraciones de la ley laboral venezolana concierne el pago de la
antigedad. Por cada ao de empleo, el trabajador se hace acreedor al
equivalente de un mes de salario, monto que se hace efectivo cuando se
retira de la empresa, pero que constantemente se recalcula en base al ltimo
sueldo. As, todo aumento de salario tiene un efecto retroactivo. En tiempos
de inflacin esta deuda de las empresas se dispara de tal manera que obliga
a los patronos a deshacerse de sus empleados ms veteranos, con la inmensa
prdida de productividad que ello acarrea para la economa.
Al gobierno, por el contrario, no le importa acumular pasivos que
administraciones futuras tendrn que pagar y por ello, aunque emplea al 20%
de los venezolanos, el sector pblico acumula 66% del pasivo por
prestaciones sociales.<p>
La situacin se agrava si el retiro ocurre por decisin del patrono y no del
trabajador, no importan las razones; entonces la antigedad se paga doble.
Por ello, un trabajador que tenga 15 aos en la empresa y gane $5.000 al
ao, despedirlo cuesta $14.000.<p>
La inflexibilidad que estas leyes populistas le han impuesto a la economa
venezolana es motivo importante del empobrecimiento de la nacin y del
atraso de nuestra industria, imposibilitada por las autoridades a competir
con el resto del mundo. Pero, los ms afectados son los miembros de la misma
clase trabajadora ante la desaparicin de ofertas de empleo y por la
imposibilidad de conseguir aumentos de sueldos a medida que sube el costo de
la vida. Eso tambin explica porque ms de la mitad de los venezolanos
laboran en la economa informal, sin ningn tipo de proteccin social.
A pesar de esta tragedia nacional, los sindicatos, fuerza dominante en
varios de los principales partidos polticos aunque representan slo a una
muy pequea parte de los trabajadores, se niegan a aceptar reformas que
impliquen la prdida de sus "conquistas", insistiendo que los "derechos
adquiridos" de los trabajadores no son negociables. <p>
 	El presidente Caldera y su actual ministro del Trabajo parecen ahora
comprender el problema, pero ellos fueron los autores de la ley promulgada
en 1990, cuando en la oposicin utilizaban todas las tradicionales armas de
la demagogia.<p>
Ahora se habla de que la ley se debera aplicar slo a quienes devengan
hasta 10 salarios mnimos. La verdad es que la situacin difcilmente podra
ser peor y da a da se hace ms evidente el atraso institucional de
Venezuela vis-a-vis el resto del continente. <p>

<h2>
CUBA: LAS MENTIRAS OFICIALES
</h2>     
Vladimir Chelminski*<BR>
<P>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Toda Amrica Latina, excepto Cuba, pudo ver la entrevista
que le hizo Dan Rather a Fidel Castro y el posterior debate sobre la misma
entre Ricardo Alarcn, presidente de la Asamblea del Poder Popular de Cuba y
Jorge Mas Canosa, presidente de la Fundacin Nacional Cubano-Americana. La
aseveracin del Sr. Alarcn de que el deseo de emigrar a Estados Unidos no
es un fenmeno cubano sino ms bien una realidad latinoamericana tiene algo
de verdad. La diferencia es que en Cuba la gente est desesperada por comer
completo, sufre una total falta de libertad y la imposibilidad de soar en
una vida mejor dentro de su patria.
<P>
Puede ser que muchos de los pobres de Amrica Latina
quisieran emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero no estaran dispuestos a correr los
mismos riesgos. Y mienten las autoridades cubanas cuando aseguran que la
falta de todo en la isla se debe al embargo estadounidense, pues estamos en
la era de las comunicaciones, por lo que es posible importar mercancas de
diferentes orgenes siempre y cuando se pague con moneda dura. La verdadera
causa de la escasez en Cuba es que el socialismo destruy todo incentivo por
producir e intercambiar.
<P>
Lamentablemente, por toda Amrica Latina campea la miseria, pero tambin hay
que aclarar que en gran parte ella se debe a la irresponsabilidad individual
que nos ha caracterizado en materia de paternidad, como tambin a que en
muchos aspectos vitales hemos seguido modelos socialistas no muy diferentes
al cubano.
<P> 
Esferas tan importantes como la educacin, la salud, el
transporte, la produccin y distribucin de energa han sido socializadas
por nuestros gobiernos, los cuales tambin han tendido a monopolizar la
explotacin de nuestras riquezas naturales y de aquellos renglones en los
que gozamos de ventajas comparativas, eliminando as la competencia, sin la
cual no existe eficiencia alguna en la produccin ni en la distribucin.
<P>
La mayora de nuestras constituciones fueron redactadas o
enmendadas por simpatizantes de las ideas de Marx y Lenin, las mismas que
inspiraron la revolucin castrista. En el resto de Amrica Latina, el estado
no ha sido tan horriblemente cruel y sanguinario, pero a travs de una
constante intervencin en la vida y el trabajo de los ciudadanos tambin ha
logrado retrasar nuestro desarrollo y nuestra habilidad de competir en el
mundo moderno.
<P>
Los cubanos prefieren emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero en su
defecto lo haran gustosamente a  cualquier otro pas del hemisferio
occidental, mientras que nadie en su sano juicio intentara jams emigrar a
Cuba, a menos de que sea perseguido por la justicia.
<P>
El respeto a los derechos de propiedad, que son la base de
la prosperidad y seguridad en Estados Unidos, fue el principal objetivo
atacado frontalmente por la Revolucin Cubana. La propiedad no es muy
respetada tampoco por la mayora de los polticos latinoamericanos, quienes
se aprestan a rechazar la Ley Helms-Burton, la cual pretende impedir que se
trafique con propiedades de ciudadanos estadounidenses que la revolucin
confisc, sin compensacin alguna.
<P>
Sobre expropiaciones arbitrarias en Amrica Latina tenemos
una larga y triste experiencia, aunque es plida frente a la de los cubano.
Como es tan tenue el respeto a la propiedad privada  en Amrica Latina,
nuestros lderes no estn en capacidad de entender bien una ley que se
refiere a  propiedades robadas por el estado. El da que el pueblo de Cuba y
del resto de Amrica Latina entienda cabalmente la importancia del concepto
de la propiedad como institucin social fundamental que alienta la
administracin cuidadosa de recursos escasos, comenzar entonces una
revolucin pacfica conducente a la prosperidad, el orden y el amor por la
patria. 
<P>      
Pero est claro que el problema cubano es mucho ms
dramtico que el del resto de Amrica Latina, a la vez que es inslito que
por todo el continente se desplacen sacerdotes propagando laTeologa de la
Liberacin, la idea de que una revolucin como la cubana  puede ser el
remedio para nuestros males. Es tambin absurdo que nuestros gobernantes
continen apoyando la dictadura castrista frente a un pas libre como
Estados Unidos. &copy;

<title>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES
</h2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El comercio irregular de mercancas importadas, en
particular de los equipos de oficina, mdicos, de sonido y vdeo, las
neveras, cocinas, lavadoras, etc. alcanza  hoy niveles sin precedentes en
Venezuela. Tan grave es el problema que conocidas empresas multinacionales
como Sony, Panasonic, Hitachi, Compact, Hewlett Packard, Phillips, Epson,
que ofrecen sus productos cumpliendo con todas las leyes, se estn
preparando para marcharse y abandonar sus operaciones en el pas.
<p>
Por comercio irregular me refiero a mercancas de contrabando que no pagan
aranceles que promedian 20%, bienes robados o utilizados como pretexto para
lavar dinero proveniente del trfico internacional de estupefacientes,
tambin artculos de segunda mano que son vendidos como nuevos o
comercializados evadiendo el IVA de 16,5%, impuesto que en ciertos renglones
llega hasta 36,5%.  Este mercado negro que se ha disparado en Venezuela este
ao atenta contra la viabilidad del comercio establecido y muchos de los
compradores no tienen idea de la procedencia de lo que adquieren ni
sospechan la posibilidad de futuros problemas, en cuanto a calidad y
garantas de servicio y repuestos.
<p>
Con la progresiva desaparicin de los representantes y distribuidores
legtimos de esas marcas tiende tambin a desaparecer el personal entrenado
para cumplir con la garanta y reparacin de bienes costosos, como
computadoras y televisores, a la vez que la ciudadana se va acostumbrando
tanto a la corrupcin oficial como al incumplimiento de la ley, aceptando la
evidente ausencia de seguridad jurdica.
<p>
Segn estadsticas presentadas por el Consejo Nacional del Comercio y los
Servicios, las ventas al detal durante el primer semestre de este ao
cayeron en Venezuela 50%, comparadas con el mismo semestre del ao pasado;
la venta de vehculos cay en 65% y la venta de alimentos se redujo en 35%.
No se conoce la proporcin de esas ventas que ahora se realizan en la
economa informal.
<p>
La Cmara de Comercio de Caracas apoya la reforma de las aduanas anunciada
por las autoridades porque suele tomar 10 a 15 das retirar mercancas de
los puertos venezolanos. La reforma apunta a la simplificacin y aceleracin
de los trmites. Se oponen los que hoy viven  del robo de mercancas
almacenadas en los puertos y de la extorsin a los importadores para
agilizar complicados y anticuados trmites oficiales.
<p>
Cuando Transparency International, prestigiosa institucin alemana,
cataloga a Venezuela reiteradamente como uno de los pases ms corruptos de
Amrica Latina y del mundo, lo hace principalmente por la mala fama de
nuestro sistema judicial y de nuestras aduanas. Cuatro veces han fracasado
los intentos de reformar el sistema aduanal venezolano en los ltimos cuatro
aos, lo cual es indicativo del poder poltico y econmico de sus
opositores. La reforma anunciada comenzar con un plan piloto en la aduana
martima de La Guaira y se espera sea pronto extendida al resto de los
puertos y aeropuertos venezolanos.
<p>
Esta reforma es un primer paso para eliminar el contrabando que debe ser
seguido de la rebaja y unificacin de impuestos, a todas luces excesivos. El
bienestar nacional reclama la unificacin de aranceles en alrededor de 7% y
del IVA en 10%. El Fisco recaudar mucho ms cobrando 7% sobre todas las
importaciones que cobrando 20% de las que hoy cumplen con la ley. Y quienes
hoy se arriesgan pagando sobornos para evitar el pago tanto del IVA como de
los aranceles difcilmente continuaran hacindolo con impuestos razonables.
<p>
Otra fuente de fraude y corrupcin es el puerto libre de la isla de
Margarita, donde se  conceden privilegios a determinados ciudadanos que le
son negados a todos los dems. No slo los residentes de Margarita necesitan
incentivos. Incentivos tambin requieren los que han invertido a travs de
los aos en establecer sus marcas y el buen nombre de sus establecimientos
comerciales, ofreciendo el buen servicio de su personal entrenado y precios
competitivos para su clientela. Son estos los comerciantes que por la
ignorancia econmica y poca visin de legisladores y funcionarios estn
desapareciendo.

<h2>
REFORMA ELECTORAL
</h2>

Edward H. Crane*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Uno de los temas ms importantes -y peor entendidos- que
enfrenta Estados Unidos es la reforma electoral. La reforma de las leyes que
rigen el financiamiento de las campaas choca de frente con la ms popular
de las reformas propuestas, la que busca asignar un lmite a las veces que
un congresista puede ser reelegido.
<dd>	El intento de reformar el financiamiento de las campaas, de la manera como
ha sido recientemente presentado en el Congreso, es ms bien una solucin en
bsqueda de un problema. Las crticas de que estamos gastando cantidades
"obscenas" en las elecciones no tienen base en la realidad. En Estados
Unidos gastamos menos de $10 por elector en cada ciclo de dos aos para cada
cargo en el pas, desde atrapador de perros callejeros a presidente de la
nacin.
<dd>	Dado el inmenso impacto que los funcionarios electos tienen en nuestras
vidas y en nuestros bolsillos, se puede ms bien argumentar que no estamos
gastando lo suficiente. Eso es particularmente cierto si reconocemos que el
dinero es lo que nos permite ser informados durante las campaas. Herbert
Alexander, director de Citizens Research Foundation lo explica de la
siguiente manera: "Los gastos en las campaas deben ser considerados como lo
que pagamos para ser educados sobre los temas polticos. Las campaas ms
costosas resultan ser aquellas donde los electores hacen una mala seleccin
por falta de informacin".
<dd>	Es obvio que los lmites que se tratan de imponer a los gastos en las
campaas electorales de los congresistas beneficia a los miembros actuales y
perjudica a desconocidos que aspiran reemplazarlos.
Por el contrario, aquellos que intentan limitar las reelecciones de los
congresistas buscan abrir el proceso poltico. Ellos quieren que sus
conciudadanos que viven y trabajan en el mundo real, lejos de Washington,
vayan a la capital como sus representantes, por tiempo limitado, en lugar de
los polticos profesionales que favorecen las propuestas de limitar el
financiamiento de las campaas.
<dd>La limitacin de las reelecciones combinado a la total transparencia e
informacin sobre las contribuciones recibidas por los candidatos
conformaran una verdadera reforma. Ello permitira que gente competente,
con las ms diferentes posiciones, pudiesen recolectar suficientes fondos
para participar como candidatos en el proceso poltico, an cuando hayan
pasado la mayor parte de sus vidas en el sector privado, como el resto de
nosotros.
<dd>                Como resultado tendramos una democracia ms vigorosa, con
la participacin de candidatos con los ms variados antecedentes y
experiencias, tomando parte en elecciones ms competitivas.
En 1968, Eugene McCarthy pudo lanzar su candidatura a la presidencia porque
unos pocos opositores a la guerra en Vietnam, con mucho dinero,
contribuyeron cientos de miles de dlares a su campaa. Si los actuales
lmites a las contribuciones hubieran estado entonces vigentes, los millones
de ciudadanos opuestos a la guerra no hubieran tenido un vocero y Lyndon
Johnson hubiera ido a la reeleccin. No es el papel de las leyes electorales
cambiar la historia.
<dd>                Como el Sr. McCarthy sostuvo: "Nuestros prceres de la
independencia arriesgaron 'sus vidas, sus fortunas y su sagrado honor en la
batalla por la libertad'. No dijeron 'sus vidas y sus fortunas hasta $1000'".&copy

<title>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO
</h2>
Porfirio Cristaldo A.*<br>
<p>
ASUNCION (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- La depredacin del bosque nativo en el Paraguay avanza a
ritmo pavoroso. Su total desaparicin se estima entre 5 y 7 aos. Miles de
hectreas boscosas son segadas diariamente e hileras de camiones cargados de
troncos cruzan las fronteras sin pausa, pese a las leyes ambientales que
proscriben la tala de rboles y prohiben su exportacin. 
<p>
Los legisladores reprochan al gobierno por la masiva destruccin de
los bosques, el trfico ilegal de madera y la creciente contaminacin de
ros y arroyos. Exigen el acatamiento de las leyes ambientales, proponen
crear un Ministerio del Medio Ambiente y sancionar leyes ms estrictas, con
elevadas multas y penas carcelarias para los infractores. Pero la
experiencia mundial muestra su equivocacin. No son ms leyes, ni penas ms
duras, ni ms burcratas lo que se precisa para conservar los bosques, sino
proteger la propiedad privada. Paradjicamente, fue el populismo de la
Legislatura en los ltimos aos lo que aceler la deforestacin. Toda
nuestra legislacin atenta contra el bosque.
<p>
        Las leyes de la Reforma Agraria califican al bosque como "latifundio
improductivo", sujeto a expropiacin confiscatoria para su posterior reparto
a campesinos "sin tierra". Supuestamente, los bosques no satisfacen la
"funcin social" de la propiedad. Y por ello los propietarios buscan
deshacerse de sus bosques transformndolos en pastos para el ganado. Por el
apuro, ante la amenaza de expropiacin, las maderas se queman en el
desmonte, sin importar la prdida de materiales de construccin, postes para
cercados y lea. 
<p>
        Pero el peligro no es slo de expropiacin; tambin est la invasin
de los "sin tierra", entre los que hay verdaderos "industriales" de la
deforestacin y el abigeo. Estos invaden nicamente los bosques, y no
precisamente por su fertilidad, sino porque constituyen una fuente inmediata
de ingresos. La primera actividad de los "sin tierra" es la tala del bosque
y venta de troncos. Buena parte del contrabando maderero financia las
invasiones de tierras y en muchos casos constituyen el nico inters de los
"sin tierra". No es fcil sobrevivir en regiones remotas esperando la venta
de las primeras cosechas. Los invasores talan y se van.
<p>
        Para el propietario, la mejor defensa contra la invasin de sus
tierras es la deforestacin, eliminando su principal atractivo. El
formidable costo de derribar y quemar la selva se justifica an ms por el
hecho que el bosque no sirve de mucho, pues las leyes ambientales intentan
"protegerlo" de su dueo. 
<p>
        Al propietario le est prohibido cortar sus rboles y venderlos sin
previa autorizacin del Ministerio de Agricultura, ajustndose a un Plan de
Explotacin forestal. Para el dueo, esta restriccin le resta valor al
bosque. A nadie le interesa cuidar o preservar un recurso cuyo uso el
gobierno puede disponer arbitrariamente. Mejor no tener bosques. Las leyes
de proteccin ambiental se suman as a los peligros de la invasin y
fomentan una rpida deforestacin. El gobierno activamente destruye lo que
pretende proteger. 
<p>
        Las restricciones a la exportacin, rezago de la fracasada "teora
de la dependencia" que consideraba imprescindible exportar bienes con "valor
agregado", limita, a su vez, el valor de los troncos al pequeo mercado
interno. Liberalizar la exportacin eliminara el contrabando y elevara el
precio de la madera al nivel internacional. Acaso esto aumentara la
deforestacin? No. Los bajos precios actuales destruyen el inters de
preservar el bosque y eliminan toda inversin en reforestar. El aumento del
precio de la madera incentivara su conservacin y eficiente explotacin.  
<p>
        En una economa libre es el propietario el ms interesado en
preservar sus bosques. Incluso hoy, las depredaciones ms severas las sufren
los Parques Nacionales, que al ser de todos no son de nadie. Intensificar
las regulaciones y controles como proponen legisladores y burcratas
paraguayos no slo agravar la deforestacin sino tambin el desempleo y la
miseria. 
<p>
        Los bosques nativos, alrededor del 10% del territorio paraguayo,
deberan declararse por ley "no aptos" para la reforma agraria. Frenar la
deforestacin requiere derogar las leyes ambientales y las restricciones al
comercio de troncos, restableciendo la propiedad privada. Nadie mejor que su
dueo cuida lo suyo.

<TITLE>Falcoff: LatinoAmerica Vista Desde Washington -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<BODY  bgcolor="#FFFFFF"background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LATINOAMERICA VISTA DESDE WASHINGTON</H2>
Mark Falcoff*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Para Amrica Latina, las noticias de nuestra campaa
presidencial son buenas y malas. Por segunda vez, en muchos aos, el tpico
de la regin no es decisivo, pero a la vez no hay razones particulares para
que los latinoamericanos teman, deseen la victoria o la derrota de uno de
los candidatos.
<dd>
Se trata de un viejo problema en las relaciones hemisfricas. Estados
Unidos es criticado por tomarlos demasiado en cuenta ("intervenir") o por
abandonar a Amrica Latina. En esta ocasin la ausencia de debate sobre
Amrica Latina podra verse como una seal positiva, por haberse alcanzado
un consenso respecto a la regin en cuanto a "democracia, libre mercado y
mayor intercambio comercial".
<dd>
Pero quedan asuntos pendientes. El primero es la expansin del TLC/NAFTA.
Chile ya debera pertenecer. Esa era la intencin de la administracin
Clinton hasta que colaps el peso mexicano. Mientras Mxico no se recupere
econmicamente (y vuelva a consumir inmensas cantidades de productos
estadounidenses) ser difcil que algn presidente de este pas arriesgue
capital poltico haciendo avanzar el proceso de integracin.
<dd>
Los latinoamericanos estn sorprendidos de lo sucedido con Chile, pas que
ha debido preceder a Mxico. Pero para la mayora de estadounidenses Mxico
representa el hemisferio; pocos han ido ms al sur. Los fracasos de Mxico
han sido proyectados a toda la regin. Eso es injusto y por ello Brasil y
Argentina tendrn que esperar entre cuatro y ocho aos. Lo positivo es que
ello ha ayudado a acelerar la integracin regional. La prxima vez que un
presidente de Estados Unidos decida patrocinar a un nuevo miembro del
TLC/NAFTA bien podra ser Mercosur.
<dd>
El nico candidato antilatinoamericano fue Pat Buchanan en las primarias
republicanas, quien gan en apenas un estado. Aunque las corrientes
contrarias al libre comercio persisten en ambos partidos, la tendencia es
favorable a Amrica Latina.
<dd>
El asunto de las drogas es ms conflictivo, pero esto tampoco cambiar
mucho segn el ocupante de la Casa Blanca. El argumento de la legalizacin,
elocuentemente presentado por personas con las ms variadas posiciones
polticas, no ha calado. Y la controversia encuentra su centro de gravedad
en el proceso de certificacin, a travs del cual el Departamento de Estado
cumple con el ritual anual de informar al Congreso y al presidente sobre las
naciones latinoamericanas que estn haciendo todo lo posible para combatir
la produccin y el despacho de drogas ilegales. No hay que ser muy cnico
para dudar que ese proceso de certificacin tenga algo que ver con el mundo
real.
<dd>
Andrs Oppenheimer lo explica muy bien en su ltimo libro. Poco antes de
las eleccin de Zedillo, la polica federal mexicana incaut 8 toneladas en
un jet Caravelle que hizo un aterrizaje de emergencia. Seis toneladas
desaparecieron y parte de los mismos paquetes fueron incautados por las
autoridades de Estados Unidos en la frontera. Aparentemente, el decomiso de
2 toneladas fue cantidad suficiente para ganarle a Mxico la certificacin
ese ao. Es una decisin significativa ante la descertificacin de Colombia
y la suspensin de la visa al presidente Samper, lo cual ha sido
profundamente traumtico para los colombianos, ya que la descertificacin
conlleva modestas pero altamente simblicas sanciones comerciales.
<dd>
La tercera cuestin pendiente es la inmigracin, algo muy complejo y
emocional. Algunas naciones dependen del dinero que remiten desde Estados
Unidos a familiares. No es probable que Mxico, por ejemplo, hubiera
sobrevivido el colapso financiero sin el dinero enviado a familiares desde
aqu. Otro dramtico ejemplo es el de la dispora salvadorea.
<dd>
La posicin latinoamericana respecto a la inmigracin es prudente y moral.
Muchos pases insisten que la inmigracin es un derecho humano universal.
As piensa Mxico, pero sin respetarle tal derecho a los guatemaltecos. Por
el contrario, la posicin de Estados Unidos ha sido irracional y poco
realista. No hay consenso nacional sobre el tema. La Proposicin 187 y la
legislacin patrocinada por republicanos para negar educacin y dems
servicios pblicos a nios ilegales son absurdas ante el hecho que el pas
no est dispuesto a hacer deportaciones masivas. La tarea es integrar a los
indocumentados, especialmente a sus hijos. Si los costos parecen
prohibitivos ahora, sern mucho mayores en el futuro. El tema, sin embargo,
no ha sido seriamente discutido en la campaa electoral.
<dd>
Indudablemente que el fantasma de la intervencin en Hait acosar al
prximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca porque el presidente Ren Preval no tiene
fuerza para imponer decisiones econmicas cruciales. Un mnimo de orden
pblico depende de la presencia de las fuerzas de la ONU, las cuales se
retirarn en uno o dos aos.
<dd>
El PRI bien puede perder las elecciones legislativas en Mxico y, en
cualquier caso, el sistema poltico mexicano enfrenta cambios fundamentales.
Por otra parte, Castro puede decidir vengarse de la Ley Helms-Burton
lanzando flotillas de balseros si no este verano, el ao que viene.
<dd>
Prximamente los estadounidenses tendrn que negociar un nuevo tratado con
Panam, permitiendo que permanezcan tropas all. Bajo el Tratado
Carter-Torrijos de 1978, todas las fuerzas militares estadounidenses deben
marcharse antes del fin del siglo. Los panameos que antes estaban ansiosos
de salir de los gringos han decidido ahora que su presencia es una pliza de
seguro que atrae inversiones y capital extranjero. Estados Unidos, por su
parte, tendr que decidir si quiere la responsabilidad de asegurar la
estabilidad poltica panamea.
<dd>
En conclusin, habr mucho en la agenda latinoamericana de la nueva
administracin. Quizs es positivo que estos temas no se politicen durante
la campaa.

<h2>
LA ARGENTINA DESPUES DE CAVALLO
</h2>     
Mark Falcoff*<P>
<BR>
WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Pocos funcionarios en la historia de Amrica Latina han
gozado de la reputacin internacional -y del poder interno- de Domingo
Cavallo, hasta hace poco ministro de Economa. Con su salida comienza una
nueva era en la poltica argentina.
<P>
 Durante 5  6 aos, el equipo Menem-Cavallo tuvo extraordinario xito no
slo en frenar una inflacin galopante sino en restaurar la confianza
internacional respecto a la economa argentina. Ello suministr un cojn
poltico no disfrutado antes por ningn otro gobierno en la Argentina y
Menem al centrar su campaa por la reeleccin del ao pasado en la
estabilidad monetaria logr aumentar en dos puntos, a 51%, su participacin
en el voto popular. Hoy, las encuestas sealan una aprobacin por Menem de
apenas 20%.
<P>
 Cmo el poltico ms exitoso en la Argentina desde Pern (fundador de su
partido) ha sufrido tan dramtica cada en la aprobacin popular? La
contestacin corta es que los argentinos dan como un hecho la estabilidad
monetaria y ahora tienen prioridades diferentes, como el desempleo que
alcanza marcas sin precedentes. Otros asuntos preocupan tambin, como el
alto costo de la vida, la criminalidad y un sistema judicial corrupto e
ineficiente. Los argentinos quieren un gobierno ms serio, algo
aparentemente imposible para Menem.
<P>
 Rumores de corrupcin hacen muy difcil la labor del nuevo ministro de
Economa. La actitud general parece ser que si el gobierno roba y derrocha
los recursos, porqu voy a pagar impuestos? Esta reaccin explica en parte
la cada masiva de recursos anunciada por el sucesor de Cavallo, Roque
Fernndez, en su primer discurso televisado.
<P>
 El primer reto del pobre Fernndez es explicar a los argentinos que el
dficit fiscal es mucho mayor que el anunciado por Cavallo, el cual
alcanzar este ao $6.600 millones (un peso = un dlar). Para reducirlo, el ministro 
anunci una serie de nuevos impuestos, la rebaja del ingreso sujeto
al impuesto sobre la renta y la extensin a 65 aos para que las mujeres
sean pensionadas. Peor todava, Fernndez anunci aranceles a repuestos y
equipos que reducirn la rentabilidad de muchas de las fbricas modernas.
<P>
 Tales medidas draconianas que reducirn el nivel de vida de la aporreada
clase media se presentan como necesarias en la defensa de la paridad
peso/dlar, pero as slo podemos esperar ms de lo mismo: ningn incremento
en el empleo ni reactivacin econmica. Por ello muchos peronistas se estn
distanciando de Fernndez y del presidente Menem.
<P>
 Sin embargo, la oposicin sigue dividida. La tradicional oposicin al
peronismo ha sido la Unin Cvica Radical, pero los argentinos recuerdan la
hiperinflacin sufrida durante la administracin del presidente radical Ral
Alfonsn (1983-1989), la cual lo oblig a renunciar con siete meses de
anticipacin al trmino de su perodo. Para horror de los radicales,
Alfonsn inform a la prensa en agosto que no haba abandonado totalmente la
idea de candidatearse nuevamente.
<P>
 La esperanza radical es el nuevo alcalde de Buenos Aires, donde vive un
tercio de la poblacin del pas. Fernando de la Rua, elegido en julio,
disfruta de 63% de aprobacin en las encuestas. El fue congresista por ms
de 20 aos y tiene reputacin de hombre decente y honrado, algo raro en la
poltica argentina. Pero no le gusta arriesgarse ni tomar decisiones
difciles y ser retado por dos miembros del ala izquierda de su partido,
Rodolfo Terragno (actual presidente del partido) y el congresista Federico
Storani.
<P>
 Desde 1993 surgi una tercera fuerza izquierdista con Frepaso, cuyo
candidato presidencial en 1995, Jos Octavio Bordn, qued en segundo lugar.
Pero en la eleccin del alcalde de Buenos Aires obtuvieron resultados
decepcionantes y Bordn anunci su retiro de la poltica. Frepaso no es un
partido sino una coalicin de grupos disimilares unidos en contra del statu
quo y actualmente organiza una serie de apagones, bocinazos y cacerolazos.
 Argentina ha sufrido una cada en su nivel de vida en los ltimos dos aos
y la oposicin comparte el odio hacia Menem, su familia, sus allegados y sus
polticas econmicas. La esperanza de que un inmenso influjo de inversiones
extranjeras absorberan el desempleo generado por las privatizaciones no se
ha hecho realidad. No sucedi porque muchos de esos ex empleados pblicos no
son capaces de convertirse en trabajadores productivos. Durante 50 aos el
objetivo del gobierno fue el pleno empleo aun con el deterioro de los
sueldos. El sistema educacional es obsoleto y no est preparado para formar
trabajadores en la era de la computacin.
<P>
 Menem ha sido presidente por siete aos, por ms tiempo que cualquier otro
excepto Pern. Duerme largas siestas y toma extensas vacaciones en el
exterior. Apenas aparece la oportunidad de un viaje sale con 100
acompaantes. Sin embargo, en el pasado ha sorprendido tanto a amigos como a
enemigos con su capacidad de enfocar y dominar situaciones difciles. Tendr
que repetirlo pronto, si es que piensa dejar una buena situacin cuando
termine su mandato dentro de tres aos. &copy;

<title>QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL? -- 11/14/96</title>

<h2>QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL?
</h2>
Mark Falcoff*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En octubre los brasileos votarn por alcaldes y
miembros de los concejos municipales, siendo estas elecciones la primera
prueba confrontada por Fernando Henrique Cardoso desde que fue electo
presidente hace dos aos. Tambin ser una indicacin de apoyo o rechazo a
su anunciado programa de liberalizacin y reforma econmica.
<P>
Dos hechos ayudan a comprender mejor al Brasil. Uno es su parecido con
Estados Unidos respecto al tamao, autonoma propia, concentracin en sus
asuntos internos, con culturas e idiomas diferentes al resto de Amrica. En
ninguna otra nacin latinoamericana se oye a la gente hablar acerca de su
pas como un gran poder del futuro. Lo mismo que los estadounidenses, los
brasileos tienen que buscar la manera de reinventar su gobierno.
<p>
A pesar de mltiples problemas, las estadsticas brasileas son
impresionantes, comenzando con que es la novena economa ms grande del
mundo. Su comercio internacional alcanz casi $80.000 millones en 1995,
colocndolo en el lugar N 23. Sus recursos naturales son imn de
inversiones extranjeras.
<p>
El tipo de centrismo poltico representado por Cardoso (culturalmente de
izquierda, pero econmicamente ligeramente a la derecha del centro) se
parece algo a la posicin del presidente Clinton. No es de extraar,
entonces, que hayan hecho buena amistad, lo mismo que sus esposas, quienes
son activistas polticas.
<p>
Cardoso a la fecha ha tenido un xito modesto. Su credibilidad poltica se
seguir basando en el xito del Plan Real que en efecto liga la moneda
brasilea al dlar. Tambin logr la promulgacin de la mejor ley protectora
de la propiedad intelectual en la regin. Pero las reformas cruciales a los
impuestos, a la asistencia y seguro social siguen esperando laaprobacin del
Congreso.
<p>
A lo contrario del resto del hemisferio, el presidente brasileo es
relativamente dbil frente a un Congreso extraordinariamente poderoso. Y los
legisladores reflejan fielmente la extrema diversidad de ese inmenso pas,
por lo que en ausencia de un partido poderoso y disciplinado es muy difcil
alcanzar el consenso. Adems, la nueva Constitucin es un documento difcil
que imposibilita la efectividad gubernamental. Qu otra Constitucin
reglamenta el tiempo del descanso para tomar caf en las industrias? Al
supervisar todo aspecto de la vida econmica y social de la nacin, requiere
enmiendas constitucionales para cualquier cambio significativo. Hasta que se
logren algunas alteraciones es imposible permitir la participacin privada y
extranjera en petrleo, minera, electricidad y telecomunicaciones.
<p>
Los mismos obstculos se aplican a la eficiencia de los servicios pblicos
y a la privatizacin del Seguro Social. Pero sin esas reformas corre peligro
el Plan Real y un retorno a la hiperinflacin liquidara lo que queda del
poder poltico de Cardoso, a la vez que tendra catastrficos efectos tanto
para el Brasil como para sus vecinos.
<p>
La salud econmica del Brasil en gran medida determina el bienestar, no
slo de pases pequeos como Uruguay y Paraguay, sino tambin el de naciones
medianas como Argentina, Colombia y Per. Slo Venezuela, con sus masivas
reservas petroleras, sobrevivira el colapso de Brasil.
<p>
La importancia econmica de Brasil se manifiesta en el xito de Mercosur,
una rea de libre comercio que ya se extiende a Argentina, Paraguay y
Uruguay. Desde el colapso del peso mexicano y la paralizacin del TLC/NAFTA
hasta Chile ha aplicado para ingresar a Mercosur.
<p>
Pero las instituciones polticas brasileas se mantienen curiosamente
rezagadas en un pas que avanza en otros frentes. Las elecciones municipales
no son determinantes de las polticas nacionales, pero se consideran buen
termmetro del sentimiento nacional. Sin embargo, como lo indica Alexandre
Barros, los votantes que favorecen mayor desregulacin y ms privatizaciones
pueden castigar a la administracin Cardoso por su lentitud en esos campos.
Pero Barros tambin cree que los electores que quieren mayor intervencin
estatal tambin castigarn a un gobierno que perciben como neoliberal.
"Cara, yo gano", dice Barros, "sello, tu pierdes".
<p>
Es difcil evaluar las tendencias en un pas con una sociedad tan diversa y
rudimentaria. Pero a lo contrario de sus vecinos, los brasileos no optan
por soluciones extremistas. Eso le da al Brasil un aire superficial de
calma, aun cuando el crimen se dispara y la brecha entre ricos y pobres
sigue siendo inmensa.
<p>
El verdadero problema es que mientras la comunidad poltica brasilea no
est dispuesta a tomar decisiones difciles acerca de las reformas
econmicas, el pas puede perder su mnima estabilidad monetaria, de la que
depende tanto su poblacin como sus vecinos.

<title>Friedman: HONG KONG VERSUS BUCHANAN -- 5/16/96</title>

<h2>
HONG KONG VERSUS BUCHANAN
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Milton Friedman*
</a>

<P>
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA (AIPE).- La experiencia de Hong Kong contradice el
falso dogma de Pat Buchanan de que el proteccionismo beneficia a los
trabajadores y promueve el crecimiento econmico.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poco despus de la Segunda Guerra, al mismo tiempo que Gran Bretaa
instrumentaba polticas socialistas, una de sus ltimas colonias -Hong Kong-
daba un vuelco hacia el total libre mercado, iniciando un experimento
ilustrativo de los resultados opuestos producidos por el mercado libre y el
mercado controlado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por algn accidente de carcter oficial, la oficina colonial britnica
design a John Cowperthwaite, un escocs estudioso de Adam Smith, como
secretario financiero de Hong Kong. A las polticas de libre mercado de
Cowperthwaite se les acredita haber producido el milagro econmico que
condujo a un fenomenal crecimiento del nivel de vida promedio, a pesar de
que la poblacin se multiplic diez veces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es difcil concebir un reto ms severo a las polticas de libre mercado.
Hong Kong es una isla pobre en recursos naturales ms all de su gran
puerto. Cuando los comunistas se aduearon de China, olas de refugiados
llegaban huyendo slo con las posesiones que podan cargar. Ellos y los que
los siguieron produjeron un rpido incremento de la poblacin. Hong Kong
prcticamente no recibi ayuda extranjera para asimilar a estas hordas de
refugiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a estas adversas circunstancias, la salvacin de Hong Kong han sido
sus polticas de libre comercio y libre mercado, basados en ningn arancel a
las importaciones ni ningn subsidio u otro tipo de privilegio concedido a
las exportaciones. Las muy pocas restricciones que se han impuesto, como el
acuerdo sobre textiles multifibras, se deben a presiones aplicadas por
Estados Unidos y algunos otros pases. Pero no se fijan los precios ni los
salarios; hay mnimas restricciones al inicio de actividades comerciales y
tanto los gastos del gobierno como los impuestos se han mantenido bajos. La
tasa tope del impuesto personal a las rentas es 25%, con un promedio mximo
de 15%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las condiciones eran ttricas al principio, pero rpidamente comenzaron a
mejorar y han seguido mejorando hasta hoy. Para 1960, el Producto Interno
Bruto per cpita (en precios de 1995) era de $2.247, o sea menos de una
tercera parte del de Gran Bretaa entonces, que era de $7.906. Para 1994 la
situacin se haba revertido. El ingreso per cpita en Hong Kong se haba
multiplicado casi por ocho, hasta alcanzar $17.832 y era ya 30% superior al
de Gran Bretaa, el cual alcanzaba $13.340. Realmente un milagro econmico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es irnico que la colonia floreci, a pesar de todas las circunstancias
adversas, al seguir polticas diametralmente opuestas a la de su madre
patria, mientras Inglaterra permaneca estancada. El Instituto Fraser del
Canad acaba de publicar una clasificacin, segn la libertad econmica, de
ms de cien pases en 1995. Hong Kong est en primer puesto; Estados Unidos
en el cuarto y Gran Bretaa en el sexto. Ms sorprendente an es que el
ingreso per cpita de Hong Kong es apenas 5% ms bajo que el de Estados Unidos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Qu contraste con la experiencia de casi todas las ex colonias britnicas
que obtuvieron su libertad despus de la Segunda Guerra. Y qu estupenda
prueba de que el libre comercio y el libre mercado favorecen mucho ms a la
gente comn y corriente que el "proteccionismo" del Sr. Buchanan o el "justo
intercambio" del presidente Clinton. La "justicia comercial" depende de
quin la mire, mientras que el veredicto del libre comercio est en manos
del mercado. Por algo la palabra "libre" aparece mencionada tres veces en
nuestra Declaracin de Independencia y una vez en la primera enmienda
constitucional, al igual que la palabra "libertad". Pero la palabra "justo"
no aparece en ninguno de esos documentos redactados por nuestros prceres.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, el milagro de Hong Kong va a ser seriamente daado si no
destruido cuando los comunistas le pongan la mano el ao prximo.

<h2>
VENEZUELA Y LA PRIVATIZACION
</h2>

Oscar Garca M.*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Para que en Venezuela podamos vivir en un Estado de
derecho, con una economa libre de mercado, el gobierno debe despojarse de
las empresas industriales, comerciales y bancarias. En sus manos no
funcionan y producen prdidas en lugar de beneficios.
<dd>	Un reciente estudio indica que entre 1970 y 1995 se realizaron
transferencias fiscales de alrededor de cien mil millones de dlares a las
empresas estatales de Guayana (acero, aluminio y energa elctrica). La
magnitud de esa cifra supera nuestra capacidad de comprensin. Pero si
hacemos slo dos comparaciones nos daremos cuenta de su dimensin. La
capitalizacin burstil, de la totalidad de las compaas que se cotizan en
la Bolsa de Valores de Caracas, a mayo de 1996, es de cinco mil   millones
de dlares, aproximadamente. O sea, que con esos cien mil millones de
dlares se hubiesen podido comprar 20 veces todas las acciones de todas las
compaas inscritas (las de Venezolana de Cementos, La Electricidad de
Caracas, Banco Provincial, Sivensa, Manpa, Mantex, etc.). Inslito, no es
verdad?
<dd>	Otra comparacin: al cierre de abril de 1996, la totalidad de los depsitos
en los bancos, tanto pblicos como privados, ascenda a 6.945 mil millones
de dlares. Esos cien mil millones en transferencias equivalen a ms de 14
veces los depsitos de la banca venezolana.
<dd>	Y, en qu se invirtieron? Pues en empresas que hoy da muy poco valen
(pues sus prdidas son inmensas y su ineficiencia proverbial), pero
sirvieron y sirven para algo mucho ms importante, apoyar al sistema de
privilegios, favores, ddivas y quin sabe cuntas cosas ms en que se basa
el sistema poltico venezolano.
<dd>	Al privatizarse esas empresas que los polticos denominan "bsicas y
estratgicas" casi como por acto de magia desaparecern las transferencias
y, ms importante an, se comenzar a tener un grupo de empresas productivas
y se estimular el mercado de capitales.
<dd>	Este punto es de especial importancia. En Venezuela no hay medios
suficientes de canalizacin de los ahorros. Si hoy fuera aprobada una Ley de
Fondo de Pensiones similar a la instituida en Chile hace 15 aos, con gran
xito y en beneficio de los trabajadores, habra mucha dificultad en poder
colocar esos fondos en el sector privado y podra el gobierno con facilidad
caer en la tentacin de absorberlos para continuar financiando sus dficit.
<dd>	Un ejemplo de la bondad de la inversin en privatizaciones: recientemente
el Sunday Times de Londres public un reportaje donde analiza las
privatizaciones inglesas y afirma que si alguien invirti 1.000 libras
esterlinas en cada una de las 20 mayores privatizaciones, tendra hoy da
una cartera con un valor de 140.000 libras esterlinas. Lo cual es una muy
buena ganancia. El promedio de retorno de las compaas privatizadas es de
599%, que supera al promedio del Financial Times que fue para el mismo
perodo de 354%.
<dd>	La privatizacin es buena para todos, pero resulta muy difcil superar los
obstculos polticos y an ms los personales y partidistas de sus
opositores. Poco a poco la opinin pblica impulsar esos cambios.&copy

<TITLE>Garcia: VeNezuela: Petroleo y Miseria -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>VENEZUELA: PETROLEO Y MISERIA</H2>
Oscar Garca M.*<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace slo 14 aos, en 1982, el venezolano que tena un
billete de 500 bolvares en el bolsillo poda cambiarlo en cualquier banco
por $116,28. Ahora ese mismo billete de 500 bolvares apenas vale $1,05,
menos de cien veces. Este proceso de devaluacin e inflacin resulta
inexplicable en un pas dotado de una riqueza petrolera casi sin fin. El
petrleo no fue sembrado, como hace 60 aos propuso hacer Arturo Uslar
Pietri, en un editorial del diario Ahora. Por el contrario ha sido utilizado
para subsidiar las crisis.
<dd>
No hemos logrado con los ingresos del petrleo construir una economa
moderna y productiva. Al contrario, al haber sido manejados los recursos
petroleros por el Estado, se han malbaratado y despilfarrado de tal manera
que la Venezuela de hoy puede ser definida con dos palabras contrapuestas:
"petrleo y miseria".
<dd>
Siguen ingresando cantidades asombrosas de dinero provenientes de las
exportaciones petroleras -para este ao ms de $20.000 millones-, lo cual
sera ms que suficiente para 23 millones de habitantes que slo importan
bienes y servicios por alrededor de $8.000 millones. Pero el  nivel de
pobreza alcanza  80% de la poblacin. Un absurdo imperdonable.
<dd>
El Estado recibe los ingresos y en lugar de utilizarlos para sentar las
bases de un crecimiento sostenido, los despilfarra en una enorme burocracia
ineficiente, una industria estatizada y un aparato clientelar.
<dd>
Aunque los ingresos petroleros seran ms que suficientes para cubrir las
necesidades financieras del gobierno, a nuestros polticos les resultan
insuficientes y el Estado recurre al incremento en los impuestos para cubrir
infinitas necesidades. Los impuestos son un mal necesario, pues destruyen
riqueza, extinguen incentivos y deben ser siempre usados para gastos
estrictamente necesarios: la seguridad (que no hay), justicia (casi
inexistente), defensa, relaciones internacionales, educacin y salud.
<dd>
En casi todos esos rubros los gobiernos venezolanos no han sido capaces de
prestar servicios razonables; al contrario, han hecho colapsar algunos que
en su momento fueron tolerables.
<dd>
Ahora, cuando el mundo entero est de regreso y ha sido ampliamente
comprobado que las altas tasas impositivas, en lugar de aumentar, reducen
los ingresos fiscales, se empea nuestro gobierno en aumentar fuertemente
las cargas a una poblacin ya exhausta.
<dd>
El impuesto inflacionario que ha azotado a los venezolanos entre 1976 y
1995 es de 9.494%. El impuesto inflacionario desde 1994 a mayo de 1996 es de
288,59%. La inflacin genera una transferencia de riquezas tremendamente
injusta, especialmente de los ms dbiles y pobres al gobierno. Los ms
ricos se protegen de la inflacin con inversiones inmobiliarias y cuentas en
el extranjero.
<dd>
Los ingresos petroleros de Venezuela han continuado aumentando y por
diversas circunstancias seguirn hacindolo, facilitando a los polticos
postergar reformas estructurales fundamentales y necesarias, como lo son la
creacin del Estado de derecho y las esencialsimas privatizaciones. 
<dd>
La voluntad poltica para realizar cambios estructurales bajo la anunciada
Agenda Venezuela ya comienza a flaquear, segn el propio ministro de
Planificacin Teodoro Petkoff. De ser as, la Venezuela del futuro seguir
siendo la misma de hoy: mucho petrleo y mucha miseria.
<dd>
Para cambiar y prosperar -y puede lograrse esto con relativa rapidez- es
necesario reducir el tamao del Estado privatizando, dejando en manos de la
iniciativa privada el manejo del aparato productivo del pas. Este proceso,
aparentemente traumtico para quienes han vivido tantos aos bajo ambientes
populistas e intervencionistas, es la solucin tanto de corto como de largo
plazo, que permitir bajar la inflacin, crear empleos y desarrollar la
productividad, devolvindole as a la nacin venezolana su optimismo y
bienestar.

COLERA Y EL IMPERIALISMO SANITARIO

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

<P>
LIMA (AIPE).- En enero de 1991 se declar una epidemia de clera en el Per
que le cost la vida a cerca de 20.000 personas en cinco aos y afect a
otras 310.000. La epidemia se propag por 14 pases del continente americano
hasta llegar a convertirse, segn la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud, en la
sptima pandemia ms letal de este siglo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Pese a su virulencia, las causas de esta epidemia han estado rodeadas de
un sospechoso misterio. Generalmente se asocian con la ingestin de pescado
contaminado en algunos puertos peruanos del Pacfico, especficamente
Chimbote y Chancay, donde empez la epidemia. Se sealan como causas tambin
la insuficiencia de servicios de agua potable y defectos en la red que la
provee.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ello no obstante, las ms recientes investigaciones revelan un hecho
aterrador. Al parecer, la causa del clera fue la reduccin de la cantidad
de cloro en el agua dispuesta por el gobierno peruano como consecuencia de
los consejos de la Agencia de Proteccin Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA,
por sus siglas en ingls).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Segn un informe de la Organizacin Panamericana de la Salud,
aparentemente se habra reducido a 0,2 miligramos por litro la cantidad de
cloro que los acueductos peruanos aadan al agua. El promedio internacional
ponderado es de 0,3 miligramos por litro. Como el Per no se encuentra en la
media de salubridad y su infraestructura sanitaria es deficiente, el nivel
ptimo hubiera estado ms bien entre 0,35 y 0,4 miligramos por litro. Sin
embargo, como los grupos ecolgicos han persuadido a la EPA de que el cloro
causa cncer, especialmente cuando se descompone en trialometanos al
contacto con materia orgnica, la autoridades estadounidenses recomiendan
una reduccin del cloro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tratando de colocarse a la vanguardia de la tecnologa, los burcratas
peruanos habran seguido la recomendacin de los ambientalistas durante
1990, creando una reduccin de la barrera qumica contra las enfermedades en
el agua potable, de suerte que en enero de 1991 se declar la epidemia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Aparentemente lo que sucedi fue que los funcionarios peruanos quisieron
ponerse en la moda ecolgica y convirtieron en "verde" el agua potable. Pero
era el verde de la contaminacin. El verde del clera. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata, pues, de una lamentable y trgica negligencia que va a dar lugar
a mltiples escndalos. De hecho existe una inexcusable irresponsabilidad de
los funcionarios peruanos que mancha con un crimen ms al gobierno de Alan
Garca. Pero es tambin cierto que la responsabilidad de las autoridades
norteamericanas se hace inocultable, al extremo de abrirse posibilidades de
que los familiares de los muertos por el clera enjuicien al gobierno
norteamericano para conseguir una justa indemnizacin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La EPA se convertira as en responsable de uno de los genocidios ms
grandes de la historia del continente americano; el cual, vista la
persistente campaa que ella hace para suprimir el cloro del agua en Estados
Unidos y otros pases del mundo, se convierte en una trgica advertencia. La
comunidad internacional no puede permitir que la demagogia y la
irresponsabilidad ecologista destruyan los precarios logros de la salubridad
pblica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Este caso es, ciertamente, una tragedia, pero ensea cmo las inadecuadas
recomendaciones de los ecologistas pueden hacer dao, al extremo de condenar
a muerte a decenas de miles de personas. Los prejuicios ideolgicos pueden
convertirse fcilmente en armas letales cuando se convierten en regulaciones
pblicas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Probablemente el cloro tiene ciertos riesgos, pero un anlisis de
costo/beneficio no puede hacerse en este caso entre el cncer y el no cncer
solamente, sino entre el cncer y el clera. No vaya a ser que por pretender
alcanzar un futuro "polticamente correcto" regresemos al ms aterrador de
los pasados.

<h2>
MANUAL DE IDIOTAS
</h2>

Enrique Ghersi*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Todo empez en el bar del hotel don Pancho de Benidorm, en el
sur de Espaa. Las Primeras Jornadas Liberales Iberoamericanas organizadas
en Espaa por el peruano Fernando Iwasaki haban convocado a un grupo de
intelectuales para discutir sobre la situacin de la libertad en el mundo.
Al final de los debates, cuando un grupo liderado por Plinio Apuleyo
Mendoza, Carlos Alberto Montaner y Alvaro Vargas Llosa miraba la televisin,
el noticiero dio cuenta de que el futbolista argentino Diego Maradona, de
visita en Cuba, se haba proclamado admirador y partidario acrrimo de Fidel
Castro.
<dd>	Apenas se inform de ello, Plinio estall en furia. Carlos Alberto calcul,
casi de inmediato, los millones de dlares que Maradona poda haberse
embolsado con este golpe de efecto. Y Alvaro, ms agresivo an, sostuvo la
necesidad de despegar de inmediato una campaa internacional dirigida a
denunciar los excesos de la intelligentsia latinoamericana, en el supuesto
asaz dudoso de que el futbolista la integrase.
<dd>	La primera vez que o la frase fue cuando, hastiado ya por la indignacin,
Montaner sostuvo que el futbolista era el prototipo del "idiota
latinoamericano". Esa especie de bpedo impune capaz de sostener sin el
menor reparo la verdad de perogrullo o trivialidad de moda, a cambio de
aparentar ser una persona informada y seria.
<dd>	Hoy los tres escritores nos ofrecen una versin, polmica y apasionada de
este problema con su "Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano" que,
publicado por Plaza & Janes, acaba de ser presentado en diferentes capitales
del continente por una gira trashumante de los autores.
<dd>	La intelectualidad latinoamericana ha estado influenciada por los
arquetipos. Renunciando a su creatividad y no queriendo ver sus indudables
aportes, el tpico intelectual de nuestro continente es aquel que se conduce
por la moda europea, al abrigo del temperamento norteamericano y con la
reminiscencia tnica suficiente. Este personaje recorre nuestra historia sin
el menor inters por la realidad. Slo se fija en el prejuicio, generalmente
el suyo propio, sentenciando a cada rato una media verdad en torno de la
cual construye un conjunto de falsas proposiciones.
<dd>	Domina la sociologa. Sabe antropologa y economa. Escribe versos y es
oportunista. Nuestro idiota es un personaje admirado y temido. Su opinin
predomina en los crculos acadmicos, resulta apreciada en los polticos y
remunerada en los empresariales. Todo perfectamente contradictorio con su
presumida modestia. Hace ya tiempo que se necesitaba un detenido estudio de
tan notable fenmeno.
<dd>	El "Manual" es un libro de combate, llamado a crear polmica y a refutar
-con sarcasmo y aguda crtica- los lugares comunes y las verdades de
perogrullo ms usuales de la intelectualidad latinoamericana.
<dd>	Primero cataloga errores. Luego los formaliza, exponindolos suscintamente
a fin de refutarlos a continuacin. Posteriormente derriba mitos sin dejar
ttere con cabeza, incluidos Gustavo Gutirrez, Eduardo Galleano y Jos
Carlos Maritegui. Finalmente, con gran irona, presenta los diez libros ms
ledos por el "idiota" y una impresionante galera de medias verdades, por
la que desfilan frases de lo ms graneado de nuestras elites, incluidos
Mario Vargas Llosa y los tres mismos autores.
<dd>	En sntesis, se trata de un libro polmico fundamental para el liberalismo
finisecular en Iberoamrica que rescata, de la clsica idea del panfleto, la
indignacin y la irona como argumentos retricos de la libertad.&copy

<h2>
MALAS COPIAS DEL SISTEMA CHILENO DE PENSIONES
</h2>

Mary Anastasia O'Grady*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Cuando el "efecto tequila" hizo estragos en
Amrica Latina en 1995 y se retiraron capitales de la regin, Chile fue poco
afectado. Eso se debi en parte a su alta tasa de ahorro interno de
alrededor de 27% del PIB.
<dd>	En gran parte tan alta tasa de ahorro se debe a la reforma del sistema de
pensiones promulgado en 1980 e iniciado en 1981. Una vez que a los chilenos
se les dio el control sobre sus ahorros para el retiro, opciones sobre la
administracin e incentivos para retirarse del sistema pblico de pensiones,
la privatizacin tom vuelo. As comenz el auge del ahorro que hizo
prosperar el mercado local de capitales.
<dd>	La reforma del Seguro Social chileno tuvo tanto xito que las naciones
vecinas que sufren de bajas tasas de ahorro comenzaron a copirselo. Pero
por razones parroquianas el modelo chileno ha sido modificado en todas
partes, modificaciones que han debilitado los resultados. Aunque los
trabajadores de esos pases se han estado cambiando a sistemas de pensiones
privados, la conversin ha sido mucho ms lenta, lo cual ha conducido a los
crticos a sostener que el xito chileno se debe a la naturaleza nica de
Chile, su gente y su cultura poltica.
<dd>	Estn equivocados. La reforma funciona en todas partes y el modelo chileno
es transferible. Y ahora que las altas tasas de ahorro se han convertido en
el objetivo de los reformistas en todo el mundo, vale la pena comparar el
exitoso modelo chileno con las malas copias que han conducido a resultados
mediocres.
<dd>	El objetivo es, o debiera ser, dar las mejores pensiones al mayor nmero de
trabajadores, al menor costo posible. En Chile as se hizo al promover
cuentas individuales, cuyos beneficios reflejaran el esfuerzo individual en
ahorrar, al mismo tiempo que se promovi la competencia entre los
administradores privados de fondos. Un mercado competitivo impulsado por
ahorradores motivados gener buenos rendimientos.
<dd>	Al mismo tiempo, Chile tom los pasos necesarios para ir eliminando
paulatinamente el viejo sistema estatal de reparto, que es costoso,
ineficiente y est condenado a la insolvencia. Eso fue clave porque de otra
manera hubiera sido un freno al crecimiento econmico. Y ms importante an,
el gobierno adopt un nuevo lema: los incentivos funcionan.
<dd>	Desde 1981, todos los nuevos empleados en Chile optan por el sistema de
cuentas individuales bajo una administracin privada escogida por el
trabajador. Slo a los antiguos trabajadores se les permiti quedarse en el
sistema estatal, si as queran. El establecer una fecha de cierre para el
sistema estatal gener confianza en el nuevo sistema de capitalizacin.
<dd>	Durante la transicin a un sistema individual de capitalizacin, el
gobierno tuvo que buscar la forma de pagar obligaciones a los retirados a
medida que se reducan los ingresos del viejo sistema. Los jvenes ya no
estaban aportando las cuotas necesarias para pagar a los retirados ya que
ese dinero iba a sus cuentas individuales. El gobierno, entonces, emiti
Bonos de Reconocimiento a aquellos que ya haban contribuido, definiendo el
monto de las acreencias oficiales.
<dd>	A los trabajadores que se cambiaron para el sistema privado se les ofreci
una rebaja en la contribucin mandatoria y por ley todo el beneficio de este
recorte fue a parar a los trabajadores. Impuestos a la nmina para cubrir
pensiones, invalidez y salud que alcanzaban entre 30% y 35% en el viejo
sistema se redujeron a alrededor de 20%. Los trabajadores que se cambiaron
vieron de inmediato aumentar sus ingresos.
<dd>	Por el contrario, en Per, Colombia y la Argentina se ignor la
contradiccin que significa continuar paralelamente con el viejo sistema
estatal, dejando escoger a los trabajadores entre los dos. Algunos de los
nuevos que ingresan al mercado de trabajo optan por el sistema estatal
quebrado bajo la vieja creencia que el gobierno conseguir los fondos.
<dd>	Esos gobiernos continan drenando recursos del sector privado para
subsidiar un sistema estatal ineficiente. En la provincia de Buenos Aires
esto se hace al recolectar un impuesto a los empleadores de 12,6% para el
sistema estatal. Al mismo tiempo los empleados en el sistema privado aportan
obligatoriamente 11% para su propia pensin y pagan un impuesto de 3% que va
al sistema estatal. El resultado es una deduccin por nmina de 26,6% slo
para pensiones. Acabar con el sistema pblico sera lgicamente lo mejor.
<dd>	Originalmente el sistema peruano ofreca dos opciones desiguales. El
sistema estatal requera contribuciones de 9% del salario, 3% aportado
directamente por el trabajador y 6% por su empleador, mientras que a los
trabajadores que optaban por el sistema privado tenan que sacar de su
bolsillo 14%. Exactamente lo opuesto a lo que se haba hecho en Chile, donde
los trabajadores recibieron incentivos para cambiarse. No sorprende que
muchos peruanos dudaron cambiarse. Posteriormente Per igual las
retenciones y desde entonces no sorprende que el nmero de los que se
cambian al sistema privado ha crecido dramticamente.
<dd>	Otro error inicial en Per es el mismo cometido en Colombia, donde se le
permite a los trabajadores cambiarse de uno a otro sistema. Eso socava la
confianza en el sistema privado y retarda el crecimiento de la industria de
administracin de fondos de pensiones.
<dd>	Pero el gobierno colombiano fue an ms lejos al hacer publicidad por
televisin diciendo que el sistema privado no era confiable. En Chile, por
el contrario, el gobierno instrument una campaa de mercadeo para educar a
la gente sobre la privatizacin.
<dd>	Hoy el gobierno argentino opera su propia empresa de administracin de
fondos en competencia con el sector privado y garantiza un rendimiento. Como
en el gobierno no es necesario generar utilidades, puede subsidiar su propia
ineficiencia, gozando de injusta ventaja. A pesar de ello, el rendimiento de
la administracin gubernamental ha sido pobre y los ahorradores ms
experimentados escogen entre los administradores privados.
<dd>	El sistema chileno funcion porque sus diseadores crearon un mercado
competitivo. Para lograrlo tuvieron que limitar el papel del estado e
hicieron nfasis en la necesaria relacin entre esfuerzo y recompensa. La
gente tiende ahorrar si es motivada a hacerlo. Los chilenos, igual que el
resto de la gente, responde a los incentivos.&copy

<H2>TERRORISMO FISCAL CONTRA PRENSA MEXICANA</H2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El PRI, partido en el poder en Mxico desde hace
67 aos, est incrementando la represin sobre la sociedad para no perder el
control en las elecciones federales de 1997 y una de las armas que utiliza
son los fiscales del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
El prximo ao estarn en juego diputaciones, senaduras y gobernaciones en
diversas provincias. Existe el riesgo de que por primera vez en la historia
Mxico tenga un Congreso de oposicin, en manos del PAN, partido
conservador, lo que implicara cierto control sobre el ejercicio del poder
presidencial, hasta ahora casi absoluto. Muchos analistas polticos dan como
un hecho que la poblacin, descontenta por la crisis, ejercer el "voto de
castigo" contra el PRI.
<P>
Mientras tanto, el ministerio de Hacienda afirma que la evasin alcanza
niveles histricos y que este ao slo lograr recaudar en el impuesto al
consumo (IVA) $7.000 millones, comparado con $9.200 del ao pasado. Se trata
de una reduccin de 24%, motivada por el desempleo, las quiebras
empresariales y el deterioro del poder adquisitivo. El gobierno tendr, por
primera vez en siete aos, un dficit en el presupuesto para el prximo ao.
<P>
El PRI necesita dinero para cubrir el dficit fiscal y para ganar las
elecciones, a la vez que busca maneras de reprimir las crticas de sus
opositores. Por ello se comienzan a aplicar las viejas tcticas contra los
medios de comunicacin, para que estos no alienten el descontento popular y
deterioren la imagen del partido de cara a las elecciones. En el pasado se
les cortaba el suministro de papel a los peridicos crticos; ahora se
utiliza el terrorismo fiscal.
<P>
El lema de los terroristas en Europa es "mata a uno y atemorizars a diez
millones". El lema del Fisco en Mxico parece ser "encarcela a uno y
atemorizars a los otros". El ministerio de Hacienda ha desatado una campaa
de persecucin en contra de lderes empresariales, triplicando los
procedimientos por evasin.  El ms reciente alcanz a Juan Francisco Ealy
Ortiz, presidente y director de El Universal, el diario ms viejo de la
capital, de amplia circulacin nacional y que se ha distinguido
recientemente por mantener una lnea editorial crtica del gobierno de
Ernesto Zedillo.
<P>
Las autoridades acusan a Ealy Ortiz de evasin dolosa por $5,5 millones, de
presentar datos falsos, pagos no efectuados, declaracin de ingresos menor a
la real y cuentas bancarias que no "engranaban" en su contabilidad.
<P>
"Al seor Ealy no se le persigue por lo que dice ni por lo que escribe. Se
le persigue por lo que nos debe. No se le persigue como periodista. Se le
persigue como empresario evasor", afirma Toms Ruiz, subsecretario de
ingresos de Hacienda. Los enemigos de Ealy Ortiz aseguran que siempre fue
adulador de presidentes y beneficiario de gobiernos anteriores. Sin embargo,
para amplios sectores de la opinin pblica, se trata de un acto
autoritario, llevado a cabo con el propsito de sofocar las crticas.
<P>
Los dirigentes empresariales ms importantes del pas condenaron la orden
de aprehensin girada en contra del director de El Universal y protestaron
que fuese tratado como delincuente. El intento de captura se realiz con
lujo de prepotencia, por medio centenar de agentes judiciales que se
presentaron con armas de alto poder. "Ni siquiera en contra de
narcotraficantes despliegan esa fuerza... los contribuyentes son tratados
por el fisco peor que narcotraficantes...", coment un analista. Hacienda
dio amplia difusin y publicidad al asunto, como para que sirviera de
escarmiento general.
<P>
Los abogados defensores afirman que el gobierno ignor olmpicamente un
acuerdo de reestructuracin de adeudos fiscales que Ealy Ortiz haba firmado
meses atrs con el Fisco, lo que demostrara la arbitrariedad de los
funcionarios.
<P>
El presidente Zedillo, en su segundo informe de gobierno del 1 de
septiembre, dijo que sera aplicada "toda la fuerza del Estado" en contra de
los grupos guerrilleros. Pero lo que nunca se imaginaron los ciudadanos es
que "la fuerza del Estado" tambin sera aplicada en contra del sector
productivo. Y mucho menos que empresarios y periodistas seran tratados como
criminales y delincuentes. La pregunta en todas las mentes es quin ser el
prximo?

<title>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES
</h2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los escndalos de corrupcin, trfico de
influencias y favoritismo durante el sexenio del presidente Carlos Salinas
de Gortari han desprestigiado en Mxico lo que, en esencia, es un proceso
necesario tanto para equilibrar el presupuesto del gobierno como para elevar
la eficiencia de la economa. Las empresas estatales suelen ser monopolios y
sin competencia no hay eficiencia en la utilizacin de recursos escasos, por
lo que es necesaria su privatizacin.
<P>
Los idelogos de izquierda, enemigos de todo aquello que huela a libertad
econmica y gobierno limitado, han sabido aprovechar la situacin para
confundir a la opinin pblica y tratar de detener las reformas. Identificar
al mercantilismo como una consecuencia inevitable de la privatizacin es la
bandera enarbolada por muchos polticos pristas y lderes sindicales que
ven en las privatizaciones, la competencia y el libre mercado una amenaza a
sus intereses y privilegios.
<p>
En Mxico hoy todo es culpa del "neoliberalismo": la marginacin, la
pobreza, el desempleo, la destruccin ecolgica, la delincuencia. "Esta
forma de conducir el debate... es sumamente inconveniente e indebida... es
caer en una especie de oscurantismo; en la Edad media todos los males que
impedan el avance se los atribuan al Diablo y decan que por el Diablo
estaban mal las cosas... todo lo malo era culpa del Diablo; no se explicaban
en trminos de la falta de trabajo, de la falta de iniciativa, de la
prohibicin que haba para explotar las ideas... quienes etiquetan un
conjunto de polticas por medio de un calificativo como el de "neoliberal",
cometen el mismo error", dijo el presidente Ernesto Zedillo en una entrevista.
<p>
La verdad es que apartando la retrica demaggica, la venta de empresas
estatales es el mecanismo idneo para transformar ramas enteras de actividad
y mejorar la situacin econmica de familias y trabajadores. As lo
comprueba la privatizacin de la industria siderrgica mexicana. A partir de
su venta al sector privado en 1991, el desempeo de la industria mejor
notablemente.
<p>
"La reorganizacin administrativa de las empresas acereras, la
modernizacin de sus plantas, la reduccin de los problemas laborales, el
aumento de las exportaciones y los montos de inversin realizados en los
ltimos aos, ejemplifican cmo una industria que en algn momento se
consider vieja, de bajo rendimiento y condenada a un deterioro permanente,
puede desarrollar un gran potencial a partir del esfuerzo de sus
propietarios y trabajadores, en un ambiente de intensa competencia local y
con el resto del mundo", afirma un estudio del CEESP.
<p>
Como casi todas las reas industriales que permanecen por largo tiempo en
manos del gobierno, la industria siderrgica fue dejada prcticamente en
ruinas. A pesar de que las siderrgicas oficiales reciban grandes
subsidios, crditos "blandos", fuertes descuentos en la compra de materias
primas, proteccin frente a competidores extranjeros, tanto los ndices de
productividad como los mrgenes de utilidad eran muy bajos, los conflictos
laborales iban en aumento y la calidad del producto dejaba mucho que desear.
<p>
Los sntomas eran los mismos sufridos por todas las paraestatales:
tecnologa obsoleta,  la falta de mantenimiento aumentaba el nmero de
accidentes y reduca la produccin. Haba una plantilla laboral excesiva: la
industria siderrgica paraestatal empleaba a 40 mil obreros para producir
7,5 millones de toneladas de acero, lo que daba una relacin de 190
toneladas por ao/hombre, contra 270 toneladas en Estados Unidos,  459
toneladas en Japn y 677 toneladas en Corea del Sur. La poltica de control
de precios aplicada por las autoridades descapitaliz a la industria y el
gobierno tuvo que declarar en quiebra a Fundidora Monterrey, una de las ms
importantes.
<p>
Para ser rescatada, se requera invertir $2,500 millones y en agosto de
1990 fue anunciada su privatizacin. A diferencia de lo que ocurri en otros
casos, el gobierno no busc obtener el precio mximo garantizndole conceder
un monopolio a un selecto grupo de inversionistas privilegiados sino que se
preocup realmente por modernizar la industria. Las empresas siderrgicas
fueron vendidas en poco ms de $1.500 millones, cantidad muy inferior a su
valor contable. Como no hubo componendas ni compromisos de tipo poltico, el
gobierno abri fronteras a la competencia extranjera, derribando aranceles y
dems protecciones. A casi seis aos, la transformacin ha sido total.
<p>
Las siderrgicas privadas mexicanas invirtieron ms de $3.000 millones en
modernizar sus plantas; al mismo tiempo que redujeron su personal a la mitad
-a 20 mil trabajadores-, duplicaron sus ndices de productividad, lo cual
les permiti formar importantes alianzas estratgicas con empresas
transnacionales en materia comercial y tecnolgica. En medio de la crisis
ms grave de los ltimos 64 aos, las maquiladoras y la industria
siderrgica fueron las nicas que mostraron crecimiento. En cuestin de
calidad, las empresas han obtenido la certificacin ISO-9000, lo que les
abri mercados en 40 pases de los cinco continentes.
<p>
As pues, tras la retrica antiprivatizadora no hay ms que una profunda
confusin e incapacidad en reconocer el verdadero origen del mercantilismo,
la corrupcin, el monopolio y el fraude. Esos males no son productos del
libre mercado sino del estatismo y del exceso de poder que concentran
funcionarios y polticos.

RESULTADOS DE LA AYUDA EXTERNA
</h2>
Steve H. Hanke*
<p>
BALTIMORE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente francs, Jacques Chirac, ha debido
considerar inhspito a Washington, cuando recientemente se dirigi a una
sesin conjunta del Congreso. Pocos senadores y representantes hicieron acto
de presencia, enviando ms bien a sus asistentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aparentemente ignorando el desaire, Chirac procedi a aleccionar al
auditorio sobre las equivocaciones de la poltica exterior de Estados
Unidos. Trat de colocar una pesada culpa sobre nuestros hombros por no
gastar ms en ayuda externa: "No abandonemos a su suerte a los pases ms
pobres de la tierra, especialmente a los pases del Africa. No los dejemos
en el crculo vicioso de la exclusin, permitiendo se agoten las fuentes de
asistencia oficial, ayuda que es indispensable para que avancen hacia la
democracia y el desarrollo".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese argumento ha sido utilizado por los franceses y otros europeos por
aos. Desde la Sptima Sesin especial de las Naciones Unidas en 1975, los
europeos han adoptado el objetivo de la ONU, en cuanto a que las naciones
desarrolladas deben transferir 0,7% de su PIB a los pases en desarrollo. En
conjunto, los pases industrializados derraman ms de $50.000 millones al
ao sobre las naciones pobres. Tales transferencias corresponden a ms o
menos 9% del PIB de esas naciones subdesarrolladas. Dinamarca, Noruega,
Suecia y Holanda sobrepasan la norma de la ONU y Francia casi si la alcanza.
Estados Unidos es el rezagado, al tranferir algo ms del 0,1% de su PIB,
convirtindose en blanco seguro de los fanticos de la ayuda externa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lo que hace ridcula esta situacin es que ninguno de los donantes se ha
molestado en averiguar si su generosidad logra algn bien. Por el contrario,
los benefactores se han opuesto abiertamente a todo anlisis econmico
objetivo sobre la ayuda externa, mientras apoyan los rebuznos de acadmicos
que predican gastadas frases sobre el tema.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Un destacado crtico que no ha sido silenciado es lord Peter Bauer del
London School of Economics. Por dcadas las investigaciones de P.T. Bauer
han revelado con detalle el dao infligido por la ayuda externa. El ao
pasado se le uni otro economista del London School of Economics, Peter
Boone, quien public un esplndido anlisis cuantitativo sobre la
efectividad de la ayuda externa para la Oficina Nacional de Investigaciones
Econmicas. Boone hace picadillo del sermn de Chirac.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Utilizando estadsticas de 97 pases receptores de ayuda exterior, Boone
concluye:
<p> No existe relacin alguna entre los niveles de ayuda y las tasas de
crecimiento de los pases receptores, implicando que falta de capital no es
una causa fundamental de pobreza.
<p> La ayuda externa no tiene impacto alguno en reducir las tasas de impuestos
o eliminando otras polticas distorsionantes que retrasan el crecimiento en
las naciones pobres.
<p> La ayuda externa logra un impacto insignificante en mejorar las mediciones
bsicas de desarrollo humano, tales como la mortalidad infantil y el
porcentaje de nios en las escuelas.
<p> La ayuda externa es muy efectiva aumentando el tamao del gobierno y
llenndole los bolsillos a las elites de los pases receptores. 75% de la
ayuda externa se utiliza para aumentar los gastos gubernamentales, lo cual
aumenta el clientelismo y el poder de funcionarios y polticos. La situacin
de la gente pasa a depender de la poltica gubernamental y de decisiones
oficiales. Esto distrae la energa empresarial de sus actividades privadas
para concentrarlas en la obtencin de favores, privilegios y corrupcin.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quizs porque tambin son polticos, pocos dirigentes de los pases ricos
se han dado cuenta que la ayuda externa hace ms dao que bien. A la fecha
slo un lder ha captado el efecto corrosivo de la ayuda externa y ha tenido
el coraje de denunciarla. Vclav Klaus, primer ministro de la Repblica
Checa dijo: "No slo nos ufanamos de poderlo lograr nosotros mismos, sino
que estamos profundamente convencidos que tal ayuda es negativa y
contraproducente". Esa actitud ayuda a comprender porqu ese es el pas
excomunista ms exitoso.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hasta Francia se est viendo obligada a reducir su ayuda externa para
ceirse a los criterios del Tratado de Maastricht. Eso ser bueno para
Francia y mejor para los pases que estn siendo corrompidos por la ayuda
francesa.&copy; <p>

Jesse Helms*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En 
base a sus actuales operaciones, la Organizacin de
las Naciones Unidas no merece el apoyo americano. Su burocracia prolifera,
sus costos se disparan, su misin est en permanente expansin y muy por
encima de su capacidad. Peor todava, con la constante ampliacin de sus
actividades, la ONU est siendo transformada de una institucin compuesta
por estados soberanos en una entidad cuasi-soberana. Esa transformacin es
una amenaza a los intereses nacionales y est siendo financiada
principalmente por los contribuyentes de este pas, quienes aportan ms de
$3.500 millones al ao, convirtindonos en el ms generoso benefactor de
esta organizacin sedienta de poder.
<P>
 La situacin es insostenible. La ONU tiene que ser totalmente reformada.
Sin embargo, el secretario general Boutros Boutros-Ghali ha ignorado las
mltiples advertencias, protegiendo su inflada burocracia e insistiendo en
la creacin de un ejrcito propio de las Naciones Unidas y el poder de
recolectar impuestos directamente. Del empeo reformista de su prximo
secretario general depender la supervivencia de la ONU.
 <P>
La ONU fue creada para ayudar a facilitar soluciones pacficas de disputas
internacionales. Pero la lite internacional que maneja la ONU desprecia la
nocin de intereses parroquiales, cuando lo que importa es el inters
mundial. Esa manera de pensar se ajusta al movimiento en favor de una mayor
centralizacin del poder poltico en manos de una lite, a costa de los
individuos y sus representantes locales. Slo ahora se comienza a comprender
el efecto destructivo de las burocracias centralizadas y del control estatal
de las actividades econmicas. Vemos que una vez establecidas, las
burocracias junto con las ddivas que reparten son casi imposibles de
desmantelar.
<P>
 A medida que nos acercamos al nuevo  milenio, el virus de la centralizacin
se extiende a nivel global y la ONU es el portador. Se trata de impedir que
una burocracia que no ha sido electa por nadie siga aumentando su poder a
costa de lderes nacionales electos democrticamente. 
 Cun grande es el problema? Segn los ltimos datos oficiales, la ONU
emplea a 53.744 burcratas. Segn esta inmensa burocracia, no existe
problema internacional, nacional ni local que no sea problema de la ONU. Ah
tenemos la reciente conferencia Habitat II en Estambul, donde la ONU gast
millones de dlares para tratar los problemas de las ciudades, asuntos que
legtimamente deben ser manejados por los gobiernos locales.
<P>
 No slo se trata de que la ONU no debe estar metiendo las narices en todo,
sino que al hacerlo empeora la situacin. En lugar de ayudar a las naciones
a que encaren sus problemas, la ONU hace lo opuesto al crear desincentivos.
Cuando todo problema local y regional se convierte en uno mundial, nadie es
responsable. Al ser la responsabilidad de todos se convierte en la
responsabilidad de nadie.
<P>
La guerra en Bosnia es el ejemplo perfecto. Confrontar el genocidio y la
agresin de Serbia era una responsabilidad europea y de Estados Unidos. Pero
la administracin Clinton y sus aliados europeos pasaron la responsabilidad
a la ONU, la cual acept una misin imposible de cumplir. Las operaciones de
paz de la ONU fueron la excusa para la inaccin, por lo que murieron decenas
de miles de civiles inocentes, mientras la ONU con una combinacin de
impotencia y negligencia no hizo nada para detener el genocidio.
<P> 
La ONU tiende a complicar todo dando excusas para que intervengan naciones
sin inters en determinados problemas. Qu tienen que ver Togo, Zaire,
Panam, Irlanda y China con la paz en el Medio Oriente? Lo que la ONU logra
es darle cabida a muchos pases que nada  contribuyen a las discusiones.
Haciendo de cada asunto un problema mundial, la ONU intenta crear un mundo
que no existe. Vale la pena preservar una ONU consciente de sus
limitaciones, pero una ONU que insista en imponer a naciones soberanas su
visin utpica est pidiendo que la desmantelen.
<P>
 La reforma necesaria incluye reemplazar al secretario general por otro que
comience desde el primer da reduciendo la burocracia, limitando las
misiones y redefiniendo objetivos. Se requiere un recorte de no menos del
50% de la burocracia. Mientras esta permanezca seguir encontrando misiones
para justificar su existencia. Y hay que acabar con conferencias y comits
innecesarios.
<P>
 Por ejemplo, el gran logro del Comit para el Uso Pacfico del Espacio fue
aprobar la resolucin por la cual los estados miembros reportaran todos los
contactos con seres extraterrestres directamente al secretario general.
Adems de masivas y derrochadoras conferencias, como la de Beijing sobre las
mujeres, la ONU est todo el tiempo patrocinando reuniones y paneles de
discusin, 7.000 de estos en Ginebra el ao pasado.
<P> 
Tambin hay que revisar a fondo el presupuesto. El presupuesto que maneja
el secretario general hay que reducirlo de $1.000 millones a $250 millones.
As cada programa tendra que pasar el examen del mercado, al valorar cada
nacin los programas en que participar, diciendo cunto est dispuesta a
pagar. Continuaran los programas vitales, mientras desaparecen aquellos
favorecidos slo por la burocracia interna.
<P>
 El negocio de la paz es el que ms ha crecido, de $230 millones en 1988 a
$3.600 millones en 1996. Ahora "mantener la paz" tiene mltiples
significados, desde instrumentar elecciones y alimentar a los hambrientos
hasta construir naciones.
<P>
 Lleg la hora para un ultimtum de Estados Unidos: o se reforma rpida y
dramticamente a la ONU o nos retiramos. Sin esta amenaza, nada suceder.
Retener parte de las contribuciones no ha funcionado. No podemos llegar al
ao 2000 con la estructura actual. Claro que la ONU se opondr, lo mismo que
muchas de las naciones menos desarrolladas que se benefician del sistema
actual y ganan influencia vendiendo su soberana a la organizacin. Por
ello, la responsabilidad del prximo secretario general ser inmensa. Se
trata de una tarea gigantesca, pero de no lograrse, no vale la pena salvar a
la ONU y yo, entonces, estara a la cabeza del ataque para que Estados
Unidos se retire.

<h2>
EL BANCO MUNDIAL: 50 AOS DE FRACASOS
</h2>

Bryan T. Johnson*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente Clinton recomienda que Estados Unidos
aporte ms dinero a instituciones como el Banco Mundial y su administracin
se comprometi a dar $800 millones a la Agencia para el Desarrollo
Internacional, una de las subsidiarias del Banco. Eso es $100 millones ms
que en el ltimo presupuesto. Darle ms dinero al Banco Mundial es ignorar
la abrumadora evidencia de que sus programas han hecho muy poco en promover
el crecimiento econmico de las naciones menos desarrolladas. Es ms, ignora
las lecciones econmicas sobre las verdaderas causas del desarrollo.
<dd>	Desde su fundacin en 1944, el Banco Mundial ha participado en unas 165
naciones, argumentando que los pases menos desarrollados tienen pocas
posibilidades de prosperar sin substanciales prstamos subsidiados
provenientes del mundo desarrollado. Adems, considera estar en una posicin
nica para enfrentar ese reto, por lo cual debe continuar transfiriendo
capital a las naciones pobres.
<dd>	El Banco Mundial est simplemente equivocado. Las estadsticas muestran que
los ms viejos receptores de dinero del Banco Mundial no estn hoy en
mejores condiciones que cuando recibieron el primer prstamo y muchos estn
peor. 	Aquellas naciones que han salido del subdesarrollo durante los
ltimos 30 aos lo lograron liberando las fuerzas productivas en sus
economas. Los mejores ejemplos son Hong Kong y Singapur.
<dd>	Hoy el Banco Mundial tiene 178 miembros; slo 12 pases no son miembros.
Los aportes de los miembros dependen del tamao de sus economas. Estados
Unidos ha sido el mayor contribuyente, habiendo aportado $53.000 millones
desde 1944. 
<dd>	El propsito original del Banco fue prestar a las naciones desbastadas por
la Segunda Guerra para que reconstruyeran sus infraestructuras. Los bancos
privados no hacan estos prstamos por ser demasiado arriesgados y porque
muchas de esas naciones haban incumplido sus obligaciones despus de la
Primera Guerra. Pero mientras el Banco Mundial prest $543 millones a
naciones de Europa Occidental entre 1945 y 1950, las inversiones privadas de
Estados Unidos alcanzaron $1.760 millones durante el mismo perodo. 
<dd>	Para 1950 era obvio que el Banco Mundial haba servido su propsito y para
mediados de los 60 comenz a transformarse en una agencia de beneficencia
internacional. El cerebro de esta transformacin fue el ex Secretario de
Defensa estadounidense Robert McNamara, bajo quien se formul el concepto de
"desarrollo sostenible". Resumidamente eso significa que los pases menos
desarrollados pueden obtener niveles de desarrollo sostenible slo si
suficientes recursos son transferidos de los pases ricos a los pobres. El
Banco Mundial contina totalmente identificado con esa manera de pensar.
<dd>	Desde su fundacin el Banco ha provisto ms de $356.000 millones,
principalmente a naciones pobres. De 66 naciones menos desarrolladas que han
recibido fondos del Banco durante ms de 25 aos, 37 no estn hoy en mejor
situacin y 20 estn peor. De esas 20, las economas de ocho se han
contrado en 20% o ms.
<dd>	Entre 1965 y 1995, Nicaragua recibi $637 millones de ayuda del Banco
Mundial. En esos 30 aos el ingreso per capita de los nicaragenses se
redujo de $1.752 al ao a $875. Niger recibi del Banco ms de $589 millones
entre 1965 y 1995, mientras que el ingreso per capita de esa nacin africana
cay de $605 a $280. Despus de tres dcadas es evidente que los receptores
de ayuda a largo plazo no alcanzan un "desarrollo sostenible".
<dd>	La principal razn del estancamiento en esas naciones es falta de libertad
econmica y la mayora de los prstamos del Banco van a pases sin libertad
econmica. De los 18 pases receptores de fondos del Banco cuyas economas
han retrocedido 16 son economas "no libres" o "reprimidas" segn el Indice
1996 de Libertad Econmica y se caracterizan por altos impuestos, barreras a
las importaciones, restricciones a las inversiones extranjeras, onerosas
regulaciones, controles de precio y de salarios, infames polticas
monetarias e inmensos mercados negros.
<dd>	Es obvio que el enfoque del Banco Mundial ha fracasado y el retiro del
apoyo de Estados Unidos no slo ahorrara miles de millones a los
contribuyentes sino que le dara la oportunidad a naciones del mundo menos
desarrollado a romper las cadenas que los han mantenido empobrecidos.&copy

WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Hasta Estados Unidos podra aprender de Chile. De hecho,
varios distinguidos economistas estadounidenses estn actualmente estudiando
la manera cmo Chile privatiz su sistema nacional de pensiones. Con el
Seguro Social en este pas deslizndose hacia la insolvencia, podramos
aprender de Chile la mejor manera de proteger a las personas retiradas.
<P>
 Aunque Chile no goza actualmente de una economa idealmente libre (a escala
mundial ocupa el rango 22 entre los 150 pases evaluados), s tiene la
economa ms libre de Amrica Latina. Si incluimos a las naciones del
Caribe, Bahamas est por delante de Chile, en el puesto nmero 9, a nivel
mundial.
<P>
 Lamentablemente, el hemisferio tambin cuenta con tres de las economas ms
reprimidas del mundo: Cuba, en el puesto 148, adems de Surinam y Hait,
empatados en el puesto 133.
<P>
 Esta evaluacin y jerarqua provienen del "Indice de Libertad Econmica
1997", editado conjuntamente por Heritage Foundation y The Wall Street
Journal, libro a publicarse el 16 de diciembre. All Hong Kong sigue
ocupando el primer puesto, como la economa ms libre del mundo. Este
volumen de 520 pginas presenta estadsticas comparativas sobre el nivel de
libertad econmica en 150 naciones.
<P>
 El Indice muestra a otros 13 pases de Amrica Latina y el Caribe con
economas bsicamente libres: Panam (31), El Salvador empatado con Trinidad
y Tobago en el puesto 34, Jamaica (36), Argentina (42), Belice y Uruguay
empatados en el puesto 43, Paraguay (46), Costa Rica empatado con Guatemala
y Barbados en el puesto 50, Bolivia (59) y Per (64).
<P>
 Los pases sin libertad econmica en el hemisferio incluyen al Ecuador
(75), Colombia (78), Honduras (84), Brasil y Mxico empatados en el puesto
94, la Repblica Dominicana (100), Guyana (104) y, a la cola, Nicaragua y
Venezuela en la posicin 108.
<P>
 En cada pas se analizan diez factores determinantes: si tienen una
poltica de intercambio comercial abierta o restrictiva, las tasas del
impuesto personal y empresarial, el grado de intervencin gubernamental en
la economa, si goza de una moneda estable, el grado en que motiva o
desalienta la inversin extranjera, si los salarios y precios son libremente
determinados por el mercado o fijados por el gobierno, cun efectivamente se
protegen los derechos de propiedad, el volumen de regulacin estatal y el
tamao de la economa informal. A cada pas se le asigna una nota en cada
una de estas 10 reas, del uno (mejor) al cinco (peor). Luego se saca un
promedio de estas notas y al pas se le asigna su posicin segn el promedio
obtenido.
<P>
 Adems de presentar un informe anual sobre el grado de libertad econmica,
este libro de Heritage y The Wall Street Journal  explica porqu unos pases
prosperan y otros retroceden. Las naciones econmicamente ms libres son
tambin las ms ricas, con el mayor ingreso per capita.
<P>
Por qu es esta una informacin importante? Tomemos el caso de Bangladesh,
en el puesto 118, un poco peor que Venezuela y Nicaragua. Si Bangladesh
contina con sus actuales polticas econmicas le tomar 102 aos alcanzar
el actual nivel de vida de Estados Unidos y de Europa occidental. Por el
contrario, si Bangladesh aplica polticas similares a Chile, obteniendo un
crecimiento de 6% anual, su gente alcanzara el nivel de vida de Estados
Unidos en 40 aos. La clave es la libertad econmica.
<P>
 Aunque la liberacin econmica no puede transformar a una nacin de la
noche al da, varios pases de nuestro hemisferio estn avanzando por ese
camino: Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Per, Barbados y Jamaica han seguido
progresando sucesivamente en las tres ediciones anuales del Indice. Por el
contrario, Venezuela y Colombia han retrocedido durante el mismo tiempo.
<P>
 El clima, la cultura, la educacin, la geografa, la infraestructura, la
fertilidad de sus tierras, sus riquezas naturales y la innovacin
tecnolgica contribuyen al xito econmico de un pas, pero ninguna nacin,
a largo plazo, tiene xito sin libertad econmica. Esto lo han demostrado
Chile y los "tigres" del Asia (Hong Kong, Singapur, Corea del Sur y Taiwan).
Amrica Latina est cada da ms consciente de ello.

<h2>
EL CAPITALISMO CHECO
</h2>
Vclav Klaus*
<p>
WASHINGON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.-  En 1996, por sexto ao consecutivo, en la Repblica
Checa tenemos un presupuesto equilibrado, lo cual es un logro importante. Y
eso no se trata de inventos econmicos sofisticados sino de la habilidad de
los lderes polticos en decir que no a gastos excesivos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Han pasado casi seis aos desde que colaps el comunismo y estamos entrando
a una nueva era que llamamos postransformacin. Ya las medidas
gubernamentales importantes para la transformacin se tomaron. No prevemos
implementar nuevas medidas extraordinarias. Como suelo decir, la ciruga
termin y estamos en la sala de recuperacin. Los retos que ahora
enfrentamos y las obras por realizar son ms normales, lo que significa que
los libros de texto de economa elemental son de mayor utilidad ahora para
nosotros que hace cinco o seis aos. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comenzamos todo el proceso de transformacin con una clara visin de adonde
queramos ir, basado en los principios de "laissez faire", una economa de
mercado sin adjetivos calificativos, propiedad privada, gobierno pequeo, un
estado de derecho, libertad y responsabilidad individual.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Una clara visin es absolutamente crucial, pero no es suficiente. Hay que
contar con una estrategia para instrumentar esa visin. Y no me refiero a
planes constructivistas porque sabemos que no es posible promover la mano
invisible del mercado con la mano visible de polticos o intelectuales
omnipotentes. Sabamos que tenamos que desregular, liberalizar y privatizar
en cada etapa del proceso de transformacin, an ante la realidad de un
mercado dbil y por lo tanto ineficiente. Por ello nuestra estrategia fue
flexible y pragmtica. Se trataba de un proceso evolutivo, del comunismo a
la sociedad libre, que no poda ser dictado desde arriba.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conceptualmente era simple. Hace algunos aos se hablaba de la economa de
la transformacin, pero eso es un disparate. Es suficiente aplicar la
economa, la sociologa y las ciencias polticas normales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La privatizacin fue crucial y comenzamos de cero. Me daba risa cuando
algn banquero occidental me deca de la importancia de privatizar el
correo. Mi respuesta era que primero tenamos que privatizar las bodegas de
comestibles, al peluquero, al cafetn y al taller mecnico.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las diferencias con las privatizaciones en Inglaterra son notables. All
privatizaban tres o cuatro empresas cada ao, mientras que nosotros
privatizbamos tres o cuatro empresas cada hora. Y ahora hemos alcanzado la
posicin en donde podemos discutir si vamos a privatizar 100% los
ferrocarriles o slo parcialmente.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En cualquiera de las etapas, la nica manera de proceder es a travs de la
economa de libre mercado, con propiedad privada y precios que reflejen
libremente el valor real de las cosas. Esa es la nica manera de preservar
la humanidad y el medio ambiente. Sabemos que el mayor peligro para el medio
ambiente es la liquidacin de la propiedad privada y el rechazo de los
precios libres, como fuente de informacin para saber sobre la escasez
relativa de los diferentes recursos. Los mayores crmenes contra el medio
ambiente han ocurrido en pases donde no hay propiedad privada, mercados ni
precios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nuestra misin ahora es defender la libertad econmica, evitando la
reaparicin del dirigismo, de intervenciones gubernamentales restrictivas e
improductivas, que ahora se presentan bajo nuevas banderas, pero que son tan
dainas como en el pasado. El peligro yace en la introduccin de nuevas
polticas basadas en los intereses de grupos de presin, en la ideologa del
corporativismo y el sindicalismo, en falsas teoras de justicia social, en
el ecologismo agresivo, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las ltimas cifras del crecimiento de la produccin industrial checa es de
21%, de la construccin 19%, mientras que el desempleo es de 2,8% y aunque
la tasa de inflacin sigue siendo exagerada - 8% -, somos el pas
excomunista con la ms baja inflacin.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Queremos seguir abriendo nuestro pas en todos los campos. En diciembre
fuimos aceptados en la OCDE, el llamado club de los pases ricos, el primer
pas excomunista que se hace miembro. Hace poco eso era apenas un sueo para
mi. Y tenemos la intencin de ser tambin miembros de la OTAN y del proceso
integracionista europeo, a pesar de las objeciones que tenemos sobre la
excesiva regulacin y control ejercido desde Bruselas. Sin embargo, queremos
ser miembros porque estamos empeados en convertirnos en una nacin europea
normal.&copy; <p>

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PENSIONADOS POR MELANCOLIA
</h2>
Martin Krause*
<p>
BUENOS AIRES <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- 	Hay descubrimientos  que nos llenan de estupor o
asombro, otros no causan la menor sorpresa. En esta ltima categora se
encuentran los recientes anuncios acerca de la situacin del sistema
jubilatorio estatal argentino. 	
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Afectado por un enorme deficit que lo lleva a mostrar sus cuentas en rojo en
forma permanente, el gobierno decidi contratar a un reconocido
administrador de uno de los grupos empresariales ms importantes del pas
para que evaluara la gestin del sistema y presentara recomendaciones. Ahora
este experto ha dado a conocer su informe en el cual incluye, entre otras
cosas, las siguientes joyas burocrticas:
<p> Cinco personas, en la ciudad de La Plata, fueron jubiladas por estar
afectadas de melancola. 
<p> Hay 28.000 jubilaciones de fallecidos que se siguen pagando. 
<p> Supuestamente hay unos 4.500 ancianos de ms de 100 aos de edad cobrando
sus beneficios previsionales, cuya existencia no ha sido constatada por nadie. 
<p> Hay expedientes de jubilados con domicilios en lugares inexistentes; por
ejemplo, en el cruce de dos calles de la ciudad de Buenos que son paralelas.
<p> La Administracin Nacional de la Seguridad Social (Anses)  tiene 15
edificios en Buenos Aires destinados al archivo de expedientes. 
<p> Todava hay regmenes jubilatorios especiales que cubren a "enlazadores de
perros" y "conductores de perreras" que se retiran a los 55 aos, igual que
los zapateros y las bailarinas del Teatro Coln que son jubilados a los 40
aos de edad, mientras que para el resto de los ciudadanos se aplica el
mnimo de 65 aos. 
<p> Los abogados de Anses no se molestan en presentarse en las audiencias
judiciales u olvidan citaciones, con lo cual no es de extraar que la
institucin suele perder todos los juicios.
<p> Hay 138.056 demandas pendientes en los tribunales por ms de $ 2.400
millones de dlares. 
<p> Se han descubierto jubilaciones otorgadas a personas con apenas 3 o 5 aos
de aportes.
<p> En Tucumn lograron su jubilacin 30 personas presentando el mismo
electrocardiograma.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La razn de todo esto no es que los funcionarios pblicos son ms flojos o
ms brutos que el resto de la humanidad, sino que no tienen ningn incentivo
para llevar a cabo una eficiente administracin de lo recursos. Todos sus
incentivos apuntan hacia no hacer olas, mantener el cargo, ganar puntos con
sus superiores polticos y acumular poder a travs de mayores presupuestos. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sin embargo, Argentina ha realizado una reforma del sistema previsional en
la cual se ha creado un nuevo rgimen paralelo y privado de capitalizacin
individual, el cual se desenvuelve con notable xito. Pero a diferencia de
la reforma implementada en Chile, aqu se mantiene el sistema estatal de
reparto como jubilacin mnima, en vez de eliminarlo con el transcurso del
tiempo como estn haciendo los chilenos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mantener  paralelamente el viejo sistema politizado significa mantener
todos los incentivos para que las situaciones ahora denunciadas sigan
generndose. Podr realizarse una limpieza, reformular la estructura,
modificar los procedimientos, pero seguir siendo manejado por gente cuya
eficiencia no es premiada ni su ineficiencia castigada, como sucede en el
sector privado, a travs del simple y claro mecanismo de las ganancias y las
prdidas. Los millones que se gastarn en la reorganizacin del sistema
seran mejor invertidos en su eliminacin total.

<TITLE>Leon: Un Encuentro de Perfectos Idiotas -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>UN ENCUENTRO DE PERFECTOS IDIOTAS</H2>
Roberto Salinas Len*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El encuentro organizado por los zapatistas de
Chiapas contra el "neoliberalismo" es una dramtica demostracin del
subdesarrollado pensamiento que motiv la reciente publicacin del libro
"Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano". Todos los males del orbe se le
atribuyen al "neoliberalismo": el narcotrfico, la pobreza, la marginalidad,
la tirana del dinero, la cartera vencida, la iniquidad fiscal, el
imperialismo cultural Slo se les olvid sealar la impotencia sexual, el
malestar estomacal y la derrota de Mxico por Nigeria.
<dd>	
Una linda causa, oponerse a un fantasma como el "neoliberalismo", descrito
con esa belleza sentimental que caracteriza la retrica del que sabe mucho
de nada, experto en conceptos indefinidos, literatos como Carlos Monsivais
que afirma: "el neoliberalismo, una de las realidades mas oprobiosas del
planeta". 
<dd>	
Fue un encuentro de perfectos idiotas latinoamericanos. Son tres las
caractersticas que  los definen y las tres se ponen de manifiesto en las
declaraciones del encuentro. La primera caracterstica es el
"antigringuismo". Se insiste que Estados Unidos es la fuente de los males de
la regin, desde el mbito comercial hasta el poltico. En Mxico, la
perspectiva del idiota antiliberal impide aprovechar uno de los recursos mas
valiosos del pas: nuestra vasta frontera de 3,000 kilmetros con el mercado
ms grande del mundo. El sentimentalismo nacionalista de  los sermones
contra el neoliberalismo no borran el hecho que la gran mayora de las
exportaciones mexicanas disfrutan del inmenso mercado vecino ni que gran
parte del capital extranjero que necesitamos puede obtenerse en los mercados
financieros al norte de la frontera.
<dd>	
Estados Unidos es un mercado privilegiado, aun con disposiciones tan
nocivas como sus leyes de proteccionismo subrepticio. Nos conviene
aprovechar la geografa con apertura comercial e instrumentar una poltica
sensata de inversin extranjera. No aprovecharlo, acusando a los vecinos del
norte de causar todos nuestros problemas es una verdadera marca de idiotez.
<dd>	
Una segunda caracterstica del idiota antiliberal es su fatalismo; la idea
que los problemas de Mxico son producto de fuerzas exgenas, que el destino
nos ha dictado el subdesarrollo. En  ocasiones se cita la cada de los
precios del petrleo y el peso de la deuda externa; en otras, la
globalizacin financiera, los capitales especulativos, hasta la propia
existencia de mercados financieros. Mxico es un pas joven, cuyos actores
son parte de una generacin devaluada por la cultura antiprogreso. En los
ltimos 25 aos, la economa mexicana ha sufrido mayores desequilibrios
socioeconmicos que en los 150 aos anteriores, aun cuando ocupamos una de
las regiones mejor dotadas en el mundo.
<dd>	
Es curioso que el idiota antiliberal nunca se pregunta por qu pases como
Singapur y Taiwan, sin riquezas naturales, han logrado alcanzar el nivel de
vida de los ingleses y, por el contrario, por qu Mxico, Venezuela y
Brasil, teniendo de todo sufren de tanta pobreza. La razn es la debilidad y
la politizacin de nuestras instituciones. 
<dd>	
Un pas donde se respetan instituciones como el derecho de propiedad y los
contratos, sin permisos ni favoritismo poltico, acumula mayor inversin en
capital humano y as genera  riqueza. Se trata de crear incentivos y
confianza. La postura fcil siempre es culpar al otro, sin reconocer los
errores que tanto le han costado a nuestra devaluada generacin.
<dd>	
La tercera caracterstica del idiota antiliberal, de aquel que todas las
noches antes de dormir hace grgaras con lo "social", es la teora del
pastelito: la idea que la riqueza es un factor preestablecido y lo que se
necesita son buenos planificadores que la distribuyan justamente, como si se
tratara de las porciones de un pastel. A ello se aade tratar de solucionar
la pobreza a travs de una poltica fiscal: ms y ms gasto, sin importar
sus nefastas consecuencias. La distribucin "equitativa" de la riqueza que
propone el idiota latinoamericano implica una injusta transferencia de
recursos del sector productivo al sector burocrtico, generando rentismo e
imposibilitando la formacin de capital, con lo cual ms bien se logra una
masiva distribucin de la pobreza.
<dd>	
El encuentro zapatista en Chiapas fue un encuentro de envidia, la
caracterstica ms perniciosa del idiota latinoamericano. Segn el
periodista e historiador ingls Paul Johnson, la envidia "es la mas
peligrosa de todas las emociones populares el Estado todopoderoso es fuente
de muchos males; pero sobre todo es el mejor custodio de la envidia".

<TITLE>Salinas-Leon: MEXICO: EL DEBATE ECONOMICO-- 9/04/96</TITLE>

<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>MEXICO: EL DEBATE ECONOMICO</H2>
Roberto Salinas-Len*<br>
<p>



CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- El llamado del presidente Zedillo a un debate
sobre la poltica econmica ha generado gran polmica sobre si se debe
cambiar el modelo y en cuanto a la participacin del Estado. Hay tres
aspectos del debate que son fundamentales: el crecimiento, la poltica
monetaria y la estructura institucional de la economa. 
No hay inconsistencia entre el llamado a debatir la poltica econmica y las
declaraciones presidenciales de que "no habr cambio en el modelo". Zedillo
tiene toda la razn; no puede haber un retorno al estatismo y al
proteccionismo, por ms que decirlo ofenda sensibilidades de aquellos que
persisten bajo la ilusin que el intervencionismo del Estado es la solucin
a los problemas de Mxico.<p>
	El hecho que la liberalizacin sea el nico camino viable no implica que no
haya elementos de estrategia econmica abiertos a debate. No es el fondo (el
qu), sino la forma (el cmo) lo que se pretende debatir.<p>
	La primera dimensin del debate, el crecimiento, es un caso dramtico por
las grandes diferencias que persisten en cuanto a poltica econmica. Por un
lado se discute si la economa va bien o mal, a la vez de cmo acelerar el
crecimiento vis-a-vis el proceso de abatir la inflacin. Por otro lado, se
contemplan los mecanismos radicales necesarios para lograr un alto
crecimiento de la economa. El gobierno mexicano plantea una tasa de
crecimiento anual de 5%; y si bien tal nivel es apenas suficiente para
generar los empleos que la fuerza laboral requiere, es ciertamente
insuficiente para superar el subdesarrollo. Por lo tanto, el debate debe
contemplar estrategias que permitan alcanzar un crecimiento sostenido de 8%
anual, congruente con la estabilidad de precios.<p>
	Sin embargo, entre los protagonistas de la poltica econmica se escuchan
diferentes versiones. El Banco de Mxico mantiene que la prioridad es bajar
la inflacin, mientras que otros, por la desesperacin de lograr la
reactivacin de la planta productiva, afirman que el crecimiento debe ser la
meta principal del gobierno. Muchos interpretan esa disyuntiva como una
lucha entre los obsesionados con la estabilidad de precios (inflacin baja,
a pesar de bajo crecimiento), y aquellos obsesionados con el crecimiento
(alto crecimiento, a pesar de alta inflacin). <p>
	Pero se trata de una disyuntiva falsa porque los objetivos se pueden
combinar. Tenemos que reducir la inflacin y simultneamente lograr un alto
crecimiento econmico. No se trata de abatir la inflacin a costa del
crecimiento y empleo ni de aumentar estos en perjuicio de la estabilidad de
precios. Hay que aumentar el nivel de vida y ello requiere alto crecimiento,
sano y sostenido.<p>
	La segunda dimensin del debate, la poltica monetaria, surge de la
necesidad de preservar el valor de la moneda. De lo contrario no hay ahorro.
Nos hemos comprometido en un sistema de flotacin, pero no se ha definido la
ruta cambiaria.<p>
	La tercera dimensin del debate es la estructura de incentivos a adoptarse
en la economa. Nuestro subdesarrollo es en gran medida por la ausencia de
un sistema de derechos de propiedad bien definidos. No contamos con
instituciones imparciales que aseguren el cumplimiento de contratos,
derechos de propiedad confiables o que nos permitan derivar todos los
beneficios del intercambio de bienes, debido a los altos costos de
transaccin impuestos por un exagerado intervencionismo del Estado en la
actividad econmica.<p> 
      	En los ltimos 15 aos, la economa mexicana ha crecido al raqutico
promedio anual de 1,9%. Y el nivel de vida ha cado dramticamente, ya que
se trata de un perodo donde aumentos bruscos de la inflacin fueron la
regla, no la excepcin. La explicacin fundamental de este escenario de
"estanflacion" (inflacin combinada con recesin) son nuestras muy poco
confiables instituciones y las psimas polticas econmicas. Por todo ello,
es importante abrir el debate sobre  los detalles de la poltica econmica
nacional. <p>

<h2>
DEFENSA DE LA LEY HELMS-BURTON
</h2>     
     
     

Alvaro Vargas Llosa*
<p>


MADRID <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Durante una reciente gira por varios pases latinoamericanos
para presentar un libro que acabo de perpetrar con Carlos Alberto Montaner y
Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza -"Manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano"- me han
preguntado hasta la saciedad: quin es el ms idiota de todos?  Siempre
contest que los idiotas son muchos pero que, con toda justicia
entomolgica, debe sealarse contemporneamente a Fidel Castro como la reina
de la especie. Y aad que son idiotas quienes creen que el problema
principal de Cuba es el embargo estadounidense, que su levantamiento
precipitara la cada de Castro y que la "ley Helms-Burton" es una
conspiracin contra la soberana de Canad, Mxico, Espaa, Francia, Japn o
la Cochinchina.
<dd>	Se ha desatado en Espaa una fuerte campaa contra la "ley Helms-Burton" de
una inequvoca ndole nacionalista. Detrs de todos los argumentos respira
el orgullo espaol herido por una legislacin norteamericana supuestamente
imperialista. Un anlisis puramente legal bastara para demostrar que lo
nico que ha hecho Estados Unidos es ejercer su derecho como pas. La ley no
dice que se va a penalizar a quienes inviertan en Cuba sino a quienes
trafiquen con propiedades que fueron de norteamericanos y dejaron de serlo
por un acto, no de derecho, sino de fuerza. Quienes no trafiquen con estas
propiedades pueden seguir comerciando con Cuba, del mismo modo que Cuba
puede seguir montando empresas en el exterior para burlar el embargo, como
lo hizo durante tantos aos desde su famoso Departamento MC que acab en el
juicio estaliniano contra el general Ochoa, De la Guardia y compaa. Como
le dijo recientemente el canciller argentino Di Tella al canciller cubano,
Cuba puede comerciar todo lo que quiera con el mundo, siempre que pague.
<dd>	Pero no es ste argumento legal -basado en que Estados Unidos tiene derecho
a proteger a sus ciudadanos, ejerciendo as la funcin esencial que tiene el
Estado- el que quiero traer a colacin. En Espaa, las razones para apoyar
la ley son ms poderosas que en todos los otros pases del planeta. Se
invoca en estos das, con las venas del cuello hinchadas, los derechos de
las pocas decenas de empresarios espaoles que han decidido -con poco
sentido de sus propios intereses- hacer negocios en la Cuba de hoy. Por qu
tendran estos intereses que ser ms importantes, a la hora de juzgar la ley
Helms-Burton, que los de las decenas de miles de comerciantes espaoles
cuyas propiedades y negocios fueron confiscados por Castro.  El comercio
minorista estaba prcticamente en manos de espaoles en la Cuba de fines de
los 50 y unos 30 mil espaoles expropiados por Castro nunca fueron
compensados por aquel acto de brutalidad.
<dd>	Pero hay ms: si escarbamos un poco en la historia cubana de este siglo
llegaremos a la conclusin de que un porcentaje elevadsimo de la poblacin
es espaola. Entre la poblacin cubana blanca (40% del total), quienes no
tienen ascendencia espaola inmediata son una minora. En 1902 un censo
estableci que la mitad del milln trescientos mil habitantes eran espaoles
(incluyendo, para desgracia de Amrica, a un tal Angel Castro). En los aos
siguientes llegaron a Cuba ochocientos mil nuevos inmigrantes espaoles,
entre asturianos, gallegos y canarios, que inclinaron decisivamente la
balanza demogrfica hacia el lado espaol. Y no era una inmigracin hija o
nieta de espaoles, era espaola y punto. De esa inmigracin son hija y
nieta directas las dos generaciones que hoy constituyen el universo de
vctimas de la dictadura castrista y est en marcha una tercera.
<dd>	Si es vlida la premisa de Palmerston de que la poltica exterior de un
pas debe ser defender los interese de sus ciudadanos, quin puede afirmar
que Espaa debe oponerse a la ley Helms-Burton?
<dd>	Pero hay an ms: est entre los intereses de Espaa, tambin, defender la
democracia en los pases latinoamericanos. Esto significa, en trminos
prcticos, penalizar a las dictaduras. Todava est muy lejos del continente
americano la conciencia de que la libertad es indivisible, que no se puede
separar la libertad poltica de la libertad econmica. Aunque hay muchos
ejemplos americanos de libertad a medias, ningn caso ha contribuido ms a
la confusin ideolgica y moral que el caso cubano. El ltimo episodio de la
larga batalla de Castro en favor de la confusin es la "opcin china": el
intento de crear unos espacios de capitalismo dentro de estructuras de poder
comunistas o simplemente despticos. La piedra de toque de esa operacin es
la inversin extranjera. Se vende la idea de que Cuba al menos va hacia la
libertad econmica, lo que engendrar la libertad poltica. Que este
razonamiento es farisaico lo demuestra el hecho de que Yugoslavia, que tuvo
relaciones econmicas privilegiadas con las democracias desarrolladas,
sigui siendo una dictadura comunista hasta los acontecimientos
cataclsmicos que todos conocemos, y el hecho de que Ceausescu, a quien fue
concedido el trato preferencial por Estados Unidos, se aferr al poder  en
Rumania por 24 aos.
<dd> Aunque es cierto que las sanciones econmicas no bastan para tumbar
gobiernos, no hay duda de que las inyecciones econmicas vitaminizan a las
dictaduras. Y aunque la Cuba de Castro no ofrece ninguna seguridad jurdica
a los inversionistas extranjeros, ni hay all las mnimas condiciones
econmicas para que los capitales hagan buen negocio, la existencia de estas
inversiones provee un sostn al rgimen de Castro y le facilita la siniestra
inculcacin del "sndrome de Estocolmo" entre sus vctimas, psicolgicamente
dependientes de la nica mano que les pone un mendrugo en la boca.
<dd>	Es una buena cosa que Jos Mara Aznar no se haya dejado acorralar por la
histeria antiyanqui durante la visita de Al Gore y que haya mantenido muy
claras las prioridades; incluso si se est formalmente obligado a oponerse a
la "ley Helms-Burton", no debe perderse nunca de vista que la batalla
principal en el caso cubano es contra la tirana y a favor de sus vctimas,
y que Estados Unidos -nico pas del mundo que intenta hacer algo concreto
contra Castro- no es responsable ni de que Cuba sea una inmensa fbrica de
sufrimiento ni de que 10 millones de cubanos no lleguen a producir la
tercera parte de los $30.000 millones que los exiliados cubanos producen
cada ao en el pas libre que les abri las puertas cuando todos los dems
se las cerraban.
<dd>	Desde agosto de 1994, cuando Castro lanz a 30.000 balseros contra las
costas de la Florida (y Washington desperdici la oportunidad de acabar de
una vez por todas con la dictadura), uno tena la impresin de que la nica
prioridad en la poltica exterior hacia Cuba era evitar nuevos inmigrantes.
Gracias a un error poltico monumental -el asesinato de los pilotos de
"Hermanos al Rescate"-, Castro precipit una saludable alteracin de las
prioridades en la poltica exterior norteamericana hacia Cuba. Mantengamos
esas prioridades donde deben estar. &copy;

<H2>LIBERALISMO</H2>
Franklin Lpez B.*<br>
<p>



NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- No cabe duda que el Estado intervencionista,
estabilizador, asistencialista, planificador e igualitario result ser un
fracaso. La cada del muro de Berln y el desmantelamiento de la Unin
Sovitica fueron manifestaciones fehacientes del desencanto de los pueblos
con el modelo estatista y socialista. Ese desencanto no se circunscribe a
los antiguos pases comunistas sino que se extiende a todos los confines de
la tierra.<p>
Pero las reformas poltico-econmicas que se han instrumentado en muchos
pases, aunque con diversos matices conceptuales, lamentablemente se han
aglutinado todas bajo la etiqueta de liberalismo o neoliberalismo.  As se
calific la poltica de Collor de Mello en Brasil, la de Carlos Andrs Prez
en Venezuela, la de Salinas de Gortari en Mxico, la de Fujimori en el Per
y la de Carlos Menem de Argentina. Si bien es cierto que algunas de esas
polticas tienen un corte liberal, no es menos cierto que la praxis
poltico-econmica de estos regmenes no goza de una cohesin conceptual
liberal autntica. Por eso, muchos no saben o confunden lo que es y lo que
propone el liberalismo.  <p>
     	Para algunos, la alternativa frente al fracaso del Estado
intervencionista es el caos, el desorden, la anarqua, la ley de la selva,
en otras palabras el "capitalismo salvaje" que supuestamente resultara de
la aplicacin del liberalismo manchesteriano o anarco-capitalista.  Nada ms
lejos de la realidad. El liberalismo es una doctrina de Estado, cuyo fin
primordial consiste en crear y defender un marco legal e institucional en el
cual florece la libertad individual. Carlos Alberto Montaner escribe: "El
liberalismo es un modo de entender la naturaleza humana y una propuesta para
conseguir que las personas alcancen el ms alto nivel de prosperidad
potencial que posean, dentro del mayor marco de libertad".<p>
     	El liberalismo busca una sociedad en la cual cada individuo tenga la
potestad de elegir los medios que ms le convengan para obtener sus propios
fines, sabiendo que tal esfuerzo conduce a mejorar las condiciones del resto
de la sociedad, siempre y cuando se respeten los derechos de terceros. El
economista espaol Pedro Schwartz afirma: "Nosotros [los liberales] no nos
ocupamos del individuo, que sabe lo que quiere, que lleva su propia vida la
mayor parte de las veces con buen seso; nos preocupamos del Estado, por las
razones de su existencia, por la necesidad de que funcione bien, por el
temor de que se desve de su tarea para convertirse en un mecanismo opresor".<p>
     	Frecuentemente, de buena o mala fe, se confunde al liberalismo con el
mercantilismo, donde los que gozan de poder econmico se asocian a quienes
ejercen el poder poltico para disfrutar de privilegios,  protecciones,
crditos blandos, monopolios y dems ventajas en perjuicio del bolsillo y de
la libertad de seleccin de los consumidores, es decir, del pueblo.
En cualquier caso, el libre mercado es slo un aspecto del pensamiento
liberal. El liberalismo implica libertad poltica y econmica, propiedad
privada e imperio de la ley, estabilidad fiscal y transparente
administracin de la justicia, moneda sana y orden pblico, defensa nacional
y libertad de comercio, tanto en el mbito nacional como internacional. Ser
liberal no es slo amar la libertad para tener la oportunidad de prosperar,
es ser tolerante de los gustos, flaquezas y prioridades de los dems,
defender el individualismo y propugnar la privatizacin de las empresas
pblicas. Es todo eso y mucho ms. Ser liberal es creer en los dems, en la
dignidad y diversidad del hombre.<p>
Estas condiciones no son producto del sentido comn ni son verdades
absolutas o evidentes. Son resultado de la discusin, del debate, de la
experiencia de otras naciones y del estudio. Ningn liberal argumenta ser
dueo de la verdad. Es posible acercarse a ella a travs de la duda,
buscando su confirmacin o su negacin en el quehacer humano y en la
experiencia de la vida diaria. Tal es la esencia del liberalismo verdadero. * <i><center>*Economista ecuatoriano, profesor de la Universidad de Nueva Orleans. </center><i><p>

BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO

November 14
, 1996</i><br>
<h2>
BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO 
</h2>
Franklin Lpez B.*
<br>
<p>
NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Se dice que Abdal Bucaram, el nuevo presidente del
Ecuador "tendr un xito absoluto o ser un fracaso rotundo". El problema de
la incertidumbre se basa ms en el fraccionamiento de las fuerzas polticas
ecuatorianas que en la inhabilidad del presidente en especificar un plan
coherente de trabajo. 
<p>
En primer lugar, el sistema poltico ecuatoriano est diseado para la
inercia. Los grupos dominantes tienen capturada a la dirigencia poltica y
civil de tal manera que es prcticamente imposible iniciar cambios
radicales. El Congreso ocupa su tiempo en discusiones intiles; cuando
logran reunir qurum inician juicios polticos con el nico objetivo de
empantanar la accin del Ejecutivo y si a eso sumamos las acciones
obstaculizadoras de un sector judicial politizado es fcil concluir que el
statu quo tiene todas las de ganar.  
<p>
                En segundo lugar, existe en el pas una enorme desconfianza
del "neoliberalismo".  Inclusive la Conferencia Episcopal se ha declarado en
contra del neoliberalismo "salvaje". Los sindicatos, los grupos indgenas,
la Unin Nacional de Educadores, las asociaciones estudiantiles
universitarias, los empleados del gobierno nacional, de las provincias y
municipios tienen un formidable poder de convocatoria; cuando perciben una
amenaza a sus intereses salen a las calles en manifestaciones violentas,
cierran carreteras, crean disturbios o se declaran en huelga, lo que en el
Ecuador significa la toma de las instalaciones y la interrupcin de las
labores ordinarias. Los dirigentes slo necesitan enarbolar la etiqueta
"neoliberalismo" para impedir cualquier cambio que no les convenga. 
Tercero, los partidos polticos, tanto de izquierda como de derecha,
realizan clculos polticos para el siguiente perodo. Cuentan con que el
gobierno de turno se desgaste y as poder llegar al poder.  An ms,
propician el descontento con quejas sobre las partidas presupuestarias o
sobre los nombramientos de gobernadores u otras autoridades y lo hacen desde
el Congreso o mediante paros de ciudades y pueblos. 
<p>
                Frente a esta realidad no es mucho lo pueda hacer un
presidente, inclusive uno con el temperamento de Bucaram.  Adems, Bucaram
se topa con elementos endgenos que van hacer su labor an ms difcil.
Entre sus opositores estn los que han llegado a sus actuales posiciones por
su afiliacin poltica, aquellos que no tienen otra ideologa que la de
disfrutar del cargo pblico, aquellos que creen que "hacer gobierno"
significa "hacer de las suyas", aquellos que dicen defender los intereses
del pueblo sin comprender el alcance de sus propuestas. Y de todos estos
est llena la administracin actual. 
<p>
                Otro elemento endgeno es el folklorismo ecuatoriano, de lo
cual no se escapa ni el mismo presidente: un da se cree Julio Iglesias,
otro da se corta el bigote en subasta, un da regala su salario a los
mendigos, otro da llama "burro" a un ex presidente y luego pide disculpas a
los burros. La caracterstica primordial de lo folklrico es el simbolismo;
es decir, es ms importante la forma que el fondo, valen ms las intenciones
que los resultados.  En lo folklrico dominan las imgenes y los espejos;
los mitos y los espejismos sustituyen a la realidad. Poco importan los
hechos, lo esencial son las emociones. El Ecuador es un pas folklrico por
antonomasia, por eso algunos comentaristas lo han llamado Absurdistn o pas
de Ripley. Un ejemplo basta: el ao pasado, una organizacin llamada Manos
Limpias decidi "limpiar" los tribunales, cmo?, pues con escobas y baldes
de agua. Lo importante, repito, es el simbolismo, las intenciones, "sentirse
bien".  Hoy el folklore ha llegado al poder con todo su colorido, pompa y
esplendor. 
<p>
                El tercer elemento endgeno es la tendencia al
autoritarismo. Se militarizan las aduanas, se cierran los locales que venden
licor, se aprehende a muchachos de pelo largo, se amenaza con la crcel a
los especuladores, se cancela sbitamente un contrato con una empresa de
petrleos; en definitiva, la tnica que va apareciendo es que el "que no
est conmigo est contra m".  Claro que esto es comprensible frente a los
factores antes mencionados, pero me temo que ms que ser producto de la
frustracin es el resultado de una tendencia natural del temperamento del
presidente hacia "hacer lo que le da la gana". 
<p>
  Pero no todo est perdido. Aunque en menor grado, hay factores de cambio
hacia un mundo mejor. Entre stos es importante la actitud de Bucaram hacia
la bsqueda de soluciones prcticas y sus sueos de reeleccin. Aunque no
tiene una ideologa definida, Bucaram es  sincero en su afn de lucha contra
lo que l percibe como "oligarquas", los grupos de poder que se amamantan
de la teta del estado. Intuye el problema sin comprenderlo en su totalidad y
por ello se ha rodeado de individuos que tienen un visin bastante liberal.
En lo econmico el ms conocido es Domingo Cavallo, pero tambin hay
asesores chilenos para reformar el seguro social, bolivianos para la
capitalizacin de las empresas estatales y as algunos cambios se  realizarn. 
En conclusin, la presidencia de Abdal Bucaram no ser ni de grandes
transformaciones ni de grandes desastres.

<title>Mellor: Nueva York Reprime la Iniciativa</title>

<h2>
NUEVA YORK REPRIME LA INICIATIVA
</h2>     
     
     
Chip Mellor*
<p>

NUEVA YORK <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Esta ciudad se conoce mundialmente por su historia
empresarial y fue en gran parte creada por generaciones de inmigrantes. Las
nuevas corrientes migratorias provenientes del Caribe, Amrica Latina y
Europa oriental vigorizan los viejos barrios con su empuje e iniciativa.
Nueva York est siendo envuelta por una nueva ola de modestos inmigrantes
con iniciativa individual.
<dd>	Veamos algunos ejemplos de la investigacin hecha para el Instituto para la
Justicia por Howard Husock de la Escuela de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de
Harvard. En los barrios de Brooklyn y Queens, cientos de autobusetes -casi
todos manejados por inmigrantes del Caribe- trasladan pasajeros regularmente
hasta las estaciones del metro. El precio del pasaje es inferior al de los
autobuses pblicos  y, segn los usuarios, el servicio es mejor y ms confiable.
<dd>	En Harlem y otras barriadas negras surgen de la noche a la maana salones
de belleza que se especializan en peinados de mltiples y diminutas
trencillas. En las esquinas y lotes vacos de los barrios surgen
"pulgueros", ferias y mercados de vegetales, donde caribeos y africanos
venden toda clase de productos, desde franelas hasta libros, mientras otros
preparan alimentos de todas partes del mundo. Se estima que los vendedores
callejeros en Nueva York ya suman 25.000.
<dd>	En una ciudad donde el 10% de la poblacin vive de la beneficencia pblica
y decenas de miles estn presos por trfico de drogas, esta explosin de la
iniciativa individual es alentadora, pero las autoridades tratan de
aplastarla, hostigando y hasta arrestando a la gente por el "crimen" de
intentar ganarse la vida productivamente.
<dd>	Los conductores de los autobusetes informales no logran conseguir licencias
de la ciudad para operar y an cuando las obtienen son multados y hasta
confiscados por recoger pasajeros en una parada "oficial" de autobs. A las
peluqueras negras se les niega una licencia a menos que tomen mil horas de
clases de cosmetologa que para nada le sirven en su negocio. Al no tener el
permiso municipal, se les obliga a trabajar en la clandestinidad por el
pecado de ejercer una profesin que el gobierno se empea en regular.
<dd>	Los vendedores callejeros que aplican por un permiso pronto se dan cuenta
que las autoridades aprueban menos de una cuarta parte y se les dificulta
hasta conseguir una planilla de aplicacin. Y si los taxista "piratas" en
lugar de responder a llamadas  telefnicas recogen pasajeros en la calle o
de los aeropuertos tienen que adquirir un "medalln" que en el mercado
cambia de manos por $200.000, cantidad totalmente fuera del alcance de estos
nuevos empresarios que comienzan desde abajo.
<dd>	Las leyes, licencias, permisos y certificaciones ocupacionales cubren 73
pginas del Directorio Oficial de la Ciudad de Nueva York. Se requiere de
una licencia para reparar un videocasete, vender entradas para la lucha
libre, o establecer un estacionamiento.
<dd>	Aunque Nueva York es de lo peor, las manicuristas en Charlotte, los
taxistas en Boston y los vendedores callejeros en San Diego sufren de
similar acoso por parte de las autoridades municipales. El Instituto para la
Justicia adelanta la publicacin de investigaciones sobre las barreras
legales contra la libre iniciativa en Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Detroit,
Nueva York, San Antonio y San Diego. Estamos decididos a llevar adelante en
los tribunales y ante la opinin pblica una campaa para restaurar la total
proteccin constitucional a la libertad econmica. &copy

<h2>
MEXICO: CORRUPCION  DE LAS LEYES 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Agustn Navarro
</a>

<P>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (AIPE).- Se sabe que la corrupcin no es un fenmeno
exclusivamente mexicano, pero en los ltimos tiempos lo que aqu sucede ha
llamado la atencin de los medios de comunicacin de todo el mundo.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Siguiendo el "principio de la causalidad", es decir, respetando la
inexorable relacin entre "causa y efecto", descubrimos que esa corrupcin
es perfectamente consistente con la naturaleza de nuestro sistema poltico,
econmico y jurdico. En efecto, el origen -y por tanto la solucin- de la
corrupcin radica en buena parte en las normas vigentes (leyes, reglamentos,
decretos, etc.), que no slo produce, sino que estimula e inmuniza a la
expoliacin. Se trata del saqueo al amparo de la ley, frase descriptiva de
la corrupcin acuada en 1850 por Federico Bastiat en su magistral obra "La
Ley". Bastiat defini a la ley como "la organizacin colectiva del derecho
individual a defenderse". El punto de partida, por lo tanto, es que el
individuo requiere para su supervivencia preservar su persona, su libertad y
su propiedad, y que cada uno de estos requisitos bsicos son completamente
dependientes de los otros dos. De ah tambin se desprende que la sociedad
tiene el derecho de organizarse y crear una fuerza comn que proteja
permanentemente esos derechos. Por ello, el derecho colectivo -y su propia
legalidad- est basado en los derechos individuales. As como un individuo
no puede usar legalmente la fuerza contra la persona, libertad o propiedad
de otro individuo, la fuerza comn (la ley) no puede ser usada para destruir
la persona, libertad y propiedad de los individuos o grupos.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Bastiat mantena que cuando la ley no se autolimita y no se confina a sus
funciones propias, se pervierte y empieza a actuar en contra de su propsito
original. Al ser manipulada para destruir su objetivo fundamental, aniquila
la justicia que se supona deba mantener y destruye los derechos que deba
respetar, ponindose al servicio de gente sin escrpulos, que prcticamente
sin riesgos explotan a la persona, libertad y propiedad de otros,
convirtiendo la expoliacin, o sea a la corrupcin, en un derecho del
gobernante y de sus allegados. Es entonces cuando la ley manejada a su
antojo por el poder poltico logra su trnsito de corrupcin. As fue como
en Mxico y en otros pases se cre una estructura legal, buscando
garantizar derechos sociales y econmicos que exceden a los fundamentales
derechos individuales, que para ser satisfechos requieren del uso compulsivo
de la ley en transferir y redistribuir la riqueza. As se dise toda esta
ingeniera de pillaje y extorsin socioeconmica de impuestos, regulaciones,
protecciones, subsidios, licencias, permisos, concesiones, transferencias,
etc., plasmada por doquier en nuestra Constitucin y leyes secundarias. Por
el contrario, debiramos entender la ley,  igual que Bastiat, como un
concepto de naturaleza negativa. Esto es, el propsito de la ley es evitar
que reine la  injusticia. La verdadera justicia slo se alcanza mediante la
erradicacin de la injusticia. Cuando la ley impone por la fuerza una
restriccin al trabajo de los individuos o transfiere riqueza sin el acuerdo
o compensacin de los afectados, est actuando positivamente y la sociedad
entonces queda en manos del poltico de turno en el poder, abrindose las
puertas de par en par a la corrupcin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por ello, antes de crear una nueva legislacin ineficiente, dirigida
combatir la corrupcin, hay que revisar con honestidad y con precisin
jurdica todo ese cuerpo de leyes que han creado privilegios y de hecho han
concedido licencias para expoliar y saquear a los ciudadanos, bajo un
rgimen de impunidad. Las recientes y escandalosas revelaciones de
corrupcin son emanaciones de un pantano ya bien conocido por todos. Los
polticos y empresarios que han disfrutado por dcadas los rentables frutos
del "me das, te doy", saben perfectamente cmo manejar ese sistema de
infinita complejidad en que se ha constituido la manera de hacer negocios en
Mxico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Podrn rodar las cabezas de prominentes miembros de la lite
polticoempresarial del pas, segn la guillotina desafilada de nuestro
sistema de justicia, si as lo determinan nuestros jueces -lo que falta por
verse-, pero si no se atiende el verdadero origen del saqueo al amparo de la
ley, que permite lucrar desde los puestos pblicos mediante la manipulacin
de leyes y reglamentos, con decretos que crean regmenes de excepcin en
favor de un grupo o sector, con protecciones a la banca, industria y al
comercio, en perjuicio del libre ingreso de nuevos competidores al mercado,
la corrupcin no cesar y la misma sofisticacin de que ya goza el crimen
organizado har que retoe. Conclusin: La corrupcin, como las escaleras,
se barre de arriba hacia abajo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Citemos finalmente a Montesquieu, quien en "El espritu de las leyes",
nos dice: "Hay dos gneros de corrupcin: una cuando el pueblo no observa
las leyes, y el otro cuando el pueblo es corrompido por las leyes, mal
incurable ya que radica en el nico remedio que el mal tendra".

<h2>
LA INEFICAZ ESTRATEGIA CONTRA LAS DROGAS 
</h2>     
     
     
Agustn Navarro*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En 1919 fue ratificada la enmienda 18 de la
Constitucin de Estados Unidos, conocida como la "Ley de la Prohibicin" de
licores. La aplicacin de esa ley fue desastrosa en trminos de corrupcin y
florecimiento del crimen organizado hasta su derogacin en 1933. Los
efectos antisociales que tuvo la prohibicin del licor se asemejan a los que
enfrentamos hoy con las drogas. Las autoridades internacionales, encabezadas
y presionadas por el gobierno de Estados Unidos, estn concentradas en su
prohibicin al costo que sea, tanto poltico, econmico o social. El
fundamento conceptual es que ciertas drogas  -arbitrariamente seleccionadas-
son ilegales y sujetas a una persecucin implacable.
<dd>	Se argumenta que las drogas son perjudiciales y por tanto se debe evitar su
uso. Fuera de la consideracin bsica sobre quin tiene derecho a
determinar coercitivamente qu debe o no autoadministrarse un mayor de
edad?, conviene distinguir entre el uso y el abuso. Hasta los alimentos
pueden ser muy perjudiciales si se abusa de ellos. Por tanto, el simple uso
no es una justificacin suficiente para considerar algo ilegal y prohibirlo. 
Para demostrar lo anterior y exponer el grave error conceptual comparo tres
alcaloides (drogas): la nicotina, la cafena y la cocana (dos legales y una
ilegal), que comprueba la arbitrariedad oficial en su clasificacin.
<dd>	La nicotina es un alcaloide lquido muy alcalino que se obtiene de las
hojas del tabaco y es una de las drogas ms txicas que existen. Acta con
una rapidez comparable a la del cianuro de potasio. La dosis letal de
nicotina es de alrededor de 60 mg. y dosis tan pequeas como 4 mg. pueden
producir sntomas alarmantes en individuos no habituados. A pesar de que un
cigarro puede contener hasta 30 mg., la inhalacin de nicotina no resulta
tan txica como se esperara y son las secuelas del tabaquismo las ms
dainas. La nicotina produce al principio efectos estimulantes (disminuye el
aletargamiento y la fatiga) y posteriormente deprime el sistema nervioso,
mediante bloqueo neuromuscular sobre el sistema cardiovascular y
respiratorio. Tiene efectos antidiurticos severos, induce la liberacin de
adrenalina, produciendo excitacin, temblores y convulsiones, hipertensin
arterial, taquicardia, vasoconstriccin y aumento del flujo coronario.
Incrementa la secrecin bronquial y salival. Produce diarrea, nusea y
vmito. Su uso frecuente crea hbito y tolerancia. 
<dd>	La cafena es un alcaloide soluble del grupo de las xantinas que se
encuentra en distintas variedades de los frutos y semillas de las plantas
del caf, t, cacao, mate y en refrescos de cola. Es un poderoso estimulante
del sistema nervioso central. Mejora la asociacin de ideas y el flujo en el
pensamiento. Es un estimulante vasomotor y un potente diurtico, que tambin
contrae al msculo cardiaco y relaja al msculo liso bronquial e intestinal.
En dosis altas de cafena predomina la vasodilatacin perifrica sobre la
vasoconstriccin coronaria y pulmonar. Sin embargo, disminuye el flujo
sanguneo cerebral por el aumento de la resistencia circulatoria. Tambin
acorta el tiempo de coagulacin. La dosis txica fatal humana es de 10 gr.
Sin embargo, los sntomas de toxicidad (insomnio, excitacin, inquietud,
trastornos sensoriales en odo y visin, tensin y temblores musculares,
taquicardia, palpitaciones y aumento en el ritmo respiratorio) ya se
presentan a partir de ingestiones de 1 gr. Su uso frecuente crea hbito y
tolerancia. El t negro tiene un 2% de cafena, una taza de caf tiene entre
100 a 150 mg. de cafena y en individuos no habituados una sola taza puede
producir efectos txicos. 
<dd>	La cocana es un alcaloide que se obtiene de las hojas de la coca, que
contienen entre un 0,6% a 1,8% de este anestsico local que bloquea la
conduccin nerviosa en donde se aplica y que tiene un importante efecto
colateral como estimulante del sistema nervioso central, produciendo
inquietud, excitabilidad y locuacidad. Aumenta la capacidad del trabajo
muscular, disminuyendo la fatiga y acelerando el ritmo respiratorio. A la
estimulacin central le sigue una depresin. Su uso frecuente crea hbito.
Produce taquicardia, vasoconstriccin, aumento de la temperatura, dilatacin
de la pupilas. Se absorbe en todos los sitios de aplicacin, incluso  en las
mucosas. Ingerida, la cocana se hidroliza y es inefectiva. Se destruye
(metaboliza) ms rpidamente que la mayora de los alcaloides. La dosis
fatal es de aproximadamente 1,2 gr. Sin embargo, en individuos no
habituados, dosis desde 20 mg. tienen efectos txicos.
<dd>	An sin entrar a comparar drogas como el alcohol y la marihuana, no son
vlidos los argumentos de toxicidad de unas sustancias o siquiera el de la
letalidad de las dosis para hacer ilegales a unas drogas (cocana) y a otras
no (nicotina y cafena). El abuso del alcohol (droga legal) est ms
asociado a criminalidad, accidentes, destruccin familiar y dao corporal
que consumir marihuana (droga ilegal). Toda esta ingeniera burocrtica
prohibicionista se ha hecho para sustentar ese fundamentalismo
anticientfico que prevalece en la legislacin antidrogas y continuar
justificando que las drogas son un problema legal y criminal, en vez de uno
de salud pblica, de medicina y educacin preventiva, formas mucho ms
adecuadas para disminuir su uso y especialmente su abuso.
<dd>	Se han llenado las crceles de todos nuestros pases de presos por "delitos
contra la salud" (en California ms del 85%) y Estados Unidos ya ha gastado
ms de $150,000 millones en esta guerra santa, pero el narcotrfico y la
corrupcin siguen aumentando. Parecera  que los zares antidrogas y los
nuevos Elliot Ness esperan que se contaminen las fuerzas armadas de nuestros
pases para intervenir en forma directa como ocurri en Panam y que
nuestros sistemas bancarios, financieros y empresariales se vean inundados y
controlados por el dinero lavado No es, acaso, la ayuda tecnolgica y
financiera antidrogas la nueva "zanahoria" y el nuevo "garrote" que
condicionan el otorgamiento unilateral de la "Certificacin"? 
<dd>	Hay muchas formas de lucrar con las drogas. El crimen organizado -tanto en
su versin gangsteril y violenta, como en la de traje y corbata- bien sabe
que las dificultades impuestas slo aumentan sus mrgenes de
comercializacin. Pero hay otros "sepulcros blanqueados" que tambin lucran
desde la burocracia, con un puritanismo anticientfico y un fundamentalismo
casi religioso, combatiendo a las drogas en forma tal que nunca se resuelva
el problema y si se empeora, mejor para sus intereses personales.  
<dd>	Utilizar con propsitos comparativos la nicotina y la cafena no insina su
criminalizacin, sino probar lo discrecional y arbitrario de la
clasificacin actual de las drogas. Uno de los grandes placeres de la vida
es tomarse un buen caf  y  fumarse un buen tabaco. &copy;

<H2>LA ETICA Y EL MERCADO</H2>
Agustn Navarro*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A menudo escuchamos crticas al mercado libre con
argumentos de que "la mano invisible" es impulsada por las ms bajas
pasiones de hombres perversos, sin freno tico ni humanitario en la
consecucin de sus aviesos fines de lucro. Tal crtica demuestra una
ignorancia monumental sobre la naturaleza del mercado, pero crea un ambiente
propicio para todo gnero de alternativas fantasiosas y dainas en
regularlo, restringirlo o impedir de plano su funcionamiento.
<dd>
El mercado es simplemente un proceso de intercambio de informacin basado en
los precios como sistema de sealizacin, los cuales concertan y armonizan
ofertas de productores con las demandas de consumidores de bienes y
servicios. En la medida que las seales de los precios sean libres, sin
controles o artificios, la informacin ser fiel y el mercado eficiente.
<dd>
Por tanto, al ser slo un proceso, el mercado es ticamente
neutro. No requiere ni de egosmo o maldad, como tampoco de altruismo y
caridad para funcionar. Lo que requiere la economa para funcionar no son
agentes ticamente calificados sino racionales. 
<dd>
El argumento central de la presunta inmoralidad del mercado
es la famosa "maximizacin de las ganancias" por parte de los participantes,
argumentando que no existira en un mundo ticamente perfecto, donde lo
importante es ayudar al prjimo,  concluyendo que el mercado est
fundamentado en una expoliacin utilitaria e inmoral. Sin embargo, la
realidad es que la maximizacin de las utilidades funciona tan bien en una
sociedad de santos como de diablos. La nica diferencia es que los santos
aplicarn las utilidades a elevados fines filantrpicos y los avaros las
usarn para fines de diversin materialista y egosta. La moralidad,
entonces, no radica en la obtencin de ganancias sino en su uso. Las
ganancias claramente no son el ltimo objetivo.
<dd>
No hay impedimento alguno para la plena convivencia del
mercado y la tica, bajo el funcionamiento del sistema de precios libres,
basado necesariamente en la maximizacin de las ganancias. Lo importante es
aclarar que el mercado es ticamente neutro, ya que promueve eficientemente
el logro de metas de todo tipo y, por tanto, es independiente de los
principios ticos o no de los actores que en l participan.
<dd>                
Al reconocer que en el libre mercado (capitalismo) pueden
coexistir individualidades y conductas inmorales con otras que no lo son
surge el requisito para su buen funcionamiento de un marco de derechos de
propiedad que elimine el dao social derivado de conductas repugnantes.
Cuando se respetan las reglas del sistema, los derechos de propiedad de la
mayora no podrn ser violados como resultado del comportamiento inmoral de
algunos. Por el contrario, el sistema de mercado libre asla y protege a los
participantes del perjuicio directo derivado de la conducta inmoral de algunos. 
<dd>                
No existe otro sistema socio-econmico que ofrezca esta
proteccin y garanta. Adems, el productivo y espontneo "contrato" social
que ofrece el mercado, basado en la divisin del trabajo, especializacin,
descubrimiento de oportunidades de servir a los consumidores y todo ese
proceso coordinado por el sistema de precios, permite que el nivel de vida
de la poblacin se vea beneficiado involuntariamente, an por aquellos que
actan inmoralmente.
<dd> 	
Baste decir que an los vicios privados pueden generar bienes pblicos.
Esto, claro est, no nos exonera de denunciar y repudiar los comportamientos
inmorales, como la corrupcin, el engao y la avaricia. Al final de cuentas
todos somos humanos imperfectos, pero tampoco podemos argumentar que el
mercado y la tica se oponen, o que la inmoralidad es un requisito para que
el mercado funcione. Ms bien, es en el mercado donde la tica tiene mayor
campo de accin y la inmoralidad es ms inofensiva, en razn directa a la
multitud de opciones que el mercado libre le ofrece a la sociedad.

<h2>
SUICIDIO ELECTORAL REPUBLICANO
</h2>
Grover G. Norquist*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Imagnese por un momento ser el candidato a la cabeza en
la carrera por la nominacin de su partido a la presidencia de Estados
Unidos. Entonces, un colega suyo, miembro de su propio partido, quien ha
anunciado su retiro del Congreso, introduce un proyecto legislativo que, sin
duda alguna, enemistar profundamente a 2,5 millones de votantes. Adems,
esa misma legislacin contiene aspectos extremadamente ofensivos para grupos
de fieles partidarios. Y, como si fuera poco, 1996 es el primer ao de
elecciones desde tiempos de Eisenhower en que su partido tiene la
oportunidad de alcanzar la Casa Blanca y mantener la mayora en el Congreso.
Pero, a la vez, necesita todo el apoyo posible para ganar la nominacin y
luego las elecciones nacionales. Por qu entonces permitirle a este colega
que ponga todo esto en peligro?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese es el dilema que enfrenta Bob Dole con su colega, el senador Alan
Simpson, quien ha introducido un proyecto legislativo sobre inmigracin que
es un desastre en potencia para el Partido Republicano. Permitir que se
discuta en el Congreso es una psima idea por multitud de razones.
Cualquiera que sea el resultado, se ofender a un grupo importante de
partidarios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El proyecto de Simpson le dice a 2,5 millones de ciudadanos estadounidenses
que se olviden de las peticiones para traer a sus familiares a este pas.
Toda esa gente que ha cumplido con las leyes y ha estado esperando hasta 10
aos veran que, gracias a los republicanos, el gobierno cambi las reglas.
Gran parte de estos 2,5 millones de votantes, quienes adems viven en los
estados con ms votos electorales (Nueva York, California, Illinois,
Florida, Massachusetts y Michigan), van a votar nicamente en razn de este
asunto en particular.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Visas para familiares no es un asunto que concierne a la gran mayora de
los votantes. Se trata de un escenario nico: si se aprueba la ley, los
republicanos perdern 2,5 millones de votos. Si no se aprueba, no perdern
ningn voto. Estn oyendo esto los candidatos republicanos?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este proyecto de ley contiene cosas aborrecidas por diferentes grupos de
republicanos. El Partido Republicano es el partido de quienes quieren bajar
impuestos, sin embargo esta ley le aumenta los impuestos a la clase media,
impone nuevos impuestos al cruzar la frontera y a las empresas que emplean
extranjeros. Tales aumentos se reflejarn en los precios que pagan los
consumidores.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adems, se planea darle a cada ciudadano estadounidense una tarjeta
nacional de identidad, con algn tipo de "identificador biomtrico", tales
como huellas digitales o registro de la retina que tendra que ser revisado
por los empleadores. Por primera vez, en la historia de este pas, nadie
podra conseguir empleo sin el visto bueno del gobierno federal. Todo
norteamericano que aprecie su libertad debe sentirse ofendido por tal
legislacin, especialmente aquellos grupos que sufren de persecucin oficial
y que tienden por ello a ser republicanos, como los dueos de armas y
quienes dan clases particulares a sus hijos por no gustarles las escuelas
pblicas. Segn el Servicio de Inmigracin (INS), la instrumentacin de una
tarjeta de identidad o registro nacional de trabajadores costara no menos
de $6.000 millones.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Y, sencillamente, no funcionar.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quienes quieran contratar a indocumentados lo seguirn haciendo. Slo
servir para estorbar a los ciudadanos que legalmente buscan trabajo. El INS
calcula que alrededor de 27% de su documentacin est errada. Si
milagrosamente lograran que slo 2% de sus datos estuvieran equivocados, a
1,3 millones de estadounidenses se les negara arbitrariamente el empleo y
tendran que introducir peticiones al gobierno. Cualquiera que haya tenido
tratos con el gobierno federal sabe cunto tarda cualquier trmite y el
problema que ello representara para quien tiene que pagar la hipoteca y
alimentar a la familia.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lanzarse a una eleccin habiendo apoyado el proyecto de ley Simpson
equivaldra a que Bob Dole le pidiera a James McDougal (el socio de Clinton
en Whitewater) que le financiara la campaa presidencial.

<H2>EL DEPORTE COMO MAESTRO</H2>
Michael Novak*<br>
<p>



WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  No es fcil ser buena gente. Honestidad, lealtad,
auto-control, disciplina y consistencia son atributos que tienen que
aprenderse para tener una buena y exitosa vida. Son tambin las cosas que
distinguen a los buenos atletas. Por eso las historias de dedicacin al
trabajo, determinacin, saber aguantar derrotas y no perder la cabeza con el
xito son parte del buen camino.<p>
	Los atletas tienen que aprender a aceptar derrotas. Hay que aguantar el
calambre en la pierna y sobreponerse a las preocupaciones. El campen
triunfa sobre las presiones. De esa manera los deportes nos ensean a vivir.
Nos entrenan a cumplir con nuestras obligaciones y a obedecer rdenes. Pero
hay ms en la vida moral que eso y el deporte nos da la visin grande. El
deporte nos entrena a dominarnos. Aprendemos a fomentar nuestras habilidades
y a controlar nuestros hbitos, a darle la cara a retos difciles y a
convertirnos en mejores personas.<p>
	Lo esencial para convertirnos en personas morales es hacer el bien en forma
natural. Hacer las cosas bien, como parte de nuestra propia naturaleza. Eso
implica esfuerzo y dedicacin. A menudo se comienza cambiando nuestra
actitud y buscando motivacin. Uno debe querer cambiar y estar dispuesto a
trabajar por conseguir pequeas mejoras constantemente, a travs de mucho
tiempo.<p>
	En cierta forma, los deportes ensean mejor la moral que las leyes. Con
demarcaciones, las leyes definen lo que no se puede hacer y, en ciertas
ocasiones, tambin definen lo que s se puede hacer, al prescribir las
reglas. En el deporte tambin se tienen que aprender las reglas. Pero un
buen deportista tiene que ir mucho ms lejos, tiene que aadir fortaleza,
exactitud y gracia.<p>
	Y hay otros aspectos morales en el deporte. El deporte es esencialmente
competitivo y el deportista con suerte es el que se enfrenta a otros grandes
atletas que lo empujarn a alcanzar lo ms alto, de otra forma nunca
averiguara cun grande hubiera podido ser. Cuando no hay necesidad de
herosmo, no surgen hroes.<p>
	Algo parecido sucede en la vida moral. Hasta que no confrontamos un grave
problema no se prueban nuestras virtudes. Entonces es que nos enteramos de
lo que la fuerza moral significa y si la tenemos o no.<p>
	Las olimpadas nos recuerdan la tradicin moral del deporte. Los griegos no
las concibieron simplemente como un gran espectculo de entretenimiento.
Estaban ms bien calibrando virtudes, hbitos productivos, logros; eran ms
una exhibicin de la belleza del espritu humano que alguna distorsin
muscular del cuerpo. An hoy en da las olimpadas siguen siendo una
celebracin del espritu y de los valores clsicos.<p>
	Me pregunto qu haramos por la educacin moral de nuestros nios si no
existieran los deportes. En qu otra actividad los jvenes de hoy aprenden
a resistir el dolor y la derrota? Dnde ms se esfuerzan por alcanzar
perfeccin? Algunas veces se fajan a trabajar en sus estudios, pero a menudo
hacen el mnimo posible. Y en cuanto a las obligaciones y trabajos en la
casa, en la vida moderna no tienen la urgencia de antes y es realmente poco
lo que ayudan. Pero en los deportes aoran hacerlo bien. Es bello verlo.
Nunca vi a mis hijos con caras ms serias que cuando estaban compitiendo en
algn deporte.<p>
	Vale la pena tomar el deporte en serio. Cualquier labor que busca alcanzar
la excelencia ofrece un estupendo objetivo. No es fcil mantener presentes
las lecciones aprendidas en el deporte durante el resto de nuestras vidas,
pero cunto ms pobres seramos si no tuviramos al deporte como maestro. <p>

<h2>
UNA AGENDA PARA DESTRUIR A VENEZUELA
</h2>     
     
     
Jorge Olavarra*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En los dos primeros aos de la segunda presidencia de
Rafael Caldera se formularon siete planes econmicos de nombres llamativos,
presentados todos con una fanfarria publicitaria que prometa corregir el
dficit fiscal, estabilizar la moneda, reducir tanto la deuda interna como
la externa y abatir la inflacin.  En cada caso, se nos dijo que tras un
sacrificio inicial, la prosperidad y la bonanza estaban a la vuelta de la
esquina.
<dd>	En dos aos, el presidente Caldera ha acumulado el mayor dficit fiscal de
la historia venezolana, aumentado la deuda y producido las mayores y ms
brutales devaluaciones. Ahora sus ministros anuncian que tendremos que
sufrir una inflacin superior al 100%; le "cambiarn el perfil" a la deuda
externa, pero la seguirn aumentando para pagar con ms deuda los "programas
sociales". En la historia mundial de la planificacin no hay absurdo
semejante y en Venezuela no hay precedente para un fracaso de esta magnitud.
Como barco a la deriva en mar tormentoso, el gobierno de Caldera pasa de un
plan a otro. Sus objetivos se anuncian en cada caso con trompetas solemnes,
pero al poco tiempo los planes y objetivos se hunden en el olvido y nadie se
molesta en recordar las promesas ni contrastarlas con los resultados. No
hubo nunca una razn, una excusa o una explicacin. Simplemente, cada  Plan
se enterr en silencio y al poco tiempo se produjo... otro plan. El ltimo
es la "Agenda Venezuela". 
<dd>No podemos olvidar que seguimos gobernados por un presidente que en 1994 se
vio enfrentado a problemas econmicos que no entenda y que hoy sigue sin
entender. Por fuerza de sus errores y omisiones, el gobierno ha sido llevado
a hacer en 1996 lo que en 1993 Rafael Caldera dijo que jams hara. Y la
actual campaa publicitaria para vender la "Agenda Venezuela" es un insulto
a la inteligencia de los venezolanos, utilizando actores de la televisin
para mentirle al pas acerca de su presente y su futuro. 
<dd>Especialmente irritante es la publicidad que empieza afirmando que un pas
con $18 mil millones en ingresos anuales no es pobre y termina diciendo que
no es cobarde el pas que libert a medio continente. Es inslito que un
gobierno que ha tenido que acudir de rodillas ante el prestamista
internacional de ltima instancia, porque no puede pagar lo que debe, alegue
por boca de un actor en un mensaje pagado que no es pobre porque recibe una
enorme renta petrolera. La verdad de la magnitud de su ingreso petrolero es
precisamente lo que incrimina al presidente Caldera como incompetente para
administrarla. Hacer una propaganda falsa para generar un optimismo
mentiroso contradice los sacrificios que sus ministros anuncian. Apelar a
una emocin patritica es comparar nuestro lamentable presente con nuestro
pasado heroico. 
<dd>Slo un gobierno encerrado en el laberinto de su soledad es capaz de hacer
una campaa publicitaria que implcitamente presenta el ltimo plan de
poltica econmica como genial correctivo de los errores del mismo gobierno. 
Si en vez de los cmicos locutores y actores contratados se hicieran
anuncios con los ex ministros y dems responsables del caos, quiz los
venezolanos empezaran a creer en la Agenda Venezuela. Pues slo la
sumatoria de tales talentos sera capaz de explicar cmo es bueno y porqu
est en buen camino un plan econmico que le exprime a una economa
deprimida los recursos que necesita para volcarlos en mantener un aparato
burocrtico parasitario, estril, inepto y corrupto. Slo ellos son capaces
de explicar la maravilla de devaluar la moneda para producir una "utilidad
cambiaria", con la cual nivelar este ao el dficit fiscal y, al mismo
tiempo, garantizar que el ao entrante se lograr acabar con la inflacin. 
Ahora bien, cuando la "Agenda Venezuela" desemboque en inevitable
catstrofe, que no  vengan a decirnos que su fracaso se debi a las voces
agoreras, a los profetas del desastre que sembraron rumores y minaron la
confianza.
<dd>El "caso Venezuela" es la madre de todas las paradojas. La ms importante es
que la economa venezolana ha logrado acopiar todos los vicios y pecados del
capitalismo sin obtener ninguna de sus ventajas, al igual que todos los
vicios y pecados del estatismo socializante sin  ninguno de sus logros. Como
lo han constatado los economistas extranjeros, las reformas tropiezan con
problemas similares a los que enfrentan los pases del ex bloque sovitico.
Aquella parte de su economa que podra llamarse "privada" o "capitalista"
tiene la moral flaca y los msculos fofos por proteccionismos, subsidios y
toda clase de malos hbitos que no la recomiendan para competir exitosamente
fuera de su invernadero, dentro del cual actan con un mercado insincero e
imperfecto que anula las ventajas del capitalismo, mientras exagera sus
defectos. La economa privada venezolana es un muestrario vivo de los peores
vicios del mercantilismo inmoral y del socialismo inepto.
Winston Churchill deca que el vicio inherente del capitalismo es el reparto
desigual de la riqueza que genera y el vicio inherente del socialismo es el
reparto igualitario de la miseria que produce. Los venezolanos hemos logrado
llevar el defecto corregible del capitalismo a extremos obscenos y el vicio
del socialismo a magnitudes monstruosas. &copy;

<h2>
EL 'COMERCIALISMO' OLIMPICO DE ATLANTA
</h2>     
<P>
Filip Palda*
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).
-- Algunos de los burcratas que controlan losjuegos internacionales acusaron de "vulgar" y de "comercializada" las
recientes olimpadas de Atlanta, prometiendo impedir su repeticin.
Samaranch y su grupo prefieren el fuete gubernamental antes que la mano
invisible del mercado. Pero veamos lo que en realidad sucedi en Atlanta.<P>
 Los juegos fueron organizados por gente que se puso de acuerdo entre s. La
belleza de los acuerdos y de los contratos es que obliga a la gente a pensar
y a hacer el mejor uso de la informacin. Si los organizadores quieren
construir un parque no emiten, simplemente, un cheque con cargo a los
contribuyentes de impuestos, sino que tienen que convencer a patrocinantes
como la IBM para que aporten el dinero. Entonces, esa empresa se pregunta si
el despliegue de su logotipo en ese parque justifica la inversin que los
organizadores exigen. Los ejecutivos tratarn de calcular si ello
representar un beneficio para los accionistas de la empresa, de manera
similar a como beneficiar a los espectadores y usuarios del parque. Slo
cuando las dos partes resultan beneficiadas funciona el mercado. Por eso las
olimpadas organizadas conforme al libre mercado, como la de Atlanta, son
democrticas y eficientes.
<P> Cuando el gobierno financia los juegos, los acuerdos sensatos son
reemplazados por imposiciones y tcticas de fuerza. Los contribuyentes
tienen que aportar el dinero, les guste o no. Ese tipo de financiamiento
produce una olimpada tipo Montreal, donde se cometieron equivocaciones por
mil millones de dlares a costa del pblico cautivo.
<P> El financiamiento a travs de impuestos impide que los organizadores hagan
uso de sus cerebros en inventar y desarrollar mejores maneras de servir a
los atletas. A qu burcrata con una bolsa de dinero proveniente de los
impuestos se le hubiera ocurrido el concepto del Aro Reebok? El Aro Reebok
era el sitio en Atlanta donde los atletas rusos participantes en las
olimpadas podan escoger equipos deportivos Reebok, por cortesa de la
empresa. En una olimpada de libre mercado, las naciones que hasta hace poco
estaban dispuestas a destruirse mutuamente buscaban maneras de ayudar a sus
atletas.
<P> La prensa ignor todo lo bueno que surgi al organizar los juegos con la
ayuda del comercio. Los periodistas ms bien se quejaban de la lentitud de
los autobuses en el trfico, de desperfectos en las computadoras y de los
agresivos vendedores de camisetas. Los reporteros no supieron detectar la
noticia ms importante: cmo los atletas, los empresarios y los espectadores
obtuvieron algo sin obligar al distante contribuyente de impuestos para que
pagara la cuenta por su entretenimiento y disfrute.

<H2> LOS MUROS POLITICOS</H2>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En un reciente viaje a Europa cruc por carretera
las fronteras de varios pases y lo nico que vi fueron instalaciones
abandonadas, donde antes detenan a los vehculos para pedir pasaportes y
revisar las maletas de los pasajeros. Ahora, esas garitas estn polvorientas
y desoladas. Los autos y la gente circulan libremente.
El extranjero que llega a Europa solamente tiene que presentar su pasaporte
y visa cuando entra a alguna nacin de la Comunidad Europea, pero una vez
dentro, se mueve libremente por todos los pases integrantes de la unin.
En una de las obsoletas instalaciones fronterizas me detuve, tom fotos y
pens sobre todos los aos que innecesariamente y sin ningn beneficio al
bien comn los gobiernos de los diversos pases que ahora integran la
Comunidad Europea obstaculizaron el libre paso de personas y mercancas en
nombre de la soberana, el nacionalismo, la seguridad interna, la proteccin
al empleo, a las empresas nacionales, etc.<p>
	El camino para abolir las innecesarias y antieconmicas fronteras fue
largo, azaroso y controvertido, pero es un triunfo de la razn, el sentido
comn y los principios econmicos sobre el egosmo, los intereses de ciertos
grupos y los mal entendidos conceptos de nacionalismo y de soberana.<p>
	La ausencia de fronteras entre Espaa y Francia no ha desdibujado la
nacionalidad francesa ni daado la soberana espaola. Los espaoles siguen
siendo espaoles, los franceses, franceses y los portugueses, portugueses.<p>
	Desgraciadamente, en Mxico y el resto de Centro y Sudamrica todava se
escuchan voces arcaicas que identifican los valores patrios y nacionales con
una burocracia que, con aires de perdonavidas, deciden quin entra o no
entra en un pas y qu mercancas pasan.<p>
Las aduanas y las fronteras no nacen como consecuencia de una necesidad
social ni mucho menos para mejorar la convivencia entre los pueblos, sino
como un medio de recaudar dinero para hacer frente a los gastos de los
gobernantes, proteger a empresarios amigos en perjuicio de los niveles de
vida de los habitantes.<p>
	Actualmente se mencionan los ms diversos argumentos para mantener las
fronteras entre los pases de Latinoamrica o con Estados Unidos:
diferencias de ingresos, migraciones masivas, asimetras de los mercados,
etc. Todas esas razones y argumentos tambin obstaculizaron durante muchos
aos la integracin Europea, pero al final se impuso la sensatez y el
sentido comn ante el miedo, los intereses mezquinos y los burcratas que
buscan reglamentaciones, obstculos y aduanas como una fuente de poder y
enriquecimiento.<p>
Despus de dos guerras y de millones de muertos, los europeos se dieron
cuenta que la nica forma de evitar una nueva confrontacin es la
integracin econmica.<p>
Aparecern lderes y estadistas en Iberoamrica que recojan la experiencia
europea y luchen porque en un futuro, lo ms cercano posible, las fronteras
entre nuestros pases se conviertan en similares vestigios de la
irracionalidad econmica?  Fronteras que durante tres cuartos de siglo nos
han mantenido divididos y que han sido un factor determinante de nuestro
atraso y pobreza.  <p>

<H2>GASTO SOCIAL O DERROCHE FISCAL?</H2>
Luis Pazos*<br>
<p>
CUIDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Una crtica frecuente de los partidos de izquierda
al gobierno es el insuficiente nivel de gasto social. Constantemente se
exige el aument del gasto pblico en obras sociales. 
<P>
El presidente Ernesto Zedillo, en referencia a la importancia del gasto
social en su administracin, seal en su segundo informe anual que "de cada
cien pesos que el gobierno programa gastar, ms de la mitad, 54 pesos, se
destinan a mejorar las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y
las comunidades". Ese porcentaje, ms de la mitad del gasto total del
estado, es similar a lo que tericamente ha sido destinado por casi todos
los gobiernos mexicanos en los ltimos 25 aos a lo que llaman gasto social.
Las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y las comunidades,
tericamente destinatarias de ese gasto social, lejos de mejorar en el
ltimo cuarto de siglo han empeorado su situacin. Aritmticamente podemos
concluir que los 54 pesos de cada cien de gasto social han sido casi en su
totalidad derrochados y desperdiciados.
<P>
Sobre el nmero de familias beneficiadas por los subsidios, el presidente
seal en su ltimo informe: "A travs del sistema de abasto popular se
atiende a cerca de 30 millones de personas, principalmente del medio rural.
Se apoya a 2,8 millones de familias de bajos ingresos para el consumo de
tortilla y a 5,2 millones de nios para el de leche". El abasto popular que,
segn dijo el presidente atiende a 30 millones de personas, se instrumenta
principalmente a travs de la Confederacin Nacional de Subsistencias
Populares (CONASUPO). Es un hecho conocido por el pblico que ese organismo,
representativo del gasto social, ha sido una de las principales fuentes de
enriquecimiento de la alta burocracia. Gran parte de lo subsidios al maz y
a la leche han ido a parar realmente a cuentas en el extranjero de
familiares de funcionarios, no slo bajo Salinas de Gortari, sino desde que
fue creada esa empresa estatal. 
<P>
Una cosa es ayudar a los ms pobres y otra sostener que esa ayuda se d a
travs de la burocracia gubernamental que, como lo demuestra la experiencia
en todo el mundo, en poco beneficia a los marginados. La solucin no es
cambiar los directivos de los organismos estatales de asistencia social cada
seis aos ni encarcelar a aquellos que circunstancialmente se les descubren
manejos fraudulentos, sino buscar nuevas formas para que los recursos ahora
destinados al gasto social no se queden en el camino, principalmente en
manos de quienes los administran.
<P>
Si el gobierno dejara de gastar los 54 pesos por cada 100 pesos que destina
al llamado gasto social, que a la fecha en muy poco ha beneficiado a los
mexicanos pobres y recorta, a la vez, en 54% sus gastos, podra reducir, sin
crear un dficit, tanto el tope del impuesto sobre la renta a la mitad (a
17%),  como el IVA tambin a la mitad (a 7,5% ) y rebajar al mismo tiempo el
impuesto de la gasolina tambin en 50%. Esos cambios provocaran tal
actividad y bienestar econmico, que los tericos destinatarios del gasto
social encontraran de inmediato oportunidades de elevar su nivel de vida. 
Por qu es difcil instrumentar tan favorables cambios?  Porque cientos de
miles de burcratas han sido por mucho tiempo los verdaderos beneficiarios
de gran parte del llamado gasto social y se oponen a perder sus prebendas.
La mayor parte del gasto social se queda en sueldos, prestaciones,
desviaciones, negocios y gastos de operacin de la burocracia encargada de
manejarlo. Y aun lo poco que llega a los pobres es distribuido con criterio
de clientelismo poltico ms que de acuerdo a verdaderas necesidades
econmicas. 
<P>
Existe una clara contradiccin entre quienes por un lado sealan la
inoperancia y corrupcin del gasto social, pero al mismo tiempo exigen que
el gobierno incremente ese mismo gasto social.

EDUCACION ESTATAL Y POBREZA
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

<P>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (AIPE).- Desde el tiempo de los conquistadores espaoles,
la bsqueda de riqueza en Chile se dirigi hacia el suelo. Para algunos esto
signific la exploracin en busca de minerales valiosos escondidos bajo
tierra: oro y plata, despus salitre y finalmente cobre. Para otros fue el
cultivo de la tierra frtil que produce trigo, frutas y madera. Siglos ms
tarde, las principales exportaciones de Chile todava provienen del suelo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero si la importancia econmica de la tierra es un asunto en que existe
pleno acuerdo, la interrogante acerca de "cmo" debe generarse la riqueza en
Chile ha sido el campo de batalla de  doctrinas econmicas opuestas. Ese
debate, que adopt especial fuerza en los aos 60, degener en un violento y
agudo conflicto que produjo una enorme crisis econmica y la quiebra del
sistema democrtico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La doctrina socialista, ya sea en su variante comunitaria o marxista, no
comprendi que el verdadero capital productivo es aquel que deriva su valor
a travs de la creatividad y diligencia de su propietario operando en
mercados libres. Por el contrario, erigieron al Estado como gran
redistribuidor de riqueza.	La esencia de esa visin estatista se encarn en
la gran Reforma Agraria de 1966. El gobierno democratacristiano de la poca
intent demostrar que la riqueza se poda redistribuir tan fcilmente como
la tierra.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Agraria se extendera
luego a la expropiacin de la minera del cobre y a un ataque generalizado
al derecho de propiedad. Los estatistas creen que la propiedad no necesita
realmente un dueo y son firmes partidarios de la propiedad pblica, pues
ella efectivamente significa que nadie es dueo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero no slo debe tener la propiedad un claro dueo; el dueo debe tener
la suficiente seguridad para que se interese por mantener e invertir en su
propiedad. Si el Estado puede disponer de la propiedad privada, quitndole a
unos y entregndole a otros, ni los ganadores ni los perdedores de ese
ejercicio del poder poltico se sentirn protegidos y seguros de su
propiedad, como para asumir riesgos e invertir capitales para incrementar su
valor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1981, la Reforma Minera chilena enfrent a la visin socialista que
haba generado la Reforma Agraria y gener la ocasin para un claro y
dramtico contraste. Al crear verdaderos derechos de propiedad en el sector
econmico de mayor tamao y de mayor sensibilidad poltica, el mensaje a los
inversionistas nacionales y extranjeros fue que la propiedad privada en
Chile era, desde ese momento, un derecho absolutamente seguro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	As fue como, en 15 aos, se llevaron a cabo en Chile dos reformas de gran
importancia y conceptualmente antagnicas, cada una ofreciendo su definicin
del tipo de economa que sera preferible para el pas. Un gobierno
demuestra coherencia en su poltica econmica segn cmo contesta una
pregunta bsica: Cul es la llave del tesoro? La Reforma Agraria y la
Reforma Minera fueron dos respuestas distintas y contrapuestas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La Reforma Agraria produjo una crisis de la produccin agrcola y la
quiebra de la fbrica social del pas, mientras que la Reforma Minera ha
significado inversiones extranjeras por $7,153 millones, destinados a
desarrollar riqueza, crear trabajos productivos, transferir tecnologa y
recursos sustanciales para invertir en capital humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Minera de 1981 consolid
una visin nueva acerca de cmo crear riqueza.  Aunque en Chile tal visin
gan el debate de los 80, esta visin fundamental no ha sido todava
aceptada ni adoptada en temas que sern de la mayor importancia en el siglo
XXI. En efecto, la contestacin a cul debe ser el motor del progreso
nacional?, permanece indefinida en la ambigua respuesta de la economa mixta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La economa mixta que postulan los estatistas es la que exprime con toda
clase de impuestos al sector privado moderno y eficiente para apoyar al
sector pblico anacrnico, ineficaz, politizado y crecientemente corrupto.
La doctrina de la economa mixta es la que condena a los nios pobres a
educarse en escuelas pblicas mediocres, en vez de darles acceso a las
escuelas privadas que escoge, casi sin excepcin, cualquier familia con
recursos suficientes, independientemente de su inclinacin poltica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero est ocurriendo un cambio trascendental. Si histricamente la riqueza
fue creada poniendo los recursos naturales al servicio del hombre, en el
futuro la llave de la creacin de riqueza -la llave del tesoro- ser el
cultivo de la inteligencia y el conocimiento humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hoy la extraccin de minerales o productos agrcolas del suelo se apoya
ms en el uso de inteligencia que en fuerza humana. Pero aunque Chile ha
modernizado importantes sectores de su economa y de su sociedad, el sistema
estatal de educacin se encuentra en una profunda crisis porque est basado
en la misma estructura conceptual que origin la Reforma Agraria y que
mantiene a  la mayor empresa  de cobre, Codelco, en poder del Estado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es un trgico error postular que la preocupacin especial por los pobres
exige que el Estado produzca cobre y educacin. Todo lo contrario. No
podemos permitir que la mala calidad de la educacin estatal los condene a
una pobreza perpetua, cuando existe una alternativa.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El meollo del asunto es que la definicin de lo que es riqueza cambi y la
poltica moderna debe reconocerlo as. Hoy en da la riqueza fundamental es
el capital humano y el insumo bsico es el conocimiento. Es probable que sea
menos perjudicial para un pas tener empresas estatales produciendo acero o
explotando minas que escuelas administradas por la burocracia estatal. Una
profunda reforma educacional es la tarea ms urgente e importante de nuestra
sociedad.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es absurdo seguir considerando a las escuelas como parte del gasto social
asignado para mitigar los efectos de la pobreza. Por el contrario, las
escuelas deben estar en manos de los ms capaces en llevar adelante los
mejores proyectos educacionales -programas, metodologas, infraestructura-
que compiten entre s, para ofrecer a los jvenes las mejores alternativas.
Esto slo pueden hacerlo empresarios privados dispuestos a desarrollar su
iniciativa y arriesgar sus capitales a cambio de una legtima ganancia. Los
profesores deben dejar de ser funcionarios pblicos regidos por un estatuto
que uniforma la mediocridad, pasando a ser actores activos de los proyectos
educacionales y recibiendo mejor ingreso, ya sea por la prestacin de sus
servicios o como dueos de las escuelas. El rol del Estado debe centrarse en
subsidiar la educacin de los ms pobres y asegurar la transparencia y
competitividad del sistema.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	As las escuelas podrn transformarse en los centros productivos
estratgicos del pas porque all se jugar la ventaja competitiva de las
naciones en el siglo XXI. La educacin no slo reemplazar al suelo frtil y
a los yacimientos de minerales como el recurso clave para el desarrollo y la
creacin de riqueza, sino que tambin ser el ms significativo determinante
de la eliminacin de la pobreza.

<h2>
EXITOSA REFORMA DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>

Jos Piera*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Est ocurriendo en el mundo una verdadera
revolucin social ante el fracaso de los sistemas estatales de pensiones. La
crisis de la seguridad social sobreviene an en naciones tan prsperas como
Estados Unidos, Alemania y Japn.
<dd>	La buena noticia es que Amrica Latina ha sido pionera en lograr la
solucin. Hace 15  aos en Chile se instaur un sistema privado de cuentas
de ahorro individuales que conduce a una verdadera seguridad social. En
Per, Argentina y Colombia se han creado sistemas similares y es posible que
tambin lo hagan Mxico, Bolivia y El Salvador. Apostara que casi todos los
pases de Amrica Latina ingresarn al siglo XXI con la ventaja competitiva
de un sistema de pensiones privado de capitalizacin individual.
<dd>	Es conveniente mantener lo esencial del modelo chileno, adaptndolo a la
realidad nacional, especialmente en la definicin de la transicin desde el
sistema de reparto al de capitalizacin. Siempre surge la siguiente
pregunta: cules son las claves del xito del modelo chileno de pensiones,
aquellos factores esenciales que deben preservarse en toda reforma?
<dd>	Al celebrar 15 aos de funcionamiento del sistema de Administradores de
Fondos de Pensiones (AFP) es oportuno enumerar 20 factores esenciales:
<dd>                1. El sistema tradicional de reparto tiene una falla
estructural al basarse en una visin errada de la conducta humana. Al romper
la relacin que debe existir entre esfuerzo y recompensa, el sistema de
reparto origina conductas que producen, tarde o temprano, graves
consecuencias econmicas y sociales. El problema slo se corrige cuando se
crea un sistema donde la pensin de cada persona resulta de su esfuerzo de
ahorro durante la vida de trabajo. Esto adems permite ampliar la cobertura
del sistema a trabajadores independientes que quieran participar.
<dd>                2. El sistema de capitalizacin individual reemplaza
completamente al sistema de reparto. Siempre existe la tentacin de
soluciones mixtas, pues algunos suponen que al introducir elementos de dos
concepciones diferentes obtienen lo mejor de ambas. Eso es un error.
Generalmente la solucin mixta es un engendro que al carecer de coherencia
interna alimenta contradicciones que ocasionan daos graves. Si la
capitalizacin es mejor que el reparto, por qu mantener un beneficio
universal entregado por el Estado y financiado con un impuesto a la
contratacin de mano de obra?  La coexistencia entre el reparto y la
capitalizacin tiende a no ser posible, pues le permite a sucesivos
gobiernos mostrar preferencia por un sistema u otro.
<dd>                3. El sistema es administrado por el sector privado. En
Singapur hay un sistema de capitalizacin individual nico administrado por
el "Central Provident Fund" del Estado. Ello tiende al mal uso de los
recursos y es contradictorio con una sociedad libre. 
<dd>                4. Las empresas privadas que operan el sistema de pensiones
-las AFP- son de giro nico. No conviene confundir el producto del sistema,
que es una pensin al final de la vida, con los otros productos que ofrece
el sistema financiero. No debe mezclarse la administracin de un ahorro
obligatorio y de largo plazo con la inversin de recursos que toleran
niveles de riesgos superiores. En muchos pases los sistemas bancarios son
oligoplicos y no es conveniente reproducir esa estructura en el manejo del
sistema de pensiones. Entre las AFP y otras instituciones financieras pueden
haber relaciones contractuales, como convenios de servicios que reduzcan los
costos del sistema, pero se debe mantener la naturaleza nica de su giro.
<dd>	5. Los ahorros de los trabajadores reciben la rentabilidad de las
inversiones. Esto es necesario tanto por razones de seguridad como de
estabilidad poltica del sistema. En efecto, si las AFP pactaran de antemano
una tasa de retorno, podran quebrar al realizar malas inversiones, poniendo
en peligro los ahorros. Al distinguir entre Administradora (la cual se
financia con una comisin) y Fondo se logra el objetivo. El Fondo de
Pensiones puede tener oscilaciones de rentabilidad, pero en la medida que
est bien diversificado, esa variacin tiene los lmites propios de lo que
son las rentabilidades nacionales o mundiales. As un Fondo de Pensiones no
puede quebrar, aunque s la Administradora, involucrando en este caso slo
el capital del empresario. Y al comprender los trabajadores que el valor de
su cuenta de ahorro previsional depende de la buena marcha de las empresas y
de la economa, se logra su adhesin al sistema de pensiones y se estimula
un comportamiento responsable.
<dd>                6. Hay libre entrada de empresas del sector. Las condiciones
competitivas permiten optimizar la eficiencia en la oferta de cualquier bien
o servicio. Adems, el sistema de capitalizacin individual es intensivo en
el procesamiento de informacin, rea en la cual estn ocurriendo
vertiginosos avances tecnolgicos. La competencia de inversionistas tanto
nacionales como extranjeros asegura que estos avances sean incorporados y
que la reduccin de costos sea traspasada a los trabajadores a travs de
menores comisiones y mejor servicio.
<dd>	7. El tamao de cada AFP lo determina el mercado y no lmites arbitrarios
impuestos por el gobierno sobre el xito de cada AFP. Si hay una AFP que
logre una fraccin importante del mercado es porque es favorecida por los
propios trabajadores y no porque la autoridad as lo dispuso. Las
deseconomas de escala han impedido la monopolizacin del mercado.
<dd>	8. No hay AFP estatal, para lo cual no hay justificacin. De existir se
produce una competencia desleal con las AFP privadas.
<dd>	9. El trabajador tiene libertad para elegir su AFP. El sistema est basado
en la capacidad de los trabajadores para tomar decisiones sobre la AFP que
le manejar su cuenta de ahorro individual. Australia tiene un sistema
privado, pero  las personas deben afiliarse segn el gremio al que
pertenecen, crendose clientes cautivos que no reciben ni el mejor servicio
ni la mejor rentabilidad.
<dd>	10. Las comisiones que cobran las AFP son libres. Los precios son seales
fundamentales en una economa libre. Por lo tanto, las comisiones -el precio
de los servicios que dan las AFP- deben ser determinadas por el mercado
competitivo. En Chile se fortaleci la ley antimonopolio para impedir la
colusin entre empresas en fijar comisiones. Las autoridades deben asegurar
condiciones competitivas, pero no caer en la tentacin de fijar los precios,
con todas las distorsiones y presiones que ello genera.
<dd>	11. La transicin contempl la libertad para quedarse en el sistema de
reparto o trasladarse al sistema de capitalizacin. Ello hace ms difcil
cuantificar los aspectos fiscales de la transicin, pero tiene un gran valor
para las personas y crea confianza.
<dd>	12. Se les reconocen aportes hechos al sistema de reparto a los que optan
por el nuevo sistema. En Chile se aplic una frmula transparente y eficaz,
el Bono Reconocimiento que reflej los beneficios ya ganados por el
trabajador en el sistema de reparto. Esta compensacin debe existir para no
penalizar a las personas que ya han hecho aportes sustanciales en el sistema
estatal y prefieren que sus contribuciones futuras vayan a su cuenta de
ahorro individual.
<dd>	13. Los nuevos trabajadores entran al sistema de capitalizacin porque no
es responsable mantener abierta la puerta de un sistema de reparto que no es
viable en el largo plazo.
<dd>	14. Creacin de un organismo fiscalizador tecnificado con los recursos
necesarios, tanto humanos como financieros, para cumplir su funcin. En
Chile tenemos un organismo altamente profesional y despolitizado, la
Superintendencia de AFP.
<dd>	15. La regulacin del sistema ha sido crecientemente liberal. Nuestro
enfoque fue radical pero con una ejecucin conservadora. Una vez establecida
la capitalizacin es prudente enfatizar  la seguridad del nuevo sistema,
mientras se adquiere experiencia. Se impusieron estrictas reglas de
elegibilidad y diversificacin de las inversiones que se van liberalizando a
medida que el sistema madura.
<dd>	16. La transparencia es total. La confianza se gana con informacin plena.
Los trabajadores tienen derecho a saber quines son los dueos de las AFP,
en qu invierten los recursos, los niveles de comisiones, etc. Es importante
esta transparencia y posibilita a los dirigentes sindicales asesorar a sus
afiliados y a los analistas, consultores, clasificadores de riesgos e
instituciones financieras emitir opiniones sobre la calidad de los
portafolios de inversin. En Chile, la Superintendencia de AFP publica un
informe mensual que contiene toda la informacin relevante del sistema.
Adems, las AFP estn obligadas a proporcionar informacin peridica a sus
afiliados acerca del estado de sus cuentas.
<dd>	17. La reforma de las pensiones fue parte de un esfuerzo integral de
liberalizacin de la economa y la sociedad. La capitalizacin individual
funciona muchsimo mejor si opera en una economa abierta y con mercados
libres. La apertura del mercado de capitales permite a las AFP aprovechar
oportunidades de inversin en el exterior. 
<dd>	18. La reforma fue precedida por un gran esfuerzo comunicacional. Una
reforma de esta naturaleza afecta la vida de los trabajadores. La inquietud
e incertidumbre son inevitables por lo que las autoridades tienen que
explicar el sistema en trminos simples pero veraces. Una vez operando, la
funcin informativa es asumida por las AFP, sus asociaciones y los medios de
comunicacin.
<dd>	19. La meta fue lograr el sistema ptimo. Para ello se requiere liderazgo.
No se puede disear una reforma de este tipo basndose en encuestas y en un
consenso artificial que diluyen la reforma ptima. El verdadero lder es
aquel que acta segn lo que conviene al pas, aun cuando sea impopular en
el corto plazo.
<dd>	20. Estado de "eterna vigilancia": siempre habrn personas, partidos,
corrientes de opinin, grupos de inters que aspiran torcer el sistema en su
beneficio y en desmedro del resto. Hay que defender los principios centrales
del sistema, rechazando cualquier propuesta que vaya en direccin contraria,
manteniendo el esfuerzo educativo y comunicacional.
<dd>	El sistema chileno de pensiones es mucho ms que una manera de generar
buenos ingresos para los jubilados, crear ahorro para la economa y
estimular el crecimiento econmico. En ltimo trmino, es un acto de fe en
la libertad de los individuos y en las maravillas que los individuos pueden
hacer cuando son libres.&copy

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>ESTADOS UNIDOS Y EL FUTURO DE COLOMBIA</H2>
Miguel Posada S.*<p>
BOGOTA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- 	El ingreso de dineros del narcotrfico a la pasada campaa
electoral en Colombia desat una crisis poltica interna en el pas y gener
un deterioro notable en las relaciones del gobierno colombiano con Estados
Unidos. El gobierno norteamericano ha sido actor importante en el proceso
desatado, aplicando presin sobre el gobierno del presidente Samper en
varias formas.
<dd>
Primero vino la descertificacin de Colombia como pas comprometido con la
lucha antidrogas. Esta descertificacin deja el camino abierto al ejecutivo
de Estados Unidos para aplicar las sanciones que estime conveniente contra
el pas. Despus del proceso en la Cmara de Representantes que absolvi al
presidente Samper, el gobierno norteamericano le retir al mandatario
colombiano su visa de ingreso a Estados Unidos. Esta sancin, aplicada
adems a otros personajes de la vida poltica nacional, es la ltima
actuacin hasta el momento. Queda encima del gobierno colombiano y del pas
la espada de Damocles de las sanciones comerciales. 
<dd>	
En la batalla contra el llamado Cartel de Cali, la polica y las fuerzas
armadas han sido exitosas. Con la excepcin de Helmer Herrera, la cpula del
Cartel est en la crcel o fue dada de baja. Obviamente quedan muchos narcos
de menor jerarqua por detectar y capturar. Fue precisamente informacin
contenida en los documentos hallados en los muchos allanamientos realizados
la que aceler la crisis al revelar la profundidad de la penetracin que
haba logrado el Cartel en la clase poltica colombiana. La presin
norteamericana, odiosa por ser externa, ha sido importante para mantener en
marcha este proceso de limpieza, vital para Colombia ms que para los mismos
Estados Unidos. 
<dd>	
Indudablemente la incertidumbre causada por la crisis poltica ha tenido un
costo importante para la economa colombiana. Por otra parte, el dao a las
relaciones bilaterales que se ha producido, no slo por las actuaciones
concretas, sino por las declaraciones imprudentes de funcionarios de los dos
gobiernos, especialmente las del ministro del Interior Horacio Serpa,
probablemente ser subsanable en el mediano plazo. Pero queda el tema de las
sanciones. Aplicarlas sera un grave error por parte del gobierno
norteamericano. El retiro de preferencias arancelarias u otras sanciones de
tipo econmico ocasionaran graves daos a la economa colombiana.
Afectaran precisamente a las exportaciones sanas del pas. En el campo
poltico debilitara a quienes apoyan la limpieza y se abrira el campo a
quienes, apelando a un nacionalismo malsano, conviven y apoyan a los
narcotraficantes y a la guerrilla, esta ltima convertida hoy en el Tercer
Cartel del narcotrfico.
<dd>	
Es probable que desde Washington sea difcil apreciar la realidad de la
situacin poltica colombiana. El proceso de limpieza, como es apenas
natural, ha generado una polarizacin y un fraccionamiento poltico. Hoy no
se ven candidatos serios y competentes dentro de los partidos tradicionales
que tengan buenas probabilidades de tener xito electoral. Es posible que en
los dos aos que faltan para las elecciones presidenciales algunos
candidatos aceptables se puedan perfilar con ms claridad, pero una actitud
arrogante y falta de tacto de parte del gobierno de Estados Unidos trabajar
en contra de los buenos candidatos y a favor de otros, populistas o de
ideologa de izquierda, cuyo triunfo sera desastroso para el pas. La
embajada norteamericana en Colombia tiene la gran responsabilidad de
asesorar bien al Departamento de Estado en la materia. En estos momentos se
requiere firmeza pero tambin discrecin y paciencia de parte de Washington
para no generar una animadversin hacia Estados Unidos que hara difcil la
necesaria colaboracin de dos pases enfrentados a un enemigo comn.

<h2>
CHILE: POLITICOS QUIEREN MONOPOLIOS
</h2>
Ciro Quintana*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los empresarios estn pendientes de las encuestas
y estudios de mercado por la informacin que ofrecen sobre las orientaciones
y el comportamiento de los consumidores. No ocurre los mismo en el mundo
poltico, donde se reacciona frente a los sondeos de opinin pblica segn
sus resultados. Cuando stos favorecen, las encuestas son un bocado. Por el
contrario, cuando dan en las narices, se acusan los trabajos de sesgados,
muestras mal estructuradas, encuestas no rigurosas o simplemente las ignoran.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Esto ltimo est ocurriendo en Chile. Los polticos sistemticamente han
venido ignorando los diversos sondeos pblicos que reiteradamente reflejan
un creciente desprestigio de la actividad partidaria y desvalorizacin de
las tareas parlamentarias. La suma de pequeos factores han causado la
brecha, cada vez mayor, que separa a los polticos de la ciudadana, de lo
cual ningn partido se escapa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El elemento que quiz ha ayudado ms a construir la mala imagen poltica a
nivel de opinin pblica es la tendencia de los dirigentes de tratar de
aprovechar la infraestructura del Estado para obtener ventajas ms en
beneficio propio que en el de sus representados.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dentro de tal lnea se inscribe el nuevo intento, esta vez propiciado desde
las propias filas del Poder Ejecutivo, de sacar adelante un proyecto de ley
que permita al Estado entregar recursos para que los partidos polticos
financien sus campaas electorales. Es cierto que la cantidad propuesta -12
millones de dlares- parece insignificante, pero ante la opinin pblica
surge como un nuevo intento de escamotear fondos que deben ser destinados a
tareas socialmente ms importantes, como por ejemplo mejorar la situacin de
los pensionados del viejo sistema estatal (unas 500.000 personas reciben
menos de $100 mensuales) y ampliar las oportunidades de educacin y de salud
para los sectores ms desposedos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El argumento de los partidarios del financiamiento pblico de las campaas
electorales es que hay que terminar "con el maridaje obsceno entre el dinero
y la poltica", es decir, la obtencin de financiamiento por vas "oscuras",
ya que en la actualidad la militancia de los partidos es incapaz de
suministrar los fondos necesarios ni siquiera para el mantenimiento del
aparataje mnimo de estos. Otro argumento es que hay que transparentar el
financiamiento de las colectividades polticas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ninguna de esas justificaciones aguantan el ms mnimo anlisis. Para que
los partidos se independicen totalmente del apoyo financiero de sectores
privados, o bien de los organismo oficiales, tendran que recibir del Estado
un aporte financiero superior a los $100 millones. Y tal cantidad generara
un proceso corruptivo al interior de los partidos que los conducira al
descalabro moral y tico, como ocurre en otros pases donde el Estado
financia la poltica. En cuanto a la transparencia, alguien cree
ingenuamente que los partidos polticos van a dar a conocer todas las ayudas
recibidas?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hay que tomar tambin en consideracin otras consecuencias derivadas de
encauzar recursos del Estado a los partidos polticos. La ms relevante es
la monopolizacin de la representacin popular por parte de las actuales
entidades. Qu posibilidades tendran candidaturas independientes en ese
escenario?  Incluso, qu oportunidades encontraran los movimientos nuevos
de insertarse en la poltica?  Sin exagerar, se trata de un camino que
demuestra que los grupos polticos no son amigos de la competencia ni del
libre mercado y prefieren mil veces un esquema oligoplico, donde solamente
puedan participar los ya conocidos o los apadrinados, aun cuando para
obtenerlo deban incurrir en gastos abusivos, financiados a la fuerza por
todos los contribuyentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Es sorprendente la actitud del gobierno de Eduardo Frei, la cual seala que
an no ha comprendido la preocupacin general respecto a que el Estado debe
reducir su nivel de gastos, factor que ha impedido que Chile pueda vivir con
tasas de inflacin bajas, al nivel de las naciones desarrolladas. <&copy;p>

<H2>CHILE: REDISTRIBUYENDO POBREZA </H2>
Ciro Quintana*<br>
<p>


SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Uno de los aspectos ms destacados de los dos
gobiernos de la concertacin centroizquierda que ha tenido Chile en aos
recientes ha sido su reiterada accin en beneficio de los sectores ms
desposedos del pas. Ante estudios que sostenan, a comienzos de los 90,
que el 40% de la poblacin sufra de pobreza, las administraciones de
Patricio Aylwin, primero, y ahora Eduardo Frei (hijo) han desplegado una
importante batera de medidas en todos los campos tras la meta de reducir al
mnimo este problema. Ello ha tenido, como contrapartida un incremento
sustancial de impuestos para financiar programas sociales, lo cual ha
catapultado a Chile a alcanzar uno de los primeros puestos en cuanto a carga
impositiva en Amrica Latina (17% del PIB).<p>
Para sorpresa del gobierno, pese a los grandes esfuerzos redistributivos
desplegados, la distribucin del ingreso en el pas no ha mejorado ni
siquiera una dcima en relacin al panorama advertido al trmino del rgimen
militar, segn el informe de la Comisin Nacional de Justicia y Paz de la
Conferencia Episcopal de Chile. El quintil ms rico de la poblacin sigue
recibiendo 58,1% del ingreso, mientras que el ms pobre apenas recibe 4,6%.
El gobierno chileno no sabe dnde ha fallado ni conoce el monto de las
filtraciones que impiden que los recursos lleguen efectivamente a quienes
estn destinados, los ms pobres.<p>
	En todo caso, la denuncia episcopal sirvi de base para reanimar a los
grupos que reclaman mayores impuestos. Para estos, la realidad demuestra la
injusticia de la actual estructura impositiva del pas y, por lo tanto,
segn ellos se debe acrecentar an ms el aporte de los sectores ms
pudientes y lograr as una ms justa distribucin. Lo que no esperaban estos
sectores es que un estudio efectuado por dos importantes funcionarios de
gobierno, uno de ellos el Subsecretario de Desarrollo Social, revel que no
haba relacin alguna entre la ms pareja distribucin del ingreso y la
proporcin de poblacin en situacin de pobreza. El estudio se aboc a
investigar la situacin de las diversas regiones del pas y determin que en
aquellas regiones donde la distribucin es ms desigual hay un cuadro de
pobreza menor que la detectada donde el panoramas es ms igualitario. Toda
una paradoja que est obligando a replantear el problema de la pobreza y a
comprender que en aquellos lugares donde es permitido que un creciente
nmero de personas se hagan muy ricas, los pobres se vuelven menos pobres.
Como sostiene el Instituto Libertad y Desarrollo, fundacin privada chilena
de estudios pblicos, no se combate la pobreza imponiendo una distribucin
ms igualitaria de los ingresos, con lo cual slo se logra redistribuir
pobreza, lo que por generaciones ha sucedido bajo todos los regmenes
socialistas de la historia, desde Europa oriental hasta Cuba.<p>
	Lo que se espera es que este segundo gobierno de la Concertacin revise sus
mtodos, rechace los viejos mitos socialistas y reconozca lo importante que
es construir un camino que motive y facilite la generacin de riqueza, nico
medio capaz de proporcionar nuevas oportunidades y expectativas a la
poblacin que hoy vive en situacin de pobreza. La experiencia demuestra que
aquellos gobiernos que han colocado en primer plano la erradicacin de la
pobreza a travs de programas del sector pblico siempre acaban con un
balance deplorable en este campo. <p>

<H2>UN NUEVO UNIVERSO MONETARIO</H2>
Richard Rahn*<br>
<p>

WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--Movilizar dinero annimamente, a la velocidad de la luz
y a cualquier sitio del mundo va pronto a ser tan fcil como oprimir algunas
teclas en su computadora. Las autoridades fiscales se sienten retadas y
amenazadas por esa nueva tecnologa y, como era de esperarse, algunos
funcionarios de los departamentos del Tesoro y de Justicia de Estados Unidos
estn proponiendo regulaciones que en esencia obligaran a cada ciudadano o
empresa estadounidense a reportar al gobierno cada ingreso y gasto efectuado
electrnicamente. Ni los nazis ni los soviticos alcanzaron tal nivel de
entremetimiento. Felizmente, muchos en el Congreso estn opuestos a tal
intento de negarnos lo que nos queda de privacidad financiera.<p>
	Estamos en una encrucijada. Mientras los gobiernos ms traten de imponernos
impuestos, regularnos, controlarnos y confiscarnos, mayor es el incentivo
del empresario y del inversionista para marcharse. Las nuevas tecnologas
permitirn hacerlo electrnicamente.<p>
	Las transferencias electrnicas reducen drsticamente el costo de
transacciones y la posibilidad de prdidas. Se adelantan varios
experimentos, uno de ellos en Amsterdam es operado por DigiCash y se llama
E-cash. Individuos podrn mover sus fondos de banco a banco, sin que los
bancos mismos se enteren sobre quin hizo el depsito o de qu pas provino.<p>
	Claro que a la oficina de impuestos no le gusta eso, pero el asunto est
fuera de su control. La gente podr escoger entre dos versiones del futuro.
La primera es la sociedad donde todas sus transacciones pueden ser
monitoreadas por el gobierno. La segunda le permitir escoger cules de sus
transacciones estarn al alcance de ojos curiosos y cules se mantendrn en
el anonimato.<p>
	Funcionarios gubernamentales argumentarn que sistemas annimos benefician
principalmente a los narcotraficantes, lavadores de dinero, terroristas y a
los que no pagan sus impuestos. Los libertarios, por su parte, alertarn del
peligro que presentan los gobiernos con total escrutinio sobre el ciudadano.
Los temores legtimos del gobierno se pueden apaciguar substituyendo el
impuesto sobre la renta con tasas bajas de impuestos a las ventas y
retenciones. De todas maneras, no hay duda que las actuales regulaciones
para acabar con el lavado de dinero estn fracasando y ello no justifica la
imposicin de restricciones adicionales a legtimas transferencias
efectuadas por ciudadanos honestos, en detrimento de nuestras libertades
civiles.<p>
	Esta revolucin electrnica significa que los bancos y otras organizaciones
podrn crear su propio dinero. La definicin de dinero como moneda de curso
legal creado por los gobiernos se volver menos y menos relevante. La
distincin actual entre dinero, bienes, servicios y activos desaparecer a
medida que se hagan intercambiables.<p>
	Los gobiernos no podrn detener esta revolucin porque es mundial y
demasiada gente tiene los conocimientos necesarios. La censura y la
regulacin no funcionarn porque el desarrollo de maneras de evadirlas se
mantendr muy por delante de quienes intentan las restricciones. Por las
mismas razones, los gobiernos totalitarios han dejado de controlar la
informacin porque la nueva tecnologa lo hace imposible de lograr. Los
gobiernos tendrn que admitir que el monopolio de su banco central en la
emisin de monedas desaparecer de la misma manera que los coches tirados
por caballos.<p>
	La batalla por la libertad financiera no est perdida. Para ganarla hay que
involucrarse en la reforma del sistema impositivo, la abolicin del impuesto
sobre la renta y su reemplazo por un sistema que no requiera del constante
escrutinio gubernamental. En la era de pagos cibernrticos no es posible
mantener el actual rgimen de impuestos. <p>

<p>
 

LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- El jefe maoista del norte del Per, Pedro Snchez Flores, fue
recientemente capturado mientras trataba de revivir la "guerra popular" de
Sendero Luminoso, el grupo guerrillero ms sanguinario de la historia
latinoamericana.<p>
	Pero ese movimiento est moribundo y los grupos que sobreviven estn ms
interesados en el narcotrfico que en el trfico de ideas. Esa ha sido una
de las victorias del presidente Alberto Fujimori, capaz de recuperar la
esperanza de la gente a travs de cambios revolucionarios. Hablar hoy del
Per es hablar de Fujimori. Desde que tom las riendas del pas en 1990, ha
acumulado poder en sus propias manos, retando a las lites tradicionales con
una democracia autcrata que es controversial tanto dentro como fuera del pas.<p>
	En 1990, Fujimori hered un pas paralizado no slo por la guerrilla sino
por una total ineptitud en el manejo de la economa, un narcotrfico en auge
y la generalizada desesperacin de la gente. Durante su mandato, la
inflacin se redujo de 7.500% a 10% anual y el crecimiento econmico de los
ltimos tres aos le ha ganado al Per el apodo de "jaguar suramericano" de
parte de un importante banquero internacional.<p>
	En una entrevista en el palacio de gobierno, el presidente me dijo que la
mayora de los estadounidenses no entendan esta revolucin, su efectividad,
durabilidad ni el sustento popular. "Profundas diferencias" surgieron entre
Estados Unidos y el Per luego de 1992 -dijo-, cuando disolvi a un Congreso
elitista que se opona al cambio. Fujimori insiste en que "la gente hoy
quiere accin, no retrica". La mayora es "ms realista, prctica y honesta
que los polticos" que prometen sin cumplir, ganndose el desprecio general.
Fujimori mantiene que el anterior Congreso haba sido elegido bajo un
proceso tan fuertemente controlado por los privilegiados que difcilmente se
poda considerar democrtico. Un nuevo Congreso fue electo en 1995,
controlado por quienes apoyan a Fujimori.<p>
	Las encuestas en junio colocaban la aprobacin de Fujimori en 65% y muchos
quieren que busque de nuevo la reeleccin en el ao 2000. Pero sus crticos
argumentan que al socavar las instituciones tradicionales, el populismo de
Fujimori ha despojado al pas de su base institucional. Para el presidente,
fue ms la obra de polticas discriminatorias y rentistas de las lites
polticas, econmicas, sociales y religiosas -an ms que el evidente
fracaso del gobierno de Alan Garca- lo que en 1990 le entreg un pas ruinas.<p>
	Como segunda generacin de inmigrantes japoneses, Fujimori se identifica
con la ignorada mayora indgena, la cual responde a su mensaje y liderazgo.
El mismo se senta excluido "por razones tnicas", concluyendo que la nica
manera de hacer que el gobierno sirva a la mayora de la gente fue
"conscientemente enfrentando a la mayora marginada contra esa lite". Para
ello, viaja incansablemente a todos los rincones del pas. Los resultados
electorales y las encuestas muestran que sus ms decididos partidarios son
los ms pobres de Lima y del interior del pas. Un reciente informe de Banco
Mundial muestra que esos son exactamente los que ms se han beneficiado bajo.<p>

<h2>
COMO AYUDAR A LOS NIOS 
</h2>

Robert Rector*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Recientemente, el capitolio federal fue el escenario de
la manifestacin organizada por el Fondo de Defensa de los Nios. El
objetivo anunciado era llamar la atencin sobre la situacin de los nios en
este pas, mientras que el propsito no anunciado era lograr el continuo
crecimiento del Estado de Bienestar y criticar a los congresistas reformistas.
<dd>	Mientras que la manifestacin tena toda la razn en llamar la atencin
sobre la situacin de muchos nios estadounidenses, es irnico que los nios
estn sufriendo debido a las polticas apoyadas por los organizadores de la
protesta. Los nios sufren porque el Estado de Bienestar izquierdista ha
destrozado los fundamentos morales de los barrios pobres, derrumbando el
matrimonio, destruyendo la tica de trabajo y dejando una estela de
patologa social.
<dd>	El fracaso de la Guerra contra la Pobreza surge de su premisa falsa, la
creencia de que la pobreza material es el meollo del problema de los nios
de los barrios. Segn este punto de vista, al reducir la pobreza se aumenta
automticamente el bienestar de los nios, logrando su desarrollo. De igual
manera, como la pobreza es la "causa" del crimen, del fracaso escolar, de la
ilegitimidad, de las drogas y de la erosin de la tica del trabajo, el
aumento de la beneficencia pblica reduce no slo la pobreza sino al mismo
tiempo todos los dems problemas sociales. De tal lgica simplista surgi el
esfuerzo durante 30 aos en aumentar los beneficios, expandir la
elegibilidad, crear nuevos programas y aumentar el presupuesto. La
manifestacin del Fondo de Defensa de los Nios repiti toda esta vieja
cantaleta.
<dd>	Pero la historia impugna esa ingenua creencia. En 1950, casi una tercera
parte de la poblacin de Estados Unidos era pobre (el doble de la tasa
actual). En 1920, ms o menos la mitad de la poblacin era pobre segn el
estndar actual. Si fuera verdad que la pobreza material es la causa de los
problemas sociales, debiramos haber tenido problemas muchos ms graves en
esas pocas que ahora, cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario: el crimen,
la disolucin de la familia y la mayora de los dems problemas sociales no
eran la sombra de los que confrontamos hoy.
<dd>	Tanto la historia como el sentido comn indican que los valores y las
habilidades existentes en las familias y no sus ingresos son los que
determinan el rendimiento de los nios. Las familias exitosas tienden a
tener valores slidos en cuanto al autocontrol, postergar placeres, trabajo,
educacin y matrimonio, todo lo cual traspasan a sus hijos. El intento de
aumentar artificialmente el ingreso familiar beneficia muy poco a los nios,
pero va lejos en su destruccin de los mismos valores que son claves para el
xito. El punto que la izquierda rehusa reconocer es que la beneficencia
pblica tiene efectos secundarios: engendra dependencia e ilegitimidad que
son nefastos para el desarrollo de los nios. Por ejemplo, entre las casi 5
millones de familias que reciben beneficios, el tiempo que estn bajo esos
programas promedia casi 13 aos. Segn el informe en 1994 de June O'Neill,
la directora de la Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso, aumentar el lapso en
que un nio recibe beneficencia pblica puede reducir su inteligencia en
20%. O'Neill deja muy claro que es la dependencia de la beneficencia y no la
pobreza lo que realmente hace dao a los nios.
<dd>	Al pagar ms a las mujeres para que tengan ms hijos fuera del matrimonio,
la beneficencia pblica juega un papel importante en la promocin de la
ilegitimidad. Nacer fuera del matrimonio y crecer en un hogar con una madre
soltera triplica los problemas emocionales y de comportamiento entre los
nios, a la vez que tambin triplica su actividad sexual, dobla la
probabilidad de que las nias tengan hijos fuera del matrimonio y que los
nios incurran en actividades delictivas que los har terminar en la crcel.
<dd>	No es posible ayudar a los nios persistiendo en polticas equivocadas. El
sistema actual de beneficencia pblica tiene que ser reemplazado y hay que
terminar con el crecimiento automtico de los gastos en beneficencia. La
beneficencia no puede continuar siendo una calle de una sola va; los
beneficiarios tienen que trabajar para recibir la ayuda. Hay que reducir la
ilegitimidad restringiendo las ddivas en efectivo a las muchachas solteras
con hijos.
<dd>	Las instituciones religiosas han sido dramticamente exitosas en reducir la
actividad sexual de los jvenes, el delito, las drogas y dems problemas.
Una manera de darle acceso a los pobres a tales fuentes de esperanza es a
travs de vales que puedan ser utilizados por las familias pobres para
mandar a sus hijos a escuelas privadas, incluyendo escuelas religiosas.
<dd>	Pero la ciudadana debe recordar que el bien intencionado gobierno grande
que quiere mantener una izquierda que apoda a los reformistas como
"anti-nios" est promocionando justamente todo aquello que daa a nuestra
juventud: la beneficencia pblica.&copy

<h2>
LA CRISIS DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>     
     
     
Paul Craig Roberts*
<p>

WASHINTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Si los ciudadanos y sus representantes en el gobierno no
encaran la situacin del Seguro Social, no habr futuro para los
pensionados. El Seguro Social siempre ha sido una pirmide fraudulenta y se
est desmoronando.
<dd>	El Seguro Social "funcion" durante medio siglo por dos razones bsicas: el
programa se origin cuando la poblacin trabajadora era muy grande en
proporcin al nmero de retirados cobrando beneficios y los impuestos a la
nmina necesarios para financiar esos beneficios eran bajos.
<dd>	Al pasar el tiempo, la longevidad ha aumentado y la tasa de nacimiento se
ha reducido. La poblacin en general se torn ms vieja y la proporcin de
trabajadores a pensionados se ha reducido. Para compensar todo esto, el
impuesto a la nmina ha ido aumentando hasta alcanzar 15,3%. Y para mantener
la pirmide ese impuesto tendra que ser doblado para el ao 2040. Varios
factores hacen eso imposible.
<dd>	Sera un peso impositivo imposible de aguantar y aadido al impuesto sobre
la renta y a otros impuestos no le dejaran gran cosa a las familias para
vivir. Otro factor es el impacto sobre el nivel de empleo. Los impuestos a
la nmina son impuestos al empleo. En el pasado, la combinacin de alta
productividad, falta de competencia extranjera e impuestos a la nmina
relativamente bajos impidi que muchos estadounidenses perdieran sus
trabajos, pero la situacin de hoy es diferente. Los impuestos ahora son
altos, la productividad ya no es tan superior a la de otros pases y la
competencia extranjera ha crecido con la desaparicin del socialismo.
<dd>	A partir del ao 2012, el Seguro Social no podr pagar los beneficios
prometidos a menos que el gobierno cubra el dficit pidiendo prestado. Pero
igual como hay un lmite a los impuestos a la nmina, existe tambin un
lmite a la habilidad del gobierno para endeudarse y pagar as los
beneficios del Seguro Social. El dficit se disparara y prestarle
crecientes cantidades al gobierno sera visto como una mala y arriesgada
inversin.
<dd>	Pero la mayor barrera contra la continuacin del actual sistema piramidal
del Seguro Social es la necesidad que tiene la economa de Estados Unidos de
nuevas inversiones para mantener su posicin competitiva en el mundo. Un
verdadero sistema de pensiones aporta los fondos que le permiten a la
economa crecer, pero nuestro Seguro Social es un sistema de transferencias
diseado para cubrir los gastos de vida y hospitalizacin de los mayores.
<dd>	Hay una sola manera de prevenir el colapso del Seguro Social y esa es
convertirlo en un verdadero sistema de jubilacin. El monto proveniente del
impuesto a la nmina sera invertido en un fondo de pensiones a nombre de
cada trabajador. Esto le dara seguridad al trabajador y aportara a la
economa los fondos requeridos para inversin.
<dd>	La transicin sera difcil, pero se puede hacer si comenzamos ahora. La
transicin tendra que ser financiada con un supervit fiscal para pagar los
beneficios de aquellos que se acercan a la edad de jubilacin y cuyo dinero
fue utilizado para pagar a otros que se retiraron antes.
<dd>	El gobierno nos ha venido engaando. Nos promete una jubilacin a cambio de
un impuesto de 15,3% a la nmina, pero no puede cumplir. A menos que se
privatice el sistema, la poblacin va a quedarse con altos impuestos y sin
ningn beneficio. &copy;

L. Jacobo Rodrguez* <br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El nuevo gobierno espaol, elegido en marzo en reemplazo
de los socialistas que ocuparon el poder por 14 aos y dejaron la economa
en estado catico, se apresura a cumplir con las estipulaciones de la moneda
nica europea. Estos requisitos, que los pases de la Unin Europea deben
cumplir para finales de 1997 para poder ingresar como miembros fundadores de
la Unin Monetaria Europea (UME), exigen que la deuda pblica no sobrepase
el 60% del PIB, que el dficit fiscal no pase del 3% del PIB y que la tasa
de inflacin no sea ms que punto y medio superior a las tasas ms bajas de
los pases miembros.
<P>Con una deuda pblica equivalente al 65% del PIB, un dficit fiscal
estimado este ao en 4% del PIB y una tasa de inflacin de medio punto por
encima del objetivo, las posibilidades son buenas de que Espaa cumpla. Sin
embargo, tratar simplemente de remendar el Estado de Bienestar no es una
alternativa viable, ya que dejara a Espaa en desventaja competitiva frente
a sus socios europeos. Por el contrario, el nuevo gobierno debe instrumentar
reformas de mercado que fomenten el crecimiento econmico, aumenten la tasa
de empleo y atraigan de nuevo la inversin extranjera.
<P>Lamentablemente, los polticos espaoles estn poniendo demasiado nfasis
en alcanzar los requisitos de la UME, en vez de enfrentar los defectos
estructurales de la economa que condujeron a una tasa de desempleo del
22,4%.  Por ejemplo, en vez de eliminar programas pblicos costosos e
innecesarios, el gobierno est tratando de reducir el dficit a 3%
congelando los salarios de los funcionarios pblicos. Tales "soluciones"
pueden lograr que Espaa entre precariamente en la UME a finales de 1997,
pero el nuevo presidente del gobierno, Jos Mara Aznar, debera ms bien
reducir substancialmente el papel del Estado en la economa.
<P>Algunos pasos se han dado, incluyendo gestiones para privatizar algunas
empresas estatales. Pero hay que ir ms lejos porque el Estado de Bienestar
espaol ha fracasado miserablemente. Aznar deber afrontar con coraje la
crisis antes que ese Estado de Bienestar colapse por su propio peso. 
<P>Hay que reformar el sistema pblico de pensiones, liberalizar el mercado
laboral y simplificar el cdigo fiscal. El actual sistema de pensiones
consume cerca del 10% del PIB y va camino a la quiebra. Si las pensiones se
mantienen a los actuales niveles, ellas de por s producirn un dficit
equivalente al 4% del PIB para el ao 2025. Y, dadas las tendencias
demogrficas de Espaa, reducir los beneficios de los actuales o futuros
pensionistas o aumentar las cotizaciones de los trabajadores (actualmente
28% de la nmina) no evitar la quiebra. Esta es la conclusin de un estudio
recientemente publicado por el Crculo de Empresarios.  
<P>Ese estudio muestra que tanto los trabajadores como los empresarios se
beneficiaran con la instrumentacin de un sistema de capitalizacin
individual, fiscalmente viable y similar al exitoso sistema chileno.  Pero
el Sr. Aznar ha declarado que cualquier reforma de las pensiones se har
dentro del marco del actual sistema pblico de reparto.
<P>Si la crisis del sistema de pensiones comienza ahora a hacerse evidente, la
crisis en el mercado laboral ha plagado a Espaa durante aos.  Espaa tiene
la tasa de desempleo ms alta del mundo industrializado. Las amplias
regulaciones estatales diseadas para ayudar a los trabajadores y a los que
buscan empleos han resultado contraproducentes. Costosas leyes sobre
despidos y vacaciones han aumentado exageradamente el costo de la mano de
obra y disminuido la tasa de empleo fijo.
<P>Tambin falta que la nueva administracin fije una poltica fiscal clara.
El reemplazo de la tasa mxima del impuesto sobre ganancias de capital de
56% por una nica del 20% fue seguida por aumentos de impuestos al tabaco y
bebidas alcohlicas, y  se esperan aumentos al agua y las medicinas.
<P>No se ha adelantado en las promesas electorales de reformar el cdigo
fiscal. Ms bien, el gobierno ha tratado de extraer ms fondos del sector
privado combatiendo la evasin de impuestos. Habra mayor cumplimiento si la
estructura del cdigo fiscal, que tiene 17 tramos, se simplificase y si la
tasa marginal del 56% fuera reducida.
<P>Si bien es cierto que la UME ofrece beneficios, hoy la economa espaola no
est en posicin de disfrutarlos y probablemente tampoco lo estar a finales
de 1997. El nuevo gobierno servir mejor al pueblo espaol si adopta
reformas de mercado, en lugar de tratar de salvar a un sistema
socioeconmico fracasado. Los espaoles eligieron a Aznar porque estaban
cansados de la corrupcin causada por la poltica estatista e
intervencionista del gobierno de Felipe Gonzlez. Solamente un golpe de
timn permitir a Espaa satisfacer las aspiraciones de sus ciudadanos.

<h2>
VENEZUELA: CRONICA DE DOS AJUSTES
</h2>
Carlos Sabino*
<p>
CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los llamados "paquetes de ajuste" en Venezuela tienden a
parecerse mucho, como dos gotas de agua. Ello ocurre por motivos bastante
definidos. Los dos programas de ajuste econmico -el que comenz Carlos
Andrs Prez en febrero de 1989 y tuvo que detener tres aos despus, y el
que se inici hace un mes bajo la presidencia de Rafael Caldera- se han
encaminado a resolver problemas fiscales y cambiarios apremiantes, que ya no
admitan dilacin. Prez se encontr con un rgimen cambiario controlado que
generaba una disparidad enorme entre el precio del dlar oficial y el que se
transaba libremente, en tanto que Caldera volvi a imponer el control de
cambios para darse cuenta, ao y medio despus, que le resultaba imposible
sostenerlo; tanto en 1989 como en 1996 las arcas fiscales estaban
prcticamente agotadas y no haba recursos para cumplir con los compromisos
ms inmediatos del estado. En ambas ocasiones se han presentado amplios
"programas sociales" que, bien mirados, no son sino simples transferencias
indiscriminadas de dinero para reducir los costos polticos de quienes toman
las medidas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No extraar por ello que ambos liberaran el mercado cambiario y que se
hayan levantado algunos subsidios que resultaba imposible mantener, como el
de la gasolina, por ejemplo. No hay en esto ninguna propuesta ideolgica de
fondo, ningn modelo de sociedad que se trate de desarrollar. Cuando las
cuentas no salen es preciso reducir los gastos, aumentar los ingresos o
combinar de alguna manera ambas cosas. Se trata de una vieja receta conocida
desde el tiempo de los fenicios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este tipo de ajustes, importantes y necesarios como puedan ser, no bastan
sin embargo para definir una poltica econmica de largo plazo, pues se
dirigen simplemente a resolver el problema coyuntural. Detrs de ste,
escondidas a la vista del observador superficial, se encuentran las
verdaderas causas que llevan a los pases a situaciones de "desajuste" que
luego se hace imperioso remediar.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En Venezuela, estas causas tienen directa relacin con el papel asfixiante
que tiene el estado frente a la sociedad civil. Este no slo posee el
petrleo y otras industrias fundamentales (acero, aluminio, electricidad,
etc.), as como una buena proporcin de todos los terrenos existentes, sino
que emplea al 20% de la poblacin activa total, regula y controla toda
actividad imaginable y se caracteriza por una ineficiencia descomunal.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Modificar esta maquinaria poderosa, pero incapaz de una accin efectiva, es
la tarea central que tiene la sociedad venezolana. No se trata entonces de
aumentar los impuestos, pues si bien con ello se mejoran las cuentas
fiscales se siguen ahogando y contrayendo las actividades productivas, ni de
vender algunas empresas pblicas que estn quebradas o dan prdidas. Se
trata de emprender un verdadero cambio estructural, de privatizar todo
aquello que puede ser gestionado eficientemente por los particulares, de
modificar la arbitraria legislacin que tenemos, de reducir drsticamente el
tamao de la burocracia pblica.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Si esto no se realiza volveremos, en poco tiempo, a una situacin parecida
a la que tenamos hace un mes: el estado gastar los nuevos recursos que
reciba, volver a endeudarse y sus cuentas, finalmente, se desequilibrarn
otra vez. De nuevo habr que emprender un ajuste, devaluar, subir los
precios de los servicios pblicos y aumentar los impuestos, empobreciendo
an ms a la sufrida sociedad venezolana.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Venezuela, otra vez, como hace siete aos, est soportando la inflacin y
la recesin que producen estos ajustes. El sacrificio de nada servir, como
no sirvi en la ocasin anterior, si no se avanza una modificacin
estructural de la economa del pas. <p>&copy;

SE CAE LA PRIVATIZACIN EN MEXICO

Roberto Salinas-Len*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- La polmica sobre la privatizacin de la
petroqumica mexicana se ha polarizado entre aquellos que celebran el
monopolio estatal de la industria petrolera como smbolo de soberana
nacional y los que reclaman nuevas estrategias para capitalizar y modernizar
uno de los sectores ms atrasados, pero con mayor potencial de crecimiento
en la economa mexicana.
<dd>	Este es otro de tantos dramas que ha sufrido nuestra economa desde el
estallido de la crisis financiera. La privatizacin es una forma de aumentar
la productividad de las empresas, de permitir que el gobierno elimine
derroches presupuestales y se logren atraer nuevas inversiones de capital
productivo. Sin embargo, la mayora de los mexicanos ven la privatizacin
con malos ojos, ms como un instrumento de amiguismo para privilegiar a unos
pocos a costa de un pueblo desesperado y empobrecido.
<dd>	Por otra parte, la ciudadana percibe que la llamada soberana nacional se
manipula a conveniencia,  para que lderes corporativistas y sindicales
mantengan su poder personal, ya que lo que se anuncia como propiedad de "la
Nacin" no es en realidad propiedad de nadie. Los grupos de oposicin
(sindicatos, intelectuales de izquierda, representantes de la burocracia
mexicana) proponen realizar un referndum sobre si se debe privatizar o no
las plantas petroqumicas. Pero ms que un referndum lo que se necesita es
ampliar la propiedad de esas empresas entre numerosas personas y grupos. As
se ha hecho con xito en pases como Chile, Inglaterra y la Repblica Checa,
donde la venta de empresas a los trabajadores y entre las clases ms
humildes produjo un fuerte apoyo a la iniciativa privatizadora.
<dd>	Es desafortunado que el debate se haya centrado sobre si se debe privatizar
la petroqumica o no, en vez de cmo se debe realizar una necesaria
privatizacin. La realidad es que las empresas llamadas "privadas" tienden a
ser ms pblicas que las empresas "pblicas", las cuales tienden a estar
bajo el frreo control y funcionar para beneficio de burcratas y polticos.
La industria petrolera mexicana es un triste ejemplo de todo esto.
<dd>	Claro que si la privatizacin se concibe como PRI-vatizacin, es decir,
como medio para fortalecer el esquema mercantilista mexicano, donde el
precio y los ingresos para el fisco son las principales prioridades, como
sucedi con la privatizacin de la banca, entonces el referndum debera dar
un voto negativo. Pero sera muy diferente si la privatizacin abarca un fin
popular, de privatizar la propiedad de la petroqumica entre el ms amplio
sector posible.
<dd>	En realidad, el fiel cumplimiento de una privatizacin bien estructurada es
ms importante que el precio en s de la venta. Es fundamental usar la
privatizacin como medio de acceso universal a la propiedad, preferiblemente
por un nmero significativo de nuevos accionistas. En Mxico, la motivacindel proceso no es popular ni mucho menos de aumentar la tenencia de
propiedad entre un creciente sector ajeno a los corredores del poder
gubernamental. Se habla, ms bien, de la "reestructuracin" del sector
pblico y de la "racionalizacin de la participacin estatal en la economa".
<dd>	El esquema que se pretende usar en el caso de la petroqumica no respeta la
necesidad de diversificar la estructura accionaria de las empresas entre la
poblacin y la falta de apoyo oblig al gobierno zedillista a revocar la
participacin de empresas extranjeras, aun cuando estas son las que podran
contribuir ms a la modernizacin del sector petroqumico. Ello signific un
triunfo parcial para los antagonistas jursicos del falso nacionalismo que
tanto dao le han hecho a Mxico. &copy;

<h2>
GUERRILLA COLOMBIANA JUEGA AL ANTISAMPERISMO
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Enrique Santos Caldern
</a>

<P>
BOGOTA (AIPE).- La guerrilla colombiana haba estado sospechosamente
quieta. A lo mejor pensaba que atacar a Samper era hacerle el juego a los
gringos. O que si cayera este Gobierno se subiran los militares.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero ya no parece tener esas dudas. La masacre de los 11 policas en el
pueblo de Chaln mediante la utilizacin de un "burro-bomba" (lo nico que
faltaba), marc el inicio de una ofensiva que continu el "paro armado", con
su trgico saldo de 25 muertos, buses y camiones incendiados, oleoductos
volados, puentes destruidos... 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Segn un panfleto del ELN, el objetivo es presionar la salida del
presidente Samper, lo que indica que la guerrilla ya reconoce el acelerado
desprestigio del Gobierno y procura sacar dividendos polticos enarbolando
tambin la bandera del antisamperismo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero, no gracias. El pas deliberante, que entiende la necesidad del
retiro del presidente, no acepta estos mtodos, ni requiere a estos aliados.
Entre otras cosas porque el antisamperismo de la subversin es producto del
oportunismo de pescar en ro revuelto, y no de una conviccin sobre las
razones de ndole tica y poltica que precipitaron esta crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla se encontr con una coyuntura que ahora piensa puede
resultarle favorable. No la busc, ni la propici, y casi ni la entiende. Le
peg tan de frente, a pesar de ella. Otra muestra de como no logra
conectarse con el pas real. Para la subversin todos los gobiernos son
iguales. No diferencia, ni matiza. No le interesa la reforma, sino la
destruccin del sistema. Por eso no puede contribuir a la solucin de la
crisis ni aprovechar siquiera una coyuntura que debera serles muy propicia
a quienes invocan la lucha contra la corrupcin, la opresin y la injusticia
para justificar actos violentos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;En efecto, con un gobierno desprestigiado y acorralado, sin credibilidad
interna ni externa, y sin recursos ya para el populismo social; sin una
oposicin que est en condiciones de movilizar a la gente o convertirse en
alternativa creble, era de suponer que quienes llevan 30 aos luchando con
las armas dizque por un pas mejor fueran por lo menos capaces de formular
una propuesta realista.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pero, qu va. La crisis no ha sido sino nueva oportunidad para reafirmar su
vocacin violenta y su naturaleza destructiva; para comprobar su grado de
despolitizacin y bandolerizacin; para seguir haciendo, en fin, lo que
mejor hacen: matar, secuestrar, dinamitar. Ya no parece interesarles nada
ms: ni el poder, ni el bienestar popular, ni los intereses nacionales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla sigue manejando, claro, un discurso poltico. Ejerce control
sobre amplias zonas del territorio nacional donde el Estado brilla por su
ausencia. Y tiene la base social que le ofrecen la marginalidad y pobreza de
una poblacin que nada tiene que perder. Y es que para un jornalero del
campo o un marginado urbano ingresar a la subversin puede significar
incluso una mejora en sus condiciones de vida.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Mientras no cambien estas circunstancias objetivas, la guerrilla tendr
siempre carne de can para alimentar sus filas. Y podr camuflar la
impresionante perversin de sus ideales invocando motivos sociales y causas
patriticas. Lo grave es que la situacin del pas, la parlisis del
Gobierno el agotamiento del presupuesto social, el deterioro de la economa
y dems signos de la crisis, indican que, lejos de mejorar, estas
condiciones pueden empeorar.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla ya lo sabe y por eso promovi un "paro armado". Que fue una
forma de medir su fuerza y la del gobierno. Y si bien su poder de
convocatoria result escaso, porque carece de credibilidad poltica, si
demostr su poder de intimidacin en muchas regiones del pas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo del paro representa un audaz paso en su estrategia de confrontacin
total. Consciente de la debilidad del Gobierno, la subversin quiere ampliar
el escenario de la guerra. Y todo indica que es lo que puede suceder. Basta
ver cmo los grupos de autodefensa tambin se multiplican y anuncian que van
a incrementar sus acciones contra la guerrilla.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin capacidad de liderazgo en la cpula del Estado; sin estrategia de
guerra ni poltica de paz, y con unas Fuerzas Armadas afectadas tambin por
el recorte presupuestal, no es nada halagador el panorama que se vislumbra
en materia de orden pblico en Colombia.

<H2>EL GRAN GOBIERNO EN RETROCESO</H2>
Chris Sarlo*<br>
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Se nota la tendencia hacia menos regulaciones y
gobiernos ms pequeos. Aunque el tamao y alcance del gobierno tienden a
subir y bajar, lo que Robert Nozick llama "el zigzagueo de la poltica",
podemos decir que una contraccin gubernamental permanente se lleva adelante
en Canad, Estados Unidos, partes de Europa, en el sur de Asia, Nueva
Zelanda y, ms recientemente, en Israel.<p>
	Parecen haber tres razones fundamentales en la reduccin del tamao del
estado: filosfica, econmica y pragmtica. Filosficamente se puede
argumentar que una vez dejado atrs los eufemismos, el estado es bsicamente
un instrumento coercitivo que restringe la libertad individual y la
creatividad. En trminos econmicos, el caso es que la intervencin
gubernamental reduce la eficiencia de la economa, lo cual resulta en menos
empleos y un nivel de vida ms bajo. La razn pragmtica es sencilla: una
inmensa deuda pblica y la inconveniencia poltica de aumentar los impuestos
significa que el gobierno tiene que recortar sus gastos. En Canad predomina
esta ltima razn. La deuda obliga a reducir el tamao del estado.<p>0
	Cualquiera que sea la motivacin, la contraccin del estado se puede hacer
bien o mal. Un ejemplo de lo ltimo es la llamada poltica de "contrato
social", donde se tratan de reducir gastos sin reducir el nmero de
funcionarios pblicos. Ese camino confronta graves problemas. Primero, parte
de la causa de la deuda pblica es que el gobierno es demasiado grande, hay
demasiada gente trabajando en el sector pblico. Se llega a esa situacin
por creer que no hay problema que no pueda ser resuelto con la creacin de
una nueva agencia, comisin o superintendencia.<p>
	En estos asuntos hay que preguntarse si lo que queremos que el gobierno
haga por nosotros lo podemos nosotros mismos hacer mejor. Acaso en este o
aquel campo el mercado y los arreglos particulares de la gente pueden
producir mejores resultados que la accin estatal? De ser as, tenemos que
resistir la tentacin de pedir que el gobierno lo haga. Todas las sociedades
deben hacerse peridicamente esta pregunta clave.<p>
	Probablemente habr un consenso sobre las principales funciones del estado,
respecto a las funciones de la polica, justicia y defensa nacional. Habr
tambin consenso sobre exclusiones. En Canad, por ejemplo, cada da hay ms
oposicin a que el gobierno confiera subsidios a empresas privadas,
incluyendo la agricultura. Y el financiamiento gubernamental de grupos de
presin es cada da ms criticado. Tambin es ahora polticamente posible la
privatizacin de servicios pblicos como el correo y el sistema de pensiones
del Seguro Social.<p>
	El verdadero debate surge en las reas de salud, beneficencia, regulacin y
ayuda extranjera. Mientras no est clara la necesidad de tener monopolios
estatales en esas reas, no ser fcil combatir los argumentos en favor de
la intervencin estatal. Lo que s sabemos es que los adelantos tecnolgicos
hacen cada da ms viable la privatizacin y la eliminacin de regulaciones.<p>
	Una vez que hayamos decidido cul es el papel apropiado para el gobierno,
hay que eliminar todas las dems funciones que no se justifican. Claro que
hay que proceder con compasin y ello incluye campaas de entrenamiento de
empleados pblicos para que se puedan ganar la vida en otras actividades.<p>
	La reconsideracin peridica del papel del estado, con el propsito de ir
pasando funciones al sector privado que ste pueda llevar a cabo con mayor
eficiencia, es algo esencial para todas las naciones que quieran evitar los
costosos errores del pasado. <p>

<h2>
UN DEPARTAMENTO DE ESTADO VERDE
</h2>     
     
     
James H. Sheehan*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El secretario de Estado Warren Christopher ha declarado
la proteccin mundial del medio ambiente como principio fundamental de la
poltica exterior de Estados Unidos. En discursos recientes, el Sr.
Christopher anunci la "Iniciativa Ambiental para el siglo XXI", como agenda
ambiciosa de las iniciativas diplomticas verdes que tiene la intencin de
promover con renovado vigor por todo el mundo.
<dd>	Esta poltica ha sido "considerablemente influenciada" por el
vicepresidente Al Gore, de donde provienen muchas de las iniciativas
ambientales de la administracin Clinton. Tal influencia comenz con el
nombramiento de Tim Wirth al cargo de subsecretario de Estado para asuntos
mundiales. Ms recientemente, Christopher orden el comienzo de la promocin
de una ideologa amistosa hacia la Tierra por parte del Departamento de
Estado. Y en marzo hizo un peregrinaje a Brasil para demostrar su compromiso
con los bosques tropicales.
<dd>	La administracin Clinton est usando el medio ambiente como tema para
atacar al Congreso Republicano y sus abortados planes de reformar la
poltica ambiental y de recortar el presupuesto en esta rea. Creyendo que
el ambientalismo es un buen tema electoral, Christopher ha propuesto
restricciones internacionales a los bosques, ocanos y al uso de materias
qumicas. Los activistas ambientales aplauden estas propuestas como un muy
esperado adelanto. Pero no van a ser muy populares entre el pblico. Muchos
estadounidenses se voltearon contra Clinton en las ltimas elecciones
parlamentarias porque medidas excesivas de este tipo daan la economa y
devalan sus propiedades. La terca insistencia en este tema muestra la
inconexin del gobierno con el votante comn.
<dd>	Mientras los estadounidenses han sealado sus deseos de menores impuestos y
un gobierno ms pequeo, el Departamento de Estado exige ms dinero para ser
gastado en programas burocrticos de las Naciones Unidas y del Banco
Mundial. Los estadounidenses no quieren gastar el dinero de sus impuestos
para sostener a gobiernos extranjeros ni para subsidiar a las grandes
corporaciones.
<dd>	Luego de un invierno congelado, el Departamento de Estado apoya
restricciones a la utilizacin de energa a travs del Tratado de las
Naciones Unidas sobre Cambio Climtico. Se estima que las propuestas del
Departamento de Estado para regular el uso de combustibles como el petrleo
y el carbn costarn 600.000 puestos de trabajo y aadirn un dlar al
precio de cada galn de gasolina. La protesta pblica por el costo de la
gasolina recientemente llev al Congreso a tratar de rebajar los impuestos
aumentados por Clinton. Si la utilizacin de combustibles contribuye al
efecto invernadero, entonces el viento polar que sopla sobre Estados Unidos
durante el invierno debiera ser menos fro en vez de ms fro.
<dd>	El Departamento de Estado quiere que el Senado ratifique el Tratado de
Biodiversidad, que contiene clusulas sobre inventarios nacionales de la
flora y la fauna, reviviendo viejas propuestas de planificacin central por
parte de los gobiernos sobre el uso de la tierra. Adems de imponer onerosas
regulaciones a la biotecnologa, la ratificacin del Senado obligara a los
contribuyentes a subsidiar restricciones similares en pases extranjeros.
<dd>	La agenda verde del secretario Christopher incluye la participacin de
Estados Unidos en la reciente Cumbre de la Ciudad, Habitat II, llevada a
cabo en Estambul. Esta fue otra de una serie de conferencias de las Naciones
Unidas sobre el ambiente, la poblacin, la pobreza y los derechos de las
mujeres. En Estambul se trat de conseguir el consenso de que el "desarrollo
sostenible" se convierta en principio fundamental en el desarrollo de las
ciudades y, al igual que en las anteriores conferencias, las discusiones
tuvieron que ver con la redistribucin mundial del ingreso y mayor
intervencin de los gobiernos en la economa.
<dd>	El intento de la administracin Clinton de mezclar cuestiones ambientales
con relaciones diplomticas est destinado al fracaso. Los estadounidenses
no favorecen mayores gastos en programas internacionales. Aunque algunos
gobiernos extranjeros sern tentados a colaborar con el presidente Clinton,
con la esperanza de recibir asistencia financiera, otros se darn cuenta que
las consecuencias de tales imposiciones ambientales conllevan costosas
restricciones al crecimiento econmico y al desarrollo. A fin de cuentas,
todo eso representa niveles inaceptables de intervencin extranjera en los
asuntos internos de naciones soberanas e independientes. &copy;

<h2>
UNIVERSIDADES QUE ENGAAN A LOS ESTUDIANTES
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio

William E. Simon
</a>

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- Actualmente hay casi 15 millones de estudiantes en las
universidades de Estados Unidos. Como nacin gastamos anualmente casi
$170.000 millones en estudios superiores. El costo de una educacin
universitaria de cuatro aos flucta, segn la universidad seleccionada,
entre $50.000 y $100.000 y los costos siguen en aumento.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A pesar del financiamiento de fuentes privadas y pblicas, una buena
educacin universitaria es una inversin considerable para la clase media y
conseguir el dinero requerido es una fuente de angustia para muchos padres.
Pero, qu estn recibiendo los estudiantes, los padres y el pblico a
cambio de esa inversin? La triste verdad es que mientras ms jvenes creen
que es esencial tener un ttulo universitario, aunque signifique una pesada
deuda, ms y ms instituciones superiores ofrecen cursos de estudios que la
mayora de los estadounidenses que viven en el mundo real encuentran sin
sentido y sin contenido prctico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Recientemente la National Association of Scholars (NAS), un grupo de
profesores que laboran en reforzar las normas acadmicas, presentaron un
informe desbastador, mostrando hasta donde las principales universidades han
desmantelado rigurosos requisitos que los estudiantes tenan antes que
cumplir para graduarse.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En su investigacin sobre los programas de estudios de 50 universidades,
NAS reporta una disminucin constante desde los aos 60 en requisitos
especficos que antes introducan a los estudiantes a conocimientos bsicos
en reas claves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En lugar de los requisitos bsicos en los primeros dos aos exigidos hace
una generacin, que se fundamentaban en estudios de literatura inglesa,
historia de la civilizacin occidental, idiomas extranjeros, ciencias,
matemticas y religin, a los estudiantes de hoy en las ms famosas
universidades se les da entera libertad para que ocupen su tiempo asistiendo
a una variedad de cursos que estn de moda y cuyo contenido consternara a
estudiantes y profesores de una generacin atrs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El requisito de un idioma extranjero ha sido abolido por muchas de nuestras
mejores universidades. En 1964, por ejemplo, 90% de las universidades
exigan cursos en ciencias naturales, pero para 1994 el nmero se haba
reducido a 34% y en matemticas la obligatoriedad se redujo durante el mismo
perodo de 36% a 12%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La duracin del ao escolar se ha reducido de 191 das de clases en 1964 a
156 en 1993. La proporcin de universidades con clases los sbados cay de
79% a 6% y hasta las clases los viernes son hoy poco frecuentes en algunas
universidades. La duracin de las clases tambin se ha reducido.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Los profesores se han dado cuenta que a medida que se reducen los
requisitos, ellos tienen que dedicarle menos tiempo a los estudiantes,
dedicndolo ms bien a investigacin especializada. Al reducir normas
difciles, los administradores mejoran la retencin de estudiantes, lo cual
es importante a medida que aumenta la competencia entre universidades.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No hay duda de que todo este proceso comenz durante las rebeliones
estudiantiles de los aos 60, cuando los activistas se burlaban de los
programas tradicionales de estudios, tachndolos de irrelevantes en sus
grandiosos proyectos de cambio revolucionario.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Es irnico que cuando necesitamos de una educacin rigurosa para competir
en un exigente mercado mundial, nuestras universidades estn eliminando
requisitos y aadiendo cursos sin valor alguno. Tambin es irnico que ha
medida que el resto del mundo adopta los ideales polticos y econmicos de
la cultura occidental, nuestras instituciones acadmicas se ocupan de
repudiarlos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Afortunadamente contamos con la ayuda de grupos como NAS, a la vez que
padres, estudiantes y funcionarios pblicos comienzan a exigir un adecuado
retorno sobre la inversin en estudios superiores, rechazando cursos tontos
que no sirven para nada. Como siempre sucede en el libre mercado, el mal
servicio ser rechazado y la gente votar con su dinero a favor de una
educacin que prepara a la juventud para una vida productiva de ciudadanos
educados.

FALSEDADES AMBIENTALES

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Cinco temas ambientales demuestran las
distorsiones y el mal uso de la ciencia en el diseo de polticas
gubernamentales, durante el ltimo ao:
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Recalentamiento de la Tierra: Durante 1995, cuentos de terror predecan
catstrofes por el "efecto invernadero", mientras que la evidencia sobre el
supuesto recalentamiento era cada vez ms dbil. En la primera Conferencia
del Tratado Climtico Mundial, en abril del ao pasado en Berln,
descubrimientos cientficos fueron ignorados, se procedi a establecer un
Secretariado Permanente y a preparar una megaconferencia. En septiembre, por
iniciativa del vicepresidente Al Gore, otra reunin en Washington promovi
un nuevo temor ligado al recalentamiento: la propagacin de enfermedades
tropicales que afectaran a 3.000 millones de personas. En noviembre en
Madrid y en diciembre en Roma, el Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambios
Climticas, auspiciados por las Naciones Unidas, se las ingeni para aprobar
dos informes preliminares en borrador, ambos muy econmicos con la verdad.
Presentaron los hechos en forma selectiva, mientras se abstuvieron de
incluir datos que indican cero recalentamiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante una burocracia desbocada a la que no le importa la evidencia
cientfica, Estados Unidos debe retirarse del Tratado antes de que las
Naciones Unidas nos lleven a la ruina econmica.
<li>Ozono estratosfrico y el cncer de la piel: Desde el 31 de diciembre
est prohibida la fabricacin de gases tipo fren y otras substancias
qumicas bajo la errada creencia que es la manera de evitar una epidemia de
cncer de la piel. La evidencia cientfica no existe y todo se bas en una
conferencia de prensa en 1992, donde se habl de un inminente "agujero de
ozono rtico" que nunca sucedi. No hay evidencia de que las radiaciones
ultravioletas que alcanzan la superficie terrestre estn incrementndose y
mediciones en laboratorios muestran que el melanoma mortal del cncer de la
piel no es afectado por el nivel del ozono atmosfrico.
<li>Humo de segunda mano: En noviembre el Servicio de Investigacin del
Congreso encontr que no hay respaldo cientfico en la teora que el humo de
fumadores causa cncer entre los no fumadores, ya que hubo manipulacin de
las cifras presentadas en las investigaciones de la Agencia de Proteccin
Ambiental (EPA).		
<li>La falsa alarma del gas radn: Antes de la Segunda Guerra, pequeas
dosis radioactivas eran consideradas saludables. Los ricos disfrutaban de
baos termales con agua ligeramente radioactiva. Inclusive nuestros cuerpos
contienen radioactividad natural. Se sabe que dosis radioactivas por debajo
de cierto nivel no son dainas. Sin embargo, la EPA insiste en que el radn
es "la principal amenaza ambiental contra la salud", causando que familias
gasten miles de dlares en detectar y erradicar el radn de sus casas.
<li>El ruinoso afn por "cero riesgo": La ms costosa de todas las
regulaciones es la Clusula Delaney de 1958 que impone el concepto de cero
riesgo. Cuando inmensas dosis de substancias como PCB, dioxn, ETS, alar,
etc. resultan fatales para ratones, se prohibe su inclusin en alimentos,
aunque el contenido sea nfimo. Esto cobra significacin cuando se toma en
cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales estn costando $150.000 millones al
ao, o sea $1.500 por cada familia estadounidense. 
</ol>
<blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La misin principal del Proyecto Ciencia y Medio Ambiente es estudiar el
uso y el mal uso de la ciencia en referencia a leyes ambientales, poniendo
al descubierto fraudes y mitos, como los del asbesto, la lluvia cida y el
alar, para mencionar slo unos pocos que han causado el derroche de miles de
millones de dlares.

<h2>
SEGURO SOCIAL CONTRA LA FAMILIA
</h2>     
     
     
Robert A. Sirico*
<p>

GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los votos que he tomado como sacerdote,
incluyendo el de pobreza y castidad, no son para todo el mundo. Otros tienen
la vocacin de ser padres y madres, de proveer para su familia y sus
comunidades. Cuando el gobierno los despoja de su dinero, los est
desanimando de tener hijos y se les coarta artificialmente tal vocacin.
<dd>	Sabemos que los gobiernos reducen la riqueza de la gente a travs de
impuestos y de inflacin. Gracias a programas como el del Seguro Social, los
hijos y las familias extensas han perdido su valor econmico. Antes haba un
contrato implcito de que los padres se ocuparan de sus hijos, quienes a su
vez se ocuparan de los padres cuando estos no pudieran seguirse ganando la
vida. Cada uno sera as protegido durante los aos vulnerables. Hoy en da
a muchos padres les horroriza tener que depender de sus hijos y los hijos
-aun en tiempos malos- resienten tener que ocuparse de sus padres. Que lo
haga el gobierno.
<dd>	Mientras muchos jvenes se lavan las manos en cuanto a la responsabilidad
que tienen con respecto a sus padres, tambin ponen en duda que van a
recibir un centavo en pensiones del Seguro Social. Y tienen razn. Para la
primera dcada del nuevo siglo, los impuestos a la nmina no sern
suficientes para cubrir los beneficios de los pensionados.
<dd>	Ha llegado el momento de dejar de hablar slo de economa e introducir el
elemento moral al debate. Por falta de fuertes argumentos morales del lado
reformista, el intento de reformar la beneficencia pblica fracas el ao
pasado. Una reforma econmica radical necesita de respaldo moral. De otra
forma, la victoria siempre ser de los demagogos.
<dd>	Hay argumentos morales contra el actual sistema de Seguridad Social? Claro
que s. El Seguro Social fue originalmente establecido como una forma de
ahorro. El trabajador aportaba una parte de sus ingresos a cambio de
seguridad econmica en la vejez. Esa es la promesa que el gobierno
cnicamente rompe. Y all mismo est el poderoso argumento moral a favor de
la privatizacin del Seguro Social.
<dd>	Cuando el mercado aporta los servicios, la gente est en libertad de
participar o de retirarse del programa. Los administradores  de los fondos
tienen el incentivo de cumplir con sus obligaciones y con la palabra
empeada. Los que no lo hacen, desaparecen. Pero no es as con el gobierno,
el cual se basa en un intercambio coercitivo, no voluntario. Desaparecen,
entonces, los incentivos para cumplir con lo ofrecido. Por eso es que el
gobierno utiliza los fondos del Seguro Social en gastos corrientes,
reemplazndolos con promesas de pago. Por eso es que se acusa al Seguro
Social de ser una pirmide fraudulenta.
<dd>	Los trabajadores no tienen manera de salirse aunque saben que se trata de
un fraude. La "promesa" ha dejado de parecerse a un contrato, convirtindose
en un sistema basado en el saqueo intergeneracional, con el botn
disminuyendo progresivamente a travs del tiempo. Las nuevas generaciones no
slo dejarn de percibir los intereses sino que ni siquiera recuperarn el
capital. Tampoco contarn con la ayuda de sus hijos cuando estn viejos. A
menos que hagamos algo se incrementarn las peleas y las recriminaciones
entre las generaciones
<dd>	Sin el Seguro Social, los jvenes estaran nuevamente conscientes de su
obligacin de pagar la deuda que tienen con sus padres. Cada uno planeara
su futuro, en lugar de depender de programas coercitivos del gobierno. Las
distintas generaciones comenzaran a redescubrir el valor de cada una de ellas.
<dd>	La moralidad del mercado es que los contratos son honestos y las promesas
se cumplen. Los gobiernos no estn atados a tales valores morales.
Necesitamos de una seguridad social que le sea fiel a su nombre. &copy;

<TITLE>Smith: Sea Bueno, Produzca Utilidades -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>SEA BUENO, PRODUZCA UTILIDADES</H2>
Fred L. Smith*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El fracaso del socialismo ha obligado a muchos de sus
partidarios a buscar nuevas maneras de alcanzar viejos objetivos. Ahora una
variante popular es la "responsabilidad social de la empresa". Los ex
socialistas ahora admiten que el capitalismo juega un papel importante, pero
ese papel debe ser limitado porque omite valores importantes, tales como la
"equidad" en el trabajo, las ramificaciones ecolgicas de actividades
empresariales, el impacto sobre los nios y las minoras, las virtudes de un
trabajo seguro, etc. Alegan que si juntamos la eficiencia capitalista con la
justicia social, el mundo sera mejor. Es eso verdad?
<dd>	
Es cierto que el capitalismo tiene sus problemas, aquellos que el
economista Schumpeter llam "elementos destructivos creativos". Cuando una
gran empresa quiebra, causa el caos entre miles de vidas. Si un producto
est mal diseado o se utiliza de manera no anticipada el resultado puede
ser desastroso. Una industria puede manejar mal sus residuos y desechos,
tirndolos a un ro o al aire que respiran sus vecinos. A menudo la frialdad
impersonal del mercado amenaza los clidos valores de una sociedad tradicional.
<dd>	
No sera maravilloso si los ciudadanos-trabajadores, motivados por una
cvica filantropa y laborando en empresas conscientes de sus
responsabilidades sociales se unieran todos para eliminar la pobreza, el
racismo, la contaminacin y dems prejuicios e iniquidades del mundo? 
<dd>	
Cuidado. El resultado podra ser mucho peor que la realidad de hoy. El
movimiento en pro de la "responsabilidad empresarial" no comprende los retos
de la sociedad moderna: la necesidad de la especializacin y de
interacciones annimas. El altruismo es un atributo demasiado raro para ser
la base de una sociedad moderna porque no hay suficiente cantidad de Madres
Teresas para lograrlo. Como lo expres Adam Smith, una larga vida apenas
genera un reducido grupo de amigos ntimos, pero todos los das tratamos
pacficamente, a travs del mercado, con un inmenso mundo compuesto de
extraos. El comunitarismo no es suficiente para organizar a una sociedad
moderna. Confiar en los ms diversos intereses personales para organizar
tales relaciones no es el resultado de la maldad sino, ms bien, de la
necesidad.
<dd>	
Una empresa junto con sus accionistas debe ocuparse de su "familia"
corporativa inmediata: sus empleados y vecinos, sus suplidores y sus
clientes. Esos grupos tienen un inters en la prosperidad a largo plazo de
la firma. Extender esa relacin al resto del mundo es permitir que se
entrometa gente que no tiene ninguna razn para averiguar el valor de la
empresa ni importarle su supervivencia. La sociedad moderna es posible
porque la mayora de la gente est excluida de la mayora de las
actividades. Las instituciones del mercado -propiedad privada, contratos, la
compaa annima- son dispositivos de exclusin. Estos crean esferas
circunscritas de responsabilidad y poder, en las cuales cada uno de nosotros
juega papeles especializados para mutuo beneficio.
<dd>	
Una empresa no se funda para resolver los problemas del mundo. Su formato
distingue a un grupo de personas como accionistas -los que aportan capital-
de todas los dems. La empresa contrata gerentes para administrar el capital
en beneficio de los accionistas. Inclusive, el inters de los accionistas
tiende a limitarse a si la empresa es lucrativa o no; a si su dinero estara
mejor invertido en otra parte. No tomar eso en cuenta y pretender que "su
empresa" es "mi empresa" nos conduce al colectivismo, lo cual socava las
bases de la sociedad moderna y amenaza con devolvernos a un pasado tribal.

<title>Stelzer: Guerra Contra Fabricas LatinoAmericans -- 8/7/96</title>

<h2>GUERRA CONTRA FABRICAS LATINOAMERICANAS</h2><br>
Irwin Stelzer*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columinsits/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los altos ejecutivos estadounidenses estn descontentos.
Primero fueron el blanco de crticas por sus altos salarios, enfrentan
incertidumbre en la Bolsa de Valores y, adems, estn siendo acusados de
explotar a mujeres y nios en los pases en desarrollo.<dd>
	Las empresas estadounidenses dependen de contratistas y subcontratistas
extranjeros que manufacturan de todo, desde franelas para Gap hasta zapatos
Nike. Esto fue llevado a la atencin del pblico cuando denunciantes
revelaron que la ropa vendida con el nombre de una conocida presentadora de
televisin estaba siendo producida tanto en Honduras como en la ciudad de
Nueva York bajo malas condiciones de trabajo.<dd>
	En el escndalo que sigui, Kathie Lee Gifford, la presentadora de
televisin, casada con un conocido atleta, pidi perdn con lgrimas en los
ojos ante una Comisin del Congreso, mientras su marido distribua billetes
entre los oprimidos trabajadores en Nueva York y todo ello era filmado por
las cmaras de televisin.<dd>
	Simultneamente, Michael Jordan, la estrella del baloncesto firmaba un
contrato por $25 millones, una cantidad que fcilmente doblar con su
patrocinio de Nike. Los denunciantes lo acusaron, entonces, de ganancias
inmorales, mientras los trabajadores que manufacturan los Nike ganan unos
pocos dlares al da.<dd>
	Peor todava, algunas de las fbricas que producen marcas americanas
mantienen condiciones indeseables, por lo menos segn el estndar de este
pas, acostumbrado al aire acondicionado en las factoras. As que adems de
acusaciones de trasladar la manufactura de sus productos a otros pases y
despedir empleados estadounidenses, a los ejecutivos ahora se les acusa de
explotar a nios del Tercer Mundo para aumentar sus ya groseras ganancias.<dd>
	Las acusaciones provienen no slo de reformistas bien intencionados sino de
sindicatos empeados en reducirle la competencia al obrero estadounidense.
Se trata de una guerra de los sindicatos en contra de la globalizacin de la
economa.<dd>
	Lamentablemente, los argumentos sobre la responsabilidad de las empresas
norteamericanas hacia los trabajadores extranjeros estn dominados por
emociones ms que razones. Una activista me inform haber logrado convencer
a una cadena de tiendas a dejar de utilizar muchachas para elaborar la ropa
que venden. Cuando le pregunt qu estaban haciendo ahora esas jvenes
salvadoreas desempleadas, me contest que asuma habran regresado a la
escuela. Es mucho ms probable que estn ahora trabajando por salarios ms
bajos y en peores condiciones.<dd>
	Es cierto que Nike se ha convertido en un gigante, pero que est obligado a
hacer ms que obedecer la ley de los pases donde opera es una propuesta
dudosa. No es probable que los trabajadores de las naciones en desarrollo
estaran mejor si Estados Unidos restringe la fabricacin en el extranjero.
Un ejecutivo me cuenta que l paga $25 mensuales a trabajadores chinos,
quienes se han convertido en los ricos del pueblo. En Honduras, los
trabajadores que cosen pantalones Levi's ganan $5,40 al da, el doble del
salario mnimo.<dd>
	Los que se la dan de protectores de los trabajadores mexicanos y
centroamericanos estn tratando de acabar con puestos de trabajo que ofrecen
oportunidades escasas en esos pases, sin aumentar los precios que los
consumidores pagan por tales productos. <p>

<H2>COSTA RICA: ESTAFA LEGALIZADA</H2>
Rigoberto Stewart*<br>
<p>
SAN JOSE DE COSTA RICA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
La deuda pblica se ha convertido
mundialmente en un grave problema que amenaza destruir economas y los
sistemas democrticos. Sin embargo, pocos pases encaran con seriedad el
problema y Costa Rica no es uno de ellos. 
<P>El problema es que los gobiernos gastan mucho ms de lo que recaudan y
prefieren financiar el dficit con crditos y con emisiones monetarias, que
es un impuesto indirecto. As, cada administracin deja en herencia a la
siguiente una deuda mayor. Por tal razn, la deuda pblica costarricense
crece como una bola de nieve.
<P>Entre 1993 y 1996, la deuda interna en Costa Rica se triplic. En
1996 crece 26% sobre 1995 y en 1997 aumentar 27%. A finales de 1995, la
deuda pblica total -interna, externa y no documentada a algunas
instituciones pblicas, como el Seguro Social- era de $6.943 millones,
equivalente a 77% del PIB. Y en 1997 se espera que llegue a US$7.937. La
deuda total por habitante crece ms rpido que la produccin econmica
(PIB). Esto indica que el pas no se est endeudando para realizar
inversiones productivas, y que pronto un sector grande de la poblacin
trabajar slo para pagar la deuda.
<P>Es sostenible tal situacin? El ministro de Hacienda dice que no hay
parmetros internacionales que indiquen el nivel ptimo de la deuda pblica.
No obstante, el PIB es un buen indicador de la capacidad de pago. Los
estadounidenses han estado alarmados porque su deuda pblica ha oscilado
entre 24% y 42% del PIB desde 1933, y porque el pago de intereses ha
representado entre 7% y 14% del presupuesto fiscal, y entre 1,5% y 3% del
PIB. En Costa Rica, la deuda alcanzar 86% del PIB en 1997, mientras que el
pago de intereses ya representa un tercio del gasto pblico anual y ms del
5% del PIB. Adems de alarmante, esta situacin es totalmente insostenible.
Pero las autoridades, que siguen gastando a manos llenas, apenas dan
muestras de preocupacin.
<P>Aparte de otros daos, la deuda pblica frena el desarrollo. Al recurrir a
los mercados financieros en busca de recursos, el gobierno impide que muchas
empresas obtengan financiamiento, a la vez que hace subir las tasas de
inters. Esto conduce a menos inversin, menos produccin, menos empleo
productivo y menos creacin de riqueza. Y al tomar dinero de instituciones
pblicas, como  la  Caja de Seguro Social y de telecomunicaciones, deja a la
ciudadana con menos servicios pblicos.
<P>En Amrica Latina, los gobernantes suelen ejercer el poder
endeudando a la poblacin sin ningn lmite, y cuatro aos despus se van,
sin responder por sus actos. Adems, casi todo el crdito pblico va a
gastos, no a inversin, lo que implica que los gobernantes se estn comiendo
hoy la produccin de generaciones futuras. Algo realmente inmoral.  
<P>En Costa Rica, adems, la deuda pblica ha sido un instrumento de estafa.
El 58% de la deuda interna es contrada con instituciones del Estado, o sea,
el Estado se endeuda consigo mismo; pero le cobra la factura a los
contribuyentes. En realidad, esta deuda tambin representa impuestos futuros
dilapidados hoy. Por otra parte, 42% de la deuda es con el sector privado.
En este caso, el Estado le pide prestado a los ricos para concederles
privilegios, pero recurre a los pobres para cancelar la deuda. Este esquema
es un mecanismo de transferencia de pobres a ricos. Una estafa legalizada.
<P>Hoy sabemos que no hay ningn servicio que no pueda ser
brindado por una entidad diferente al Estado. De ah que, los libertarios
costarricenses han propuesto las siguientes tres acciones, para solucionar
definitivamente el problema de la deuda: Primero, vender los activos del
Estado y, con el dinero, cancelar la deuda. Para lograr el mayor precio
posible, los activos seran vendidos mediante subastas abiertas a todo el
mundo. Se ha estimado que la venta del Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (electricidad y telecomunicaciones) podra generar unos $1.500
millones, la mitad de la deuda externa. Segundo, retirar al Estado de todas
las actividades que no le competen. Tercero, prohibir, por medio de la
Constitucin, el endeudamiento futuro del Estado. Esto ltimo es esencial
para que la solucin del problema sea permanente.

<h2>
SOCIALISMO VENEZOLANO SOCORRIDO POR EL FMI
</h2>     
     
     
Alejandro J. Sucre
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Con la ceremonia de la firma del prstamo de $1.400
millones, el Fondo Monetario Internacional est oficialmente de vuelta en
Venezuela desde el 3 de junio. El director gerente del FMI, Michael
Camdessus, nos record -lleno de orgullo- que a raz del anterior acuerdo en
1989 el gasto social y la inversin gubernamental aumentaron. Los polticos
venezolanos respiran ahora aliviados por el auxilio del FMI y los
inversionistas extranjeros estn alertas a oportunidades de negocios.
Irnicamente, el venezolano comn fue quien sali perdiendo.
Se han dado algunos pasos positivos. En enero, el gobierno venezolano
reabri el sector petrolero a inversionistas extranjeros. El nombramiento de
Teodoro Petkoff -un ex guerrillero comunista- como ministro de Planificacin
ha sido bien recibido por su nueva retrica pro mercado.  El gobierno acept
las condiciones del FMI sobre la eliminacin del control de precios y de
cambios, terminando tambin con el inmenso subsidio al precio de la gasolina.
Pero tales medidas en realidad significan muy poco. El FMI nos impuso sus
tpicas medidas de austeridad e incremento de impuestos.  Peor todava, el
prstamo del FMI slo sirve para  financiar la crisis de balanza de pagos,
la cual debi haber sido resuelta a travs de los mecanismos de mercado. Y
la apertura petrolera a inversionistas extranjeros lejos de significar la
privatizacin de la industria petrolera la aleja porque las utilidades
compartidas y los ingresos impositivos del nuevo esquema de explotacin irn
directamente a engrosar el estado. Esos nuevos ingresos lejos de ser
herramientas de desarrollo sern el nuevo sustento de las corruptas
instituciones polticas.  
<dd>Venezuela sigue dndole la espalda a la solucin a sus problemas: el
traspaso a manos privadas de los inmensos activos que el estado derrocha.
Por este camino seguimos avanzando hacia la desintegracin econmica,
mientras que los nuevos recursos petroleros y el acuerdo con el FMI
facilitan y financian esa fatal trayectoria.
<dd>Durante los ltimos 20 aos, el estamento poltico venezolano ha acumulado
control sobre los activos del pas a una velocidad vertiginosa. Se estima
que 70% de los activos productivos pertenecen al estado, contra 25% en 1970.
Las propiedades del estado incluyen todas las minas, el petrleo, fbricas
petroqumicas, las industrias de aluminio y acero, playas, puertos, gran
parte de las tierras agrcolas, inmuebles, hoteles, 60% del sistema
bancario, compaas manufactureras, estaciones de radio y televisin, etc. Y
todas esas empresas estatales, a excepcin de las petroleras, pierden dinero
a manos llenas. Sin el esquema de apertura petrolera y el financiamiento del
FMI, el estado venezolano se vera obligado a privatizar.
<dd>A pesar de los inmensos ingresos petroleros (ms de $350.000 millones desde
1976), estos ya resultan insuficientes para los polticos, drenando su poder
de comprar elecciones. Segn las ltimas encuestas, ningn poltico ni
partido goza de ms del 8% de las preferencias del electorado. Pero el
retroceso logrado ha sido dantesco. 
<dd>Desde 1976, el PIB per capita del venezolano ha cado en 39% y la inflacin
se ha multiplicado 110 veces. Hoy el dficit fiscal equivale al 16% del PIB;
el servicio de la deuda externa absorbe 25% de las exportaciones; la deuda
es de $35.000 millones; el desempleo de 20% y  51% de  la poblacin activa
trabaja en el sector informal de la economa. La clase media se ha contrado
de 25% a apenas 18% de la poblacin.  
<p>
En lugar de correr la arruga endeudndonos ms, aumentando impuestos y
tarifas de servicios pblicos, el gobierno debi superar la crisis
instrumentando las reformas necesarias: 
<ul>
<li>  Privatizacin del 20% de la industria petrolera para pagar toda la deuda
externa.
<li>  Liquidacin de $2.000 millones de activos bancarios asumidos por el
estado a raz de la crisis del sector financiero de 1994, para reducir la
deuda pblica interna y el costo de intereses.
<li>  Reducir el gasto pblico a travs de un programa de capitalizacin que
coloque en manos de los ciudadanos todos los activos del estado socialista,
incluyendo escuelas pblicas, hospitales y el 80% remanente de PDVSA.  Slo
devolviendo a la ciudadana la propiedad de los activos productivos de la
nacin se cambia el rumbo econmico. Los subsidios a la gasolina, los
impuestos ni las tarifas de los servicios pblicos se han debido alterar
antes de traspasarle a la ciudadana los recursos productivos del pas.
El FMI ha tenido un papel vergonzoso en toda esta comedia de errores.
Financiar el dficit fiscal con nuevo endeudamiento y elevando impuestos se
sacrifica y se empobrece ms al pueblo. Luego del alboroto propagandstico
de las ltimas semanas, la Venezuela de hoy sigue siendo la misma de ayer.
La economa sigue en manos de polticos y burcratas ineptos y corruptos,
mientras que los burcratas del FMI parecen creer que el capitalismo slo
funciona en las naciones del G-7y hay que evitar su contagio al mundo en
desarrollo.
</ul>
<dd>	Ningn plan del FMI ni pacto estatista con las grandes corporaciones
petroleras detendr la devaluacin, la inflacin y el progresivo
empobrecimiento, a menos que el ciudadano comn tenga los incentivos
necesarios para convertirse en verdadero motor de la economa. Por ahora,
los venezolanos estamos forzados a aceptar la Agenda Caldera-FMI: aumento de
impuestos y de los servicios pblicos y seremos testigos de cmo esos fondos
son despilfarrados. &copy;

HAITI, EL GRAN ENGAO

<h2>
Haiti, El Gran Engao*
</h2>
John Sweeney*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace dos aos regres a Hait Jean Bertrand Aristide
bajo la proteccin de 20.000 soldados estadounidenses enviados por el
presidente Clinton para restaurar la democracia en un pas que nunca la ha
experimentado. La administracin Clinton alega que su intervencin militar
en Hait ha sido uno de los mayores xitos de la poltica exterior en la
historia americana. La realidad es que no se diferencia mucho de las dems
aventuras extranjeras de Clinton: Bosnia, Irlanda del Norte, Corea del Norte
y el Medio Oriente.
<p>
Los contribuyentes estadounidenses han desembolsillado ms de $2.000
millones para financiar la intervencin en Hait y todava ninguno de los
propsitos de la "Operacin Rescate de la Democracia" ha sido alcanzado. No
se ha establecido una firme y duradera democracia. Continan los asesinatos
polticos. Siguen las presiones econmicas y polticas para que la gente
emigre a Estados Unidos. 70% de la poblacin no sabe leer y 60% est
desempleada. Escuadrones armados estn surgiendo en el interior de la isla.
<p>
La eleccin presidencial del 17 de diciembre de 1995 result ser ni justa
ni libre, segn el Centro Carter y la presidencia de Ren Preval consolida a
Aristide como gobernante absoluto, ya que Preval har el papel de ttere por
cinco aos hasta que Aristide pueda volver a ser candidato en el ao 2000.
Gracias al apoyo de Clinton, Aristide es el lder poltico ms temido y
poderoso de Hait desde tiempos de 'Pap Doc' Duvalier. Desde su regreso,
Aristide tambin se ha hecho millonario. Los tmidos intentos privatizadores
de Preval han sido bloqueados por Aristide y nada se ha adelantado en abrir
una economa que sigue estancada.
<p>
Bejamin Gilman, presidente del Comit de Relaciones Internacionales de la
Cmara de Representantes del Congreso de Estados Unidos afirma que la
administracin Clinton "sabe desde principios de 1995 que escuadrones de la
muerte operan bajo la direccin de los jefes de seguridad del presidente
Aristide". El embajador de Estados Unidos en la isla, William Swing, inform
sobre el primero de estos asesinatos en un cable al Departamento de Estado
el 18 de febrero de 1995. Luego, en septiembre de 1995, Swing inform que el
gobierno de Aristide haba obstaculizado las investigaciones del FBI de
estos mismos asesinatos polticos. Unos 24 lderes democrticos, opositores
de Aristide, fueron asesinados en 1995, mientras muchos soldados americanos
permanecan en la isla. Todos los asesinatos fueron relacionados
directamente a los jefes de seguridad del Palacio Presidencial y Aristide
rechaz las peticiones privadas del embajador Swing y del subsecretario de
Estado Strobe Talbott para que destituyera a los culpables.
<p>
Esa misma guardia palaciega, entrenada en Virginia a un costo para los
contribuyentes estadounidenses de $5,5 millones, sigue cuidando a Preval y
exterminando a la oposicin durante 1996. El 13 de septiembre de este ao,
el gobierno de Estados Unidos envi urgentemente a 46 agentes del
Departamento de Estado y del Pentgono a Puerto Prncipe al enterarse de
rumores de golpe contra Preval. Entonces fue cuando Preval destituy al jefe
de la guardia de seguridad presidencial y a su asistente, tras una reunin
secreta con Talbott, Swing y Anthony Lake, asesor de Seguridad Nacional del
presidente Clinton.
<p>
El gobierno de Clinton est engaando al Congreso y al pblico con respecto
a Hait. La complicidad de la administracin en la poltica interna haitiana
es tan sucia que el presidente Clinton se ha visto obligado a invocar
razones de estado para tapar el total fracaso de la Operacin Rescate de la
Democracia. Aristide, un cura antiamericano que ahorc los hbitos y
pblicamente daba el visto bueno a los asesinatos de sus opositores, antes
de ser tumbado en 1991, tiene a la Casa Blanca agarrada por el pescuezo.
Clinton puede mantener el mito de una frgil paz en Hait mientras Aristide
se lo permita. Hait sigue siendo un polvorn que estallar poco despus de
la retirada de las ltimas tropas de Estados Unidos y de las Naciones Unidas.

Carlota Wigglesworth*<br>
<p>

LONDRES  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Un creciente nmero de mujeres latinoamericanas est siendo
atrapado en el terrible mundo de la pobreza y el vicio, al dedicarse al
srdido transporte de drogas. <p>
Tengo tiempo  trabajando  con mujeres  latinoamericanas en crceles de Gran
Bretaa, detenidas casi todas en los aeropuertos de Heathrow y Gatwick por
transportar drogas, principalmente cocana. En los ltimos meses he notado
un cambio radical y preocupante en la mecnica de esa importacin. Venezuela
se perfila como el puerto de salida de la droga proveniente de Colombia,
Per y Bolivia con destino a Europa. Por aos, en el grupo de 94 latinas
encarceladas en Inglaterra, haba una sola venezolana y la mayora eran
colombianas. Este ao, el nmero de venezolanas ha aumentado
considerablemente y aunque las detenciones son de nacionalidades variadas,
todas procedan de Venezuela. La edad promedio es de 22 aos; casi todas son
madres solteras, sin medios para mantener a sus hijos.  Sin ningn tipo de
recursos ni de apoyo familiar, terminan siendo reclutadas por los
narcotraficantes, quienes se concentran en los sectores pobres. En
Venezuela, 84% de la poblacin vive hoy en la pobreza y madres desesperadas
son especialmente vulnerables a las promesas de los narcotraficantes. <p>
	El reclutamiento de las llamadas "mulas" funciona de la siguiente manera.
Los agentes identifican a mujeres con deudas y desespero por cubrir las
necesidades bsicas de su familia. Le ofrecen "amistad" y ayuda material.
Cuando la mujer se enreda, la obligan a pagar la deuda trabajando en el
transporte de paquetes con droga. Si la desdichada trata de salirse del
compromiso, la amenazan con maltratar y hasta matar a sus hijos y dems
familiares. Una vez que la mujer est atrapada, la obligan a tragar
cpsulas, burdamente preparadas, rellenando condones o dedos de guantes
quirrgicos con cocana. Algunas han tragado hasta 100 cpsulas o las
"embalsaman"; esto es, sujetan pequeas bolsas de cocana al cuerpo con
vendajes. As las montan, generalmente por primera vez, en aviones. Otras
traen droga en tacones falsos, en el forro de la ropa, en maletines y bolsos
de mano, en cosmticos y hasta en alimentos.<p>
	Las autoridades britnicas estn muy bien equipadas para detectar
contrabando de drogas y los inspectores de aduana son muy competentes. Aqu
la ley es muy severa respecto al narcotrfico.<p>
En los aeropuertos de Londres presencio continuamente duras interrogaciones
a travs de intrpretes. Las someten a exmenes de rayos X y las detienen en
celdas hasta que la droga ingerida sea evacuada. La droga se pesa y se
analiza para establecer su pureza y cantidad, de lo cual depender la
ulterior sentencia.<p>
	Del aeropuerto estas mujeres son trasladadas a la prisin de Holloway,
donde permanecen hasta ser sentenciadas, unos seis meses ms tarde. Luego,
las transfieren a prisiones en el interior del pas, donde cumplen condenas
de 7, 9 o 12 aos. Sin saber el idioma ni conocer el sistema legal o las
regulaciones de la crcel, estas mujeres ingresan a un infierno, donde el
peor castigo es no saber de sus hijos y familiares.<p>
	Tenemos varios casos de mujeres que dejaron hijos pequeos a cargo de una
amiga cuando salieron de viaje "por una semana", bajo promesas de $200 a
$600 por transportar cocana con un valor en la calle de 30 a 45 mil
dlares. Los nios, quienes pronto dejan de estar a cargo de la amiga,
generalmente tan pobre como la "mula", seguidamente ingresan al implacable
crculo de la pobreza-vicio-droga-crimen.<p>
	La mujer una vez reclutada no tiene escape. Si cumple con xito su primera
misin, vuelven a usarla; si la detienen, la familia es vctima de
represalias. Visito a tres  mujeres que les  mataron los hijos. Una
colombiana recibi en la crcel la noticia del asesinato de su hijo de 16
aos, a quien durmiendo en casa de la abuela lo ejecutaron de un tiro en la
sien. A otra colombiana le mataron la hija saliendo de una tienda en Cali y
a un tercer nio lo arroll y mat un automvil, mientras que al hermano de
otra detenida lo asesinaron a palos. Vi los certificados de defuncin tengo
las pruebas.<p>
	Una espaola, detenida al llegar de Venezuela, cuenta que para drogarse se
endeud con el cartel y fue reclutada, "una vez que entras en ese circulo
-me dijo- no te puedes salir aunque lo desees y trates... despus de uno de
mis intentos de escapar, mataron a mi hermano en represalia".  <p>
	No quiero slo ayudar en lo que puedo a estas desdichadas mujeres, sino
tambin dar a conocer este horrible drama para evitar que otras muchachas
caigan en la misma tentacin, creyendo que los narcotraficantes les van a
resolver sus problemas. Slo lograrn destruir sus vidas y exponer a seres
queridos a la tortura y el asesinato. <p>

<h2>
POBRES PERO NO TONTOS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Walter Williams
</a>

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Entre 1965 y 1994, los programas gubernamentales
para eliminar la pobreza le costaron al contribuyente estadounidense
$5.400.000.000.000. Con esa cantidad se pueden comprar todas las fbricas,
toda la maquinaria industrial y todos los edificios de oficinas de este
pas. Con el dinero que queda, se pueden comprar todas las lneas areas, de
transporte terrestre y martimo. Y si todava tiene ganas de seguir de
compras, podra adquirir todas las estaciones de televisin, de radio y
plantas de energa elctrica, adems de todas las tiendas al detal y todas
las empresas mayoristas. Y todava quedaran suficientes fondos como para
comprar todo el sector agrcola, maderero y pesquero de la nacin. La
tragedia es que durante los prximos cinco aos se proyectan gastar
$2.800.000.000.000 en estos mismos programas.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Acaso los pobres reciben todo ese inmenso caudal de dinero? En 1993
haban 40 millones de pobres en Estados Unidos y se gastaron $324.000
millones en programas para combatir la pobreza, lo cual equivale a darle
$8.100 a cada persona pobre o $34.400 a cada familia pobre. Lo que en
realidad sucede es que el grueso de ese dinero no le llega a los pobres sino
que queda en manos de los parsitos que forman parte de la "industria de la
pobreza".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Adems, la forma en que estos programas estn diseados simplemente le
impiden a la gente con ganas de ganarse la vida salir del crculo vicioso
impuesto por el gobierno. Por ejemplo, en el estado de Oregon, el "paquete"
de ayuda gubernamental que recibe una madre soltera con dos nios es de
$16.959 al ao. Para que le quede esa cantidad neta, despus de pagar
impuestos, esa misma mujer tendra que percibir un sueldo anual de $19,000,
o sea $9,23 por hora. En Hawai el "paquete" de ayuda social para esa madre
es $27.736, lo cual quiere decir que para mantener su nivel de ingresos
trabajando tendra que ganar $17,50 por hora. El monto de salario por hora
equivalente a los beneficios percibidos por una madre soltera con dos nios
es de $14,75 en la ciudad de Nueva York, $12,45 en Filadelfia, $11,35 en
Baltimore y $10,90 en Detroit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Muchos de los beneficiarios de la ayuda social no tienen el entrenamiento
ecesario para ganar tales salarios. Son pobres, pero no son tan tontos como
para dejar de percibir beneficios que equivalen a $12 o $14 por hora para
esforzarse en conseguir un trabajo que les pague $5 o $6 por hora, adems de
tener que levantarse temprano, cumplir con la disciplina de un trabajo,
pasarse ocho horas diarias recibiendo rdenes de sus supervisores y gastar
en transporte, ropa adecuada, etc. Las encuestas muestran que el 70% de los
beneficiarios de ayuda social gubernamental no buscan empleo. En el largo
plazo, esto tiene devastadoras consecuencias para el pas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Para mantener el Estado Beneficencia, el Congreso le saca del bolsillo a
cada familia estadounidense que paga impuestos un promedio de $3.400 al ao.
Se trata de un nuevo tipo de esclavitud. El trmino es apropiado porque
significa que se est obligando fsicamente a alguien a hacer algo contra su
voluntad, en beneficio de otro. Como descendiente de esclavos, eso es algo
que comprendo bien y que me convierte en abolicionista.

<h2>
MODERNISMO DESCONCERTANTE
</h2>

Walter Williams*
<p>

FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Tener 60 aos significa pertenecer a otra
generacin y tener problemas ajustndose a la vida moderna. No vivimos en
una poca donde el sentido comn y la responsabilidad personal se dan por
sentado.
<dd>	Hace unas semanas mi esposa me compr un mueble de madera sin pulir para mi
oficina, con la esperanza de que se viera ms ordenada. Como persona
razonable proced a leer las instrucciones en la lata del tinte para la
madera, antes de comenzar a aplicarlo. La etiqueta tiene la siguiente
advertencia: "No se ingiera". Y me pregunt, hay gente capaz de agarrar una
lata de tintura para madera y empinrsela? Alguien suficientemente estpido
para hacer eso seguramente no sabe leer. Por qu , entonces, tal
advertencia? Me imagino que los abogados de la firma fabricante temen que
alguien se tome el contenido y demande a la empresa, consiguiendo varios
millones con la decisin de un juez que la culpe por la estupidez del
demandante.
<dd>	Tambin est el asunto de la juventud estadounidense. Me he pasado la vida
adorando a los nios, no a todos, pero s a la mayora. Ahora los nios se
han convertido en mis enemigos. Los nios permiten ser utilizados como
herramientas de un gobierno entrometido. Apenas alguien habla de dar menos
dinero del gobierno para los almuerzos escolares, alguien se monta con un
nio en el escenario y grita, "pretenden matar de hambre a este nio
inocente!" Cuando se hacen esfuerzos por reformar la beneficencia pblica
haciendo trabajar a quienes sean fsicamente capaces de hacerlo, lo primero
que omos son gritos contra "los hambreadores de nios y madres indefensas".
Cuando los tiranos en el Congreso quieren restringir por la fuerza lo que
podemos ver en la televisin y en el Internet o prohibir a adultos que fumen
si les da la gana, de nuevo son los nios los que usan como instrumentos.
<dd>	Si los nios quieren recobrar mi cario y mi fe en ellos tienen que dejar
de ser utilizados como armas por tales granujas. Los nios deben convocar
una rueda de prensa y decirle a la nacin que si alguien quiere saber lo que
ellos piensan tienen que preguntrselo a ellos y no a quienes se han
autodenominado sus representantes y defensores.
<dd>	Otro problema de desajuste a mi edad es que no s tratar a las damas como
si fueran hombres. Cuando viajo en transporte pblico, suelo ofrecer mi
asiento a una seora, si no hay otro puesto disponible. Cuando camino por la
acera con una dama, tomo instintivamente el lado de la calle y le abro las
puertas que encontremos. Algunas lo ven como caballerosidad, mientras que
ahora otras se ofenden, sintiendo que trato de insultarlas. Cmo distinguir
de antemano a las damas de las mujeres?
<dd>	Adems est el asunto de las razas. Los expertos ahora dicen que la
patologa de la vida de muchos negros es el resultado de un legado de
esclavitud, segregacin y racismo. Por eso muchos jvenes negros no saben
leer ni escribir, prolifera entre ellos el delito y menos del 40% crecen en
un hogar con padre y madre. 
<dd>	Pero en 1950, cuando yo estudiaba en la escuela pblica Benjamin Franklin
del norte de Filadelfia, no sabamos de ningn nio que no supiera leer y
escribir. A partir de 1870, la mayora de los nios negros vivan en hogares
con su pap y su mam. Los barrios negros, incluyendo el vecindario de
viviendas gubernamentales donde yo viva, eran suficientemente seguros como
para dormir con todas las puertas y ventanas abiertas durante los meses
calurosos del verano. Cmo engrana eso con lo que dicen ahora los expertos
raciales en cuanto a que la esclavitud y el racismo son las causas de los
problemas actuales? La nica explicacin es que los efectos de la esclavitud
y el racismo saltan generaciones enteras, afectando a la de hoy, pero no a
la de ayer. Nada de eso suena muy lgico, no es verdad?&copy

personal por parte de las grandes empresas, que a menudo se denuncian en la
prensa, es un ejemplo de esa estrategia.<p>
	Pongamos tales reducciones en su perspectiva correcta, preguntando si ello
resulta favorable para el pas o si el gobierno debiera intervenir para
evitarlo.<p>
	Cuando naci este pas, 95% de la poblacin tena de alguna manera que ver
con la agricultura. Hoy apenas 2% labran la tierra. Tremenda reduccin de
personal, pero ha resultado malo para la nacin? Ha debido el Congreso, en
el pasado, tomar cartas en el asunto para evitar la prdida de puestos en el
campo?<p>
	Aos atrs, la construccin pesada, de ferrocarriles, carreteras, represas,
puentes y tneles requera cuadrillas de hombres con palas y picos. Hoy,
unos pocos y muy bien pagados operadores manejan inmensos y sofisticados
equipos, apretando botones y moviendo palancas, logrando hacer en un da lo
que cientos no lograban hacer antes. La tecnificacin de la construccin
destruy miles de puestos de trabajo. Qu ha debido hacer el gobierno para
evitarlo?<p>
	Son inevitables las reducciones de personal cuando las empresas encuentran
mtodos ms baratos de produccin. La mano de obra tiende a ser el elemento
ms costoso, por lo que hay incentivos econmicos para automatizar. Cuando
se utiliza menos personal, el personal sobrante encuentra ocupacin en otra
rea de la economa. Si no se hubieran logrado formas de ahorrar mano de
obra en la agricultura, de dnde hubiesen salido los trabajadores
necesarios para producir todos los dems bienes y servicios que han
contribuido a nuestra riqueza? Si el 95% estuviera todava ocupado en
producir alimentos, no habra tiempo para obtener la educacin y el
entrenamiento necesario para aumentar la productividad.<p>
	El ao pasado Wal-Mart contrat 41.000 nuevos empleados, Motorola 5.000,
Intel casi 10.000. De hecho se crearon 9,5 millones nuevos puestos en los
ltimo cuatro aos. Si IBM y AT&T no hubieran encontrado la manera de
utilizar menos personal, en dnde hubieran las otras compaas conseguido
los empleados? La alternativa hubiera sido que se dispararan los sueldos y,
por consiguiente, los precios.<p>
	En una economa robusta, dinmica y en crecimiento, siempre habr
alteraciones en el uso de la mano de obra. Unos puestos desaparecen y otros
se crean. La intervencin del gobierno en este proceso slo empobrece a la
nacin. Seramos ms pobres si se hubiese mantenido por decreto al cochero y
al vendedor de hielo.<p>
	Nada de esto niega que las reducciones de personal causan penuria,
especialmente entre los padres de familia que tienen que pagar la hipoteca
de su casa y vestir a los hijos. Muchos tienen que aprender otros oficios o
aceptar sueldos ms bajos. Pero una economa sana y robusta facilita esa
transicin, mientras que todo lo contrario sucede en economas con leyes que
"protegen" el empleo con toda clase de regulaciones.<p>
	En cualquier momento, la inmensa mayora est empleada. Debemos aceptar
que se debilite la economa, extinguiendo toda innovacin y progreso en
beneficio de un relativamente pequeo nmero de trabajadores que pierden su
empleo como resultado de adelantos tecnolgicos, cambios del mercado y
reestructuraciones de las empresas? Pienso que no.  <p>

<H2>LA FALACIA DE LA VENTANA ROTA</H2>
Walter Williams*<br>
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Con cada leda de "Economa en una leccin",
escrito por el ya fallecido Henry Hazlitt, quedo ms impresionado por la
manera clara que este economista y periodista entenda los fundamentos de la
economa y con la agudeza de su ingenio.
<P>En el cuento de Hazlitt sobre la ventana rota, unos maleantes tiran una
piedra y rompen la ventana de una panadera. El panadero sale enfurecido,
pero alguien le dice que lo sucedido tiene su lado bueno. Los $250 que
cuesta reemplazar la vidriera le dar trabajo al cortador de vidrios.
Despus de todo, si las ventanas nunca se rompieran, qu sucedera con el
negocio de los vidrios? Al panadero tambin le recuerdan el efecto
multiplicador. El vidriero tendr $250 para gastar en otros comercios y
estos comerciantes gastarn a la vez ese dinero, continuando la cadena. Uno
podra entonces concluir que los maleantes lejos de ser una amenaza pblica
son benefactores de la sociedad.
<P>Hazlitt dice que la primera conclusin es correcta. El vidriero no va a
estar ms apesadumbrado por el vandalismo de esos muchachos que el dueo de
la funeraria por la muerte de alguien. Al panadero, sin embargo, le va a
costar $250 que pensaba ms bien gastarse en la compra de un traje nuevo. La
ganancia del vidriero va a ser a costa del sastre. Desde el punto de vista
de la comunidad, esta se empobrece por el valor de un traje que hubiera sido
confeccionado. Es fcil concluir que el vandalismo estimula la economa
porque se ver la nueva ventana, pero como el panadero no puede ahora
comprase el traje, el desempleo del sastre resulta invisible.
<P>Hay muchas maneras en que se nos engaa con diferentes versiones de la
falacia de la ventana rota. Algunos maestros ensean que aunque la Segunda
Guerra Mundial fue espantosa, nos sac de la Gran Depresin. No es as. Hubo
un incremento en la demanda por armamentos y Estados Unidos tena los
recursos para fabricar el equipo de guerra. Pero esos recursos hubieran
podido ser utilizados en fabricar casas, automviles y neveras.
<P>Una variante de la falacia de la ventana rota es cuando el alcalde, los
jefes sindicales y la cmara de comercio nos dicen que tenemos que gastar
dinero proveniente de los impuestos para construir un centro de
conferencias, un estadio o un puente, por los empleos que se crearan. Los
impuestos provienen de los contribuyentes. Si los contribuyentes no se ven
obligados a pagar esos impuestos gastarn su dinero en carros, muebles, la
remodelacin de sus casas y dems cosas que tambin crean empleo. As que al
igual que en el cuento de la ventana rota, algunos empleos se crean,
mientras que otros desaparecen o no se llegan a crear. La ventaja para los
polticos que fomentan el gasto pblico es que los empleos creados son
visibles, mientras los que se eliminan o no se llegan a crear resultan
invisibles.
<P>El Seguro Social es otra variante de la falacia de la ventana rota. Los que
apoyan el sistema se maravillan de los beneficios. No tienen idea cunto
mejor estaran si hubieran colocado ese dinero en planes privados de
pensiones. Entonces, entre los beneficios tendramos una tasa nacional de
ahorro superior, una tasa mayor de inversin, un producto interno bruto 18%
ms grande, segn algunas estimaciones. Todo eso es invisible, mientras que
los cheques del Seguro Social son visibles.
<P>Leer a Hazlitt lo convertira a usted en una persona mejor informada que la
mayora de los economistas.

ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO
--

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO
</h2>
Guillermo Yeatts*
<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El Congreso argentino est debatiendo el tema de los
hidrocarburos, con el objeto de convertir en ley el decreto presidencial de
1989 que desregul la industria petrolera, resultando en el aumento de 55%
de la produccin. Lo que se pretende evitar es que un futuro gobierno repita
lo ocurrido en 1963, cuando por decreto se cancelaron las reformas
petroleras instrumentadas por la administracin del presidente Frondizi en
1958. La historia de la actividad petrolera en la Argentina muestra
reiterados ejemplos de cmo los procesos aperturistas fueron neutralizados
por nuevas oleadas de intervencin estatal.
<p>
Lamentablemente, el nuevo proyecto de ley reafirma la propiedad del estado
sobre el subsuelo, lo cual no evitar que se repita la historia. Mientras el
estado sea propietario de lo que est debajo de terrenos privados seguir
siendo fcil regresar a la intervencin estatal y se le cierran las puertas
al desarrollo agresivo de las provincias pobres.
Por el contrario, las leyes relativas al subsuelo en Estados Unidos siguen
la tradicin inglesa: el dueo de la tierra es propietario de todo lo que
est encima o debajo. Esto significa que la riqueza encontrada en el
subsuelo le pertenece al dueo del terreno. Ello incentiva la inversin y la
innovacin tecnolgica.	
<p>
Mientras en Estados Unidos la industria petrolera ya generaba riqueza a
fines del siglo XIX, nada parecido ocurra en la Argentina, donde regiones
enteras con gran potencial petrolero quedaban en el olvido y la pobreza. 
La conexin fundamental que existe entre las instituciones y el rendimiento
econmico ha sido estudiada por el economista y premio Nobel Douglass North,
quien en 1993 escribi: "Las instituciones son las reglas del juego en una
sociedad o, ms formalmente, son las limitaciones ideadas por el hombre que
dan forma a la accin humana. Por consiguiente, estructuran incentivos en el
intercambio humano, sea poltico, social o econmico". La historia nos
ensea que cuando las instituciones crean incentivos positivos, la gente
acta de manera productiva y cuando las instituciones reprimen los
incentivos se contrae la iniciativa privada.
<p>
En el caso argentino, las instituciones heredadas de Espaa determinaron
que el subsuelo fuera propiedad del estado. Ya en el siglo XII, el rey de
Castilla se declaraba dueo de las riquezas minerales de su territorio,
tendencia que se acrecent a partir del siglo XV, con el descubrimiento de
metales preciosos en Amrica y simplemente lo que era del rey pas a ser de
la nacin. El Cdigo de Minera de 1886 reconoci la propiedad pblica del
subsuelo y la participacin del sector privado qued limitada a la forma de
concesin.
<p>
En 1865, apenas siete aos despus de que el negocio petrolero se iniciara
en Pennsylvania, en la provincia de Jujuy se gestaba el primer hallazgo de
este tipo en la Argentina. Leonardo Villa fue el empresario que intent
explotar el petrleo en forma comercial para cubrir las demandas del mercado
de kerosene para alumbrado pblico, tal cual estaba sucediendo en Estados
Unidos desde 1858. Pero la iniciativa de este pionero choc contra una
impenetrable muralla. Para comenzar la explotacin, Villa se vio obligado a
solicitar autorizacin a las autoridades de la provincia y luego al poder
legislativo nacional, lo cual, tras infinitos vaivenes, le fue denegado. El
estado, dueo del subsuelo, no permiti que el negocio se concretara. Igual
suerte corrieron otros pioneros hacia fines del siglo XIX.
<p>
Paralelamente, en Titusville, Pennsylvania, el negocio petrolero -iniciado
en 1858- haba alcanzado niveles insospechados. Contrariamente a lo sucedido
en la Argentina, el impulso de aquel grupo de visionarios que vio en el
aceite mineral una alternativa para reducir el elevado costo del alumbrado
no fue frenado por la intervencin del estado. La leyes de Estados Unidos
alentaron la inversin, la toma de riesgo y la innovacin tecnolgica.
<p>
Con el correr del tiempo, la intervencin estatal argentina se increment a
partir de la declaracin de zonas de reserva para la exploracin y
explotacin, el incremento de las regulaciones y, finalmente, la creacin de
Yacimientos Petrolferos Fiscales (YPF) en 1922. Los aos que siguieron
acrecentaron la voracidad de estado y restringieron an ms la limitada
participacin del sector privado. El nacionalismo econmico y su concepcin
del petrleo como recurso estratgico excluyeron casi completamente a los
particulares de la actividad, lo cual alcanz su punto mximo con la
nacionalizacin de los recursos energticos en la Constitucin de 1949. La
desregulacin de la actividad petrolera iniciada con los decretos de 1989,
si bien constituy un cambio radical dado que la produccin se increment de
27 millones en 1989 a 42 millones de metros cbicos en 1995, y liber el
comercio petrolero, no concret el cambio institucional de privatizar
totalmente este sector.
<p>
La mentalidad estatista conden a las regiones no agropecuarias a la
marginalidad y a la pobreza. Hoy en da, 80% del subsuelo argentino sigue
sin haber sido explorado. Lo que habra que hacer es proceder a un cambio
institucional fundamental, traspasando la propiedad del subsuelo a los
dueos de las tierras. La privatizacin del subsuelo acabara con el freno
artificial sufrido por la industria petrolera argentina por ms de 100 aos.

<H2>APRENDIENDO FUERA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD</H2>
Karl Zinsmeister*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Hace unos aos, el autor George Gilder escribi en el
anuario de Harvard que una vez terminados sus estudios se haba concentrado
"en un laborioso esfuerzo para redescubrir las verdades aprendidas de mi
madre mi padre y que desaprend en la universidad". De manera parecida, el
poeta Robert Frost dijo, en la conferencia dictada ante los graduados de
Dartmouth en 1955, que haba hecho un particular esfuerzo "de pasar por la
universidad mantenindome como soy para no ser cambiado completamente es
una pobre clase de persona, creo yo, la que se siente satisfecha pensando
'me han transformado en una persona que ni mi madre reconocera'".
<P>Se trata de importantes crticas a la educacin universitaria porque las
universidades no slo difunden conocimientos sino que tambin los destruyen.
Y las instituciones de altos estudios se sienten cada da con ms derecho a
borrar otros tipos de conocimiento.
<P>Alguna "deseducacin" es valiosa, especficamente aquella que destruye
falsos prejuicios. Pero gran parte de la variedad contempornea no va en
contra de falsedades sino en contra del sentido comn que ha evolucionado a
travs de la historia, lo mismo que contra nexos humanos naturales. En reas
que van desde el sexo, el lenguaje, la estructura familiar y las creencias
religiosas, muchos profesores se empean hoy en corroer las costumbres
tradicionales, rechazando juicios inmemoriales y descontando la sabidura de
los padres, extirpando las creencias fuera de moda.
<P>Dnde en el mundo acadmico de hoy se acepta la fe catlica, juda
ortodoxa, evanglica protestante? Y ni hablar de la mormona o musulmana.
Cun aceptado entre acadmicos es la creencia de la mayora de los
americanos de que hay diferencias biolgicas importantes entre el hombre y
la mujer? Cun tolerantes son las universidades de los puntos de vistas
mayoritarios en cuanto al crimen, la homosexualidad, la pena de muerte y el
servicio militar?
<P>Una reciente encuesta hecha por mi revista, The American Enterprise, mostr
que slo entre 2% y 6% de los profesores de humanidades en las mejores
universidades de Estados Unidos son republicanos. Adnde qued la amplia
gama de perspectivas y la discusin de puntos de vista antagnicos que las
universidades dicen patrocinar? Ms bien encontramos una vanidosa seguridad
y hostilidad contra las ideas "reaccionarias" que los estudiantes traen.
<P>El problema es que las universidades ejercen un monopolio en la educacin
superior y se sienten con el arrogante derecho de cancelar las verdades
intelectuales o morales aprendidas fueras de sus muros.
<P>En la universidad donde estudi, perteneciente al Ivy League (asociacin de
las ocho universidades ms antiguas y prestigiosas de Estados Unidos),
recib una menor exposicin a las obras clsicas de la literatura y la
historia de la que considero merecen recibir los estudiantes. Los temas
religiosos se ignoraban y no aprend nada til acerca de cmo crear un
matrimonio feliz, una familia y un hogar. Por el contrario, recib mucha
informacin contraproducente. Y si usted piensa que esos temas van ms all
de la esfera universitaria, recuerde que los sabios desde Platn hasta San
Agustn y Austen dedicaron el mayor inters intelectual a esos asuntos.
Lanzar a los estudiantes al mundo sin haber sido expuestos a la evolucin de
la sabidura en temas cotidianos es una grave falla educativa.
<P>No estoy predicando oscurantismo. El acceso a entrenamiento acadmico
formal es una gran cosa y obviamente es la misin principal de las
universidades. Pero debemos recordar que hay mltiples caminos hacia el
conocimiento y los profesores universitarios difcilmente tienen el
monopolio de la sabidura. Hoy los ms brillantes eruditos tienden a ser los
ms grandes crticos del mundo acadmico. El recin fallecido Allan Bloom,
traductor de Platn y de Rousseau insista que sus abuelos, quienes apenas
si saban leer y escribir, eran mucho ms sabios que sus nietos con
mltiples doctorados.
<P>Los estudiantes deben ingresar a la universidad con suspicacia en cuanto a
que las autoridades acadmicas representan la fuente final de la verdad. Y
deben balancear su educacin formal con una disciplinada educacin informal.
Si el entrenamiento personal y familiar es simplemente suplantado por la
educacin oficial, el resultado ser una comprensin deformada y falsa del
mundo, especialmente ahora que las universidades son tan "polticamente
correctas", izquierdistas y apegadas a lo que intelectualmente est de moda.
<P>Los estudiantes universitarios deben estar conscientes que en lo que tiene
que ver con muchos de los aspectos de la vida, su experiencia personal es
superior a lo que hoy ofrecen las lites letradas.

Nicomedes Zuloaga*<br>
<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El bienestar econmico de una nacin se mide por el consumo
de bienes materiales. Los pases ms prsperos consumen ms alimentos, ms
servicios y ms bienes durables. Podemos, por lo tanto, afirmar que
bienestar es igual a desarrollo econmico. Y, desde luego, no se puede
con-sumir lo que no se ha producido, aunque no es indis-pensable producir
localmente todo lo que se va a consumir. Constantemente se intercambian
bienes producidos en el pas por otros producidos en el extranjero,
aumentando as la eficiencia. Pero los extranjeros no entregarn sus bienes
sino a cambio de otros, ya sea mediante el procedimiento arcaico del trueque
o la moderna transferencia de divisas. Es por lo tanto indispensable
producir para intercambiar. Consumo es igual a Produccin.
<P>Esto nos lleva a lo que llamo la ecuacin del bienestar: Desarrollo o
Bienestar = Consumo = Produccin. Esta ecuacin es vlida con independencia
del sistema econmico y poltico imperante. Es igualmente cierta para Angola
y para Alemania, para Venezuela y para Rusia, para Estados Unidos y para el
Japn.
<P>Podemos, entonces, afirmar que la nica manera de aumentar el desarrollo
econmico, el bienestar de la comunidad, es haciendo crecer el consumo a
travs de un aumento de la produccin. Y no existe otra forma de 
El Premio Nobel de la Paz Lord John Boyd Orr, en el prlogo de la edicin
de 1962 de la "Geopoltica del Hambre", afirm que dos terceras partes de la
humanidad estaban muriendo de hambre, tcnicamente calculada esa hambre en
razn del consumo de protenas, y que la solucin era la transferencia
masiva de recursos de los pases ricos de Occiden-te hacia el Tercer Mundo.
Afirmacin errada segn el proverbio chino, pero repetida durante aos,
hasta el cansancio, en todos los foros inter-nacionales y a travs de los
medios de comunicacin. 
<P>Resulta que en estos 34 aos los pases desarrollados han transferido al
Tercer Mundo, mediante ddivas o prsta-mos del Banco Mundial y del Fondo
Monetario Internacional -que jams cobrarn- la astronmica cifra de
$170.000 millones, sin que haya mejorado el consumo de protenas. Pero
seguimos oyendo y leyendo sobre la "injusta distribucin" de la rique-za
mundial.
<P>Esa transferencia de fondos del sector pblico de los pases desarrollados
al sector pblico de los pases subdesarrollados, a manos de gobernantes
casi siempre corrup-tos del Tercer Mundo, ha cumplido slo con la primera
parte del pro-verbio chino. Ha sido una transferencia masiva y astronmica
de fondos al mundo subdesarrollado, pero est muy lejos de haber sido
inversin en el sentido econmico. Ha sido capaz, eso s, de producir en el
mundo subdesarrollado una kleptocracia que se enriquece, una nueva casta
parsita de demagogos populistas que gana elecciones y por lo tanto tiende a
perpetuarse en el poder.
<P>Para que una inversin aumente la produccin, el bienestar y el desarrollo
de la comunidad, tiene que ser inversin privada, sometida a las reglas del
mercado y de la competencia, tanto nacional como internacional. Esa
inversin, cuando es extranjera, adems trae consigo una cultura industrial.
Con la inversin verdadera de capital extranjero se produce, adems del
traslado de fon-dos, el traslado de procedimientos productivos, de
entrenamiento de personal y de aplicacin de sistemas de produccin, de
tecnologa y mer-cadeo casi tan valiosos como el propio capital. Es esa
verdadera inversin un elemento indispensable para acelerar el desarrollo
econmico.

<title>"First Principles in the Public Arena" -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 543</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">Lectures and Seminars</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>"First Principles in the Public Arena"</h3>
<b>By Governor John Engler</b><br>
<p>
Michigan Governor Engler delivered the first <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a> on Tuesday, September 26, 1995, at The Heritage Foundation, Washington D.C.
<p>

	This weekend, Michigan Republicans held a leadership conference on Mackinac Island. For all practical purposes, we met in honor of Dr. Russell Kirk. After listening to the various presidential candidates and to Speaker Gingrich, it was clear that many of the ideas Russell had written about since the 1950s not only had taken root, but had blossomed. He always said it took about 30 years for a new generation of ideas to enter the public arena--and in this, as in so much else, he proved right.
<p>
	I am honored to be in this redoubt of conservative thought to inaugurate the Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures. It is a humbling experience for me to stand in this auditorium, knowing that I follow in the footsteps of giants. Russell himself must have given some 60 lectures within these walls. In 1986, at a landmark Heritage event, President Reagan paid a wonderful tribute to the Sage of Mecosta, calling him a pillar of post-war conservative thought.
<p>
	Who could have foreseen it back in 1952, when Russell submitted a manuscript to Henry Regnery called <i>The Conservative Rout</i>? Strange as it may seem to us today, that was the original title Russell proposed for the classic the world would know as <i>The Conservative Mind</i>. Back in the early 1950s, Russell was concerned that there was not a more spirited defense of what he and T. S. Eliot called "the permanent things." But he never put his pen down in despair. Over the course of four decades, he wielded the "Sword of Imagination" against an "antagonist world" and gave new strength to conservative ideas.
<p>
	How the battle had turned at the close of the day, for Russell could see the makings of a liberal rout. One can only imagine what mordant comment he would have made about last November's historic elections and the resulting confusion and chagrin in the Liberal Mind, which more than a few are characterizing as brain-dead. Michigan's own Jack Kevorkian--otherwise known as Dr. Death--could be the poster boy of latter-day liberals.
<p>
	If you have ever been to St. Paul's Cathedral in London, you may have seen Sir Christopher Wren's tomb. Wren designed the cathedral and is buried there. On his tomb is an epitaph, which in translation reads, "If you seek my monument, look around you." I think that epitaph is apt for our purposes today, because if you seek a monument to Russell Kirk, look around  you.
<p>
	This foundation, this audience, and in significant ways this city, which today is becoming an epicenter of conservative policies and ideas, all bear Russell's mark. As Ed Feulner eulogized at last year's Memorial Mass in Russell's honor, the Sage of Mecosta "made a real impact on Washington. In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists, legislators, and staffers...of prudence and of taking the long view."
<p>
	Not just in Washington, but on both sides of the Atlantic, conservatives looked to Russell for inspiration and guidance. Closer to home, I sought his counsel as well. We both lived in central Michigan's "stump country," just two dozen miles from each other, and Russell was a trusted friend. He and Annette, whose hospitality is known around the world, always kept the door at Piety Hill open, not only for the refugee, the hobo, and the scholar, but also for a young legislator just out of college and eager to learn from Michigan's pre-eminent man of letters.
<p>
	I don't think Russell ever held public office except for a brief time as Justice of the Peace. He was, above all, a man of ideas. Yet he was wise to the nature of politics. He always used to say--and it's good advice to remember in Washington these days--that "politics is the art of the possible." The trick is not only to fight for reform, but to live to tell about it.
<p>
	As an aside, let me say that the Republican Party today has a great advantage over Democrats. It is conservative Republicans and their ideas that are driving the debate. And I think the more Americans get to know Republican ideas, the more they will vote for Republican candidates. But whatever their party affiliation, Russell had much to say to the men and women charged with the responsibility of governing. Nobody was more eloquent than Russell in defending what he called the "first principles" of conservative thought. At the center of these "first principles" is the apprehension that order, justice, and freedom are mutually dependent on one another.
<p>
	Another way Russell used to put it: For there to be order in society, there must be order in the soul--and vice-versa. You cannot have one without the other. So it is not just freedom, but ordered freedom that we must strive to preserve. Otherwise, the barbarians will come crashing through the gates.
<p>
	There are a number of first principles that Russell wrote about and that have been important to me as governor. What I would like to do today is tell you how I have tried to apply one of them in the public arena. It concerns the importance of community and the need to respect state and local government because they are closest to our communities.
<p>
	Here, as in so much else, Russell followed the lead of Edmund Burke. The great British statesman wrote that the true wellsprings of community are "the little platoons we belong to in society." By that quaint term, Burke was referring to the groups that we voluntarily seek to associate with and that give our lives meaning. Our church and alma mater, the professional and civic organizations to which we belong, the volunteer charities and friendships we seek out--these are the little platoons that enrich our lives and humanize our relations with one another.
<p>
	Russell early perceived that the centrifugal forces of modern times were tearing apart these little platoons, which are the fabric of our communities. He wrote:
<blockquote>
We have more voluntary organizations than has any other nation.... But it is tempting and easy to let centralized power assume the burdens which necessarily accompany the privileges of community.... I may add that this disintegration of community, and its supplanting by centralized authority, commonly have been accompanied by a proportionate decay of culture and morality.... A nation is no stronger than the numerous little communities of which it is composed.1</blockquote>	These words, though written some four decades ago, ring truer than ever today. They certainly resonate with Marvin Olasky's landmark work, <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, which I am sure Russell would have applauded. For in the court of public opinion, the verdict is in: We have seen the unintended consequences of a horrendous, $5 trillion experiment in centralized authority known as the Great Society. After three decades, even liberals are beginning to concede that the Great Society was neither great nor good for society.
<p>
	In one of his last Heritage lectures, Russell said that the centralizing tendency of the Great Society, combined with the centrifugal forces of modem times, had helped create "a mass of people who have lost...community, hope of betterment, moral convictions, habits of work, sense of personal responsibility, intellectual curiosity, membership in a healthy family, property, active participation in public concerns, religious associations, and awareness of the ends of human existence."2 How could this tragedy come about?
<p>
	At the diseased heart of the Great Society there evolved more than 300 welfare programs, a number of which rewarded ignorance, idleness, and illegitimacy--the absolute antithesis of the qualities you want a free citizenry to possess. These programs have worked untold mischief on the American republic.
<p>
	As many of you know, the welfare debate is a battleground on which, as governor, I have fought from the beginning. Soon after I took office, back in 1991, I made a priority of getting the Michigan legislature to abolish a state version of the Great Society	known as General Assistance. GA provided a monthly check to almost 100,000 able-bodied adults without children. In essence, it paid them not to work.
<p>
	We put an end to the program with some dispatch and said we wanted these tax-takers to become taxpayers. And you know what? Despite bitter denunciations in the liberal media at the time, not one of the four Democrats who challenged me in my 1994 re-election campaign called for the restoration of GA. That is significant because abolishing GA was, I believe, the first tangible sign in America that the nation was serious about ending welfare as we know it. Nobody else had said, "Get rid of a $250 million government welfare program; it won't exist next year." But that's what we did--and it signalled the beginning of the paradigm shift that is currently afoot.
<p>
	As my friends at the Heritage Foundation know, I have some thoughts about Washington's role in welfare. I am not an advocate of pruning federal programs, because those of you who are gardeners know that pruning just makes things grow faster than ever. What I advocate is getting a firm grip on the system as we know it and pulling it up by the roots. That means pulling welfare's roots out of Washington and letting the states decide what to transplant and what to reject. To stick with my gardening metaphor--and to use the words in a recent issue of <i><a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html">National Review</a></i>--let 50 flowers bloom instead of the weed patch in Foggy Bottom.
<p>
	As a result of last November's historic elections, the relationship between Washington and welfare is undergoing radical redefinition. Under Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole, the l04th Congress is taking an extraordinary step: It is beginning the process of relinquishing power and returning it to the 50 states. Getting Washington out of the way is the crucial first step in the long process of returning authority and responsibility to where they ultimately belong--to the "little platoons" of civil society, our families and neighborhoods, churches and charitable organizations.
<p>
	In the area of welfare, I and other governors are hopeful that this historic opportunity will result in no-strings-attached block grants. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: There is no devil in devolution. No-strings-attached block grants are the first crucial steps to meaningful reform. But I am not content to stop there. Ultimately, the goal of welfare reform is to cut federal taxes and return all the fiscal and policy initiatives to the states. This is consistent with America's heritage. There are both constitutional and historical grounds for removing the federal government from such programs as Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
<p>
	Two weeks ago, the Heritage Foundation teamed up with the Federalist Society to present a working conference on the Tenth Amendment. I do not know whether Russell's book <i>The Conservative Constitution</i> was cited, but it should have been, because in it we are reminded that the Constitution set up a federal government that was to be supreme in its sphere, while the states were to remain supreme in their sphere. Washington and the states were meant to be co-sovereigns, with a host of undelegated powers reserved to the states. Welfare is one of those areas in which the states were meant to be supreme.
<p>
	This point is buttressed by the fact that our Founders never gave any indication that welfare should be the responsibility of the federal government. America was at its founding, and still is in many ways, a nation of immigrants, and almost 100 percent of the immigrants who have come to our shores have been poor. The men who drafted our Constitution knew the face of poverty. Despite numerous innovations that came out of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, no one called for giving the federal government a role in alleviating poverty. Yet over the last 60 years, as we have moved from the social insurance system proposed by FDR to the massive giveaway programs enacted by LBJ, Uncle Sam has become Big Daddy. And a tragic number of American citizens have been hurt in the process.
<p>
	I would not be so adamant about getting Washington out of the way if I did not think the states could succeed. If given a chance, the states can and will succeed. Remember the classic by Jonathan Swift, <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>? We in the states are like poor Gulliver on the beach, tied down by small-minded Lilliputians who remind me of the army of federal bureaucrats in Washington. If, like Gulliver, we can extricate ourselves from the entanglement of federal rules and regulations, we will be free to experiment and find better ways of truly helping the needy go to work and become independent.
<p>
	In Michigan, for example, an array of welfare reform initiatives over the past three years is yielding dramatic results. One goal of reform has been to get people to work and thereby enable welfare recipients to accept more responsibility for their lives. Because Michigan recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children must sign a Social Contract, they are working, training for a job, or volunteering in communities at least 20 hours a week. As a result, the number of Michigan AFDC recipients earning income is up to an all-time high of almost 30 percent, compared to just 8 percent nationally.
<p>
	A second goal has been to shrink the size of welfare rolls and save taxpayers money. Again, because of our enforced Social Contract, over 67,000 cases have been closed since 1992 because families are earning enough to be independent. Consequently, Michigan's AFDC caseload has declined to its lowest level in over two decades--and that is saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars as a result.
<p>
	A third aim of reform has been to keep at-risk families intact. In Michigan, our family preservation programs have a proven track record of reducing foster care and helping troubled families work through their problems. Much of our success is due to the fact that we contract out to private agencies, many of them church-run, because they an important moral element in the battle against poverty.
<p>
	Finally, the most critical objective has been to lower the illegitimacy rate. Efforts of the public-private Michigan Abstinence Partnership have helped bring about the lowest teen pregnancy rate in the Great Lakes State in a decade. However, our task--and America's task--is far from finished. In Michigan, 70 percent of births to teen mothers are to unwed teen mothers. If you think that is shocking, in Detroit it is 95 percent.
<p>
	My friends, this is a crisis of unprecedented proportions. As a state we could move even more aggressively to tackle the problem were it not for one thing--and that thing is the federal government. Like Gulliver, the states have been tied down by Lilliputians in Washington who make reform difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
	I hope the people who complain about the lack of federal control over welfare reform will look at the example of states like Michigan. I also hope they will acknowledge that the 50 governors have at least one credential that nobody in Washington has: We governors must actually administer the welfare system. We are closer to the problem than any federal bureaucrat. We know what works and what doesn't. We know what needs changing and how to change it. And if our reforms are not working, we can tackle the problem quickly rather than wait literally years for the federal government to act. Fifty states experimenting will create what are tantamount to market forces that will encourage governors and state houses to be responsible to both tax-takers and taxpayers.
<p>
	Whatever the final shape of welfare when the 104th Congress adjourns, more is at stake than whether this group of conservatives or that wins the debate. At bottom, this is a fight for the freedom of the states to exercise their constitutional authority and responsibility. If the states lose and Congress insists it has the right to micromanage welfare programs among the 50 states, then an important principle of freedom will have been compromised.
<p>
	But I do not think the states will lose. And in this I draw strength from our good friend, Russell Kirk. One of the things I appreciated most about Russell was his ability, no matter what the challenges, "to let a little cheerfulness break in."
<p>
		I want to close on the last words of one of the last lectures he delivered here at Heritage. This passage summarizes both his belief in the "little platoons" and his indomitable spirit of hope:
<p><blockquote>
		Spritually and politically, the twentieth century has been a time of decadence. Yet as this century draws to a close, we may remind ourselves that ages of decadence sometimes have been followed by ages of renewal.
<p>		What can you do, young men and women of the rising generation of the 1990s, to raise up the human condition?... Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are, by improving one human...yourself, and by helping your neighbor.
<p>	You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in redeeming the time: what you require for that task is moral imagination joined to right reason....
<p>	Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face against things evil; and by doing God's will...find that peace which passeth all understanding.3
</blockquote><p>
	<i>Requiescat in pace</i>, my friend.

 The Heritage Foundation's research in the area of health care has always underscored the importance of consumer choice and patient power in our health care system.  Individual ownership of health care insurance and individual control of health care spending are critical if we are to contain health care costs and preserve the high quality health care delivery Americans have come to expect. <p>
 In 1994 at the time of the debates over the Clinton Health Care Plan, Heritage formed a Physicians Council made up of doctors who were concerned about the increasing role and interference of the federal government in the practice of medicine and the prospect of the Clinton Health Care Plan becoming a reality. Members of the Physicians Council helped Heritage publicize the details of the Clinton plan, its costs, its complexities, and its unprecedented control of both public and private health care spending.

<P>

	Today, the Physicians Council of The Heritage Foundation continues to play an active role in informing the medical and policymaking communities about what's at stake in the health care policy debates in Washington.  The Council brings together physicians from all over the country and from many different specialties.  It has no fancy offices and no high-paid lobbyists like many of the large medical societies.  Its aim is simple:  To communicate with patients and physicians about what reforms would mean and to provide ways to let politicians know the views of doctors.  The Heritage Foundation provides for the research needs of the Council and keeps members up-to-date on what is happening in health care reform through a broad range of easy-to-read studies and regular mailings.
<p>
	The Physicians Council is chaired by Heritage Board Chairman, David Brown, M.D., a retired orthopedic surgeon from Oklahoma City, OK.  The more than 700 members of the Council help Heritage leverage our own research and marketing efforts through their use of Heritage speakers, their use of our materials in their own communications, and their distribution of our publications to colleagues and patients.  The membership dues of the Council members ($250/year) help to fund much of the work of our health care analysts, the publication of our policy papers, and distribution of our <i>Physicians Council Reports</i>.  
<p>
	The past year has been an active one in the area of health care.  In 1995 Heritage's model became the framework for the legislation to reform Medicare.  The Heritage plan called for the "voucherization" of Medicare so that seniors could choose private alternatives to Medicare.  Ultimately, legislation did not pass the Congress, but we continue to work with members of Congress and senior staff aides on this issue.   In fact, our June 1996 <i>Physicians Council Report</i> titled, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr3.html">Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat</a>," highlights the urgent and continuing need to reform our Medicare system.
<p>
	On lessening the daily regulatory burdens doctors face, one Heritage paper has proved especially influential:  "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1056.html">Cutting Red Tape on Clinical Labs:  Why Congress Should Deregulate Doctors</a>."  Written by Physicians Council member Sandra Mahkorn, M.D., the report was used by Representative Bill Archer to convince fellow Members of Congress of the need for his crucial reform legislation.  And another paper, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1059.html">Reforming Medicare:  What Congress Can Learn From the Health Plans of America's Corporations</a>," by Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D., was circulated throughout Congress by Congressman Charlie Norwood of Georgia.

<h3>Activities -- Second Quarter 1996</h3>
<p>
	Second quarter health care reform activities focused on providing the medical community with a better understanding of the elements of the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform legislation and the latest news on the Medicare Trust Fund.  
<p>
	An April 24 Physicians Council dinner in Chicago brought Heritage members and staff together with AMA President-elect Daniel "Stormy" Johnson to discuss the AMA's public policy activities and positions on the latest health care legislation.  At this dinner, Johnson credited Heritage's Bob Moffit with educating the AMA board of directors on the fundamental flaws of our health care financing system, and Heritage Vice President Grace-Marie Arnett shared an early copy of her publication, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr2.html">"Cops And Doctors, Part II"</a> which broke the story on the very frightening waste, fraud, and abuse provisions contained in the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation.  At this meeting, Johnson pledged to review these provisions, and the AMA subsequently mounted a substantial lobbying effort to remove or modify this portion of the bill.  This publication was released as a <i>Physicians Council Report</i>, and copies were distributed to Physicians Council members, Hill offices, and the AMA.

	On May 17, physicians who are members of the Heritage President's Club met with Rep. Greg Ganske, M.D. (R-IA) to discuss managed care's "gag rule" on doctors and brief them on his pending legislation addressing this issue.  And, our June 20-21 Physicians Council meeting brought members together for a program of panel discussions on the current political debate over health care reform and Medicare.  For the first time, we asked that presentations at this meeting incorporate a message of how to communicate our message to patients and colleagues.  And, we used this meeting to learn more about how Heritage can better work with doctors to deliver the message of consumer choice and competition in health care.
<p>

	Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), chairman of the Speaker's Steering Committee on Health and the Resource Group on Health of the Health Care Task Force in the House of Representatives, opened our meeting with a dinner address.  Morning speakers included:   Stuart Butler, Marshall Wittmann, Grace-Marie Arnett, and Mike Franc, now Director of Communications for House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT), chairman of the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force, closed the meeting with a luncheon address on "Why We Need Tax Reform to Truly Reform our Health Care System."  Sen. Bennett's speech provided such a thorough and understandable overview of the problems of our health care financing system and the reforms necessary that we plan to publish his remarks as a <i>Heritage Lecture</i> and distribute these to our Council members, medical societies, and specialty organizations.

<p>
	Upcoming Activities:  The next meeting of the Physicians Council is scheduled for December 3-4 in Washington, D.C.

<H3>Corporate Responsibility</h3>
<p>
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td>
	On Thursday, May 16, President Clinton and Vice President Gore will convene a White House conference on corporate responsibility.  CEO's have been invited to participate in a program of panel discussions that will highlight "good corporate citizens" and emphasize behavior the President wants other companies to follow.  What will President Clinton and the White House team propose, and what will America's CEO's report from the front line?  The Heritage Foundation's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy Mark Wilson's essay below highlights several key issues business leaders should keep in mind when politicians turn to the topic of "corporate responsibility".
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	After three years of talking about economic insecurity and pursuing government solutions, President Clinton is now trying to walk a fine line between encouraging corporate citizenship and mandating it.  Hence, we see the White House promoting principles of corporate responsibility, while members of the President's Administration and political party propose more government mandates and incentives.  Americans are concerned about their jobs and wages, but in an election year politicians would rather focus that concern on business instead of the real problem: the high cost of government.
<p>
	Do companies have obligations beyond the bottom line?  Of course they do, but <b>the primary responsibility of companies is to produce the best possible products and services for the best possible price.  This, in turn, will ensure the most secure jobs for workers at the highest possible wages, as well as the highest profits for shareholders.</b>
<p>
	Striving to be competitive in a global marketplace does not mean that companies do not care about their workers or communities.  In fact, it can be argued that it is the competitive market forces a business faces every day, not government regulations, that cause it to be responsive to its customers, shareholders, employees, and communities.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>Between 1942 and 1970, before the creation of OSHA, companies steadily improved workplace health and safety on their own as the total number of work-related injuries in the U.S. declined by 45 percent.  
<p>
 <li>Companies also recognize the goodwill generated by community giving.  In 1994, corporate giving totaled $6 billion.  Thirty-seven percent went to education, 26 percent went to health and human services, 12 percent went to cultural and arts activities, and 10 percent went to civic and community groups.
 <p>
<li>Companies also recognize the importance of training their workers.  Virtually all large establishments, and 69 percent of small establishments, provide some formal training to their workers.<sup>i</sup>  Over half of all establishments that provided formal training made it available to all employees.
</ul><p>
	Companies that are downsizing are not undertaking these measures just to increase their profits.  Rather, they are fundamentally restructuring how they operate in response to competition and to better serve their customers.  In a competitive marketplace no company can be sure how its customer demands will change, what its products will be, or even exactly what business it will be in five years from now.  Moreover, customers are demanding more for less.  If one company can not meet their needs, customers will look for another that does.  So, companies must remain flexible and innovative.
<p>
	The recent pummeling that business has taken in the press is largely undeserved.  And the President should be applauded for highlighting the positive contributions that companies make to society.  In fact, the innovation and invention inherent in business rarely gets much press or attention, but it is crucial to social progress and improvements in American living standards.  
<p>
	The problem, of course, is that politicians are not elected for talking about good deeds.  They are elected to solve problems by passing laws, creating programs, and legislating benefits.  Hence, we see liberals pressing for another mandated increase in the minimum wage and hailing the passage of the Family Medical Leave Act as a great accomplishment.  The dichotomy between the President's recent statement that the government can't make all companies do good things, and his proposal to mandate that all businesses provide health care insurance to their workers is a troubling contradiction.
<p>
	The public, Congress, and the President need to keep in mind that there are no government programs that will make layoffs disappear.  Mandating benefits and training will not eliminate layoffs or increase real wages.  Shutting off imports and immigration will not guarantee everyone a well-paying, secure job.  And sending every American to college will not end economic growth and its accompanying dislocations.  For as long as there has been economic progress, there have been layoffs.
<p><ul>
<li>Although over the past 15 years an average of 20 million workers per year experience at least one spell of unemployment, the economy has managed to create 25 million <i>net</i> new jobs. <sup>ii</sup>
<p>
<li>Sixty percent of the companies reporting job cuts in the twelve months ending June 1995, were also creating new positions at the same time.<sup>iii</sup>  The net workforce change in companies reporting job cuts was only -1.1 percent, down from -5.2 percent the year before.  Because of concurrent job creation, job elimination is no longer synonymous with downsizing.<sup>iv</sup>
<p>
 <li>Of business layoffs that involved 50 or more workers from October to December 1995, most were due to seasonal jobs ending (41.6 percent), slack work (12.2 percent), or the completion of contract work (8.4 percent).<sup>v</sup>  Company reorganizations, business ownership change, and domestic relocation together accounted for 10.9 percent of layoffs.  Import competition and overseas relocation together accounted for less than 1 percent.
 <p>
<li>Those companies that are downsizing many have taken a variety of actions to avoid workforce reductions.  Forty-three percent implement pay cuts and transfers, 40 percent offer voluntary separations, 10 percent offer voluntary job sharing.<sup>vi</sup>  Further, most downsizing companies (75 percent) offer a variety of outplacement assistance to laid-off workers.  Forty-six percent provide extended severance pay, 40 percent provide extended health coverage, and 19 percent provide job retraining.
<p>
<li>Seventy-five percent of all displaced workers who lost their jobs between January 1991 and December 1992 found new jobs.<sup>vii</sup>  Only 11.5 percent remained unemployed.
<p>
<li>Most displaced workers (53 percent) who found new jobs were earning the same as or more than their old job paid.  Over 27 percent were earning 20 percent more.<sup>viii</sup>  And, 82 percent of workers who were previously covered by group health insurance were covered in their new jobs.  Median weekly earnings, however, were 8.2 percent less than the old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>ix</sup>
<p>
<li>Although the overall distribution of job duration has not changed over the last two decades, the distribution of long-term jobs across the population has changed in two ways.<sup>x</sup>  First, individuals, particularly men, with little education (less than twelve years) are substantially less likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago.  Second, women with at least a high-school education are substantially more likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago. 
</ul><p>
	Competition and economic change are a source of America's strength and opportunity.  Government mandates limit innovation by requiring a one-size-fits-all solution, and they will only diminish economic growth. Employment security in the 1990s and beyond will depend upon business flexibility and individuals' ability to adapt to the changing demands of jobs and the job market.  Workers who will fare the best are those with a good basic education, a strong work ethic, sound communication skills, and a willingness to relocate. 
<p>
	Corporate citizenship can not be enhanced with complex tax code changes, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage.  Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes on labor and capital, and job-restricting regulations.  Correcting these problems will increase economic growth, real wages, and job opportunities.

<H3>How Congress Won the Budget War</H3></center>
<P>Its one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; its quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to a new Heritage Foundation analysis.

<P>	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics Ron Utt.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices, and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  

<P>"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war."

<P>	Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.

<P>	Utts conclusion: Congresss accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agencys budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagans goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congresss 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.

<P>	Granted, theres much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congresss performance was," Utt says,  "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congresss cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the countrys four "power marketing administrations."

<P>	With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congresss goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "Theres no reason it cant cut spending a second time."

<H3>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3><p> 
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7><tr><td>
	President Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill on August 21, 1996, and the provisions of the bill will become effective on July 1, 1997.  The exception being the four-year Medical Savings Account demonstration project, arguably the most "controversial" provision of the bill, which will become effective January 1, 1997. The huge margins of support for the bill in both the House and Senate reflect the deep desire of Members of Congress from both parties to address the serious and continuing problems faced by workers and their families in getting and keeping health insurance coverage.  Despite the voting margins, many Members remain concerned that specific provisions, even though drafted with the best of intentions, could have unintended and seriously damaging consequences.
<p>
	Over the next several weeks, in the wake of the political conventions and into the election, analysts, aides, and members of the business community will analyze the legislation to determine its impact on employees and businesses, as well as its impact on the American health care system.  Legal teams from the various professional associations will pore over the new law, trying to ferret out the meaning of some of the more abstruse provisions of this highly technical document, and you can be sure that they will find a few surprises--the unexpected always happens in the legislative process.  Heritage's Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies, <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a> shares his "preliminary observations" of the legislation below.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	With the number of uninsured Americans rising by about a million a year, the 104th Congress was anxious to pass some type of health care reform legislation that would begin to address the serious problems facing the health insurance market.  Provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation are designed to reform the employer-based health insurance market and guarantee portability of insurance coverage for workers.  Our analysts believe that its provisions for guaranteed issue, limitations on pre-existing condition exclusions, and guaranteed renewal of policies may make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market, but they will not make it more <i>affordable</i>.  
<p>
	The bill increases the deductibility for the self-insured, but not by much.  And the long-fought-over MSA demonstration project most certainly will disappoint those longing for a more open market in health care.  The government will dictate MSA policies instead of letting them develop in response to consumer demands, and the four-year trial is limited to 750,000 MSAs -- hardly an incentive for the private sector to compete.  How did this happen?  And what else can we expect from the bill?
<p>
<b>1. The bill is the lowest common political denominator. </b>
<blockquote><p>
	The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was the only vehicle that Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and moderates could agree to vote on and pass into law this year.  It passed the Senate by 98 to 0; the House 421 to 2; only liberal Democrats Pete Stark of California and Pat Williams of Montana voted against it in the House of Representatives.  (Many in the business community know Congressman Stark as a major congressional champion of a single-payer system.)
<p>
	In one respect, this is a limited bill.  It has a very narrow focus, namely, health insurance regulation.  And, regardless of the particulars of health insurance rules, they are not decisive in terms of the structure of the market.  What is decisive is the tax treatment of health insurance and medical services.  At best, and putting the very best face on it, this bill should only be seen as a down payment on real market reform--and real market reform will come only with tax reform.  In that respect, we have not even begun to reform the American health care system.  In fact, we have a very long way to go.  
<p>
	The good news is that the debate on the tax treatment of health insurance and health care services is unavoidable, precisely because the debate on tax reform, including a major overhaul of our tax code, is unavoidable.  
</blockquote><p>
<b>2.  The American people should not expect dramatic changes resulting from the President signing the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.</b>  
<blockquote><p>
	We will not see a drop in health care costs.  Unfortunately, we probably will not see a drop in the rate of uninsurance either. Also, we will not see <i>true</i> portability in health insurance, like we have in auto insurance or homeowners insurance or life insurance, the kind of portability that we take for granted in all of these areas.  The reason:  Americans will still not be able to own their own health insurance policies, like they can in other areas of insurance, and take it with them when they change jobs.  Policies will still remain the property of employers. 
<p>
	Once again, we should remember that insurance regulation, no matter how well- or ill-intentioned, does not and cannot fix the major distortions in the broken health insurance market.  Only changes in the federal tax treatment of health insurance can do that.  This bill does <i>not</i> do that. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>3.  There are certain features of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that will help millions of Americans who already have insurance at their place of work. </b>
<blockquote> 
<p>
	The bill sets up unprecedented federal ground rules for the health insurance market, so that Americans who are working will be able to keep health insurance from job to job.  In this way the new law does address the very real worries of millions of Americans who will lose health coverage if they get sick or lose their jobs.  It does this by establishing rules to guarantee, through regulation, portability of health coverage.  With guaranteed issue, health insurance companies must sell you policies in the individual market after you have exhausted your COBRA coverage.  With a limitation on exclusion of pre-existing medical conditions, they cannot deny you or your employer a policy because of your medical status.  With guaranteed renewability, your insurance company in the individual market cannot drop you if you get sick.
<p>
	The bill, therefore, will make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market.  It will not, however, make it more <i>affordable</i>.
</blockquote><p>
<b>4.  In fixing <i>some</i> problems in the health insurance market, the bill could create others.</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
	The American health insurance market is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy.  This regulation is overwhelmingly done at the state level, and state regulation imposes rules on insurance ranging from rate setting for doctors and hospitals to mandating that companies include very specific benefits, everything from in vitro fertilization to psychological counseling.  These state regulations are costly for individuals, families, and small businesses.  In the state of Maryland, for example, these mandates add about 25 percent to the costs of health insurance premiums.  Furthermore, the bill creates two potentially serious problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b><i>First, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill adds a new layer of federal regulation on top of the existing morass of state rules.</i></b>  The concern among analysts at The Heritage Foundation and elsewhere is that the new federal rules will drive health care costs up.  The reasons:  nobody, no matter how sick, can be denied health insurance; nobody's health insurance can be canceled, except for cause, such as fraud; your medical conditions are henceforth not a barrier to health insurance.  Of course, many medical professionals find these changes desirable. 
<p>
These new federal rules may establish equity of sorts among patients--which is what they are designed to do--but, taken alone, without any other offsetting market changes, they will add to the cost of insurance.  We don't all automatically win.  There will be losers with this bill: those who become uninsured because they can't afford the premium increases or because individual insurers in this new and even more highly regulated environment may withdraw from the market. 
<p>
How much will costs go up?  Nobody knows for sure but there are a range of estimates.  The American Academy of Actuaries says that it will be a modest increase, between 3 and 5 percent.  Individual insurers say we will see anywhere from 10 to 30 percent increases in the individual market.  The increases and adjustments are hard to predict in a rapidly changing employer-based market.  But, in any case, we should be going into this with our eyes open. 
<p>
<li><b><i>Second, the bill sets up a vast, federal data collection apparatus at the federal level, including the storage and sharing of patient records. </i></b>    Each person will have, under the bill, a "patient identifier" code, and this is designed to simplify the administration of the system.  In the text of the conference report, the Congress restates its good intention to protect privacy.  Good intentions are not enough.  As the <i>Washington Post</i> pointed out recently, unauthorized leaks could result in confidential data being sent into electronic mailboxes all over the country.  At The Heritage Foundation we are more than a little nervous about the potential for abuse. This is only the first controversial issue to surface with the passage of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.  There will doubtless be others.
</ul><p>
	A "technical corrections" bill will likely be introduced early next year to fix the glitches created by various provisions of  Kassebaum-Kennedy.  Two items should be at the top of the agenda:  First, further modification or elimination of unnecessary fines and penalties on doctors.  My colleagues at The Heritage Foundation have opposed, on sound federalist principle, the nationalization of criminal law, usurping or overriding the authority of the states.  There are today over 3,000 criminal laws.  The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill has added a half dozen more of them.  While Members of Congress insist that they have heard the message from physicians justifiably angry over the imposition of new fines and penalties amidst the growing underbrush of thorny and complicated rules and regulations.  Members of Congress claim to have "fixed" the problem, but we believe that more can be done to protect honest physicians from overzealous bureaucrats.  If Congress remains conservative, the deregulation of the medical profession should be a top priority, just as the deregulation of agriculture and communications has been a top priority in this Congress.  
<p>
	Second, no personal medical record should be turned over to any public or private agency without the express, written permission of the patient. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>5. The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill could have, but didn't, advance health care reforms that would have made the American system work better for individuals and families. </b>
<blockquote><p>

	<b><i>First, the bill is not nearly generous enough in providing tax relief to individuals and families, regardless of where they work or even the status of their employment.</i></b>  It increases the deductibility for the self-insured from 30 percent to 80 percent--by the year 2006!  While this is a step in the right direction, in itself it is no big deal.  It falls far short of tax equity for individuals and families--and there is not much pizzazz in waiting ten years for the full implementation of a measure that will approach a bare modicum of tax equity.
<p>
	Real tax relief either in the form of tax credits or vouchers for low-income persons, would be a far more generous approach.  It would expand personal choice for individuals and families, and make health insurance and health care itself more affordable.  In any case, tax credits would be more equitable than deductions, especially for lower-income and lower-middle income working families.  
<p>
<b><i>Second, a related item, the MSA demonstration program looks as if it were designed to fail.</i></b>  We hope it doesn't fail, but that's how it looks.  The four-year demonstration project imposes a cap of 750,000 policies that get tax equity, including the self-employed and individuals in firms with anywhere between 2 and 50 employees.  And it is hobbled by literally dozens of statutory conditions on employers and insurers, too extensive and intricate to enumerate here; and it requires a tight policing of these policies by the IRS. 
<P>
	With all of the attendant paperwork, two problems are immediately evident:  (a) small employers are wrestling with too much government paperwork now.  And this program, with its strict reporting requirements and conditions, is hardly designed to make it an attractive option for harried small businesses; (b) such an artificially small pool of potential policyholders--over a four-year period--is not likely to be inviting to a broad spectrum of commercial insurers.  This means that only a small number of insurers currently specializing in high-deductible polices, who are also willing to put up with the government's regulatory regime, will venture to participate.  The likely result: premiums will be higher than if the option were open to a much broader competition. 
<p>
	If you are interested in a demonstration of the dynamism of the market, the powerful and fruitful collision of the forces of supply and demand, designed to unleash free market forces, this is not it.  This is a political compromise.  Others can judge who got the best of the compromise; the market reformers or the regulators?  Furthermore, the very premise of a demonstration program for medical savings accounts also should be questioned.  Over 2,500 companies already have adopted MSA's, and we know that they are very popular with employees and have been successful in controlling costs in the companies where they are used.  And, as for adverse selection, employers have managed risks with managed care, and there is no reason why they can't manage risks with Medical Savings Accounts.  Moreover, they are popular with employees, even though their savings accounts are subject to federal and state taxation and thus are hobbled by an unfair discrimination in tax treatment.
<p>
	The opposition to individual tax relief and Medical Savings Accounts seems to be grounded in fear; not a fear that they are a bad idea or will fail, but rather that they are an excellent idea and will succeed.  Once individuals and families have individual tax relief, they will pick and choose their own plans and policies, their own doctors and medical treatments and procedures.  And, liberals in Congress know that once families start exercising this level of personal choice, they will never - politically -- be able to take that freedom of choice away.  Families with Medical Savings Accounts are hard, if not impossible, for regulators to regulate; huge, consolidated managed care networks, dominated by a few large insurers in any given area of the country, are comparatively easy to regulate.  It is also easy to transition from such a consolidated corporate system into a single-payer system.
<p>
	The short-term value of Medical Savings Accounts, even in the truncated form found in Kassebaum-Kennedy, is that it will give some employers another health care option that can help them hold down costs, and it will give thousands of individuals and families the power to choose their own physicians, medical treatments, and medical services.  And ultimately this is the kind of health care system Americans want.  
<p>
	Unfortunately, we still have a lot of work to do to get there.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
China's July 21-26 missile test about 100 miles north of Taiwan
was a blatant act of intimidation. Armed with nuclear warheads,
these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases
or naval formations in Asia, which lack adequate missile defenses.
China's attempt to threaten the Republic of China challenges the
United States to provide its forces and friends with appropriate
defenses. Unless America responds, China's future nuclear intimidation
could destabilize Asia by driving others in the region to seek
their own nuclear deterrent.
<P>
To avoid this, the U.S. should incorporate missile defenses into
its strategy to deter aggression in Asia. At the same time, Washington
should emphasize missile defense cooperation as an effective alternative
to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration's
focus on short-range, theater-based missile defense (TMD) systems
is inadequate. The Administration can enhance security in Asia
by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile
attack and extending that umbrella to America's allies and friends
in the region. Such a strategy should include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Building and deploying</B> a missile defense system for the United
States. In order to defend its allies, America itself must
be defended from missile attack.
<P>
<LI><B>Improving</B> the defense of U.S. forces in Asia by accelerating
development and deployment of the Navy's Upper Tier system to
the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD system to U.S. forces in
South Korea and Japan.
<P>
<LI><B>Encouraging</B> Australia, Japan, and South Korea to acquire
advanced U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense
cooperation.
<P>
<LI><B>Telling</B> China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.
<P>
<LI><B>Selling</B> advanced theater missile defense systems to Taiwan,
consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval
TMD forces to help defend Taiwan.
<P>
<LI><B>Offering</B> India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.
</ul>
<P>
<b>ASIAN MISSILE THREATS AND PROLIFERATION DANGERS</b>
<P>
<B>China's Global and Regional Threat. </B>China's nuclear missile
program dates back to the mid-1950s and has grown to include several
classes of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. China is believed
to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. <sup>1</sup> By
the year 2120, according to one estimate, China could have 50
to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching
the United States from bases in China. <sup>2</sup>  Two mobile ICBMs are under
development  the 5,000-mile-range DF-31 and the 7,500-mile-range
DF-41. The DF-31, tested on May 29, 1995, could reach the Western
U.S. if fired from Northern China. China deploys four DF-5 missiles
which can carry a 4 to 5 megaton warhead over 8,000 miles and
10 DF-4 missiles with a 3,000-mile range. China has one to two
nuclear missile submarines which can carry 12 of the 1,000-mile
Julang-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The 5,000-mile-range
<I>Julang-2</I>, a variant of the DF-31, is under development.
<P>
China also possesses several intermediate-range and tactical nuclear-capable
missiles. Since the mid-1980s it has build over 30 DF-21 missiles
with a 1,125-mile range. It also may have more than 60 older and
less accurate DF-3 1,700-mile-range missiles. Chinese nuclear-capable
tactical missiles include the 185-mile-range DF-11 (M-11) and
the 375-mile-range DF-15 (M-9). According to Chinese military
analyst Dr. Chong Pin Lin, China has hired Russian technicians
and may have purchased a complete missile plant from Russia, to
produce long-range cruise missiles similar to the U.S. <I>Tomahawk.</I> <sup>3</sup>
 China is developing Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) that
emit precise navigation signals. With such a capability, Chinese
ballistic and cruise missiles could acquire high degrees of accuracy. <sup>4</sup>

<P>
In 1993 China reportedly purchased 60 Russian S-300s, comparable
in capability to the U.S. Patriot missile, which can intercept
tactical ballistic missiles, such as the Russian Scud, in flight. <sup>5</sup>
 Thus, China already has a limited anti-tactical ballistic missile
(ATBM) capability.
<P>
China's nuclear strategy against the United States and Russia
is often described as one of &quot;minimum deterrence,&quot; targeting
its small number of ICBMs on U.S. or Russian cities. However,
Beijing clearly employs a more active strategy with its intermediate
and tactical missiles. The &quot;testing&quot; of DF-21s and M-9s
near Taiwan was China's first high-profile use of missiles to
intimidate an opponent. The M-9 missiles were fired from Leping
Military Base in the Jaingxi Province west of Taiwan; Taipei is
just at the edge of the M-9's 370-mile range from this base. <sup>6</sup> 
DF-21 missiles are deployed from bases where they can threaten
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India. <sup>7</sup>
 With the assistance of PLA Navy tracking ships, DF-21 missiles
also could be used to attack U.S. Navy carrier task groups. From
China's Hainan Island in the South China Sea, DF-21 missiles could
counter U.S. naval forces transiting the Straits of Malacca.
<P>
<B>North Korea's Current and Future Threat. </B>North Korea's
extensive missile program is often overshadowed by its nuclear
weapons development program. <sup>8</sup>  But its ballistic missile program
deserves equal attention. It was revealed in 1994 that North Korea
was developing two long-range missiles, dubbed the Taepo Dong-1
&amp; 2 with estimated ranges of 1,200 miles and 2,000 miles,
respectively. These missiles would give North Korea the capability
to target U.S. forces in Guam. According to recent South Korean
and Russian estimates, the Taepo Dong-2 could have a 6,200-mile
range, which would cover about half the continental U.S. <sup>9</sup>  At this
estimated range, the Taepo Dong-2 also could reach Europe, all
of East Asia, and Australia. Some U.S. estimates, however, give
this missile only a 2,500-mile range, and it is not expected to
be operational before the year 2000. In a June 1994 statement,
the head of U.S. Naval Intelligence estimated a North Korean missile
could carry a nuclear warhead by the year 2000, or possibly as
early as this year. <sup>10</sup>
<P>
North Korea tested a variant of the Scud in May 1993. Called the
<I>Nodong-1 </I>, it has an estimated 625-mile range and is capable
of threatening U.S. forces in Japan. North Korea was reported
to have had 12 to 18 <I>Nodong-1 </I> missiles in early 1994. <sup>11</sup>
 There are also reports that the North is developing a solid-fueled
930-mile transportable variant, the Nodong-2, with the help of
Russian technicians. <sup>12</sup> 
<P>
Pyongyang began producing the 185-mile-range Scud-B in the mid-1980s,
after gaining advanced missile design knowledge from China and
from copying a <I>Scud-B</I> obtained from Egypt, most likely
in 1981. <sup>13</sup>  Pyongyang began production of the improved 300-mile-range
Scud-C in 1991 and is now estimated to be producing that missile
at a rate of 100 a year. The Scud-C is a mobile missile capable
of carrying high explosive, biological, or chemical warheads.
It has a range enabling it to reach all of South Korea. The North
is believed to maintain a total of 24 to 36 Scud-Cs in its Army.

<P>
According to Robert D. Walpole, Deputy Director of the CIA's Nonproliferation
Center, &quot;North Korea is the largest proliferator [in the
world] of ballistic missiles.&quot; <sup>14</sup>   Pyongyang uses missile sales
to earn hard cash for oil. By one estimate North Korea has sold
Iran and Syria a total of 320 Scud-Cs. <sup>15</sup>  It also has enhanced Iran's
missile production capability. In turn, Iran may be providing
North Korea with missile test facilities. <sup>16</sup>  Although North Korea
has discussed missile sales with Libya, Walpole believes that
Iran probably will be the first to purchase <I>Nodong</I> missiles.
<P>
<B>India and Pakistan. </B>India and Pakistan have fought each
other in 1947, 1966, and 1971. In recent years both countries
have almost come to blows over the disputed state of Kashmir in
Northern India. Their nuclear competition dates from the 1970s.
Although claiming not to be a nuclear state, India is believed
to have exploded a 12-kiloton nuclear device in 1974, and Shekhar
Gupta, Senior Editor of<I> India Today</I>, estimates India has
enough fissile material to build 60 bombs. <sup>17</sup>  The opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) is committed to building a nuclear arsenal
and may lead the government after national elections early in
1996. Meanwhile, Pakistan is believed to have enough plutonium
for seven crude nuclear weapons. <sup>18</sup>  Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD)
charged in April of this year that he believes Pakistan has five
nuclear weapons and India possesses between five and ten. <sup>19</sup>  The
inability of the Bush Administration in 1990 to certify that Pakistan
lacked a nuclear weapon triggered provisions of the 1986 Pressler
Amendment barring U.S. military sales to Pakistan.
<P>
Both states are developing missiles that could be nuclear armed.
India is deploying the indigenously developed 150-mile-range Prithvi
 to reserve Army units. <sup>20</sup>  This is a liquid-fueled, mobile missile.
India is estimated to have 40 to 50 <I>Prithvi </I> missiles,
with the intention of building up to 80. <sup>21</sup>  In 1992 India tested
a variant of the liquid-fueled and immobile <I>Agni </I> missile
that flew over 1,500 miles. It is now considering deploying this
missile, <sup>22</sup> which is capable of reaching most of Pakistan and many
targets in China. Additionally, India is developing an Advanced
Space Launch Vehicle (ASLV) for commercial purposes, and this
could become a 2,500-mile-range missile. In 1993 the United States
stopped Russia from selling ICBM engine technology to India but
did go ahead and sell complete rocket engines that could assist
India in building more powerful missile engines.
<P>
With China's assistance, Pakistan began the development of its
Haft missiles in the early 1980s. First tested in 1989, the <I>Haft-1</I>
has a range of only 50 miles. Also under development are the 185-mile
<I>Haft-2 </I>and 375-mile <I>Haft-3</I> missiles. In 1991 U.S.
officials revealed that Pakistan was purchasing the 185-mile Chinese
M-11. <super23></sup>  Pakistan received transporter-erector-launchers for the
M-11 in February 1991 from China. In July 1995, U.S. spy satellites
discovered over 30 M-11 delivery cases at an air force base in
Pakistan. <sup>24</sup> 
<P>
Future Indian long-range ballistic missiles may be capable of
reaching U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. However,
India's and Pakistan's potential nuclear missile arsenals are
mainly to deter each other, while India also seeks to deter China.
While it would not threaten the United States, a nuclear missile
exchange between India and Pakistan would create incalculable
destruction and loss of life, fuel religious and ethnic conflict,
and destabilize South Asia and the Persian Gulf for decades.
<P>
<b>DIPLOMACY ALONE WILL NOT PREVENT PROLIFERATION </b>
<P>
Washington has tried diplomacy and sanctions to prevent nuclear
and missile proliferation in Asia. While these attempts have been
worthwhile, they have not stopped proliferation. China signed
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1992 but continues
to export nuclear technology. Most recently China is reported
to have sold Iran a calutron for enriching uranium, a critical
missing link in Iran's nuclear weapons program. <sup>25</sup>  China twice has
promised but failed to abide by the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), which forbids the sale of missiles with ranges
over 185 miles. <sup>26</sup>  However, evidence is accumulating that China
earlier this year shipped more than 30 M-11s to Pakistan. <sup>27</sup>
<P>
North Korea signed the NPT in 1985 but has failed to comply fully
with its terms. For example, it refused until 1992 to allow inspections
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as required by
the pact and threatened to withdraw from the pact in March 1993
in reaction to IAEA requests to inspect a nuclear waste dump.
This dump, which would have yielded information on the extent
of North Korean plutonium production, still has not been inspected.
In addition, North Korea has yet to fulfill a pledge, made to
South Korea in 1991, to create a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula.
The threat of limited United Nations sanctions in 1994 forced
Pyongyang to agree to &quot;freeze&quot; its nuclear program.
In October 1994 North Korea agreed to freeze and then dismantle
its existing nuclear program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
power plants that would be financed and built by an international
consortium. However, the pact allows Pyongyang to delay full IAEA
inspections for five years or more and stipulates that these inspections
will not begin until &quot;significant components&quot; of the
reactors are delivered.
<P>
Pyongyang has challenged and will likely continue to challenge
the implementation of this complex agreement.<sup>28</sup>  Pyongyang's objections
to Seoul's role in building the proposed light-water reactors
heightened tensions and again led to a flurry of U.S.-North Korean
negotiations this Spring and to further delay in the agreement's
implementation. Meanwhile, it is possible that North Korea continues
nuclear weapons-related research and development in locations
unknown to the IAEA  which cannot undertake full-scope inspections.
North Korea also refuses to join the MTCR. North Korea's ability
to undermine the NPT and IAEA and flout the MTCR all demonstrate
the weakness of diplomacy in stemming nuclear proliferation.
<P>
Both India and Pakistan also have refused to sign the NPT and
join the MTCR. The Pressler Amendment sanctions against Pakistan,
which have barred U.S. military sales since 1990, have yet to
convince Islamabad to end its nuclear weapons program. The Bush
Administration tried, but failed, to convince India and Pakistan
to negotiate a South Asian Nuclear Free Zone.<sup>29</sup>  In 1994 Pakistan
rejected a Clinton Administration proposal that the United States
and NATO guarantee Pakistan's security if it denuclearized.<sup>30</sup>
<P>
<b>THE DANGERS OF A WEAKER U.S. DETERRENT IN ASIA</b>
<P>
America's extended nuclear and conventional force deterrent is
the foundation of security in the Asia-Pacific region. This American
commitment obviates the need for allies and friends to build their
own nuclear deterrent. The possibility of nuclear proliferation
in Asia increases when America's commitment is undermined, either
from Washington or by new nuclear threats. After China's threatening
July missile tests, in Taiwan's parliament on July 28, Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui responded to a question from opposition
Democratic Progressive Party member Liu Jui-hsiung on whether
Taiwan should develop nuclear weapons. &quot;Whether [we] need
nuclear weapons would require long-term study,&quot; Lee said.
&quot;Taiwan used to have the capability to build nuclear weapons
but it caused international concern and damaged the country's
image.&quot;<sup>31</sup> 
<P>
Indeed, it was the Carter Administration's decision to end diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and its attempt to reduce U.S. troops in
South Korea that increased interest in nuclear weapons in both
countries. Washington convinced Taipei not to proceed with attempts
to acquire plutonium in the late 1970s and to end nuclear weapons-related
research in the late 1980s.<sup>32</sup>  A retired South Korean general has
disclosed that in the late 1970s South Korea almost completed
an atomic bomb, but the project stopped after pressure from Washington.<sup>33</sup>

<P>
Although, although Japan's national policy since 1971 has been
not to manufacture, possess, or allow the introduction of nuclear
weapons into Japan, in 1994 then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata unnerved
many with the comment that &quot;It is certainly the case that
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons, but has not
made them.&quot;<sup>34</sup>  Only a series of cataclysmic events, such as
a rupture of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty combined with nuclear
proliferation on the Korean Peninsula, would likely move Japan
to build nuclear weapons.<sup>35</sup> 
<P>
Missile technology is also widespread throughout Asia. Japan's
H-2 commercial space-launch vehicle conceivably could be turned
into a 9,300-mile-range ICBM. The South Korean Army deploys the
150-mile <I>NHK-1 </I>tactical missile. In June, Seoul reportedly
asked Washington to scrap a 1979 agreement that bars South Korea
from building missiles that travel more than 180 miles.<sup>36</sup>  Taipei
is developing the 80-mile-range<I> Green Bee</I> tactical missile
and the 600-mile-range <I>Sky Horse</I> missile.
<P>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES BENEFIT ASIANS AND AMERICANS</b>
<P>
Missile defense systems will increase the security of American
forces deployed abroad. At the same time, they can benefit the
United States and its Asian allies in other ways. For example:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Anti-missile systems offer a deterrent far less threatening
than nuclear weapons.</B>
<P>
Anti-missile systems are a less destabilizing way to deter attack
from nuclear missile-armed states.  Should a non-nuclear Asian
state build nuclear weapons, other non-nuclear states will be
inclined to follow suit. This is a recipe for further proliferation.
<P>
<LI><B>Anti-missile defenses reduce vulnerability to nuclear blackmail.</B>
<P>
China's July missile tests were intended to threaten Taiwan. With
appropriate anti-missile systems, Taiwan would not be as vulnerable
to future Chinese threats. Moreover, with adequate defenses, South
Korea and Japan could better withstand potential North Korean
or Chinese demands backed by nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses are insurance against accidental nuclear
missile launches.</B>
<P>
China is undergoing a near-term leadership transition in which
the military could emerge as a nationalist force. Because political
stability cannot be assured, concerns that the political leadership
may lose control of China's nuclear weapons cannot be dismissed.<sup>38</sup>
 Control of some of China's nuclear weapons may have been contested
in 1967, as reports indicate that the commander of the Chinese
military region containing the Lop Nor nuclear test facilities
rebelled briefly against Mao Tse-tung.<sup>39</sup>  In North Korea, presumed
leader Kim Jong-Il's intentions toward South Korea remain unclear,
while accurate knowledge of his health and mental stability is
lacking. Were he to be replaced by a faction bent on heightening
tensions with South Korea, the chances of an accidental missile
launch would grow.
<P>
<LI><B>Cooperation in missile defenses can build political confidence
in Asia.</B>
<P>
As missile defenses are non-threatening and reduce threats to
Asian population centers, multilateral efforts led by the United
States can enhance security, promote defense cooperation, and
advance U.S. leadership with Asian allies and friends. These measures
would decrease mistrust and increase confidence between Asian
countries.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses can create incentives to reduce both nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.</B>
<P>
For example, if both India and Pakistan possessed missile defenses,
there would be less incentive to launch missile attacks against
each other. A reduction in the utility of nuclear missiles could
enhance mutual confidence, opening the door to negotiations on
limiting and reducing nuclear and missile forces. Similarly, if
the ROC possessed adequate missile defenses, Taipei would have
a greater incentive to propose confidence-building measures with
Beijing. It could ask, for example, that Beijing join it in agreeing
not to deploy tactical or intermediate-range missiles within a
threatening proximity. If the U.S. and its Asian allies were to
create a regional missile defense system, they would have greater
credibility in approaching China, perhaps in the ASEAN Regional
Forum, about beginning a dialogue on shared missile defense systems.
This could serve as an incentive for Beijing to limit its short-range
and intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
<P></OL>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES WILL STRENGTHEN ASIAN SECURITY</b>
<P>
American extended deterrence and forward deployment of conventional
forces serve as the foundation for Asian security. In order to
strengthen deterrence and security in Asia, the United States
must take the lead in dealing with Asia's emerging next threat:
 the proliferation of nuclear-armed missiles. The United States
is the only country with the technical and moral strength to counter
the growing missile threat in Asia.
<P>
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1985 invited Australia,
Japan, and South Korea to participate in the Strategic Defense
Initiative.<sup>40</sup>  Only Japan responded positively, allowing private
companies in 1987 to participate in missile defense architecture
studies with the U.S. Department of Defense. The Clinton Administration
has built on this by seeking Japanese technological contributions
to missile defense systems more aggressively and by offering Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) systems on a commercial basis.
<P>
But the Administration's Asian missile defense architecture is
hobbled by its decision to abandon the Bush Administration's more
ambitious Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) program.
The Clinton Administration is limiting the U.S. missile defense
program to theater-based, short-range systems. The Administration
refuses to build space-based missile defense systems, like boost-phase
interceptors, that have a better chance of defending the United
States and its allies from missile attack. An active missile defense
strategy toward Asia can strengthen U.S. leadership by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating a major post-Cold War mission for the Asian-American
alliance system. </B>Building a regional missile defense architecture
is a service that only America can provide. A secure and stable
Asia will foster growth in job-creating U.S.-Asia trade. Equally
important, by cooperating with Washington to develop and fund
missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able
to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries
from nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Confirming the benign and defensive intent of American strategy
in Asia. </B>American leadership in missile defenses would offer
allied and friendly Asian states the same protection from limited
nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail that  Americans enjoy. Such
defenses threaten only the offensive weapons of potential aggressor
states in Asia.
<P>
<LI><B>Reversing the growing impression in Asia of American retreat
and weak leadership. </B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's policy flip-flops toward China, attempts
to manage trade with Japan, and inaction in response to aggressive
acts by China in the South China Sea and against Taiwan have reduced
American credibility in Asia. By exercising strong leadership
in missile defenses, Washington can regain lost political momentum
and begin to reverse diplomatic damage. A strategy to accomplish
this goal would entail:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><b>Building and deploying a missile defense system for the United
States.</b>
<P>
A National Missile Defense (NMD) system is needed not only to
defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends
that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail.
Such a goal is both feasible and affordable. Earlier this year,
a team of experts assembled by The Heritage Foundation recommended
a National Missile Defense system based initially on the Navy's
Upper Tier proposal. This is an advanced high-velocity version
of the Navy's <I>Standard</I> surface-to-air missile system deployed
in AEGIS cruisers and destroyers. Its guidance would be assisted
by the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> early warning and tracking satellite.
The Heritage plan then calls for Upper Tier to be supplemented
by space-based defenses, to include space-based missile interceptors
and lasers. The cost of the Upper Tier, <i>Brilliant Eyes,</i> and space
based systems is estimated to be about $25 billion over 15 years.<sup>41</sup>
 At the same time, it is critical that the U.S. retain adequate
offensive nuclear systems, although NMD would allow the U.S. to
reduce its nuclear deterrent forces.<sup>42</sup>
<P>
Space-based missile defense systems also would enable the U.S.
to complement any future TMD capabilities of its Asian allies.
If U.S. space-based interceptors or lasers did not destroy hostile
missiles early in their flight, U.S. satellites could help direct
Asian-based interceptors to their targets. Some countries in Asia,
like Australia, oppose a U.S. National Missile Defense program
because it might lead to abrogating the 1973 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty. Washington should tell its friends that it seeks
ultimately to renegotiate the ABM Treaty with Russia to allow
for a limited national defense against missiles but that, in the
meantime, the ABM Treaty does not prohibit the United States from
deploying theater missile defenses in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Accelerating development and deployment of the Navy's Upper
Tier TMD system to the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD TMD
system to U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan.</b>
<P>
The Clinton Administration should increase funding for the Navy's
Upper Tier TMD system, THAAD, and the Brilliant Eyes early warning
satellite. These TMD systems are needed urgently to defend U.S.
naval and ground forces in Asia.<sup>43</sup>  The Navy's Upper Tier system
is especially important because its mobility will enable the U.S.
Pacific Command to deploy a TMD system near South Korea or Taiwan.
This system also will protect U.S. naval forces within range of
Chinese medium-range missiles. The THAAD system is needed to defend
U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan against North Korean Scud
 and <I>Nodong </I> missiles. Accelerated development of Upper
Tier and THAAD would make these systems more rapidly available
for sale to U.S. allies.
<P>
<LI><b>Encouraging Japan, South Korea, and Australia to acquire advanced
U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense cooperation.</b>
<P>
Washington should urge its major allies in Asia to purchase TMD
systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore
multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. Japan
is slowly developing a political consensus to purchase an advanced
U.S.-based TMD system. According to a recent study of potential
missile defense architectures for Japan, completed by private
U.S. and Japanese companies, a Japanese TMD system could include
advanced Patriot, THAAD, and naval-based Upper Tier systems guided
by missile targeting systems built into AWACS radar aircraft.
Washington should urge Tokyo to decide quickly on missile defense
architecture and to purchase those systems from the United States.
<P>
South Korea has a clear requirement to defend itself against North
Korean missiles. Therefore, it is interested in obtaining TMD
systems. Washington should urge Seoul to place a much higher priority
on purchasing TMD systems from the U.S. South Korea now relies
on the approximately 192 Patriot  missiles deployed in the Spring
of 1994, which mainly protect U.S. forces in South Korea and are
not enough to defend ROK forces or cities.<sup>44</sup>
<P>
Australia, which refused to join the 1985 U.S. offer of SDI international
cooperation, finally signed a missile defense research agreement
with the U.S. in June 1995.<sup>45</sup>  During the Gulf War, a jointly manned
early warning satellite downlink in Nurrungar, Australia, helped
target attacking Iraqi Scud  missiles. The U.S. should encourage
Australia to consider purchasing naval-based Upper Tier systems
and placing them in air defense frigates which Australia plans
to build. Washington should ask Canberra to consider hosting a
multinational missile defense early warning observation facility
at Nurrungar. The facility would be open to Western allies cooperating
in missile defense and to other states seeking neutral enforcement
mechanisms for missile control or reduction agreements.
<P>
Washington also should encourage missile defense cooperation between
South Korea and Japan. The major reason for this is to help South
Korea avoid any unintended damage from Chinese or North Korean
missiles destroyed on their way to Japan. When the Upper Tier
AEGIS cruisers are introduced to the 7th Fleet, the U.S. Navy
should demonstrate their capability to allies and friends in Southeast
Asia and make their use a regular part of multilateral exercises,
like <I>KANGAROO</I> in Australia and <I>RIMPAC,</I> conducted
bi-annually with most U.S. allies and friends in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Telling China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.</b>
<P>
Washington should continue to urge Beijing to abide fully by the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to join the Missile Technology
Control Regime. Washington also should urge Beijing to make its
nuclear weapons programs more transparent and to consider eventual
limitations on its nuclear arsenal. But added pressure on China
is needed. The Chinese should be told that if they do not curb
nuclear technology cooperation with countries like Pakistan and
Iran, and missile sales to Pakistan, China will begin to define
itself as an adversary.
<P>
The Clinton Administration should obey the 1990 Arms Export Control
Act that obligates the United States to impose trade sanctions
on China because of its sale of missiles to Pakistan. U.S. intelligence
agencies believe China has shipped over 30 M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
This charge cannot be swept under the rug. Failure to respond
to China's sale of missiles makes a mockery of the Administration's
nonproliferation policies. The Clinton Administration should devise
a graduated schedule of sanctions that will be ended when China
joins the MTCR.
<P>
Clinton should also explain to the Chinese that missile defenses
are a justified and moral response to China's continued nuclear
weapons buildup and its demonstrated willingness to engage in
nuclear threats. Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees
to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsenal, the
U.S. will make available to China early warning data.
<P>
<LI><b>Selling advanced TMD systems to Taiwan, consistent with the
Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval TMD forces to help
defend Taiwan.</b>
<P>
The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) calls for the U.S. to &quot;provide
Taiwan with arms of a defensive character&quot; and to &quot;maintain
the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force
or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security,
or the social economic system of the people of Taiwan.&quot; 
Following China's missile &quot;tests&quot; designed to threaten
Taiwan, sale of missile defense systems to Taiwan is consistent
with the TRA. Raytheon Company is helping Taiwan build a variant
of the Patriot PAC-2 called the Modified Air Defense System.<sup>46</sup> 
Since this program does not respond to Taiwan's immediate defense
needs, Washington should offer Taipei the more capable <I>Patriot</I>
 PAC-2 GEM  the most advanced variant in the U.S. Army  and consider
offering THAAD if Beijing persists in threatening Taipei. Washington
should make clear to Beijing that the sale of missile defense
systems to Taiwan does not threaten China. Rather, the purpose
is to prevent China's nuclear blackmail of Taiwan. Washington
also should prepare to use 7th Fleet AEGIS cruisers and destroyers
armed with the Standard Upper Tier TMD missiles to defend Taiwan,
consistent with the TRA.
<P>
<LI><b>Offering India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.</b>
<P>
To advance non-proliferation initiatives between India and Pakistan,
the United States should offer both countries missile defenses
and technology if they agree to limit and reduce their nuclear
and missile arsenals. A verifiable treaty to limit such systems
might be facilitated by giving Indian and Pakistani officials
access to a U.S. monitor that receives data from U.S. early warning
and reconnaissance satellites or a similar monitor placed in another
location. A monitor would enable both countries to observe each
other's military sites and provide warning of a first strike.
The agreement could be strengthened later by the sale of ground-based
TMD systems to both countries. After acquiring space-based missile
defense systems, the U.S. might help enforce an Indian-Pakistan
nuclear and missile reduction treaty by extending space-based
missile defense coverage to both countries. Space-based defenses
also could give Washington the option to intervene unilaterally
to prevent a disastrous nuclear exchange.
</OL>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
The United States must develop a missile defense strategy for
Asia. Missile defenses are needed to enhance the security of U.S.
military forces in Asia, to safeguard America's Asian friends
and allies, and to encourage multilateral missile defense cooperation.
This strategy is sorely needed to enable Americans and Asians
to reduce their vulnerability to Chinese and future North Korean
nuclear missiles. Both countries have demonstrated they are prepared
to disregard conventions like the NPT and MTCR. China's willingness
to use missiles to intimidate neighbors like Taiwan, in addition
to concerns about instability in China or North Korea, compels
Americans and Asians to plan jointly for appropriate missile defenses.
<P>
Only the United States has the technical capability and the moral
vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail
or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation. By responding
to the threat of nuclear missiles in Asia, the U.S. can counter
perhaps the most critical emerging threat to peace in that region.
At the same time, by demonstrating determination to counter this
threat, Washington will be strengthening its extended nuclear
and conventional deterrent in Asia while lessening the possibility
that Asia could become destabilized by nuclear proliferation.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections, conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress. For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope of government.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although President Clinton repeatedly has vetoed major legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and retreats, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses. While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents. Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives should appreciate the progress that has been made.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating $245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This legislation not only represented the first balanced budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in government programs which would have returned power to states and communities. In spite of the President's obstructionism, however, Congress succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the taxpayer's credit for cutting the Administration's projected deficit nearly in half.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it."  But it was conservatives in Congress who made this promise a reality. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill. Congress restored funding for important national security programs that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress. Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of costly new mandates, and stopped unjustified new regulations. Congress delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. In addition, the 104th Congress gave the President the line-item veto.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance. However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts access to health insurance.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of its success in other areas, Congress has more work to do to complete work on other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments. The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs that were unthinkable before 1994.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over."  The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Clinton Claims Undeserved Credit for Cutting FY 1996 Deficit<br>
<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

<h3>WHAT THE 104TH CONGRESS DID TO COMBAT CRIME</h3></font>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<h3>HOW CONGRESS REFORMED THE WELFARE SYSTEM</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><sup>1</sup><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress passed historic welfare reform legislation; and after vetoing two previous versions of welfare reform, President Clinton finally signed the congressional welfare reform bill into law on August 22, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals have long opposed serious welfare reform, arguing that if the federal government continues its traditional practice of offering free handouts, children in particular will be better off, and the social maladies that characterize the life of low-income Americans in many of our urban and rural areas will decline or disappear. The liberal experiment in social policy has been tried and has failed.<sup>2</sup>  No scientific study has ever demonstrated that increasing welfare benefits to low-income persons improves the long-term prospects of the children of those persons. Indeed, children on welfare, compared to children whose families are poor but are not on welfare, do poorly: They do less well in school and earn less. The liberal welfare state has not helped children; it has hurt them.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The congressional legislation reforms the current welfare system in four major ways:
<P>
<b>1. It eliminates perverse financial incentives for state government.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the major welfare program for unmarried mothers and children established in 1935, has been funded on an entitlement basis. Traditionally, this has meant that the more persons a state enrolls in AFDC, the greater will be the funds received from the federal government. Conversely, if a governor reduces the number of persons on welfare, federal funding to his state is reduced. Clearly, AFDC's entitlement funding structure creates perverse incentives for state government, penalizing states which reduce dependency and rewarding those which allow their welfare caseloads to grow.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new congressional welfare reform legislation eliminates these perverse incentives by creating a new funding system. Under this new system, each state will be given a fixed dollar grant which will be increased gradually from year to year. If a state reduces its AFDC caseload, its federal grant will not be cut. Instead, the state will be permitted to keep any surplus federal funds that are generated by caseload reduction and apply those funds to other efforts to aid the poor. On the other hand, if a state permits its AFDC caseload to grow rapidly, the state -- not the federal government -- will bear the added cost.
<p>
<b>2. It slows the growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to claims by liberals in Congress and certain reports in the press, the congressional reform bill will not cut welfare spending. It merely slows the rate of growth in spending. Seven major programs are affected by the legislation:<p><ul>

<li>Aid to Families with Dependent Children;
<li>Food Stamps;
<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI);
<li>School lunch and other child nutrition programs;
<li>Foster Care;
<li>Social Services Block Grant; and
<li>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under prior law, aggregate spending in these programs was scheduled to grow by nearly 50 percent over the next seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 6 percent).  The congressional reform legislation will slow the rate of growth to around 35 percent over seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 4.5 percent). Thus, the reform will permit future aggregate state spending in these programs to expand faster than the rate of inflation.
<p>
<b>3. It establishes work requirements.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the new law, welfare no longer will be a one-way handout. The law establishes serious, correctly designed standards for the states and work requirements for welfare recipients; the goal is for states to reduce their caseloads, not to process greater numbers of persons through welfare. Specified percentages of AFDC recipients will be required to take private-sector jobs. If a state is unable to reduce its caseload through placements in the private sector, it will be required to place certain numbers of welfare recipients in community service work in exchange for welfare benefits. When working in a community service job, the welfare recipient must be in a "pay after performance" system: The beneficiary will not receive AFDC benefits until after the community service work has been completed satisfactorily. If the individual fails to work the prescribed number of hours, his welfare benefits will be reduced accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One weakness in the reform legislation is that because of numerous loopholes, the number of recipients who will be required to work is quite low. By 1999, the typical state will be required to have only 18 percent of its AFDC caseload working. The new law, however, is still an improvement over the current system.
<p>
<b>4. It provides incentives to reduce illegitimacy.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the present time, nearly one-third of all American children are born out of wedlock. There is a growing consensus, among liberals and conservatives alike, that the growth in illegitimacy is a social catastrophe for the nation. The collapse of marriage and the rise in out-of-wedlock births encourage welfare dependency as well as crime and many other social problems.<sup>4</sup>  The welfare reform bill contains three provisions to combat illegitimacy. First, it will focus the attention of state governments on the illegitimacy problem by requiring each state to set numerical goals for reducing illegitimacy over the next ten years. Second, it will provide bonus funding to states which reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion rates. Third, it will create a new program to provide abstinence education, funded at $50 million per year.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While it is not perfect, the congressional welfare reform legislation is a significant step in the right direction. It represents the largest change in federal welfare policy since the initiation of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty in 1965.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much more, however, has to be done. Congress must begin the job of rebuilding and revitalizing America's inner-city neighborhoods, promoting moral as well as urban renewal in the nation's most devastated communities and giving hope to millions of Americans trapped in environments whose principal distinguishing characteristics are broken families, crime-ridden communities, and economic and physical deterioration. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Their goals are real enterprise zones in urban and rural areas to encourage business opportunities and job creation in the nation's poorest communities; scholarships for poor children to attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that reinforce traditional moral virtues; a charitable contribution tax credit to any American who makes a contribution to any private charity engaged in providing direct services to the nation's poor; and the elimination of official discrimination against religious or faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers -- the very programs that most often use public funds for these purposes most effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives in Congress have a full agenda in social policy. Serious welfare reform is only the beginning.

<h3> HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS REFORMED ITSELF</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David M. Mason</a><br>
Vice President of Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Imperial Congress was dethroned in 1994, and conservatives who had railed against an insulated ruling class in Washington had reason to celebrate. The switch in majorities alone deposed decades-tenured House and Senate committee chairmen who had frustrated Ronald Reagan's policy initiatives and hounded his appointees. But the new majority was far more than an ideological mirror image of the old. Beginning with its first day in January 1995, the 104th Congress instituted sweeping reforms of its own internal operations and budget, the legislative process, and congressional relations with the states and the executive branch.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The abuses of the old order were rooted out, not only with new leaders, but with new laws and rules which amount to the most sweeping changes in decades. More important, these changes likely represent an enduring and positive change in the way Americans govern themselves. As a result of reforms enacted in the past two years, future Congresses will be unable to perpetrate many of the abuses practiced by politicians in the past. The new Congress strictly limited gifts and perks, agreed to abide by laws imposed on the private sector, cut its budget and staff, limited its own spending and taxing powers, and agreed to avoid new impositions on state and local governments. By acting voluntarily to curb its own powers and privileges in this way, the 104th Congress has been truly revolutionary.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the new Congress has received insufficient credit for these achievements. The reasons: They are not widely known to the public, many of the early reforms were forgotten during the political storms of last winter, and procedural reforms take time to bear fruit. Further, many Americans were disappointed that Congress failed, albeit narrowly, to approve the most popular and sweeping reform: term limits. But the blame does not lie with Congress, which advanced term limits farther and faster than nearly any previous constitutional amendment proposal. Votes in the House and Senate have laid the groundwork, making eventual passage of a constitutional amendment highly likely. The real culprit is the Supreme Court, which invalidated state laws imposing term limits on Members of Congress. Had the Court ruled the other way, a constitutional amendment would have been more swift and certain, and some Representatives would have been facing term limits as early as 1998.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Repairing the public's fractured trust in Congress will take a long time, but a simple listing of reforms implemented since January 1995 should cheer Americans who sometimes despair about whether politicians can ever get things right. Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Applied laws imposed on the private sector to itself;

<p><li>Froze congressional pay;

<p><li>Cut its own budget and staff;

<p><li>Granted line-item veto authority to future Presidents;

<p><li>Banned most gifts to Members of Congress;

<p><li>Required lobbyists to register and disclose their activities;

<p><li>Restricted laws imposing burdens on states and communities (unfunded mandates);

<p><li>Reduced franking (free mail) and other perks;

<p><li>Imposed term limits on committee chairmen and top House and Senate leaders;

<p><li>Abolished an entire agency (the Office of Technology Assessment);

<p><li>Privatized support services;

<p><li>Eliminated government grants to nonprofit lobbying groups;

<p><li>Repealed a law that favored congressional staff in hiring for career government jobs; and

<p><li>Established a mechanism for Congress to review major new regulations.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to these reforms applying to the entire Congress, the House of Representatives, which had been subject to more severe criticism for its management and procedures, acted on its own to:
<ul>
<p><li>Require a supermajority (three-fifths) vote to increase taxes;

<p><li>Conduct its first comprehensive audit and modernized financial management;

<p><li>Reform the committee structure, eliminating three full committees and 25 subcommittees;

<p><li>Prohibit absentee (proxy) voting in committees;

<p><li>Open committee meetings and information to the media and the public;

<p><li>Create a new corrections day process to repeal unreasonable rules and regulations;

<p><li>Guarantee that the minority party would have more opportunities to amend legislation; and

<p><li>Compare spending proposals to existing spending (rather than to inflated projections).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The result of these reforms is a Congress that is less costly, less bureaucratic, and less insulated from the concerns of average Americans. It is more open, more responsive, and more accountable to voters. It is, in brief, a Congress more befitting a democratic republic, and unless these reforms are abandoned or reversed, Americans should discover a growing sense of confidence in their ability to govern themselves through Congress.
<p>

<b>THE FIRST DAY</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and practices. The 1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress and delivered a clear reform mandate. The Contract With America promised numerous changes in House rules, and the new leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate and ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th Congress, the House voted to end procedures that had become increasingly arbitrary and secretive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of the institution's critics. The rules were designed to:<ul>

<p><li>Improve deliberation by banning proxy (absentee) voting in committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process, and requiring fuller reporting on spending bills;

<p><li>Streamline the legislative process by cutting the number of committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of legislation, and slashing committee staff;

<p><li>Promote accountability by requiring that committee meetings be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll call votes on major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate transcripts, and conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances; and

<p><li>Increase responsiveness by imposing term limits on the Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a measure to apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative vote in the 104th Congress.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight specific first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing, in most cases with large bipartisan majorities:
<ol>
<p><li><b>Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</b> The new rules package eliminated three House committees (Post Office and Civil Service, District of Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries) and 25 subcommittees. The committee reform provision also shrank House committee staff by one-third.

<p><li><b>Truth in Budgeting.</b> Appropriations committees are now required to compare new spending recommendations to the current spending level. Under the old system, tax-and-spend liberals had the upper hand because spending increases were judged not against what actually was spent last year, but against projected spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending increase could be called a "cut."

<p><li><b>Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</b> House committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more than three consecutive Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure of committee chairmen begins to address some of the concerns of advocates of full-scale legislative term limits. A central problem of previous Congresses had been that committee chairmen, who set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd Congress, for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most powerful committees (Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce) had held these positions for over a decade; the chairman of the third (Appropriations) had just vacated his position after holding it since the 1970s.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more than four Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional officer of the legislative branch in line with the President, his executive branch counterpart.

<p><li><b>Elimination of Proxy Voting.</b> Elimination of the practice of allowing absent members of a committee to lend their votes to other members was critical to ensuring fairness and improving committee deliberation. Although House rules strictly prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on the House floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by violations of this rule), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the 103rd Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proxy voting promoted committee absenteeism by ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain their ability to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its merits. Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee chairmen and force Members to show up and actually participate in the work of their committees if they want their votes to count.
<p>
<p><li><b>Open Meetings.</b> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public access to committee meetings. In previous Congresses, committees frequently closed their doors to the press and public, a step the panels could take for nearly any reason. In fact, the two House committees that most often operated in secret (Appropriations and Ways and Means) were the ones making controversial choices about federal taxation and spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open hearing or meeting (previously, media coverage was subject to a vote of approval). The new rules also require that committees publish recorded committee votes in their reports (most voting records previously were available only at committee offices) and that hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor grammatical changes.

<p><li><b>Tax Hikes More Difficult.</b> The new rules require a three-fifths vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and prohibit retroactive taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been particularly controversial, with some Washington commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or even unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the conviction that new tax increases are needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions voters have imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the most beneficial aspects of the 60 percent tax rule is that any future Congress desiring to raise taxes would have to alter or waive the rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost. The provision also balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively requires a 60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
<p>
<li><b>House Audit.</b> Another 1995 rules change authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and facilities by an independent accounting firm. Some House accounts previously had been audited sporadically by the General Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the fact that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most House accounts were not examined regularly, and some may never have been reviewed by an independent examiner. This audit -- the first complete accounting of the House's financial status ever made available to the public -- uncovered 14 material weaknesses (significant deficiencies) in House accounting and financial control processes and resulted in a complete overhaul of House financial management practices.

<p><li><b>Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</b> The last of the Contract reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). This measure has both substantive and symbolic importance. It underscores the principle that no American should be immune from the law or receive special treatment in its application. The bill also should encourage legislators to review the burdens that federal laws place on American citizens and ensure that the benefits they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</ol>

<p>
<b>EARLY SUCCESSES</b>
<p>

<b>Congressional Accountability Act.</b> After being passed by the House on its first day in session, the Congressional Accountability Act was taken up by the Senate as its first item of business. The Senate added an eleventh law, the Veterans Reemployment and Training Act, to the ten the House had applied to Congress; it also strengthened congressional employees' judicial review and appeal rights. The House quickly approved the Senate changes and sent the bill to President Clinton, who signed it on January 23.
<p>
<b>Unfunded Mandates.</b> The second piece of legislation considered by the Senate bars unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments. This was also an item in the Contract With America, though not on the list of "first-day" reforms. As with the Congressional Accountability Act, the House and Senate speedily passed this legislation, which President Clinton then signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the federal government essentially had run out of money over the past decade, Congress increasingly had resorted to laws requiring state or local governments to provide new services. Aside from upsetting the balance of federal powers, this allowed one agency of government (Congress) to expand services while leaving others to raise taxes to pay the bills. This was a sure formula both for expanding government and for increasing voter discontent. The new law requires congressional committees to assess and report the costs of any requirements imposed on states or localities. It also requires the House and Senate to vote explicitly to impose new mandates. As a result of this law, Congress has stopped even considering imposing new unfunded mandates. Rather than trigger scrutiny under the new law, congressional committees have rewritten communications, environmental, and other laws to avoid imposing new costs on state and local governments.
<p>
<b>Senate Reforms.</b> The Senate did not reform its internal procedures to the degree the House did, largely because a bipartisan tradition had allowed incremental reforms to be implemented over a number of years, making a large package unnecessary. The Senate did, however, echo the House by imposing term limits on committee chairmen and on the Majority Leader (the Senate's most influential member). The Senate also cut committee staffs by a substantial 15 percent and worked with the House to devise overall congressional budget cuts.
<p>
<b>Term Limits.</b> The new Congress also held the first-ever House vote on term limits, and provided the first serious consideration in the Senate. On March 29, 1995, as a part of the Contract With America, the House voted 227-204 in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting House and Senate service to 12 years. Though a majority favored term limits, the total was 63 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states. In a similar fashion, the Senate voted 58-42 in favor of a "cloture" motion on term limits, like the House, garnering a simple majority, but falling short of two-thirds support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While supporters of term limits were disappointed by the failure to achieve the two-thirds majorities necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states, at least members of the House and Senate are on record as publicly supporting or opposing term limits. Supporters now have a standard against which they can measure future Congresses, and voters will know -- unequivocally -- where their representatives stand on this important issue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Supporters of terms limits should remember that a majority in Congress voted for them; the real culprits are not in the majority, but among those Members still opposed, as well as on the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<sup>1</sup> the Court held that states may not impose term limits on their own representatives in Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress may not act on its own to impose term limits by statute. The impact of this decision was to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and make a constitutional amendment essential to achieving term limits for Congress.<p><b>Budget Cuts.</b> The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY 1996 legislative branch appropriations bill provided systemic congressional reforms as important as any yet enacted, including spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and abolition of unnecessary offices and functions. The FY 1996 and 1997 congressional budgets reduced spending in real dollars -- not phony "baseline" cuts -- by $161 million, or 9 percent below the 1995 level. Had Congress and the President made similar cuts in every other agency and program, the federal budget would be balanced next year. While cutting every program (including interest payments and Social Security) is clearly unrealistic, it is evident that Congress took its share of cuts and more.
<p>
<b>Pay and Pensions.</b> Members of Congress made personal sacrifices as well, voting in both the 1996 and 1997 appropriations cycles to freeze their own pay. Congress also approved reforms in the bloated congressional pension system. Congressional pensions far exceed most private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as generous as those of most Fortune 500 corporations. Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers, but they also promote political careerism by providing incentives for lawmakers to extend their tenure. Unfortunately, the pension reforms approved by Congress were part of the reconciliation package which was vetoed by President Clinton in November 1995.
<p>
<b>Perks.</b> Cuts in congressional perks contributed to budget savings, including a $20 million cut in franking (postage) costs achieved by cutting the budget for each Representative by one-third, bringing down the average annual allowance from $163,000 to $108,000 per office. The House achieved further savings by privatizing food services, mail handling, and other support functions.
<p>
<b>Agencies and Personnel.</b> Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the government by slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded agencies, including the $21 million Office of Technology Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the national legislature. The reforms pushed the General Accounting Office to privatize its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract out some of its auditing work so that it can benefit from the lower costs available in the private sector. The result is a cut of more than 25 percent in the GAO's budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In line with budget savings, Congress cut total employment by over 2,600 positions, nearly 10 percent of the total for Congress and its agencies.
<p>
<b>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban.</b> In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting the types and amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The Senate passed a complex rule that allows single gifts up to $50, with a $100 annual limit. Any item less than $10 falls outside the Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping proposal, offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to prohibit all gifts. Both the Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for commemorative items and expenses related to official activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the House and Senate in late 1995. While this legislation would institute new reporting requirements and close loopholes in the original 1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many potential pitfalls. It protects legitimate grassroots organizing as well as incidental or small lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Line-Item Veto.</b> Among the most potentially far-reaching reforms approved by the 104th Congress is the line-item veto, which will be available to the President who takes office in January 1997. The removal of presidential impoundment authority (the practice of refusing to spend all the money Congress appropriated) in the 1974 budget reforms was one factor in the continuing stream of high deficits from that year on. Despite partisan differences, the 104th Congress agreed that the President should be able to excise unneeded items from appropriations bills and send them back to Congress. Unless both houses can muster a two-thirds vote to override the President's objections, the spending cuts stand. This is a power used by 43 state governors and, effectively, by Presidents prior to 1974. Ronald Reagan repeatedly asked Congress for just this authority. The 104th Congress's approval of the line-item veto was an act of political magnanimity and unmatched institutional restraint.
<p>

<b>CONTINUING REFORMS</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As impressive as this list of reform accomplishments is, even more impressive is the fact that leaders and members of the 104th Congress remain committed to further reforms. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has vowed that a term limits amendment will be the first item of business for the House in the next Congress. Balanced budget and tax limitation amendments also will be brought back for consideration. Several House and Senate committees are considering changes in the budget process, which probably will be altered in 1997.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is exploring ways to streamline Senate procedures, and separate Republican and Democratic task forces in the House have issued reports urging further changes in House procedures. These are likely to result in another opening-day package of House rules changes in January 1997. Among the most likely items for action is a Congressional Freedom of Information Act, which would make information about Congress more widely available on the Internet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other House rules changes which have widespread support are a truth in testimony proposal to require witnesses testifying before congressional committees to disclose the amount of federal grants and contracts they receive, and a proposal to require sponsors of legislation to cite specific authority from the Constitution to justify it. Following up on the Unfunded Mandates Act, Senator Ted Stevens and others are promoting legislation to enforce the Tenth Amendment and its reservation of powers to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Too often, revolutionaries who seize power become too much like the leaders they overthrew. Some Americans may even fear that this has happened to the 104th Congress. But a review of congressional reform accomplishments over the last two years shows that the reformers stayed true to their cause. They achieved most of their goals (and even exceed some) and remain committed to further political reform in the next Congress.

<h3>
HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS HAS PROTECTED THE NATION'S SECURITY</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moore.html">Thomas Moore</a><br>
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been more stark and disturbing than in defense and foreign policy. Failures in economic and domestic policy are bad enough. But negligence, complacency, incompetence, and self-delusion in national security are matters of life and death, as the terrorist bombing of the U.S. barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, so tragically attests. When the Commander in Chief is not up to the job, lives are lost and vital national interests are injured.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The President, as Commander in Chief, has the primary constitutional responsibility for the conduct of U.S. foreign and defense policy. But the Framers of the Constitution wisely did not place all the responsibility in the President's hands: The constitutional system of checks and balances assigns much of the responsibility for national security to Congress. Under Article I, Section 8, "The Congress shall have Power to... provide for the common Defence and general welfare of the United States... ," including the power "To declare war... To Raise and support Armies... To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.... "

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress exercises oversight authority for the conduct of foreign and security policy through the authorization and appropriation of funds for executive branch agencies. The Senate also has specific national security responsibilities, both through its power to confirm Administration appointments and officers of the armed services and, most significantly, through its role in approving or disapproving the ratification of treaties, as spelled out in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 104th Congress has performed with great credit in carrying out these responsibilities, though in some cases the results have not been commensurate with the quality or intensity of the effort. Indeed, there are limits to what Congress can do to protect the nation's security if the Commander in Chief persists in following misguided policies, or is guilty of slipshod execution of sound policies. In any case, the 104th Congress has mitigated the worst consequences of President Clinton's record on national defense and foreign affairs, and has provided balance against Clinton excesses, negligence, and irresponsible actions. Highlights of congressional accomplishments in national security include:
<ul>
<p><li>Making national missile defense a congressional leadership issue. Though the proposed Defend America Act of 1996 has yet to be enacted, it has given supporters of national missile defense the political initiative and has exposed the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Clinton Administration on the most vital of all defense issues.
<p>


<li>As part of the missile defense effort, focusing attention on the need to withdraw or substantially modify the 1972 ABM Treaty and providing a statutory reminder that substantive changes in the Treaty must be brought before the Senate for advice and consent to ratification.

<p><li> Restoring needed funds to the defense budget to offset the severe, chronic budget shortfall inherent in the Administration's Bottom-Up Review force levels and its five-year defense plan.

<p><li> Allocating substantial new funds to modernize the forces and rebuild combat readiness.

<p><li> Acting to renew the NATO alliance by a series of votes calling for enlargement of the alliance to include newly independent democracies in Central Europe.

<p><li> Cutting foreign aid and instituting organizational reforms in the State Department and in foreign operations accounts to eliminate waste and duplication.
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's misguided policies in foreign and defense policy were a prime target of the Contract With America. Alarmed over Clinton's defense budget cuts and failure to move rapidly toward a national missile defense system, Republicans and conservative Democrats committed to the Contract promised to restore America's military strength. And early in the 104th Congress, they worked to fulfill their promise.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On February 7, 1995, the House of Representatives passed the National Security Revitalization Act (H.R. 7), which sought to establish a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall in defense, set a new policy for the development and deployment of missile defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the President to subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Senate did not take up H.R. 7, but parts of the bill did find their way into different pieces of Senate legislation, such as the defense and foreign relations authorization bills. While not all of the original Contract items were included in final legislation reconciling differences between the House and Senate -- for example, Congress dropped the House demand for a commission to examine U.S. national security strategy -- conservative supporters of the Contract delivered on the majority of their promises to the American people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress undertook a number of other foreign and defense policy initiatives that complement and supplement the national security planks of the Contract With America. For example, the new majority in Congress has endeavored to:
<p>
<b>Restore America's military strength.</b> Congress approved a defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget request submitted by President Clinton. This money was needed not only to keep America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but also to maintain a force with modern high-technology weapons in the 21st century. Because he needed congressional support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton bowed to demands from the Hill and signed the defense appropriations bill for FY 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his original defense budget request.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the President vetoed the accompanying FY 1996 defense authorization bill, which would have 1) provided more funds to maintain the technological superiority of U.S. forces; 2) authorized a pay raise and housing allowance increase for military personnel (including those deployed to Bosnia); and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S. homeland against ballistic missiles. The veto was narrowly upheld, and Congress found it necessary to weaken the missile defense provisions of the bill in order to secure its enactment with the President's signature.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the FY 1997 defense authorization bill, Congress has added more than $11.2 billion to the defense budget and has maintained a vigorous missile defense program -- or at least as vigorous as can be expected under the threat of another veto from a White House which gives lip service to missile defense while steadily undermining any real prospects for deployment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Move the United States closer to a national missile defense system. The FY 1996 defense authorization bill -- approved by Congress but vetoed by the President -- sought to establish a clear timetable for development and deployment of both national and theater missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the application of Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater defense systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill, giving as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it contained. He prevailed, forcing Congress to weaken missile defense in the final 1996 defense authorization bill. Once again, the President succeeded in blocking this country's ability to defend its citizens from nuclear attack, and Congress was not able to muster enough votes to override his veto.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the second session of the 104th Congress, both House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) sponsored the Defend America Act of 1996, which would mandate the development and deployment by a specific date of limited missile defenses of the U.S. homeland. This Act has not yet won approval, but the strong opposition of the Clinton Administration further illustrates the lengths to which the President is prepared to go to ensure the strategic status quo, which defends the 1972 ABM Treaty instead of defending Americans and leaves the U.S. vulnerable to the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.
<p>

<b>Cut foreign aid.</b> While the new Republican majority promised extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of revamping America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending on foreign aid will likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than it was in FY 1995. However, under the umbrella of a balanced budget by the year 2002, further cuts are likely. While current cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except aid to Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right direction is a new law requiring that the U.S. government report on the progress being made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets, the main engine of economic development. This effort was inspired by The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, a global comparison of economic freedom in 142 countries.
<p>
<b>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</b> Congress passed, and the President signed, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act just a few days after Cuba downed two U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international waters on February 24, 1996. This legislation, which tightens the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and allows American citizens to seek compensation for property stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening the end of Castro's dictatorship.
<p>
<b>Reorganize the State Department.</b> Congress proposed to cut waste in the State Department and foreign operations accounts by consolidating several independent foreign policy agencies within the State Department. This effort, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the support of Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic interests within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key legislation to move the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), Agency for International Development (AID), and other foreign policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President has vowed to veto this legislation if it is approved by Congress.
<p>
<b>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</b> In December 1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support the U.S. troops being deployed on the peacekeeping mission to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did not endorse the President's decision to deploy them, and also raised questions about the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear goals. The House went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission.
<p>
<b>Maintain America's trade relations with China by approving most-favored-nation trade status for China.</b> In June 1996, the Congress sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China. This decision reflects the belief, held by a majority in Congress, that increasing economic interaction is the best way to promote economic reform and advance political liberalization and human rights.
<p>
<b>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</b> In the face of Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui a visa to visit his alma mater Cornell University, Congress voted with near unanimity in May 1995 to support his visit. As a result, the President reversed course and granted the visa. Also, both the House and Senate have included provisions in the 1996 State Department authorization bill that would give precedence to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China government-to-government communiqus when considering future weapons exports to Taiwan. U.S. China policy too often is framed by communiqus that have no force of law, international or domestic. The Taiwan Relations Act, however, is the law of the land. The President has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.
<p>


<b>UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the 104th Congress has done much to mitigate the Clinton Administration's negative impact on national security, much remains to be done. Working within its constitutional, budget, and oversight prerogatives, Congress needs to adopt a concerted strategy -- and initiate a legislative campaign based on that strategy -- to restore America's lost credibility abroad and dispel doubts around the world about U.S. leadership.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The first step is to continue the good work of the 104th Congress to reverse the neglect and decline of U.S. military strength that has characterized the Clinton Administration. Proper congressional action can encourage the development of a clear and coherent foreign and defense policy grounded in American principles and national interest, replacing the Clinton Administration's politicizing of defense and indifference to foreign policy, which have created only muddle and confusion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must ensure that the U.S. preserves the capacity to act unilaterally when U.S. interests are threatened. This means rejecting the false notion that U.S. power must be "legitimized" by operating through some international or multilateral agency like the United Nations. Congress must make sure that the Clinton policy of "assertive multilateralism" does not subordinate clear national interests to the U.N. and other supranational entities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to assert its prerogatives to prevent more dubious foreign interventions like Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia which turn the U.S. military into an international social work agency. Clinton's vague global utopianism has misused the military, gotten American soldiers needlessly killed, and wasted scarce defense dollars. If Congress does not intervene properly in such cases, American military strength and credibility will continue to be frittered away in "peace operations" which provide little or no benefit to the nation's security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to provide adequate funds and resources to preserve the core mission of the armed forces: to fight and win wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and existing military alliance commitments. Under Clinton, American fighting forces are weaker and less able to deal with larger military contingencies in areas like Korea or the Persian Gulf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In keeping with this duty, Congress must end the weakening of the armed forces caused by the imposition of a radical social agenda of "political correctness."  The President has imposed his radical vision on the military services by pushing women into combat positions before their effectiveness has been tested or their impact on combat effectiveness honestly evaluated. He has advocated the admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the ranks, contrary to the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The result has been a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat effectiveness. Congress must intervene to protect the morale and combat effectiveness of America's fighting forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must also continue to press for deployment of the most effective theater and national missile defenses possible. If the President and his advisors continue to use the 1972 ABM Treaty as an excuse not to defend Americans from the growing threat of ballistic missiles, Congress should remove the Treaty as the chief impediment to meeting this vital requirement.
<p>

Many in Congress are unnecessarily intimidated by the prospects of dealing with the ABM Treaty. The Constitution establishes treaties duly ratified as part of the "supreme Law of the Land."  But the law of the land consists of the U.S. Constitution; "laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof;" and then "all Treaties... which shall be made under the Authority of the United States" -- <i>in that order</i>. In other words, treaties are not supreme over statute law or provisions of the Constitution itself. Treaties, like the Constitution and other federal laws, are subject to change or amendment. They are not permanently unalterable like the laws of the Medes and the Persians. Congress may overturn the ABM Treaty by a simple statute declaring it null and void.

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that have characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign and defense policy over the past four years are serious. They have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad and, unless rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great power capable of defending its values and interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For America, it is either lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security, and greatness; the second, to weakness and submission. For America's own well-being, and for that of the entire globe, U.S. leadership must be restored. If the Administration cannot or will not provide this leadership, Congress must hold it publicly and politically accountable and then, insofar as the Constitution and good public policy allow, step into the breach to safeguard America's national security.

	Spend a little time in virtually any city in America and you'll see them -- in doorways, under bridges, poking through trash cans, begging for loose change. They are America's homeless. They no longer wear the face of the 55-year-old alcoholic man; they look more and more like young crack addicts, battered women and children, prostitutes, gamblers, and AIDS sufferers. On any given day, about 600,000 people are living either on the streets or in shelters trying to stay alive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Americans are a compassionate people. But traditional approaches to the problem--promoted through government initiatives and many private charities -- have been so ineffective at treating the fundamental causes of homelessness that we must reconsider what it means to help our neighbors in need.
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">M</font>ost homeless programs fail because they protect lifestyles that produce homelessness and neglect the moral and spiritual means to overcome it. </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many government programs assume that homelessness is simply the absence of four walls and a roof. Usually it is not: The lack of affordable housing, though a problem, is not why most of these people have no permanent address. Most people in trouble economically have friends and families whose homes they could share temporarily if they choose to. The level of government spending on the problem likewise leaves deeper issues untouched. There are more than 60 separate federal programs that provide some form of help. The federal <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) now operates homeless shelters and drug rehabilitation programs in every major city in the United States. But the rates at which the able-bodied homeless graduate to independence from these programs rarely rise above single digits. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America need not settle for this level of failure. If anyone can testify to that, we can.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a> -- whose staff members often emerge from the ranks of the formerly homeless -- has been helping the destitute break the cycle of dependence since 1913. Last year, our emergency services and long-term rehabilitation programs helped 14,000 homeless men and women achieve self-sufficiency. These were not "easy" cases. Thousands walked into our doors addicted to alcohol, heroin, crack cocaine, and other drugs. Many have been prostitutes, or veterans who couldn't adjust to civilian life. Many have committed crimes, served time in prison, and failed other rehabilitation programs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our experience teaches us that America needs nothing less than a reformation in the way we think about homelessness. Many traditional and government-funded approaches fail not for lack of money but for a deficit of vision: They do not treat the whole person. They neglect the familial and moral aspects of a person's life. They refuse to challenge the homeless person's fundamental way of thinking. Says Rev. Mickey Kalman, the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City: "The philosophy of government homeless programs is to respect and protect lifestyles that produce homelessness."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most significantly, these programs ignore the central dimension of the problem -- the spiritual. After more than 35 years of trying to help homeless people with every imaginable problem, I cannot escape this fact: Men and women who walk away from their jobs, their families, and their homes do so because, fundamentally, they are turning away God and His claim on their lives. But government-funded policies, by definition, must exclude this vital dynamic from the discussion. It is a prescription predestined for failure.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Not only are government approaches not working, but government regulations continue to impede or thwart the most innovative programs. Labor laws, zoning issues, licensing requirements are all getting in the way of private, religiously based efforts to deliver effective care. Authorizing block grants and returning power to the states will not by themselves make much of a difference, because it's state and local governments that throw up some of the most egregious obstacles to our faith-based shelter programs. Moreover, much of government's regulatory itch is aggravated by blindness to the moral and spiritual causes of homelessness.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What follows are some of the dynamics of change: We make sure that these elements are present in all of our 245 rescue missions in the 210 cities in which we operate nationwide. Though our missions offer various educational, job-training, relational, and other skills, these three principles establish an ethical and religious foundation without which all our other efforts would amount to nothing. <p><center><b>The Faith Factor</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is very difficult to overstate the importance of the spiritual aspect of this problem. <i>Spiritual renewal is the fountainhead for personal transformation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Enoch Walker was married and had a child he loved, a job he enjoyed, and a house in Washington, D.C. Then he began abusing alcohol and drugs, what he calls "the great removers" in his life, because they became more important to him than his family and friends. Soon his wife left him, taking their child. He became so abusive that even his dog left him. He lost his job, smashed his car, and started living on the streets.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker went through several rehabilitation programs. He doesn't know the precise number because he doesn't even remember some of them. Yet each time, he slipped back into addiction. "When I was functional, I would put on a nice three-piece suit and go and get the good jobs," he says. "But it was like putting a three-piece suit on a fish. Nothing would happen on the inside."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then he checked himself into the Gospel Rescue Ministries of Washington, D.C. There, he received not only mental and physical counseling, but something else -- spiritual guidance. As he says, "They reached my heart and . . . gave me an awakening." He has now been clean for three years, and is a self-employed carpenter with two other men working for him.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker's story is important because his background is so typical of America's homeless population. Homeless advocates are quick to point out that many of the homeless suffer serious or acute mental illness. They are correct. There are no easy answers for how to help heal these people and restore balance and normality to their lives. Many of them may never leave an institutionalized or group-home setting. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mentally ill, however, do not make up the majority of the people who walk into our centers. About 80 percent of the homeless who enter the City Mission in Cleveland, for example, show symptoms of substance abuse. At our Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, Michigan, perhaps 90 percent struggle with addictions that have helped spawn and sustain a whole set of destructive attitudes and behaviors. There is simply no way to get at those behaviors without first helping the addict break his or her addiction for good. Most government and traditional shelter rehabilitation programs are notoriously poor in curing addictions. Many do not even try.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But those that do suffer from a crucial flaw. Although grounded in the best of intentions, federal programs by law can only administer to mental and physical maladies, not the spiritual. Any homeless programs that receive federal funds "must provide shelter and other eligible activities in a manner free from religious influence," writes Michael Stover, HUD's assistant general counsel for the Rocky Mountain region, in a 1995 legal brief. "It may not provide religiously oriented services to persons using the homeless shelter and must not hire only persons from a particular religious persuasion." There it is: an explicit rejection of faith as the crucial component of change. This is why the overwhelming majority of our mission directors steer clear of government funding.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We've seen countless people wander into our shelters with a mind-wrenching addiction to crack cocaine, for example, and it's obvious to us that it takes more than physical and mental counseling to break that grip. Simply telling that addict to eat his vegetables and study the multiplication tables just isn't enough. Ask any of our mission directors, many of whom have 20 to 30 years experience helping the homeless: The spectrum of addictions and difficulties from which the homeless suffer have no long-term cure outside of a heartfelt commitment of faith. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Skid Row is not a geographical location," says Kalman, a former drug addict. "It's a heart condition. Unless you change a homeless individual's heart -- not just his mind and body -- he will remain homeless."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For this reason, all of our missions instill in homeless people the reality of a God who loves them, cares for them, and wants to help change them. In our view, based not only on our theology but on our experience, it is Jesus Christ, not any program, who transforms a man's or woman's life, who gives them the strength to summon the courage to break their destructive habits.<p><center><b>A Moral Incubator</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Hand in hand with faith commitment is the sustained determination -- both from shelter staff and the homeless themselves -- to stay clean, hold down a job, or save a marriage. <i>The homeless need an environment in which they are challenged to acknowledge and consistently renounce unhealthy behaviors; otherwise, they won't acquire the practical or emotional skills they need to succeed</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mouthing a religious commitment is not enough; there must be actions to match. Our shelters insist not on perfection, but on repeated, good-faith efforts to change. And with God's grace, and a disciplined environment, they do. "We not only place responsibility on our clients," says Rev. Carl Resener, the executive director of the Nashville Union Rescue Mission, "we demand that, as a condition of living at the mission and participating in its programs, these men and women change their destructive habits."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is one reason our shelter programs span several months. It gives the homeless time not only to rid themselves of their addictions, but also to build a foundation of faith, education, and social skills necessary to succeed in life. Consider our Regeneration Program at our Miami Rescue Mission. Rev. Frank Jacobs, the executive director, oversees an eight-month recovery program for 130 men. Bible study is mandatory. The men commit to memory biblical passages--they call them "arsenal verses"--that address behavioral problems such as drunkenness, laziness, and theft. The mission also offers a three- to four-month period of daily instruction on coping and social skills, with a heavy emphasis on relapse prevention.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Listen to Raymond Nastu, a drug addict arrested more than 80 times for offenses ranging from drug possession to brawling. He checked into the Bridgeport Rescue Mission in Connecticut. "I should have been dead so many times I can't keep track of them," he says. But the mission's strict regimen and climate of tough love turned him around. "I never had people care about me the way they do here, and that gave me the hope and courage to believe I could change." Today, Nastu is drug free and works as a carpenter. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now compare that to some of the larger shelters in the country that place virtually no conditions on their residents. The results have not been pretty. Take the Mitch Snyder Shelter, in Washington, D.C. It is named after the homeless activist whose 1983 hunger strike prompted the Reagan administration to renovate a federal building so that it could be used as a homeless shelter. As documented by a <i>60 Minutes</i> expose, this shelter has been a haven for the selling of crack cocaine and liquor, as well as misuse of charitable funds and general corruption.<P><center><b>Friends and Family</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our missions place a heavy emphasis on rebuilding relationships -- to one's family, friends, and religious community. <i>Positive relationships are a vital link between the homeless and lasting rehabilitation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We don't always want to put our clients back with their old friends because sometimes the old friends are the problem," says Rev. George Verley of the Union Gospel Mission in St. Paul. "However, the worst thing in the world is for them to be alone, so we teach them to establish relationships. It's vital that they have this support structure when they leave us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is probably one of the most overlooked elements of most traditional and government-funded shelter programs. The homeless typically are treated in utter isolation; little attempt is made to reconnect them to family members. Yet when caregivers don't know a person's family background, it often becomes much more difficult to discern the most effective ways to help. <p><table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many shelters, fearful of crossing church-state lines, do not even introduce the homeless to religious communities that could offer support. The Salvation Army shelters are a noteworthy exception here, but the majority of shelters have no process for helping a recovering addict plant roots in his or her community.</td><td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he Department of  Housing and Urban Development says any shelter receiving federal funds must operate "free from religious influence." </h3><hr width=75></td> </td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There may be no more important step for a formerly homeless person, however, than to be grounded in a community of caring, committed individuals. Listen to Enoch Walker again: "If you do not have people surrounding you who care about you and give you unconditional love and give you the time that it takes to work yourself through it and work with you, I do not really see too many people who can make it." The pressures of life, the temptations of the street, the siren call of old habits -- all can easily prove to be too much for the men and women struggling to get back on their feet.<p><center><b>The Government Albatross</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We know that these and other principles are crucial to effectively helping the homeless help themselves. Though we don't expect the people we serve to pay us a dime -- most couldn't -- that doesn't mean we have no expectations of them. "There are two root causes of homelessness," says Rev. Mike Edwards from the Los Angeles Mission. "Lack of relationships and lack of responsibility. Re-establishing a sense of both is key to our long-term success."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Success for us means much more than feeding people and keeping them safe, as important as those objectives are. Our aim is to help people break their addictions, learn basic life skills, and become honest, productive members of their communities. Over the last few years, we've conducted internal studies of our programs and the results are truly encouraging: The vast majority of our missions achieve success rates of more than 50 percent, with many achieving success rates of 70 or 80 percent. That means that most of the people who graduate from one of our programs become independent; a few slip back into old habits, but most remain addiction free, employed, and connected to family and friends.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our success is also reflected in support from our communities. Eight years ago, the cumulative budgets of the 210 U.S.-based member missions in the International Union of Gospel Missions totaled $50 million. Today, IUGM counts 245 missions as members, and their cumulative budgets add up to more than $300 million. The overwhelming majority of our programs are funded privately, through individual donors, churches, and corporate sponsors. We don't require or expect government to lend a hand -- and it hasn't.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nor do we expect government to get in the way of our efforts -- but it has. There are several areas where government bureaucrats have been unsupportive or downright hostile to rescue ministries' efforts. These include labor laws, zoning issues, licensing, surplus food distribution, and disaster relief. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;v	Most of their objections stem from their reading (misreading, actually) of the First Amendment's religion clauses, designed to ensure citizens' basic religious freedoms. To which we respond: If we want a person to be truly free, that person must first be free of drugs. This is the promise rescue ministry fulfills.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Consider the following trouble areas:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Labor.</b> For years, rescue missions have struggled with the issue of whether homeless men and women who do work in the missions as part of rehabilitation qualify as employees under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/206.html">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>. In September 1990, the Labor Department determined that the <a href="http://w3.salvationarmy.org/saweb/home.htm">Salvation Army</a> had to pay the minimum wage to clients performing work as part of rehabilitation, unless the Army's location registered as a "sheltered workshop." (Sheltered workshops historically have been places handicapped people went for training, not live-in facilities.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After much political and legal wrangling, the Labor Department suspended enforcement pending further study. The policy remains in suspension, but has not been formally revoked.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Zoning.</b> City and county boards have stopped or interfered with mission programs across the nation. The Denver Rescue Mission is located in an area known as Lower Downtown or "LoDo." This was formerly Denver's Skid Row, an area where the destitute congregated. In recent years, however, the area has been redeveloped and now supports a burgeoning night life.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That welcome development has had a most unwelcome side effect: City officials have ratcheted up their efforts to curb the mission's work. For example, on cold nights, the 110-bed mission used to set up about 40 cots in the chapel to meet the increased need. City officials never raised any objection because it took people off the street. Today, city officials flatly prohibit this practice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;City officials in Daytona Beach, Florida, have not allowed the Daytona Rescue Mission to locate within the city. The mission has gone to federal court. In Albany, New York, the Capital City Rescue Mission has been trying to relocate in order to expand its services. Recently, the city rejected the mission's request to move to a previously agreed-upon property. Other missions that have encountered significant roadblocks include the Union Gospel Missions of Dallas, Spokane, and Yakima, Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Licensing.</b> The licensing of faith-based programs, beyond issues of health and safety, has become a major impediment to many missions' spiritual integrity. Licensing has brought regulations such as a "client's bill of rights" in Tennessee, which originally included the right not to be presented with religious teaching. (That's somewhat like organizing a football team and including the right not to be touched!) <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then there is the case of the City Mission in Schenectady, New York. It was cited by New York's Department of Social Services because it prohibited pornographic materials from its facilities. Only after three months of negotiation did the mission and state authorities reach agreement that the mission was within its rights to prohibit pornography. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We determined that on health and safety issues, we would submit to government regulations," says Eivion Williams, the mission's executive director. "But this was an issue of morality -- what was right and what was wrong -- and we stood firm. And in the end, we wound up getting what we asked for."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Food Distribution.</b> For many years, rescue missions accepted federal surplus food and distributed it to the needy without excessive oversight or regulation. In December 1993, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture mailed a memo to missions in its Western region that stated that USDA commodities were not to be used in meals where individuals were required to attend religious services. This caused confusion among many mission directors who were uncertain how to interpret the new rules. On advice of counsel, some missions have turned down USDA commodities because they believe accepting the food would subject them to federal regulations that compromise religious teachings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, one of the interesting contradictions of federal policy is that schools, day-care programs, and early childhood development classes operated by churches may serve surplus food -- even though their programs are grounded in religious beliefs. The government seems to believe that children in religious programs need good food, but homeless in religious programs do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tonight 27,000 people in America are staying in rescue missions. Each is being fed, sheltered, and assisted. Last year, rescue missions served more than 28 million meals to the poor and homeless. That's enough to provide a meal to every resident in the state of California. Yet each person is also being challenged with hope and opportunity. Our rehabilitation programs involve over 11,500 men, women, and children. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Rescue missions are poised to continue their dramatic growth and success. Drug rehabilitation programs are expanding to meet the increasing need. Computer training and educational programs are now staples at many missions, providing GED preparation, core curriculum classes, drivers education, and job training. Missions are also setting up joint ventures with local businesses to give reformed addicts on-the-job training. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, our optimism at the progress of our missions is tempered by the cold realities of the street. The face of homelessness in America is changing. It is getting younger and more female. Children, once a rarity at shelters, are showing up with increasing frequency -- and this cannot bode well for American society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are other problems. As Rev. Tom Laymon, the executive director of Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, observes, "There is an aging population in our prisons that will eventually be given back to society. Many will have spent decades in prison. This means a whole new generation of 'older homeless' will be out on the streets and in need of our services."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Amidst this trend, federal and state homeless and anti-poverty programs -- devoid of moral, spiritual, or religious counseling -- will continue to fail. The answer is not for government to get into the religion business, but, at the very least, to get out of the way of religiously based groups that are making a decisive difference in people's lives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have identified more than 100 American cities with populations of over 40,000 that are without a rescue mission. In 10 years, IUGM wants to have programs in each of these. Our hope and prayer is that missions around the country will demonstrate the power of a well-rounded program that nourishes mind and body, spirit and soul.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rev. Stephen Burger</b> is the executive director of the <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a>. Also contributing to this article were Rev. Mike Edwards of the Los Angeles Mission, Rev. Del Maxfield of the Denver Rescue Mission, and Rev. Lee Schmookler of Goodwill Home and Missions in Newark, New Jersey.

<center><b>"Hey -- I'm Hungry."</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those involved with rescue missions know the difficulties and dangers of inner-city life. Many, like Mickey Kalman, spent years on the street -- drifting, stealing, begging, and doing drugs -- until they reached out for help. Kalman, now the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City, was invited to speak at the 1996 Republican National Convention, in San Diego.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mickey Kalman's young life centered around alcohol. "I grew up with drunks and learned to drink," he says. He joined a gang. When he wasn't travelling and getting into mischief, he found trouble locally. At one point he pulled a gun on his teacher, threatening to "blow his brains out." By the age of 12, he was on probation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Later Kalman got involved with drugs. "Once I ran away with a shipment of dope, sold it, and hid out in Wyoming," he remembers. "When I didn't have money for gas, I siphoned it out of construction trucks."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One day he found himself in Stockton, California, alone and hungry. He'd been living on the streets for the better part of two years. He walked up to the door of a rescue mission and said, "Hey -- I'm hungry." The man at the mission offered Kalman some food and some work. He didn't usually get offers for work, but he agreed. Kalman decided to enter the rehabilitation program, where he found faith in God and the power to turn his life around.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, Rev. Mickey Kalman oversees a mission budget of $1.4 million, with a staff of 21. Thousands are helped by his mission every year. "Rescue mission work isn't easy," he says. "It's hard to love some of the people who come to us . . . [but] when they knock, I say, 'Come on in. My name is Mickey Kalman. How would you like to stick around and do a little work?'"

<b>Habitat for Conservative Values<br>by Harris Wofford & Steven Waldman</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's conduct what Charles Murray might call "a thought experiment." Imagine it's 1993 and Newt Gingrich has been sworn in as president. In his Inaugural Address, he pledges to "dismantle the welfare state and replace it with an Opportunity Society." He appoints a task force of the party's most creative conservatives to ensure that citizen action will fill the void left by the withdrawal of government. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There is, by no means, unanimity. The Cato Institute's Doug Bandow argues that as government recedes, charities and volunteer groups will naturally fill the gap. Arianna Huffington says that the nonprofit sector must become more effective and less bureaucratic. Gingrich agrees and advises the task force to look at <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> as a model for truly effective compassion -- inexpensive, nongovernmental, and faith-based. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	From Switzerland, William F. Buckley Jr. faxes in a chapter from his book <I>Gratitude</I> calling for a national-service program to engage young people in solving problems outside of government bureaucracies. Jim Pinkerton urges the re-creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps on a massive scale. Colin Powell reminds the group that the most successful race- and class-mixing program has not been busing or quotas but service in the U.S. Army. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> argues that all government benefits ought to require something of the beneficiaries in turn, shattering the entitlement mentality created by years of Democrat-created welfare programs. Senator Dan Coats suggests that government's role should be confined to helping local community-based institutions solve their own problems. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The task force decides unanimously that there should be no big federal program, with armies of Washington bureaucrats telling communities what to do. Instead, Washington would give money to states to help local community groups help themselves. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And, inspired by Buckley, the members of the task force hit on an innovative idea. Instead of just giving grants to nonprofit groups, thereby creating nonprofit bureaucracies, they could model it after programs like the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, to which committed young people devote themselves for a year or two of service. The federal government would in turn provide that young person with a "service scholarship." This would, someone points out, establish a principle that the "educrats" in the higher-education lobby have always opposed: financial aid awarded not on need but merit, merit in this case defined as a willingness to serve one's country. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Pollster Frank Luntz tells Gingrich that even though it's a decentralized, community-based program, the young people it engages should be linked together with a national spirit -- and name. Haley Barbour suggests "RepubliCorps" but Gingrich believes that might deprive it of bipartisan support. He asks his advisors to come up with a better name and gives them one bit of advice, "Don't be afraid to make it sound patriotic. Unlike the other party, we are not embarrassed to be Americans." So Luntz has a brainstorm: Let's call it "AmeriCorps." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The reality, of course, is that Bill Clinton thought of <a href="http://www.cns.gov/americorps.html">AmeriCorps</a> first, and most Washington Republicans ended up opposing it as typical Big-Government liberalism. Republicans in Congress are now on the wrong side not only of the politics -- AmeriCorps is popular with voters -- but of their own ideology. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is, however, a striking difference between the comments of Beltway Republicans and those in the rest of the country. New Hampshire governor Steve Merrill has called AmeriCorps "a great success in the state of New Hampshire." Michigan governor John Engler has said AmeriCorps "captures the promise found in all citizens." Arizona governor Fife Symington said he was "enthusiastic and impressed with the work of AmeriCorps." And Massachusetts governor William Weld called it "one of the most intelligent uses of taxpayer money ever." Let us explain why we think these Republican governors are right. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Readers of <i>Policy Review</i> will not need much persuading that government cannot solve many of our problems. But just as liberals have to be more realistic about the limits of government, conservatives need to be more realistic about the limits of the volunteer sector. One of the most common criticisms of AmeriCorps is that it is not needed in a nation in which 90 million people are volunteering. That is a weak argument. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, one-third of the volunteering done by those 90 million Americans consists of serving on committees, baby-sitting, singing in the church choir, or other activities that are beneficial but hardly a substitute for the welfare state. Second, while the potential power of the volunteer sector is awesome, the trend is in the wrong direction. Just as a social consensus against government solutions has begun to emerge, Americans have been volunteering less, according to estimates by the Independent Sector.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As women have moved into the labor market, the composition of the volunteer force has changed. Most people now are free only on weekends or evenings. That limits the types of volunteer work they can perform. Most important, harnessing the power of volunteers is not easy. Volunteers need to be trained, supervised, and deployed well to be effective. As former Michigan governor George Romney said, "There is no free lunch when it comes to volunteering." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives argue that even if the charitable sector has limits, governmental solutions will only make matters worse. "Paying" AmeriCorps members, the argument goes, subverts the idea of volunteerism -- labor given for love, not money. In an <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/walt.html">article</a> for the January-February 1996 issue of <i>Policy Review</i>, John Walters of the New Citizenship Project argued that AmeriCorps's "very premise -- using federal resources to promote voluntarism -- contradicts the principle of self government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Paid volunteerism, he wrote, would sap the strength of the nonprofit sector at precisely the moment when it most needs to flourish.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This argument ignores the experience of the past two years. Many of America's most respected nonprofits, from Big Brothers/Big Sisters to the YMCA to the American Red Cross, participate in and staunchly support AmeriCorps. A year ago, leaders of 24 volunteer groups wrote that AmeriCorps is an "enormously beneficial addition to the traditional voluntary sector. This program has not undermined our position, rather it has enhanced our efforts and strengthened our institutions."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To understand why, consider the case of Habitat for Humanity, one of the most successful faith-based volunteer groups. The founder, Millard Fuller, was wary of any involvement with AmeriCorps precisely because he feared a government program would distort the religious nature of his effort. But on the urging of his board, Habitat brought in some AmeriCorps members.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fuller used AmeriCorps to solve a particular problem. Habitat was flooded with good people who wanted to help build houses but didn't have enough full-time crew leaders to organize the volunteers. They selected AmeriCorps applicants who they thought might help. These full-time AmeriCorps members dramatically increased the number and effectiveness of the unpaid volunteers. In Miami, for instance, two dozen Habitat-AmeriCorps members coordinated, organized, trained, and worked alongside about 5,000 unpaid volunteers, who together built 50 homes in a little more than a year.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now Fuller is a fan. "As AmeriCorps members gain in construction skill," he says, "our affiliates are able to expand the number of occasional volunteers through increased capacity to supervise and manage volunteers. We at Habitat for Humanity feel privileged and honored to have AmeriCorps people with us, and we want more of them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Habitat's experience is instructive, not only because it is Newt Gingrich's favorite charity, but because it is a faith-based organization that did not have to alter its spiritual mission to make use of AmeriCorps members. This has been the experience of all the religious groups -- from the nuns of the Notre Dame de Namur mission to the Greater Dallas Community Churches -- that have brought on AmeriCorps members. The reason for their confidence is simple: they choose the AmeriCorps members, they train them, and if they're not working out, they send them home.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Habitat story is not unusual. One independent study has found that each AmeriCorps member has "leveraged" 12 unstipended volunteers. It was a recognition that volunteer groups need a cadre of full-time people to organize volunteers that led George Romney to refer to full-time stipended service and unpaid volunteers as the "twin engines of service."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even if one accepts the idea that volunteers need to be organized, why not just give the money to the nonprofit to hire its own full-time staff person? Because charities are quite capable of becoming bureaucratic. We need an infusion of people who plan to work only a year or two and have not, therefore, developed a careerist mindset. Besides, AmeriCorps members are much cheaper than full-time staff.<p>

<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">N</font>onprofits that use AmeriCorps members can provide services more efficiently, humanely, and cost-effectively than government. </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Service programs also provide a nonbureaucratic alternative to traditional government. One of the reasons the Peace Corps has enjoyed bipartisan support is that the money funds volunteers directly. Someday conservatives will view domestic national service as the antidote to bureaucracy. </td></tr></table>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider what AmeriCorps members have accomplished in rural, impoverished Simpson County, Kentucky. Over nine months of service in 1995, 122 second-graders served by 25 AmeriCorps members saw their reading comprehension scores improve by more than three grade levels. Thirty-seven percent improved by four or more grade levels. The reasons for success are quite simple. AmeriCorps volunteers can develop intense, one-on-one tutoring relationships and become familiar with the academic and emotional problems of the child. Just as important, AmeriCorps members visit each student's home every other week to show parents their child's classroom materials and suggest ways for them to help. Parental involvement has increased dramatically. Would this have happened if the federal government had given the grant to the state education agency?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, the nonprofits that use AmeriCorps members can provide services more efficiently, humanely, and cost-effectively than government can.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There has been a great deal of confusion about the costs of AmeriCorps. The standard AmeriCorps living allowance is $7,945 -- about $160 a week -- of which $6,700 comes from the federal government. Those members with no health insurance also get a health plan valued at $1,200. So direct compensation is just more than $9,000. If they finish a year of service, they get a $4,725 scholarship.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On top of that, the Corporation for National Service gives grants to local programs to help manage the AmeriCorps members. If the program builds low-income housing, that might include the cost of supplies. If the program establishes crew-based corps, that might include the cost of supervising them. If the corps helps a disaster-struck area, this would include travel costs. Then there are the administrative costs, which are distributed between the headquarters staff and the governor-appointed state commissions that distribute much of the money. The total cost to the Corporation per AmeriCorps member averages $18,800.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Programs are encouraged to raise outside money to supplement that provided by the federal government. Indeed, they can choose to add extra training, supplies, or supervision if they feel that enriches the quality--but only if they raise the money from somewhere else.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At first blush, $18,000 "per corps member" sounds like a lot of money. But think about it. This is direct compensation plus all the other costs associated with the program. If you used the same calculus for Microsoft Corp. -- the total budget divided by the number of employees -- the average "cost per employee" would be about $150,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's easy to see that this methodology has limited value, for it doesn't tell what you are getting for your money. We know what "benefit" or "product" the Microsoft investment produces. The truth is $18,000 could be a lousy deal -- or a real bargain -- depending on what the AmeriCorps members do.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps members help solve problems.</b> According to partial results from a study by Aguirre Associates, an independent consulting firm, 1,353 AmeriCorps members in 12 states restored 24 beaches, enhanced 338 miles of river banks, planted 200,000 trees, constructed 440 dams, and cleaned up 139 neighborhoods. In all, they estimated these Corps members working on environmental issues in those states "affected the lives" of 469,000 people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Three separate independent evaluations of the cost-benefit ratio of the program predict measurable returns between $1.54 and $2.60 for every AmeriCorps dollar invested. Each study concluded that AmeriCorps's full value is understated because the benefits of safer streets, better schools, stronger communities, and more active citizens are difficult to quantify and not seen immediately. The high return is part of the reason that more than 600 companies -- from Microsoft to G.E. to local grocers -- have supported local AmeriCorps programs. Stanley Litow, an officer of the IBM International Foundation, summed up his company's satisfaction by stating, "IBM expects a return on investment, and it bases its funding decisions on demonstrable results. . . . This program works."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider a program called L.A. Vets, which helps homeless Vietnam veterans become sober and independent. This nonprofit, established with the help of groups like the Disabled American Veterans, runs a 210-bed transitional home that provides 24-hour-a-day support, counseling, and job placement. Program managers conduct drug-testing regularly and expel those who flunk, a tough-love policy beyond the capacity of government bureaucracies. They require the veterans to maintain Westside Residence and pay $235 in rent, a demand that is both cost-effective and therapeutic. AmeriCorps didn't create this program but the 11 corps members at the Westside Residence, according to L.A. Vets' founders, have enabled them to start small businesses staffed by the veterans, stock a library, and make effective use of outside volunteers--including employees of a local computer business who teach the veterans how to repair computers. AmeriCorps members, in other words, have helped veterans become independent of government aid. As of this spring, only about one-quarter of the vets who moved in a year ago were back on the street. One-quarter were in treatment programs and half remained in transitional or independent housing, more sober and hopeful than they've been in years. And it's a good deal for taxpayers. The program has helped move more than 200 veterans out of veterans hospitals, where they would have cost the government $20,000 per year each.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
About two-thirds of AmeriCorps projects address the problems of the young. AmeriCorps members tutor, operate after-school programs, work with gangs to reduce violence, create safe havens and safe corridors, and organize students to volunteer. Our record in these areas is one reason Governor Pete Wilson turned to the California Commission on Community Service to help reach his goal of providing at-risk youth in California with 250,000 mentors by the year 2000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps changes those who perform the service.</b> Full-time service, whether in AmeriCorps or in the armed forces, is a rite of passage that helps create well-rounded adults and citizens. They are expected to be resourceful and show leadership. On a more mundane level, they might learn practical skills -- how to build a floor level, how to calm a crowd in an emergency, how to lead a team, or even how to show up on time.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For low-income youth, service provides a different experience than traditional government make-work jobs or training programs. AmeriCorps implicitly accepts conservative arguments against indiscriminate aid to the poor. All major religions teach that it is more blessed to give than receive. This is not only a moral instruction but a statement about human psychology: If you treat someone as a dependent, they will view themselves as such. Low-income citizens, who make up about a quarter of AmeriCorps volunteers, are earning a government benefit by serving, instead of being served. The principle was illustrated by a young high-school dropout, who left a street gang to join the Philadelphia Youth Service Corps. "Look, all my life people had been coming to help me," he said. "For the first time, this Corps asked me to do some good." <td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">H</font>abitat for Humanity did not have to alter its spiritual mission to make use of AmeriCorps members. </h3><hr width=75></td> </td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps teaches the right values.</b> AmeriCorps challenges young people to give something to their community and country. It teaches them, in the words of William Buckley, to have "gratitude" for being given so much. It instills core values of hard work, discipline, and teamwork that make young people not only more productive workers but also better citizens.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps combats balkanization.</b> By bringing people of different backgrounds together, AmeriCorps can combat ethnic and social fragmentation. Members who come to AmeriCorps from college quickly realize that the separatism they learned on campus has to be replaced by teamwork. Here again, the goal is to replicate some of the successes of the military. The World War II draft was the nation's most effective class-mixing institution. The modern army is the most effective race-mixing institution. Because they are so focused on staying alive or achieving a military objective, soldiers inevitably have to focus on individual characteristics rather than group traits. National service can be the most effective means we have for dealing with our nation's racial problems. National service may ultimately replace affirmative action as the primary means for bridging the racial divide.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps expands educational opportunity.</b> This is often cited as the main benefit of AmeriCorps, but it really doesn't make sense to spend $18,000 per member if the only benefit is extra college aid. However, the education award is proving to be an effective way of drawing people into service. And the AmeriCorps experience expands educational opportunity in a more subtle way -- by raising the aspirations of those who serve. We have seen many individuals who decided to go to college because their service convinced them that they were capable of greater things. Many of them in turn impart this sense of broad horizons to elementary or high-school students they tutor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have argued that even if AmeriCorps does worthwhile things now, it will inevitably evolve into a bloated bureaucracy that smothers local initiative. This is the strongest argument against AmeriCorps. Many an enterprise, public and private, that started out lean and flexible eventually became ossified.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps, though, will likely improve, not worsen, because of its basic structure. It is locally based and relies on a competitive grantmaking process. Two-thirds of the money goes directly to state commissions, which choose among competitive proposals from local nonprofit groups.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps is nonpartisan. By law, the state commissions comprise an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, appointed by governors -- three-fifths of whom are currently Republicans. AmeriCorps supporters must acknowledge that the success of this program stems in no small part from the leadership of some Republican governors. And those who dislike this program must also recognize that "Bill Clinton's pet project," as it is so often called, is being shaped in large part by Republicans.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We at the Corporation have been willing to learn. The traditional government posture -- cover up problems as quickly as possible -- may work for a while, but it does not make for good programs. Among our mistakes:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We have taken too long to switch from an old-style government accounting system to a more rigorous, private-sector model. As a result, our books were recently found "unauditable" using the new accounting standards. We are now bringing in outside financial experts to make the Corporation a model of government financial accountability.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We funded a grant to Acorn Housing Corp., which is closely associated with an advocacy agenda. When we found out that Acorn had crossed the line into political advocacy, we pulled the plug. (Among our 400 programs and 1,200 sites we have found only a handful that have engaged in political advocacy.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We saw that some of our programs were spending too much money on management and overhead. So, we have told AmeriCorps's national and state grantees with above average costs that they must cut costs by 10 percent. And as part of our cost-cutting agreement with <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/grassley.html">Senator Charles Grassley</a> of Iowa, we've committed to specific average cost targets -- $17,000 per member next year, $16,000 the next, and $15,000 in 1999.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In our first years, the programs raised $41 million from the private sector -- $9 million more than the authorizing legislation required from all nonfederal sources -- but some programs were relying too heavily on school districts, police departments, and other units of local government. So this year, we have required all of our programs to raise some money from the private sector.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite our efforts to make all our programs models of excellence, some did not succeed. So the Corporation for National Service or the state commissions stopped funding them. Fifty of the first-year AmeriCorps programs were not renewed -- 15 percent of the total. We realize that such a statistic can be used against us by our opponents. However, since the difference between business and government is the willingness to correct mistakes, this is probably the most businesslike thing we have done.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Having argued the substance of national service, I would like to close on a political note. House Republicans last year put themselves in an awkward position on AmeriCorps. They placed themselves on the wrong side of their own ideology, and played right into the old Democratic argument that Republicans are heartless and uninterested in solving social problems.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Republicans need not compound the error by giving this issue to Democrats. Voters do not automatically associate civilian service with Democrats. If Republicans embrace it, and put on their own imprint, people will look back 10 years from now and say AmeriCorps was a program that Democrats created and Republicans improved. Republicans could then be known as tough <i>and</i> compassionate, skeptical <i>and</i> wise. And along the way, Republicans will have truly helped transform the country from one that relies on government to solve problems to one that relies on citizen service.<P><i><b>Harris Wofford</b>, a former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, is the CEO of the Corporation for National Service. <b>Steven Waldman</b> is his senior advisor for policy, planning, and evaluation.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Service has a long and venerable history in the U.S., and it remains strong today. Three-quarters of American households give to charity. About 90 million adults volunteer; the value of their time has been estimated by the Independent Sector at nearly $200 billion.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Impressive as this is, it isn't enough to meet all of the pressing human needs that face our society. For example, Harris Wofford and Steven Waldman worry that the entry of women into the work force will reduce the number of volunteers. Hence, in their view, the need for a government program like the Corporation for National Service. </td></tr></table><p>
 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The desire to give Uncle Sam a senior management position in the service business goes back at least a century, to <i>Looking Backward</i>, a novel by lawyer and journalist Edward Bellamy. He envisioned compulsory service for all men and women between the ages of 21 and 45, resulting in a peaceful and prosperous utopia. <i>Looking Backward</i> was the best-selling book of its time and inspired the establishment of some 165 Bellamy clubs to push his egalitarian social system. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two decades later, William James advocated the "moral equivalent of war," in which all young men would be required to work for the community. He argued that "the martial virtues, although originally gained by the race through war, are absolute and permanent human goods," and that national service could instill those same values in peacetime.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most national service advocates today eschew such far-reaching utopian visions of social transformation. Nevertheless, the desire to create the good society through service lives on. Some advocates have seen national service as a means to provide training and employment, to encourage social equality, to promote civic-mindedness, or to expand access to college. Margaret Mead even saw it as a way to help liberate children from their parents. The legislative process always shrank such grandiose proposals into much more limited programs, such as the Peace Corps and, in 1993, the National and Community Service Trust Act, which established the Corporation for National and Community Service. But many of the grander goals remain -- and are expressed by Wofford and Waldman: transforming participants, teaching values, combating balkanization, and expanding educational opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Thus, the heritage of national service -- this desire for government to promote ends other than service -- is critical to understanding today's program and recognizing the pitfalls of government involvement. When we evaluate the Corporation and the thousands of AmeriCorps members, we must ask: service to whom and organized by whom?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Americans have worked in their communities since the nation's founding. Businesses, churches, and schools all actively help organize their members' efforts. Service in America is so vital because it is decentralized and privately organized, addresses perceived needs, and grows out of people's sense of duty and compassion. Any federal service program must be judged by whether it is consistent with this vision of volunteer service. Wofford and Waldman think yes. I'm less sanguine.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The mandatory variants of service obviously do not share this vision. In fact, the explicit goal of advocates of mandatory service programs was (and remains) to create a duty to the state rather than to the supposed beneficiaries of service. Moreover, service is to fit into a larger social plan implemented and enforced by government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, AmeriCorps is not mandatory, and Wofford and Waldman amass an impressive list of testimonials from private groups that welcome the Corporation's support. But, no one should be surprised that volunteer organizations might welcome financial assistance and "free" help. Washington's funds, however, could prove almost as powerful as its mandates in reshaping the independent sector. Some voluntary organizations recognize the danger. David King of the Ohio-West Virginia YMCA has warned: "The national service movement and the National Corporation are not about encouraging volunteering or community service. The national service movement is about institutionalizing federal funding for national and community service. It is about changing the language and understanding of service to eliminate the words 'volunteer' and 'community service' and in their place implant the idea that service is something paid for by the government."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	King's fears are well founded. The history of the welfare state is the history of public enterprise pushing out private organization. The impact was largely unintentional, but natural and inevitable. Higher taxes left individuals with less money to give; government's assumption of responsibility for providing welfare shriveled the perceived duty of individuals to respond to their neighbors' needs; and the availability of public programs gave recipients an alternative to private assistance, one which did not challenge recipients to reform their destructive behavior. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Corporation, despite the good intentions of people like Wofford and Waldman, risks doing the same thing to philanthropy. A federal "service" program risks teaching Americans that the duty of giving, and the job of deciding who is worthy to receive charity, belongs to government and not average people throughout society. At some point service to society could become widely equated with work for government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Glimmerings of this problem have already surfaced. For instance, the Corporation treats "public" service as inherently better than private service. Service, however, comes in many forms. Being paid by the government to shelve books in a library, whether as an employee or as an AmeriCorps member, is no more laudable or valuable than being paid by Crown Books to stock bookshelves in a bookstore. A host of private-sector jobs provide enormous public benefits -- consider health-care professionals, medical and scientific researchers, entrepreneurs, inventors, and artists. Many of these people earn less than they could in alternative work; they have chosen to serve in their own way. Yet government programs that equate public employment with service to society effectively denigrate service through private employment.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This public-sector bias is reflected in the fact that 2,800 of the first 20,000 AmeriCorps participants were assigned to federal agencies. For instance, the Department of the Interior used AmeriCorps workers to "update geological and hydrological information for the U.S. Geological Survey" and restore wetlands and wildlife habitat. Jobs like these are respectable, but they resemble traditional government employment rather than "service." While AmeriCorps participants may do good work as government employees, such activities are not likely to promote volunteerism around the country.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A more subtle problem is the likely long-term effect of federal funding on the volunteer groups and those who normally support volunteer groups. It is, in the abstract, hard to criticize grants to organizations like Habitat for Humanity (which until now refused to accept government funding), Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and the Red Cross. These groups do good work and money given to them is likely to be well spent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Who, however, should do the giving? It is certainly simpler for the IRS to empty pockets nationwide and hand a bit of the tax haul to the Corporation, which, in turn, gives it to charity. But the right way is for individuals to send their money directly to deserving groups. That Habitat for Humanity could use more full-time employees to supervise its ample private volunteers is understandable; that it should turn to the government for the resources to hire those volunteers is not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, at its most basic level, real charity doesn't mean giving away someone else's money. As Marvin Olasky has pointed out, compassion once meant to "suffer with." Over time it came to mean writing a check. Now it seems to be equated with making someone else write a check. At least public welfare programs are theoretically accountable to taxpayers for their activities. But collecting taxes for private charities, especially those with philosophical or theological viewpoints that may conflict with those of many taxpayers, is especially dubious.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nor is dependence on government healthy for private philanthropic groups. Although they get to choose and train volunteers funded by the Corporation, it seems inevitable that government will end up favoring some activities and disfavoring others. Such preferences may not be nefarious, but groups will be tempted to adjust their mission to become eligible for federal funding. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even if the Corporation eschews the natural temptation to meddle, the behavior of recipients is likely to change. Groups will be tempted to shift their fundraising from private appeals to "public education" and formal lobbying. After all, government checks tend to be much larger and cheaper to obtain than private donations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Wofford and Waldman contend that government funding will prevent private groups from becoming bureaucratic by furnishing them with short-term volunteers, who won't develop "a careerist mindset." It's not clear why career volunteers would be a problem. In fact, some problems are better met by experienced volunteers. Surely volunteer groups, if they found careerism to be a problem, could, if adequately funded, hire precisely the sort of people who now join AmeriCorps. Money does not have to be funneled through government to ensure that private groups receive "new energy," as Wofford and Waldman put it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, government's growing role in funding private groups, however worthy, is likely to encourage people to further abdicate their civic responsibilities. If we are serious about strengthening civil society and reviving a sense of individual duty to help those in need, we must emphasize contributing as well as volunteering. People will feel less pressure to volunteer time and money if the government not only provides public welfare programs but funds charitable groups. Wofford and Waldman cite private support for local AmeriCorps programs as evidence of their value. But AmeriCorps isn't necessary for IBM, G.E., Microsoft, and local grocers to support service programs. Private-sector funding should preempt, not follow, government involvement.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Boosting contributions will address one of the problems that Wofford and Waldman mention: the increase in women who have entered the work force and therefore have less time to volunteer. If they are working, they should have more money to contribute, and they should be encouraged to do so, thereby helping to fund full-time volunteers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, thoughtfully choosing which charities to support, and monitoring their activities are themselves important forms of volunteerism. Sending money off to Washington for distribution to private groups benefits the recipients, but no one else. By contrast, the sinews of community grow stronger when people stay informed, give voluntarily, and get involved. As we attempt to shrink the welfare state, getting more people to give more and to take more time considering where to give should be one of our highest priorities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, AmeriCorps may have undesirable consequences on volunteers. Undoubtedly, many volunteers paid by the government really believe in what they are doing. But the Corporation has turned service into a job, one that, counting the tax-free voucher, pays more than other entry-level employment. Some participants have privately admitted that they see national service as a remunerative job option, not a unique opportunity to help the community. Indeed, much of the president's pitch during the campaign was framed in terms of naked self-interest: earning credit toward college tuition. There's nothing wrong with joining AmeriCorps to do so, of course. But doing so really isn't more noble than, say, pumping gas for the same reason.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, government-funded service plays into what some national-service proponents have denounced as an entitlement mentality -- the idea that, for instance, students have a right to a taxpayer-paid education. Some advocates of national service have rightly asked: Why should middle-class young people be able to force poor taxpayers to help put them through school? But public "service" jobs sweetened with a salary and an educational grant are no solution: they merely transform the kind of employment that a young person seeks to help cover his educational expenses. Some AmeriCorps volunteers do sacrifice, but there is no real sacrifice involved in, say, informing people about the availability of Federal Emergency Management Agency service centers, maintaining vehicles, surveying residents about recreational interests, cutting vegetation, and changing light bulbs in dilapidated schools -- all activities funded by the Corporation. In contrast, consider the sort of tasks envisioned by William James: young laborers would be sent off "to coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in December."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 The real solution to the entitlement mentality is not to say that students are entitled to taxpayer aid as long as they work for the government for a year or two, but to rethink who deserves the subsidy. We also need to explore how federal educational assistance may have actually made it harder for students to afford college by fueling tuition hikes (the schools, of course, are the ultimate beneficiaries of most student aid). And we have to address the host of other "entitlements" that riddle the federal budget and sap people's independence.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, there is the more practical question as to whether taxpayers are likely to get their money's worth from the service provided by AmeriCorps members. Wofford and Waldman cite impressive statistics about trees planted and beaches restored, and there's no doubt that much good work has and will be done by AmeriCorps volunteers. But there is no guarantee that taxpayer-funded "service" will be worth its cost.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the opportunity costs of national service. "Public service" has a nice ring to it, but a dollar going to national service will not necessarily yield more benefits than an additional dollar spent on medical research, technological innovation, business investment, or any number of other private and public purposes. Nor is hiring, say, a potential doctor to spend a year surveying residents, handling paperwork, or replacing light bulbs necessarily a good deal -- in terms of economics or service.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, some waste is almost inevitable. Local organizations are not likely to use essentially "free" labor from the federal government as efficiently as if they had to cover the costs themselves, because staff members will be tempted to assign work they prefer not to do themselves to the subsidized outsiders. For example, in Orange County, California, the Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. used AmeriCorps personnel to solicit donations and handle paperwork. Corporation critics have, in fact, generated their own roll of waste to counter Wofford and Waldman's list of successes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another potentially important opportunity cost is the diversion of bright men and women from the military. The end of the Cold War has sharply cut recruiting requirements, but it has also reduced the perceived national need. As a result, the armed forces have had greater difficulty in attracting quality recruits. Yet various programs of educational benefits have always been an important vehicle for drawing college-capable youth into the military. Providing similar benefits for civilian service is likely to hinder recruiting for what remains the most fundamental form of national service -- defending the nation. Surveys have found that a majority of potential recruits would consider joining AmeriCorps rather than the armed forces because they see it as a better way to gain educational assistance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If AmeriCorps is not the answer, what is? First, government barriers in the way of private individuals and groups who want to help should be torn down. Minimum-wage laws effectively forbid the hiring of dedicated but unskilled people; every increase makes this problem worse. Restrictions on paratransit operations limit private transportation for the disabled. Regulations also hinder other forms of volunteerism. Unnecessary health department restrictions prevent restaurants in Los Angeles and elsewhere from donating food to the hungry, for instance. In short, in many cases important needs are unmet precisely because of perverse government policy.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, leaders throughout society, from lawmakers to clerics to philanthropists to corporate presidents, need to emphasize that the ultimate responsibility to help those in need lies with individuals, families, and communities, not government. They need to create a more traditional sense of compassion, the idea that charity requires personal commitment -- both in volunteering time and exercising careful stewardship over charitable contributions. This requires highlighting the needs of the disadvantaged and groups seeking to help the disadvantaged, and emphasizing that people can no longer act as if they "gave at the office" through government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, policymakers need to consider tax incentives, particularly tax credits for charitable donations, to encourage people to volunteer their money. A goal of $500 million in new contributions--a mere $2 a person and more than now spent by the Corporation -- might be a reasonable start.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, to the extent that serious social problems remain, government should use narrowly targeted responses to meet the most serious problems. That is, it would be better to find a way to attract several thousand people to help care for the terminally ill than to lump that task in with teaching, planting trees, changing light bulbs, administrative work, and scores of other jobs to be solved by a force of tens or hundreds of thousands. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps was created with the best of intentions. But the Corporation for National  Service cannot escape its statist heritage: it promotes service, but shifts the center of gravity in the volunteer community from civil to political society. What we need instead is a renewed commitment to individual service. People, in community with one another, need to help meet the many serious social problems that beset us. But private activism needs neither oversight nor subsidy from Uncle Sam. Some of the volunteerism can be part-time and some full-time; some can take place within the family, some within churches, and some within civic and community groups. Some may occur through profit-making ventures.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point is, there is no predetermined definition of service, pattern of appropriate involvement, set of "needs" to be met or tasks to be fulfilled. America's strength is its combination of humanitarian impulses, private association, and diversity. We need service, not "national service."<p><i><b>Doug Bandow</b> is a senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> and the author of several books, including</i> The Politics of Envy: Statism as Theology <i>(Transaction)</i>.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of all the passions that distort one's view of politics, the greatest, I think, is the desire for closure, the yearning for some golden moment at which it can be said, "Well, that's the end of that." The jury announcing its verdict, the emissaries of a defeated power signing the papers of unconditional surrender, the poker player beating a full house with four of a kind -- decisive and final.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he 104th Congress has learned that in politics there are no permanent victories - that the fat lady never sings</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps it's understandable. Our politics does have built-in cycles with closure of a sort, namely, elections. Every four years, we have an opportunity to elect a new president or affirm the tenure of the one we have; every two years, we have a new Congress. And the outcome of these elections is rarely ambiguous. Candidate A wins or loses. The <a href="http://www.house.gov">House</a> has this many Republicans and that many Democrats. Moreover, the legislative process itself has various endpoints: the moments after the committee report and the floor vote and the conference and the bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden, just as the civics textbooks say.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even here, closure in politics is overblown. In politics, little is ever settled once and for all. The day after the election is the first day of the next election cycle. So you got a bill passed? Fine. Now an army of bureaucrats will begin writing the regulations and other means of enforcing it; the courts will begin pondering its meaning; the lawmakers themselves, aided by an army of lobbyists and other interested parties, will prepare for the next go-round. Politics ebbs and flows. Victory and defeat are never permanent. "Endism"--the yearning for closure--often amounts to substituting one's political fantasies for reality.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The essential fact of the 104th Congress is that, as the first GOP Congress in 40 years, it did not live up to the expectations it helped create. Many of its members rode into town two years ago promising nothing less than "revolution." But the budget is not balanced, nor is there a constitutional amendment requiring that it be balanced. There has been no tax relief for families with children, no cut in the capital-gains tax rate, no expanded Individual Retirement Accounts. Nor have we seen fundamental reform in Medicaid for the poor and Medicare for the elderly: Most of the vast entitlement apparatus stands untouched. Broad regulatory relief remains elusive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Was the 104th Congress, then, a failure? The position of the Democratic Party sounds like this: The Republicans vastly misinterpreted the results of the 1994 elections that brought them to power. They claimed a broad mandate for change where none existed. Moreover, they were never candid about the specifics of the changes they intended to make. Once the details began to emerge, in the Democratic view, the American people recoiled from the Republicans' extremist positions. Popular opinion turned against this new Congress and its living embodiment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Republican expectations that their party would sweep the 1995 off-year elections turned out to be wrong. President Clinton stood up to the GOP legislative blackmail represented by two shutdowns of the federal government. The people responded by supporting him in opinion polls. The Republicans, reeling and desperate, finally gave up. Democrats prepared to take their case to the people in the fall elections, with an excellent chance, they say, of retaining the White House and regaining the Congress, as people think more about what GOP bombthrowers have been trying to do to American society and government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This telling is also the version offered by the establishment media. I will leave it to future historians to determine whether the Democratic line and the establishment media's analysis coincide so well because they simply reflect the truth of the situation, or for some other reason. You can also hear this interpretation in certain Republican circles, such as when Al D'Amato launched his celebrated screed against Gingrich, his Contract, and GOP extremism in the spring of 1996. Boiled down, the theme of this argument is: game over. Republicans had their chance, they blew it, and that's the end of that.<p><table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But, in fact, it's not the end of that. Before too long, Democrats will likely be reminded of the fallacy of endism. Even if Republicans lose  this November, they are not going to fold their tent and go away. Novels may have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but politics is a perpetual middle.</td><td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he essential fact of the 104th Congress is that it did not live up to the expectations it helped create</h3><hr width=75></td>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans recently suffered their own brutal lesson in the fallacy of endism. Weren't the Democrats finished, kaput, toast, less than two years ago? Wasn't the Democratic president trying to persuade everybody (including, it seemed, himself) of his own relevance? Wasn't the juggernaut of popular opinion that swept the GOP in and the Democrats out going to overpower whatever feeble resistance might be offered by a weak, rudderless, scandal-plagued administration? And wasn't this all merely prologue to the completion of the, well, Revolution--in 1996, when Americans would surely elect a Republican to the White House and all good things would be in legislative reach? And doesn't that all seem a bit naive just now?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Surely it was unrealistic to expect a true revolution as long as President Clinton occupied the White House, Senate Democrats wielded the power of the filibuster, and House Republicans held only a slim majority. But judged by more modest standards, Republicans in the 104th Congress actually achieved a great deal. And the chief obstacle to the rest of their agenda was Bill Clinton and his veto pen. Didn't get your tax cut? Talk to Clinton. Budget not balanced? Clinton didn't want to balance it. Federal regulators and a legal system still out of control? Clinton vetoed changes. Medicare careening toward insolvency? Been there, vetoed that.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans can also muster a fairly decent <a href="/heritage/congress">list of things</a> they did manage to get through. The biggest one was surely a welfare overhaul in the form of a broad "devolution" of responsibility to the states. This was, in fact, transforming legislation, an end to a federal entitlement program that was for 30 years <i>the</i> symbol of the promise and failure of the War on Poverty.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In addition, the president now has a line-item veto, which Democratic Congresses repeatedly refused to give Ronald Reagan. The candidate elected in November will be the first president with the power to use it. Congress also completed a massive revision of telecommunications law, which ought to open up some promising technological vistas and provide more competition in cable, broadcasting, telephone, and information services.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To everyone's surprise, the vast, centralized apparatus of American agricultural policy was significantly reformed in the Freedom to Farm Act. In lieu of the complicated formulas and procedures that determine how much wheat, corn, rice, and cotton -- the four major "program crops" -- farmers can plant and sell, growers will get a declining subsidy over five years (based on the level of their previous payments from Washington) and freedom to plant crops as they see fit.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">W</font>as it realistic to expect a true revolution with Bill Clinton in the White House, Democrats filibustering in the Senate, and the GOP holding a slim majority in the House? </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress overrode a presidential veto of securities-litigation reform designed to protect companies from unreasonable class-action lawsuits when their stock price declines. The antiterrorism bill provided a vehicle for streamlining the use of habeas corpus in federal death penalty appeals. And, of course, the national speed limit is history.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At this writing, there are a couple of other possibilities for significant legislation. Passage of an immigration-reform bill containing sharp restrictions on illegal immigration -- but surprisingly unnativist on legal immigrants -- seems imminent, and the president is widely expected to sign it. There is also a possibility of legislation designed to make health insurance more portable, including a provision for a small experiment with Medical Savings Accounts. And, ahem, how about that minimum-wage increase?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No, this record doesn't add up to a revolution. It hasn't transformed the policy landscape to resemble maps designed by Republicans. On the other hand, the 104th Congress has nothing to be ashamed of. This is a solid record of legislative achievement. And Republicans are right to say that the achievement would have been much greater had it not been for the president's rather sudden display of backbone, starting in the late fall of 1995. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That resolve may have been precisely the quality Americans wanted to see in a president whose fecklessness had become something of a national joke, and they rewarded him with higher approval ratings. On the other hand, the president did pass up at least one historic opportunity. As Senator John Ashcroft, the freshman Republican from Missouri, has observed, every president goes to bed at night praying that Congress will announce some major entitlement reform the next day. Even modest changes in entitlement programs usually require blue-ribbon commissions to provide political cover. But this Congress offered two -- not only welfare reform, which Clinton would go along with only the third time a bill landed on his desk, but also a much more politically tricky Medicare fix. The president walked away from Medicare, even though he and his advisers knew the insolvency of the program is certain in the absence of program changes. The White House shamelessly protested the horrific Republican "cuts" in Medicare -- make that "gutting," "slashing," and "destroying" Medicare. The opinion polls favored the president. But they would likely have continued to do so even if he had actually chosen to behave constructively. Clinton could have split the rather small difference with Republicans and anointed himself the savior of Medicare--not only from bankruptcy, but also from heartless Republicans eager to slash it to pay for tax cuts for the rich. For the White House, though, relentless counterattack was the order of the day. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Besides welfare reform, the Republican Congress got the president to agree to something truly extraordinary in one other area: discretionary (that is, nonentitlement) spending. This is the part of government determined each year through the appropriations process--the 11 big bills that fund the operations of the government itself, and without which (or some other mechanism agreeable to Congress and the president) we get a shutdown. Clinton vetoed a number of these bills and signed only a couple, but the shutdowns led to the other spending mechanism, the "continuing resolution" that set spending levels for all programs where appropriations bills had gone unsigned. To that measure Clinton attached his signature.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Every year since 1969, spending in the domestic (that is, nonmilitary) discretionary category has increased. (Military spending has had its ups and downs and is now in a sharp decline that has been partially ameliorated by the GOP). That changed in fiscal 1996. The Republican Congress actually did cut spending--not reductions in the rate of increase, not "cuts" against a rising baseline, not "cuts" after adjusting for inflation, but genuine reductions. Domestic discretionary spending was $246 billion in fiscal 1995 and $223 billion in fiscal 1996.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By contrast, the Clinton administration wanted to spend $30 billion more in 1996 than 1995, instead of $17 billion less. The proposed Clinton budget for the year would have yielded a deficit of $211 billion. Current projections from the Congressional Budget Office show a fiscal 1996 deficit of $117 billion. Economic growth that exceeded projections account for some of this difference. But more than half is the result of cuts in domestic discretionary spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ronald D. Utt</a> of The Heritage Foundation has noted, appropriators achieved these savings in part by eliminating some 200 government programs and scaling back many others. The cynical conventional view of Washington has long held that the closest thing to eternal life in this world is a federal government program. Well, good riddance to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (to say nothing of the welfare entitlement).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The discouraging thing is that this $23 billion in savings came out of a federal budget totaling $1.57 trillion, up (thanks to entitlements) from $1.52 trillion last year. In short, the cuts amounted to less than 1.5 percent of total spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And yet this truly was a reversal of a course that had been followed for 26 years. Surely it means something when a Democratic president declares in his State of the Union address that "the era of Big Government is over." Surely, as well, it means something when that same president tacks sharply to the right as he takes his case for re-election to the voters.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This has been the real Republican solace in the face of frustration during the 104th Congress. The terms of the debate have changed, Republicans tell themselves. America is, undeniably, a conservative country now. Democrats recognize that the old-fashioned, liberal, Big Government agenda is now a loser, and they know that to survive politically, they must run as conservatives. They may, for a time, be able to get away with running right and governing left, as Clinton is trying to do. But eventually their own record will catch up with them, and voters will select the real thing rather than the ersatz version.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I think there is much truth to this analysis, but there is something about it that bothers me, and that is its endism. William F. Buckley Jr. once wrote, famously, that the conservative mission is "to stand athwart history, shouting 'Stop!'" I have long thought that the problem with this formulation is that history isn't listening. And now conservatives are erring in the other direction, rushing to the conclusion that they represent the future. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The spending cuts of fiscal 1996 and the advertised end of the era of Big Government are remarkable achievements. But there is nothing permanent about them, and Republicans are deluding themselves if they think otherwise. It is pleasant, in some sense, to think that large forces are at one's back -- certainly more pleasant than the experience of swimming upstream, with which conservatives are plenty familiar. And if public-opinion polls mean anything, the electorate is clearly more responsive to conservative proposals for solving problems than to huge new government bureaucracies. Yet this does not spare Republicans the responsibility and drudgery of fighting, fighting, fighting the daily battles of practical politics, against those who would like government to assume even more control over the lives of the American people. The measure of victory is not just the passage of vast, transforming legislation but also the extinguishing of the lights at the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most compelling problem of practical politics for Republicans is that they are not as popular right now as they imagined they would be. Whether this decline in popularity threatens their hold on Congress, whether the Democrats have really gained at their expense, whether the electorate in 1994 saw its choices for Congress as a choice between national policies, and whether 1996 will also be such an election--these are all questions that will be "settled" in November. In other words, we will argue about them for years.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The question for Republicans is how to rebuild their popularity. To answer that question, Republicans must first understand why their popularity rose and fell in the first place. Republicans often claim that by the end of last year, their message had gotten lost--lost in the obsessive focus on balancing the federal budget within seven years. Republicans took popular support for granted and lost sight of the need to explain why the budget had to be balanced. Some add that the message got lost in a media culture that has never understood the Republican agenda and remains hostile to it. In addition, the Clinton administration lied about what Republicans were actually proposing. The solution, in this analysis, is to figure out better ways of both framing the message and communicating it to the people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Others have argued that the message was fundamentally flawed from the outset. The supply-side faction of the party, for example, has excoriated the Contract With America for failing to articulate a Reagan-Forbes-Kemp message of hope, growth, and opportunity--and never mind the budget deficit. Still others have said that the message was wrong because it is, as Democrats charged, too extreme. Why make sweeping changes in regulatory policy in areas where most people have come to trust the government -- clean water, clean air, and safe food and drugs?<p>

<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But I think the biggest problem came from the heady sense of victory following the 1994 elections: We win, they lose; the people are with us, the people are against them. And that's the way it is. Republicans in the House worked very hard on a plan for governing if they should find themselves in power. They studied the House's Democratic masters with care, fashioned a strategy for seizing a majority, and crafted a legislative agenda that they believed reflected the wishes of most Americans. When they finally won, they did what they had set out to do. The Senate is a very different place, less a stranger to Republican control but at the same time less susceptible to control altogether. Yet the Republican Senate went along, too.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And then . . . they didn't win it all. They did not get everything or even most of the things they wanted. They faced an opposition that did not always fight fair. And the American electorate, whom they thought they had squarely behind them, turned out not to be. Republicans retreated, they regrouped, they recriminated, they refought the battles they had won and the battles they had lost to try to figure out why. And they returned to fight another day, with this change in strategy and that change in tactics, and they recognized that the pursuit of total victory is dangerous when it comes unmoored from the daily business of democratic politics, which is to keep things moving your way while pleasing people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans learned that there is always another day, that this is not a game of chess or a mystery novel, but rather politics, in which nothing is ever settled once and for all and in which the illusion that things are can be your undoing. And that was the greatest accomplishment of the Republicans of the 104th Congress. They learned that in politics there are no permanent victories, that the fat lady never sings. And whether they hang on to Congress in 1996 or return to power in 1998 or later, this wisdom will be essential if they are to govern.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What

can government do, if anything, to make sure that the overwhelming majority of American children grow up with a mother and father?" <i>Policy Review</i> asked a number of family experts across the political spectrum to address this question, considering state and local government as well as the federal government. <p><hr><p>

<b><i> Encourage Parental Involvement </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In the classic movie <i>King Kong</i>, the giant ape lifts the tiny heroine into his hairy hands with a puzzled look on his face, as if to say, "She's small and cute, but now what do I do with her?" Similarly, what can or should that giant leviathan known as "government" do to provide children with parental guidance? My first thought is the same one I had when I saw the massive Kong delicately hold the fragile heroine: "I hope he doesn't hurt her."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government should always keep in mind that no one loves children more than their parents. There are many in Washington who believe otherwise, and think that <i>they</i> know what's best for your children. The best thing that government can do to ensure children grow up with a mother and father is to recognize that parents -- both a mother <i>and</i> a father -- are fundamental to a child's upbringing in the first place.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government needs to encourage and solicit -- not frustrate -- parental involvement in the education of children. In the early 1930s, there were more than 130,000 school boards in the United States. Today, there are fewer than 15,000. We need to encourage parental participation by restoring local school boards for each and every school and empowering them -- together with faculty and administrators -- to determine educational policies and curricula. We must also enact school choice and voucher plans to give parents more control over their children's education.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Finally, we must stem the tide of divorce, including so-called "no-fault divorce." Nothing harms children more than losing the support and involvement of either parent, a frequent result of divorce. We should give the institution of marriage greater respect and protection. A marriage ought to be difficult to enter and even more difficult to leave. How about requiring a waiting period before every wedding?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We need to acknowledge that government -- in any form -- can never provide what children need most: love. Only two people are qualified for that -- Mom and Dad.

<b><i> Revive the "Marriage Culture"</i></b>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A distressing number of children in this nation will go to bed tonight without the participation of both a mother <i>and</i> father in an important family ritual: reading a bedtime story, saying nighttime prayers, and being tucked in with reassuring goodnight kisses. This experience is more and more often a solo act for one reason: the slow death of a marriage culture. It is being replaced by a culture of divorce and illegitimacy, each of which now exists, for the first time in our nation's history, in equal proportion to their opposites. It is paramount that we re-establish an appreciation of the value and virtue of marriage, both for the individual and society. As recent history shows, this work cannot rest on the ever-expanding shoulders of government (also known to some as "the village").	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his report on the declining health of the black family in America, few authorities took his warning seriously -- except his boss, President Lyndon Johnson. Largely influenced by Moynihan's work, Johnson's "Great Society" swelled a small government bureaucracy of 45 domestic social programs to a leviathan of 435 by the end of his administration. Yet for all this "help," things have only gotten worse since then. What can be done?

-- James Dobson</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>



&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There are four obvious imperatives for government. First, it should clearly define marriage as a lifelong commitment between a man and woman. Second, states should reform no-fault divorce laws. Third, government should end our confiscatory tax structure, which undermines the financial stability of families. Our tax policy ought not merely level the playing field for married couples; we should actually <i>tilt it in their favor</i>. Fourth, the federal and state governments should reform welfare in order to end current incentives for conceiving children outside of marriage.
</td></tr></table>


	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But the real recovery of a marriage culture requires tools that the government doesn't possess or even recognize. Our nation needs both a vision for the purpose of marriage and the personal and spiritual resources to build strong unions. These can only be provided by our faith-based institutions, which are divinely commissioned and uniquely gifted to undertake this work. Without this vital contribution, many children will never enjoy the irreplaceable benefits of a home with a mother and a father. Consequently, society will suffer.<p><i>James Dobson, a psychologist, is the founder of Focus on the Family, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</i><p> 
<a name="engler"><b>Gov. John Engler</b></a><br>
<b><i> Acknowledge the Limits of Government</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government policy should follow the Hippocratic Oath. Government policies should in no way discourage the formation and preservation of families, nor add momentum to the powerful centrifugal forces breaking our families apart. Here are three reforms at the top of my list:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Tax reform. Government must reduce the tax burden on families and eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, real average weekly wages are 5.5 percent lower today than during the Reagan years. As a result, many families are in debt. Spouses are entering the work force to help make ends meet, and they raise total family income by about one-third. Yet these families must also pay almost 28 percent of their income to the federal government. In effect, mothers are having to work just to pay off Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is useful to put the burden on our families in historical perspective. In 1954, the last year Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, federal taxes amounted to less than the tithe to your local church -- 8 percent of total family income. Often one parent chose not to work. Today, however, few families are free to make that choice, and government tax policy has burdened them unnecessarily.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare Reform. Remember the stories about couples splitting up so welfare benefits would keep coming in? That was due to the "100-hour rule," which kept intact couples from working more than 100 hours per month. Unfortunately, it's still federal law. Michigan was one of the first states to apply for and receive a waiver from the federal government to exempt two-parent families from this destructive policy. The 100-hour rule is just one example of where federal welfare policy is wrong. Until states are free to undertake far-reaching reform, the system will continue to fail families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce reform. Because of the terrible impact of easy divorce on women and children, state lawmakers are taking a second look at their no-fault laws. In Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and a half-dozen other states, Republicans and Democrats alike are seeking to make the decision to get divorced a more considered one.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A national leader in turning back no-fault divorce has been Jessie Dalman, a Michigan state legislator. She has sponsored 12 bills that would deny a divorce if only one spouse wants it -- unless that spouse could prove infidelity, desertion, alcoholism, physical or mental abuse, or other serious problems. Her legislation would also require participation in a pre-divorce program for all parties in an uncontested divorce where young children are involved.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In addition, Dalman's legislation seeks to reduce the number of impulsive marriages by requiring a 30-day waiting period and encouraging every couple to receive counseling before their wedding day. A state marriage license would cost $20 for those who get counseling, $100 for those who do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that our society rethink the no-fault revolution. Over the past quarter-century, easy divorce laws have helped tear apart American families. As a society, it is time to refocus more on the needs of children and less on the desires of parents. We must make it harder for children to be victimized by a no-fault system that gives all the legal clout to the party that wants to break the marriage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that Washington acknowledge the limits of government. It never has been, nor will it ever be, a substitute for the family. Family renewal must, in the end, come from within the family. Despite well-publicized divorce statistics, I am hopeful that our nation can slow down the forces of disintegration. The brisk sales of works like <i>The Book of Virtues</i>, the recognition that "Dan Quayle was right," the growing impact of groups like Focus on the Family and Promise Keepers -- all these signs give me encouragement.

<b><i> Praise the Two-Parent Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first and most immediate task is to stop undermining the two-parent family. Whatever government subsidizes, it will be inundated with. In the 1930s, when government subsidized pigs, the Midwest was up to its hips in pigs. Today, we are subsidizing illegitimate children, and the result is a social catastrophe.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government ought to dismantle every welfare program that promotes single-parent families. The litmus test is simple: Any program that encourages out-of-wedlock births and supplants fathers should be eliminated. Next, government should aggressively <i>promote</i> two-parent families. The Bible says that rulers have been established "for the praise of those who do good" (1 Peter 2:14, NKJV). Here are a few ways government can "praise" the two-parent family:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make divorce more difficult to obtain. Reduce the tax burden on the family. Defend traditional (one man, one woman) marriage. Uphold parental authority over children. Empower parents with educational choice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A century ago, the Supreme Court called the traditional two-parent family "the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement" (<i>Murphy v. Ramsey</i> [1885]). I pray for leaders at all levels to have the wisdom -- and the courage -- to stand on such principles today.

<b><i> Remove Perverse Incentives </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government must encourage families to come together and stay together through cultural, not governmental, pressures. The most important role for government is to remove the perverse incentives of the welfare state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current policy encourages parents to abdicate financial and moral responsibility for their children to the government. Our entitlement system induces some irresponsible fathers to abandon their families, cavalierly confident that government will step in. If we resist the temptation to cure every societal ill with more government programs, I believe parental influence and responsibility will fill the void. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We must weed out invasive government policies, so that our culture can recuperate. Our current welfare system penalizes marriage and work and fosters dependency, and it must be reformed. We should also eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. In addition, we should modernize 60-year-old labor laws to grant working parents the opportunity for flexible work schedules, so that families can spend more time with their children.

<b><i> A Modest Role</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We should be appropriately modest about the role of government in promoting family stability. Current rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth reflect deep cultural changes over which law and public policy have limited influence. Still, there are some responsible steps government at various levels should take.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reducing out-of-wedlock birth. In the past decade, several promising programs to reduce pregnancy among unmarried young people have been developed at the local level. The federal government should create -- or help the nonprofit sector create -- a clearinghouse to inventory these programs, evaluate them rigorously, and provide reliable information to states, localities, and community-based organizations. Since recent research suggests a connection between the welfare system and out-of-wedlock birth, welfare reform should permit states to adopt new policies that reduce perverse incentives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Making marriage pay. The federal tax code tilts against families. To correct this, we should dramatically increase the dependent exemption for young children and do what we can to eliminate the marriage penalty. In addition, tax credits for education and training should be made available to parents who leave the paid work force for extended periods to care for young children and then seek to return.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Restricting divorce. States should reshape their laws of divorce to make divorce more difficult when minor children are involved. I favor the elimination of unilateral no-fault in such cases, with the alternative of a five-year waiting period. In addition, as Maggie Gallagher, Elizabeth Scott, and others have suggested, states should stand behind the premarital agreements of couples who wish to make their own marriages harder to dissolve than state law requires.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Can government do anything to reverse the trend of fatherlessness? Yes. Reform no-fault divorce laws, eliminating the right to unilateral divorce on demand. Lengthen waiting periods for divorce. Create financial and other incentives for engaged couples to participate in marriage preparation and for couples with troubled marriages to get counseling.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reform school curricula that trivialize or denigrate marriage. Stop the practice of mainstreaming pregnant girls and teen mothers through the school system. Prohibit boys who impregnate girls from participating in sports and other extracurricular school programs. Enforce statutory rape laws. Put the current welfare system out of its misery and replace it with public and private efforts, including faith-based initiatives, that embody effective compassion and promote marriage.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate the antimarriage bias in the Earned Income Tax Credit. Increase the value of the marriage deduction in the tax code. Calculate child-oriented tax exemptions and credits on a per-parent basis -- that is, permit households with two parents twice the exemption and credit value of one-parent households.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Give priority to married couples in public housing. Reform adoption laws and procedures so that more children will be adopted, sooner, by married couples. Appoint and hire people who will publicly insist that unwed childbearing is wrong, that our divorce rate is far too high, and that our society should dedicate itself to increasing the proportion of our children who grow up with their two married parents.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	The real question is not whether we know what would work, but whether we want to do what would work.<p><i>David Blankenhorn is the president of the Institute for American Values and the author of </i>Fatherless America<i> (<a href="http://www.harpercollins.com">HarperCollins</a>).</i><p><a name="quayle"><b> Dan Quayle </b></a><br>
<b><i> Preserve, Protect, Defend the Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	There is no question government has a role, albeit a minor one, to play in strengthening families. In recent years, the real problem in our society hasn't been so much that families have failed but that government has failed to act in the best interest of families. Some common-sense reforms would do much to correct the government's anti-family bias.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Taxes. The government could and should immediately repeal the marriage penalty, increase the tax exemption for children and index it for inflation, and repeal regulations prohibiting employers from paying "family wages." As a long-term solution, I support a modified flat tax that maintains the deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce. States should reassess their "no-fault" divorce laws, and make children's interests paramount in divorce proceedings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare. We should scrap our current system, which encourages illegitimacy and discourages work, in favor of new ways to help those truly in need. Senator Dan Coats's "Project for American Renewal" is a good place to start.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Adoption. The House of Representatives has passed reforms removing barriers to interracial adoption and making adoption easier in general. The Senate should pass this bill and send it to the president.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We also desperately need help from nongovernment institutions like the media and the entertainment community. They have a tremendous influence on our culture and they should join in when it comes to strengthening families. <p><i>Dan Quayle, the 44th vice president of the United States, is the chairman of Campaign America.</i><p><a name="weyrich"><b> Paul M.

<b><i> Reverse an Anti-Marriage Bias </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In 1987, the Free Congress Foundation pioneered the development of cultural conservatism with a book called <i>Cultural Conservatism: Toward a New National Agenda</i>, by William S. Lind and William H. Marshner. This book suggests that, to strengthen American families, government could:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Raise the personal exemption (for dependents only) to its original, 1948 value, which in today's dollars would be more than $6,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make the child-care credit universal, so parents who care for their own children receive the same benefits as those who send their kids to day care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Permit employers to offer a "family wage," that is, a higher wage to heads of families. The family wage was a major Victorian reform that was made illegal by a Department of Labor regulation issued in 1966.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate "no-fault" divorce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Assign children their own guardian <i>ad litem</i> in any divorce proceeding. The guardian would represent the children's interest in having the parents stay together.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Limit cash welfare benefits to intact families and offer "matching grants" to heads of intact families with full-time jobs whose income is insufficient to support a family.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Fund programs in which volunteers build homes for sale (not rent) to the poor, with the proviso that these homes may only be sold to intact families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current government policies reflect a consistent bias against traditional families. The proposals above depend upon the willingness of those who make government policy to favor such families and regard them as essential to the nation's future. In the face of the influence of "political correctness" (which is to say, cultural Marxism) in both political parties, that most basic change will be the most difficult to bring about.

<b><i> Do No Harm </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first obligation is to do no harm. For 60 years, Big Government has engaged in massive intrusion into the family -- with disastrous consequences. It is time to get out of the way. <p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	What the government should not do has been obvious to conservatives for many years. It should not maintain a tax system that punishes two-parent families and forces both parents to work; it should not grant "no-fault" divorces more readily than drivers' licenses; and it should not maintain a welfare system that rewards illegitimacy and punishes women who get married.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Ronald Reagan used to say that "government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them." Social engineering, whether done by liberals or conservatives, is still social engineering. Imagine the horrific programs the federal bureaucracy would create to "help" the family. First, it would redefine "family," then "mothers," then "fathers." Could they really even settle on a definition of a child? <p><i>Kay James is the dean of the Robertson School of Government at <a href="http://www.regent.edu/">Regent University</a>, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</i><p>

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Judy Hooper has two passions in life: doughnuts and the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA).Hooper loves doughnuts. That's one of the reasons she opened a bakery in Evanston, Illinois. It's a small shop, bringing in about $50,000 in profits annually. That's not enough to make her rich, but the challenge of running a small business and her talent for baking keep this 35-year-old Chicago native busy.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Ask Hooper about OSHA, however, and her face glazes over with disdain. A 1994 inspection of her 30-person bakery by OSHA officials left Hooper with $13,000 in frivolous fines. Her infractions included a failure to warn employees of the hazards of household dishwashing liquid. To recoup the cost of the fines, she would have to sell 260,000 doughnuts, or 10,400 cakes, or 1,040,000 cookies.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The national news media picked up her story, but OSHA refused to back down. So has Hooper. Though she paid the fine, she hopes to file a class-action suit against the federal agency, and is trying to enlist other OSHA victims to help her cause. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
She will find plenty of recruits. The bakery owner joins millions of women entrepreneurs across the country who are finding out just how intrusive Big Government can be. Indeed, one of the most overlooked issues in this campaign season is how the rising number of women business owners -- a third of all U.S. firms -- are being beaten down by Washington's overbearing laws, inflexible regulations, and arcane tax policies.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If they mobilized, these women could be a potent force. The National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) reports that the number of women-owned businesses in the United States will reach 8 million this year, employing more than 18.5 million people and generating more than $2.28 trillion in gross sales. Over the last nine years, NFWBO estimates, the number of women-owned firms has increased 78 percent. "The growth in the number of women-owned businesses continues to be dramatic across the nation," says Julie R. Weeks, NFWBO's director of research. But <a href="http://www.house.gov/myrick/">Sue Myrick</a>, a first-term Republican congresswoman from North Carolina and a former small-business owner, knows first-hand how Big Government threatens this growth: "Most government-imposed regulations are duplicative, expensive, and time-consuming," she says. "If not checked, regulations can cripple a small-business owner's ability to compete in the marketplace."

<p><b>Attack on Nurses</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Consider Arlene Kaplan's Heart to Home, Inc., a New York company that provides skilled nurses for patients needing home health care. To accommodate their unpredictable hours, Heart to Home hires nurses as independent contractors. That means the nurses pay their own state, federal, and Social Security taxes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For the 70 nurses working for Kaplan -- and the thousands of others who labor as independent contractors in health care -- their employment status buys them flexibility. They are free to schedule their work around their families and other commitments, working anywhere from 5-hour to 60-hour weeks as needed. For the home health-care industry, independent contractors deliver affordable, quality care on demand.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But to the <a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS</a>, the independent contractors who find jobs through Kaplan's company aren't independent enough. Based on a 20-point litmus test, IRS officials determined in a 1990 audit that Heart to Home's nurses legally were not independent contractors, but employees. Kaplan's business was assessed $250,000 in back taxes and fines for misrepresenting her workers to the IRS.
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Sandra Abalos, a CPA, the test is "so vague and so subjective" that even tax law practitioners cannot determine who is an employee and who is an independent contractor. Heart to Home's lawyer Barry Frank believes the IRS is "targeting small businesses" by frequently auditing those who hire independent contractors. In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines.
</td></tr></table><p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	So far Kaplan's business has accrued $20,000 in legal fees and expects another $40,000 in court costs when she goes up against the IRS later this year. Unlike most people engaged in legal jousting with this federal agency, however, Kaplan is the plaintiff: Through a complicated financial maneuver, she managed to sue the IRS.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If the government wins, they put me out of business," Kaplan says. "I don't own enough things in this entire world to pay off what they want from me." Even if Kaplan is successful, there is little hope she'll be reimbursed by the IRS for her legal fees. But forcing the agency to retreat would be a moral victory for her, and might make IRS agents a little less eager the next time around. Says Kaplan, "Maybe they will get off someone else's back in this business."<p><b>Tripping up Toddlers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The IRS, of course, retains no monopoly on crippling regulation. A few years ago, Virginia resident Tanya Wallace started a small business called Toddlin' Time, a playgroup for stay-at-home moms and their kids. When she decided to franchise her idea, however, she ran up against <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) regulations intended for larger companies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The FTC's "franchise rule" requires all companies, regardless of their size, to meet the same franchising requirements. So Toddlin' Time, which simply brings mothers and children together at dance studios and karate centers to play games, must meet the same auditing requirements as McDonald's, a company with billions of dollars in sales and operating costs, expensive equipment, and trained staff. 
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>It's just easier to walk away from the business, says Tanya Wallace, than to deal with all the government regulations</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	With just a few hours a week in administrative work, Toddlin' Time franchise owners can earn around $14,000 per year by enrolling 50 kids for six-week sessions at $36 per child. Wallace sees her idea as an excellent opportunity to combine family and business in a way that "feels comfortable to home-based women." The business gives kids a regular time and place to play together while stay-at-home moms get to know each other. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It's an easy concept to market. But FTC franchising rules have stopped Wallace cold. To comply, she had to expend $15,000 in auditing and lawyers' fees just to become a licensed franchiser. But Wallace couldn't pass these high start-up costs along to the moms interested in Toddlin' Time, so she marketed her franchise below cost. That meant selling four franchising chains just to break even. Yet the fees did not end when her start-up was complete. The FTC requires franchise operators to update their financial statements every year and demands yearly audits to verify the changes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're not a big company," Wallace explains. "We can't afford the two or three or four thousand dollars each year to [prepare] FTC financial statements."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	After six years and 10 successful Toddlin' Time franchises, Wallace is putting the brakes on further expansion. She says she simply can't afford the fees and regulations. Despite these setbacks, Wallace has not totally given up on the idea of Toddlin' Time. She is pursuing a consulting practice to spread her idea, though not her logo, to moms around the nation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"There is little that you can do when you're up against Big Government and government regulations," she says. "It's easier to walk away, unfortunately, than to deal with all the regulations and expectations they have for you."<p><b>The Disablers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	When it comes to federal regulations like the Americans with Disabilities Act, however, walking away is not an option. Ask Karla Hauk. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	She and her husband and business partner, Richard Hauk, opened a 32-room Days Inn franchise in Wall, South Dakota. That was on July 1, 1993, about six months after the ADA went into effect. They thought they were ready: Following their franchiser-approved plans, they made two of their 32 rooms accessible to handicapped patrons and made the entrance of their motel accessible to wheelchairs. When they opened their doors, they became the first motel in Wall to provide rooms with accommodations for the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Their reward? Karla, Richard, their architect, their contractor, and their franchiser all are being sued by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">U.S. Justice Department</a> for failure to comply with ADA regulations. They are charged with "unlawful discrimination" toward individuals with disabilities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It all started with a whirlpool. According to the Justice Department's suit, the Hauks' two-story motel became a three-story facility when they installed a whirlpool in the basement. ADA regulations require that their motel have an elevator so that handicapped customers can reach every floor, as well as a ramp leading to the whirlpool. According to Karla Hauk, installing the elevator alone would cost more than $100,000, not including the increase in property taxes. Even if the owners removed the whirlpool and left the basement empty, they would still be required to build an elevator for handicapped access, because the Justice Department has declared the basement "occupiable space."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In addition to the elevator, the ADA requires the Hauks to widen all of the bathroom doors in the nonhandicapped rooms. "If someone who uses a wheelchair . . . visits another guest in a non-accessible guest room, he or she will not be able even to enter the bathroom in that room," according to the suit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Changing the building's design after the fact looks nearly impossible. "Structurally we don't know how you can do it," says Hauks' lawyer Kim Ruckdaschel-Haley. "What do you do, just knock the place down and start over?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Karla Hauk says she believes there should be provisions for the handicapped, but that "a lot of this is unreasonable." She says if they had known then what they know now, they never would have built the motel. "We wish to God we never had. They will bankrupt us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Because the Hauks' business is dependent upon the seasonal tourist traffic at nearby Badlands National Park, they bring in profits of only $20,000 to $25,000 a year. "If Karla and Richard have to fight this, they'll have to go out of business," says their lawyer. In addition to substantial costs to comply with the ADA regulations, the co-owners could each be fined $50,000 by the Justice Department. When the ADA went into effect, it was unclear how the law would be implemented, says Ruckdaschel-Haley. "Karla and Richard in good faith thought they were doing everything they could."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For ADA bureaucrats, it seems, everything is not enough. So says Debbie Shaffer, owner of an interior design firm in Walla Walla, Washington. Shaffer wanted to move her eight-year-old company, DGS Interiors, out of her home and into a downtown storefront to expand her business. The proposed Main Street site consisted of a 1,500 square-foot main floor for retail sales, with a raised mezzanine to serve as both a design studio and an administrative office.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The problem? Contractors familiar with ADA regulations informed Shaffer that she had two options in bringing the bi-level facility up to code: either build an elevator to make the second floor accessible to the handicapped, or illogically and wastefully duplicate the design studio on the showroom floor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If a handicapped client wanted a design consultation, Shaffer says, she could easily accommodate their needs by bringing her portable decorating samples down to the lower level. But this was not good enough: According to the ADA, this special treatment would unfairly discriminate against the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	To comply with the ADA codes, Shaffer would have to spend $150,000 to install an elevator, build handicapped bathrooms, and widen all of the building entrances and doorways. These costs were in addition to her other remodeling expenses. "I have a great amount of support for people with any kind of disability," she says, having grown up with a sister who is deaf. "But the government steps in and takes it too far."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The results? "As a small business owner, it was black and white," Shaffer explains. "I couldn't afford it." Shaffer believes the downtown location could have increased her business by 50 percent, but because the regulations were "too overwhelming, with too many hoops to jump through," she was forced to scrap her plans to expand.<p><b>Doughnut Holes</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If the ADA's regulatory reach can be breathtakingly broad and intrusive, its rival in the universe of federal agencies is <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a>. Over the last two fiscal years, OSHA has recorded 234,409 violations and assessed over $158 million in fines.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Responding to complaints by a disgruntled employee, OSHA held a three-hour inspection of Judy's Bakery, the Illinois mom-and-pop operation cited above. Nothing could have prepared Judy Hooper for OSHA's report, which cited her for, among other things:<ol>	<p><li>Failing to have a written "Material Safety Data Sheet" for "hazardous" chemicals used at the bakery. The only chemicals used at Judy's Bakery are household bleach and the sort of pink dishwashing liquid used in many homes. Both "chemicals" have clearly marked warning labels. OSHA was unmoved. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have a written plan for emergencies such as a fire. Hooper's shop, which is on the first floor and has four clearly marked exits, is inspected twice a year by the Evanston fire department. Local fire officials had never found any potential safety problems. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have an accident log on the shop's wall. At the time, her company had never had an accident requiring a workmen's compensation claim. The officials said this was irrelevant and argued that even if the log contained all zeroes (one for each day without accidents), it must still be hung on the wall. Fine: $500.	</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
At her informal settlement hearing with OSHA officials, Hooper was able to negotiate the fines down from $13,000 to $5,450. The catch was that Hooper was required to spend the balance of the fines due--approximately $7,500--on safety and health programs for her employees and to present proof that she had complied. Ironically, none of the citations was related to the employee's complaints, which were found to be baseless.<p><b>The Gentle Scrub Jay</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It was not the safety of employees that concerned the government officials who intruded into Anita Cragg's business, but the safety of the Florida scrub jay.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	 Cragg, the owner and president of Space Coast Management Services, Inc., bought an existing subdivision in Country Cove, Florida, in 1992, with plans to expand and build new homes adjacent the previously developed site. Cragg's permits were in order and some buyers were waiting to build and settle in.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Enter the scrub jay. While surveying for waterline extensions in 1993, officials from the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) noted two jays flying onto Cragg's lots. Under the Endangered Species Act, the scrub jay, a 12-inch-long, blue and gray crested jay, is listed as threatened. The officials claimed that Cragg's planned development posed a potential hazard to land "suitable for occupation by scrub jays" and suspended construction on the site.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Cragg, neither the USFWS, nor an independent environmental engineer hired by Cragg, could locate any scrub jay nests on her property. Her four-person company fought with officials from the USFWS for 18 months. Construction was frozen in the meantime, while Cragg's buyers had to continue paying real-estate taxes on the land.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Fish and Wildlife Service pushed Cragg into a corner. The agency forced her firm to purchase four acres off-site for every one on-site to compensate for the loss of potential scrub jay habitat. That little bargain cost her more than $100,000. It "didn't really help the scrub jay," she says, "because we really weren't hurting it in the first place."<p><b>An Irresistible Offer</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	From 1964 until 1979, most of the commercial garbage in Seattle was hauled to one landfill located on the Tulalip Indian reservation. The site was closed and cleaned up in 1979, getting a clean bill of health from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. For the next 16 years, there wasn't a whiff of trouble from Seattle's former commercial dump.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And then the EPA started talkin' trash: In 1995, the agency placed the Tulalip Landfill on the Superfund's National Priority List, a list reserved for the country's most serious hazardous waste sites. EPA Project Manager Cindy Colgate admitted that "sometimes we think a problem is taken care of when it's not."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Apparently, this was one of those times. Superfund legislation allows the EPA to retroactively assess liability for environmental clean-ups. So the agency is asking Seattle's commercial businesses for approximately $40 million to clean up the landfill a second time.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The EPA has made what it calls "settlement offers" to 208 Seattle companies, each of which hauled more than 200 tons of waste to the site. These offers allow companies the chance to "resolve their liability" by making payments of $11,070 to $185,497 to the EPA, according to Colgate. The official insists this "is not a fine," but instead an "agreement between the EPA and the parties which says we won't sue them regarding the site." It also protects the firms from third-party suits. Many attorneys are advising firms to pay the EPA and move on. So far, 187 parties have decided to settle rather than face EPA lawsuits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For some women-owned firms, the experience has been a primer on the power of federal agencies to impose their will. One such firm in Seattle, an import-export company whose owners asked not to be identified, agreed to pay their  $11,070 fine. In total, Seattle's business owners are forking over $8,130,610 to the EPA--at least $30 million short of its goal. Suzanne Burke, the president of the Fremont Dock Co., which was not named in the settlement, says she believes the 208 letters are "just the beginning," and fears her company may be next on the list. She says the $40 million Superfund cleanup is "an absolute horror for small businesses."

<p><b>Fighting Back</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	There may be some legislative help on the way for business owners. Congress is seeking to clarify the ambiguity over the tax status of independent contractors versus employees, which bedeviled business owner Arlene Kaplan. Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/christensen/welcome.html">Jon Christensen</a>, a Nebraska Republican, is sponsoring a bill to simplify IRS rules for independent contractors. A spokesman for Christensen says the bipartisan bill could pass this year. Oklahoma Republican <a href="http://www.senate.gov/member/ok/nickles/general/">Don Nickles</a> has introduced similar legislation in the Senate because, according to his spokesman, "hassle from the IRS" is the principal complaint from his constituents. 	<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But as more women start their own businesses, they are becoming more cynical about government's helping hand. Forty-seven percent of the women business owners surveyed in 1995 by the United States Trust Company believed that government policies had made things "a little worse or much worse" for their businesses. When asked to rate specific government policies, almost all of the female respondents (91 percent) said they feel most threatened by government-required paperwork, while 90 percent feel threatened by taxes on businesses, raw materials, final products, or services.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The bureaucrats contend they're changing the system. Several officials separately claimed OSHA's new and improved agency has purged archaic enforcement procedures, yet all cited the same case to prove their reform: "Instead of fining someone for not hanging one of our posters about workers' rights," they say, "we offer them a poster to hang." While this may be a first step in dismantling the adversarial relationship between employers and OSHA, it demonstrates how federal agencies are not getting the message from business owners across the country. What happens, one might ask, if they don't hang the poster?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Women business owners are bumping against a ceiling all right. But it isn't made of glass -- it's made of red tape.<p><i>Sheila A.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	California's Yuba County is getting ready to spend $12,000 this November on election materials that nobody will use. That's because the federal government forces local officials to print voting information in Spanish for every election.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Bilingual ballots are an enormous waste of county resources," says Frances Fairey, Yuba County's registrar of voters. In last March's primary election, this county north of Sacramento was forced to spend $17,411 on Spanish-language election materials. But, according to Fairey, "In my 16 years on this job, I have received only one request for Spanish literature from any of my constituents."

<tr width=80>

<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The biggest problem with bilingual ballots, however, is not that they go unused in Yuba County, but that they are used in so many other places. Thousands of Americans are voting in foreign languages, even though naturalized citizens are required to know English. The National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium estimates, for instance, that 31 percent of Chinese-American voters in New York City and 14 percent in San Francisco used some form of bilingual assistance in the November 1994 elections. Though these figures may be overstated, proportions anywhere near this magnitude are devastating to democracy. As Boston University president John Silber noted in congressional testimony last April, bilingual ballots "impose an unacceptable cost by degrading the very concept of the citizen to that of someone lost in a country whose public discourse is incomprehensible to him."</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A nation noted for its diversity needs certain instruments of unity to keep the <I>pluribus</I> from overrunning the <I>unum</I>. Our common citizenship is one such tool. Another, equally important, is the English language. It binds our multiethnic, multiracial, and multireligious society together. Not everyone need speak English all of the time, but it must be the <I>lingua franca</I> of civic life. Since the voting booth is one of the vital places in which citizens directly participate in democracy, it must be the official language of the election process.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is not, however, and political jurisdictions ranging from Yuba County to New York City can pin this mess on the perversion of voting-rights legislation. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 guaranteed blacks the right to vote in places, particularly the South, where they had been systematically blocked from electoral participation, often through the use of bogus "literacy tests." But as Manhattan Institute scholar Abigail Thernstrom has shown in her comprehensive book <I>Whose Votes Count?</I>, it did not take long for this important piece of civil rights legislation to expand in dangerous ways.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After the Act's passage in 1965, civil rights groups toiled to expand its authority. When the law came up for reauthorization in 1975, Hispanic organizations argued that English-language ballots were the equivalent of literacy tests. People whose first language was Spanish needed special protections in order to vote, they claimed, citing low turnout among Hispanics. This was sheer quackery. Literacy tests in the South were used for the fraudulent purpose of keeping blacks away from elections. Low Hispanic turnout was mainly due to the fact that so many Hispanics were not citizens and therefore ineligible to vote.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nevertheless, Congress sided with the activists. It required bilingual ballots in any political district where "language minorities" made up at least 5 percent of the total population and less than half of the district's citizens were either registered to vote or had voted in the 1972 presidential election. It also required that bilingual election materials be made available to voters in every county in which the language-minority population had an "illiteracy rate" -- meaning "failure to complete the 5th grade," a trait that includes many immigrants--above the national average. Interestingly, "language minorities" were not defined by language (a cultural characteristic), but by ancestry (a genetic one). The category included only "persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives, or of Spanish heritage." French Canadians living in Maine, the inhabitants of Little Italy in New York City, and the Pennsylvania Dutch received no special assistance. By the early 1990s, the foreign-language ballot provisions of federal voting-rights law applied to 68 jurisdictions in the United States.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bilingual-ballot mandate bloated even further in 1992, when Congress said that counties with more than 10,000 residents who speak the same language and who are not proficient in English must provide bilingual voting ballots, even if their potential users make up less than 5 percent of the overall population. This applied to heavily populated areas with large numbers of non-English-speaking residents, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco. To comply, New York City had to purchase new voting machinery because its old equipment did not have enough space for all the Chinese characters that the law said it must provide. Los Angeles County now offers ballots in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. In the three elections between November 1993 and November 1994, the county spent more than $1.2 million to print voting materials in these foreign tongues. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund has called this "a particularly small price to pay." This "small price" could have paid for a year's tuition at UCLA for 308 Los Angeles residents.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ballot initiatives are often worded very precisely. Will translations always convey the exact English-language meaning of every initiative? In a deliberative democracy, they must. On a 1993 New York ballot question, translators printed the Chinese character for "no" where it should have said "yes." More important, immigrant voters should not even need bilingual ballots. We have required naturalization applicants since 1907 to demonstrate English-language proficiency. In order to become citizens -- and thus gain the right to vote -- the foreign-born have to demonstrate the ability to speak, read, and write simple English. A handful of them are granted exemptions. Naturalization applicants who are over the age of 50 and have lived in the United States for 20 years do not have to meet the English requirement. But they only make up about 7 percent of all citizenship applicants. The other 93 percent have to pass the test. So why do we assume they lose their English skills on Election Day? Meanwhile, foreign-language voting sends one more message to immigrants that assimilation is not an important part of civil society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A popular antidote to bilingual ballots is declaring English the official language of the United States. But that is like declaring the bald eagle its official bird -- it's essentially symbolic. Many self-proclaimed official-English advocates in Congress have no intention of repealing foreign-language ballot laws or federal funding of bilingual education. When Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~stevens/">Ted Stevens</a> of Alaska opened hearings on an official-English bill last December, he proudly announced that "the bill does not affect existing laws which provide bilingual and native language instruction. Those statutes are integral parts of our national language policy." Message to civil rights activists: We're not going to change a thing.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a speech to the 1995 American Legion convention in Indianapolis, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole announced that "English must be recognized as America's official language." But he said nothing about bilingual ballots. As a senator in 1992, Dole voted to expand their use.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In August, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would repeal the federal government's unfunded bilingual ballot mandate by amending the Voting Rights Act. It would not deny local communities the right to print non-English voting materials, should they choose to pay for it themselves. Nor would it stop voters from taking punch cards into the election booth. No companion bill, however, has been introduced in the Senate. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is a long tradition in the United States of ethnic newspapers -- often printed in languages other than English -- providing political guidance to their readers in the form of sample ballots and visual aids that explain how to vote. In the absence of bilingual ballots, this practice could continue and expand. Perhaps we should also allow voters to bring a friend or relative into the booth, just as blind voters can do. The polling place would remain open to people who have trouble with English, but it also would remind them that English -- or even broken English -- is the common language of American democracy.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A year ago, a 16-year-old constituent of mine, Jeff Gardner, died from a lethal combination of "huffing" gasoline and smoking marijuana. After Jeff's death, his mother, who was aware of a much larger drug problem in the community, called a parent's meeting at the local high school. No one came. She told me her story and asked how her representative in Congress was going to help address the growing drug problem. It was a fair question, but I was not satisfied with the response I could give her. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress take seriously their responsibility to represent their constituents in Washington -- by legislating, by voting, and when appropriate, by securing federal funding for state and local concerns. Despite spending $13 billion annually on drug-control programs, however, drug abuse is rising dramatically among our youth.
<p>
<table width="160" align="left" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>We'll continue to lose the war on drugs until national politicians show local leadership</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A big part of the problem has been the president's failure to show any leadership on this issue (until his wise appointment of General Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar). In fact, President Clinton hurt the antidrug effort by cutting the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 full-time positions, by hiring a surgeon general who advocated legalization of drugs, by cutting funding for interdiction efforts, and by sending confusing messages about the stigma of illegal drug use. It is no surprise, then, that after dramatic reductions in drug use during the decade before Clinton took office, drug use has nearly doubled among teenagers during his administration. The evidence shows that <i>national leadership</i> is critical in reducing drug abuse.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeff's mother wanted that leadership, but in a manner that would help her in Goshen, Ohio. Spending more federal dollars on drug-control programs was unlikely to directly touch this mother's life. Neither would it encourage other parents in her community to address the drug problem. How could I really help? By rolling up my sleeves and providing leadership where it matters most--at the local community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress are in a unique position to mobilize people in their own communities. By the nature of our jobs, we deal with every sector of the districts we represent. We can also bring statewide and nationwide expertise and resources to bear on a problem. And we can draw the attention of news media that is so critical to educating and mobilizing neighborhoods to solve their toughest social problems. What I've initiated -- and what I'm challenging my colleagues in Congress to embrace -- is a new model of governance that recognizes the limitations of Washington-based solutions, while drawing on the resources of citizens locally.
<p>
<b>Cause for Alarm</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If there is any public-policy area that demands a new, more effective approach, it is drug abuse. Recent Gallup polls show that crime and drugs are Americans' top concerns. When you ask parents and children what is the most serious issue facing youth today, both groups cite drug abuse.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
National statistics show there is indeed cause for alarm. After a decade of progress in the war on drugs, the number of young people using drugs began to increase in 1992; use among young kids showed the sharpest increase. LSD use is now at its highest level since 1975, when it was first measured. Since 1992, the number of children between 12 and 17 using marijuana has nearly doubled. To put the problem in perspective, in the average class of 25 eighth-graders (13- and 14-year-olds), five are now using marijuana. And drug abuse is implicated in other social problems -- violent crime, dropout rates, and domestic violence, to name a few. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Greater Cincinnati has a drug problem that mirrors the startling national statistics. This region of the country experienced a similar decline in drug use in the 1980s. But by the early 1990s, it began to skyrocket. Why?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I'm convinced that the resurgence stems in part from the disappearance both of effective national leadership in the fight against drug use and of the media attention that usually follows such leadership. This attention is vital to teaching children that drug abuse is both dangerous and wrong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No one makes this point more authoritatively than Jim Burke, the chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. It was Burke's group in the 1980s that launched the most extensive and successful public-service campaign in the country. Burke also believes strongly that, while the message must emanate from our national leaders and engage the opinion shapers at every level, this issue is best addressed at the community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I decided we could not afford to wait for another tragedy to prompt us to action. Over the last year and a half, I have spearheaded an effort to establish the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati. This effort is not about flashy press conferences and slick brochures. It's a serious, long-term initiative that brings together for the first time community activists already involved in the antidrug effort, key business figures, religious leaders, the media, parents, young people, law enforcement officials, and others. Our aim is to develop and implement a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reduce drug abuse in our region.
<p>
<b>Mobilizing Citizens</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How do you start a coalition? First, you do a lot of listening at all levels -- to kids and parents, grass-roots activists, and state and national leaders in the field. Over an 18-month period, we led or helped organize countless meetings in all sorts of settings, from living rooms to classrooms, and from boardrooms to community centers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We made it clear through the amount of time we devoted to the effort--more than 1,000 man-hours over 18 months -- and through our inclusive, nonpartisan approach that this was not about re-election campaigns or shallow publicity. The reaction from the community to this new kind of leadership has so far been very positive. Every television station, every major radio station, the two daily newspapers, and our largest outdoor advertising company are all running antidrug public service announcements and ads. Some of the radio spots are from a popular local rock band. We know that such messages help reduce drug abuse, and Greater Cincinnati now has one of the most aggressive antidrug media campaigns in the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Such messages, however, are not enough. The data shows that most people who use drugs go to work every day. Also, work is a good place to find parents who need counsel on dealing with teenage drug use. So we had to engage businesses. We took an idea proposed by one of our national prevention experts and brought it to our coalition in Greater Cincinnati. The result? One of our largest health-care providers and the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation will offer, for the first time ever, financial discounts to businesses that adopt certified drug-free workplace programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The program makes sense. Businesses like it because health-care and workers' compensation coverage costs less. Health-care providers and the bureau like it because drug-free workplace programs do result in a healthier work force and fewer medical and workers' compensation claims. Communities like it because it helps keep workers drug free, encourages drug abusers to seek treatment, and educates people about the dangers of drug abuse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We also brought PRIDE, a premier national parents' group, to one of our school districts to train more than 600 parents in taking practical steps to keep their kids drug free. This training will be replicated in every school district in the region. Parents are signing up in droves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We mobilized our local clergy to incorporate an antidrug message in their sermons every six months and to follow up with an educational slide presentation that we developed. We have established a speakers' bureau to supplement the D.A.R.E. program in the schools, and to help get the message out in community centers and student clubs. The list of initiatives proposed by the local community, brought to the coalition by state and national leaders, and facilitated by congressional leadership, goes on and on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition, I have brought to Greater Cincinnati national and state prevention experts to bolster the local effort, including the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education. I have also brought the president's drug czar, Senator Bob Dole, and Speaker Newt Gingrich to Cincinnati to see the coalition's work firsthand.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The public rightly expects the federal government to do something about drug abuse, which diminishes and threatens the lives of so many of our young people. And the federal government clearly has an important role in combating drug abuse: protecting our borders and interdicting drugs from other countries, strengthening our federal criminal-justice system, and providing federal assistance for the best prevention and treatment programs.	
	Despite a significant federal effort, however, our country is still seeing dramatic increases in drug use among our teenagers. In the last t<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
wo years alone, use of illegal drugs has increased 50 percent. We need a new approach.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of my colleagues are beginning to agree. At least 15 other members of Congress are establishing, or supporting, similar community coalition efforts in their regions. The entire House of Representatives -- in an unusual show of election-year bipartisanship -- recently endorsed this community-based initiative.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's a much more significant step than cynics imagine. Although the public has become disenchanted with the federal government's ability to address our worst social problems, there's still an abiding faith in a community's ability to fashion solutions close to the needs of ordinary people. And members of Congress can still be a catalyst. Although the public seems to distrust Congress as a whole, individual members are generally well respected in their districts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point is that members of Congress <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> inspire citizens to action. We've heard about the need to revitalize civil society. Well, here's a concrete example of how members of Congress can do that in a way that actually touches people's lives -- not by passing more laws in Washington, but by using their bully pulpits to engage their communities back home. This is how we as national leaders can best exert--and sustain -- national leadership over the long haul. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And for the sake of the Jeff Gardners in our communities, we'd better get started.

<h2>A Morningstar for Human Services</h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a></b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">E</font>very now and then an idea comes along that is so breathtakingly sensible, one wonders why no one ever thought of it before.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The National Results Council, a new nonprofit organization based in St. Paul, Minnesota, plans to give users of human services the same kind of comparative performance measures available to buyers of cars and CD players.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It will begin by measuring the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation programs that try to find jobs for people with disabilities. With some 15,000 programs nationwide serving 500,000 people, this is a $3-4 billion industry, funded mostly by federal and state taxpayers. Despite all this money, roughly two-thirds of people with disabilities remain unemployed. Yet, astonishingly, there are no industry-wide measures for judging how well individual programs are doing.
<p><table width="160" align="right" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>"For the same amount of money, we could help 25 percent more people get jobs."</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"When you're choosing between different mutual funds, you can compare their performance in Morningstar," says Terry Etling, the CEO of the National Results Council (NRC). "But if you have a disability and want a job, you don't know which rehab programs have the best track record. And if you're a legislator trying to get the most bang from the taxpayers' buck, you don't know which programs to expand or scale down." Etling ought to know. As a former top official at the Ohio Rehabilitation Services Commission, he used to hand out money to service providers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To fill this void, the NRC will compare every vocational rehabilitation program in the country according to two measures of performance:<ul><p><li>	Four months after graduation, what percentage of participants have been employed for at least 30 days earning at least $180 per week? (For some kinds of programs, the earnings threshold will be lower.)<li>	How much does the program cost per beneficiary?</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will then rank the programs according to the benefits delivered and the cost per beneficiary. Rank order will be adjusted according to labor market conditions and barriers to employment, so that programs are rewarded for serving consumers with the greatest difficulty finding jobs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will test its methodology in a pilot study of 90 rehab programs at Goodwill Industries International. Kenneth Shaw, Goodwill's research director, says his organization has conducted internal studies of its programs, "but we think an independent third-party evaluation will have more credibility."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Shaw thinks the NRC study will help Goodwill do its job better. "We want to know if some of our programs aren't achieving industry standards, and then figure out why," he says. "We also want to identify which of our programs work best, so that we can learn from our own success, and transfer those lessons to our other operations." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That's exactly what the NRC hopes will happen throughout the rehab industry. Robert Walker, the organization's president, is a program-evaluation specialist who used to run a Minneapolis rehab center. He estimates that the industry could improve its cost-effectiveness by 20 to 25 percent, simply by bringing low performers up to the standards of the best in the business. "For the same amount of money, we could help 25 percent more people get jobs."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The big question is how consumer information will transform the industry. "Simply pointing to models of excellence isn't enough," says Chris Olander, an NRC board member. "We have to change incentives." Olander is the executive director of New York City's JM Foundation, which conducted a seven-year search in the 1980s to identify the nation's most effective vocational rehab programs. "Guess what? The winners were exemplary but nobody cared. Government and private funders didn't reward the best performers, or punish the worst ones. That's because we don't pay for outcomes in this industry, we pay for quantity of services. We have to start paying for results."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After vocational rehab, the NRC's next target for evaluation will be the larger world of employment and training--a $20 billion industry. It is also considering programs for alcohol and drug treatment, mental health, and teen-pregnancy prevention. One issue the NRC may be able to resolve is whether faith-based alcohol and drug addiction programs have much higher success rates than medical therapies or secular counseling programs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC hopes it can reach five audiences with its information: consumers who can make more informed decisions; service providers who can compare their results with similar programs; government officials who can better direct tax dollars for maximum benefit; researchers and trainers who can help improve programs; and private funders who can invest their charitable contributions for greater impact.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our mission," says president Robert Walker, "is to help human services achieve higher success rates while reducing costs and serving more people."<p>

<h2>Don't Brake for Big Government</h2>
<b>by Tyce Palmaffy</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">I</font>n 1974, in the wake of the OPEC oil embargo, the federal government imposed the 55 mile-per-hour "National Maximum Speed Limit" (NMSL) on American motorists to conserve gas. But long after the fuel crisis had abated, the federal speed limit remained, backed by advocates who touted its supposed safety benefits. Even as these benefits were soon cast into doubt and drivers' compliance with the law began to erode, its supporters continued to lobby for the federal maximum. And for more than 20 years, Congress followed their lead. The Democratic leadership of the Congress blocked all efforts to overturn the national speed limit.
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">C</font>ongress has finally repealed a law that defied popular will and common sense - the federal speed limit</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then last year, with their robust commitment to limiting government, the newly elected House and Senate freshmen pushed for a repeal of the federal speed limit. In the fall of 1995, despite the resistance of old-guard Republicans Bud Shuster and John Chafee, chairmen of the key committees in the House and Senate, legislation repealing the national speed limit passed both chambers by chasmic margins -- 419-7 in the House, by voice vote in the Senate. On November 28, 1995, President Clinton reluctantly signed the legislation. The endurance of this anachronism is but one sign of Washington's bureaucratic paternalism; its demise, however, may augur a new era of limits on federal authority. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The federal maximum was not, technically, mandatory. It was enforced through the power of the purse -- federal highway funds were withheld from states refusing to post the new limit. Naturally, every state capitulated. Building on legislation in 1987 and 1991 that allowed states to raise the limit to 65 m.p.h. on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds, the repeal removes the threat of reduced funding, freeing all states to set their own speed limits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the effective date of the repeal. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada, and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 m.p.h., while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once liberated, state legislatures ushered in these increases by lopsided margins. Missouri's House and Senate, for example, voted by 122-34 and 28-2, respectively, to raise the maximum limit to 70 m.p.h. Idaho's lower and upper chambers voted to increase limits by 56-12 and 28-7, respectively. Higher speed limits were voted down in Ohio, Connecticut, Kentucky, Virginia, and Louisiana. That's the beauty of a federal system. States can now set their own speed limits after assessing local conditions; some will increase their limits and some will not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The swift actions of these legislators were bolstered by the support of motorist advocates. "We believe that the states will do as good a job, or even a better job, at setting and enforcing the limits," says Bill Jackman, a spokesman for the <a href="http://www.aaa.com">American Automobile Association</a>. "In many states the federal limits were really disdained. . . . All of the state departments of transportation are responsible institutions with respectable people working in them. We trust them to do their jobs well." With 39 million members nationwide, AAA represents the interests of almost a quarter of all licensed drivers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State traffic engineers and highway patrolmen, whose reputations depend on drivers' safety, added their applause. "Putting the decision up to the individual states was a good idea," says Ken Howes of the Florida Highway Patrol. "Our Florida Department of Transportation has done excellent research on what speeds are appropriate. We are very comfortable in Florida if a speed is raised, because we know it is not done haphazardly." Adds P.D. Kiser, the chief traffic engineer at the Nevada Department of Transportation: "The repeal was way overdue; the 55 m.p.h. speed limit was an experiment that failed miserably."<p><b>Easy Riding</b>	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Patrolmen and engineers supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable and safe speed limits. According to traffic engineers, the proper method of determining speed limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The limit should be posted at the speed at or below which 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, <i>drivers</i> set the speed limit. What engineers call "the 85th percentile speed" --  the proper speed limit -- is the safest speed to travel. "People who drive at the 85th percentile speed are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," explains engineer Tom Hicks, of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Says Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma DOT, "When the 85th percentile speed was at 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, drivers weren't comfortable-some drove at 55, some at 65, some at 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. Hicks reports that ever since Maryland increased the limit on some roads to 65 m.p.h., "We're seeing more tightening of speeds; the slower drivers are catching up while the faster drivers are slowing down."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 m.p.h. speed limits were unreasonably low -- often 5 or 10, and sometimes 15 m.p.h. below the 85th percentile speed. In Minnesota, engineers report, the 85th percentile speeds were 73 m.p.h. on rural interstates and 69 m.p.h. on urban interstates. In <a href="http://www.mt.gov/">Montana</a>, the 85th percentile speed was 72 m.p.h. In Oklahoma, it was 75. Drivers in essence voted for repeal with their feet -- by pressing down on the accelerator.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Such rampant disregard for the law made the situation even <i>more</i> dangerous. Says Maryland's Hicks, "There are many traffic engineers, myself included, who think that the 55 m.p.h. speed limit caused a degradation of respect for traffic laws and contributed to what we call aggressive driving. For the last five years, everybody has been going 15 to 20 m.p.h. over the speed limit, including the police. It's terribly harmful to have a law and not enforce it."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also unduly influence the effectiveness of police. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 m.p.h. limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking and that threatened rather than improved safety. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 m.p.h. speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads, and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Charles Lave, an economist at the University of California at Irvine specializing in traffic issues, says that researchers must take into account these changes in police and driver behavior by studying overall fatality rates instead of just rates on the interstates. In his 1992 study, "Did the 65 m.p.h. Speed Limit Save Lives?" he found that the stepped-up enforcement of the 55 m.p.h. speed limit did reduce fatalities on interstates after the national limit was enacted. But, he says, the reduction was illusory. To avoid the extra policing of the interstates, drivers switched to the scenic but more dangerous country roads, thus decreasing both traffic and fatalities on interstates.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So by requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 m.p.h. speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety. Says Jackman of AAA, "People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed; if the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." Now that the federal limit has been repealed, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.<p><b>Straw Men</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The repeal of the federal mandate encourages better use of police resources, greater respect for the law, and safer roads. If one adds overwhelming support from motorists, the state legislatures, the highway patrol, and state departments of transportation, the case for repeal seems airtight. So why the opposition?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Well, they're wrong," scoffs Judie Stone, the president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, an organization funded by insurance companies. "I am not an engineer, but it is just common sense. . . . It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if you raise speed limits, speeds go up." Higher speeds, Stone contends, mean greater chances of crashing.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Changes like these that increase the severity of injuries mean higher health-care costs, more expensive insurance claims, and higher premiums for everyone," adds Richard Retting, the senior transportation engineer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These arguments held sway in Congress for 20 years. Safety advocates also often point to statistics that indicate fatalities rose 30 percent in 1987 on roads where the speed limit was increased to 65 m.p.h. This proves, they say, that raising the speed limit costs lives. But Lave's study concluded otherwise. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By concentrating solely on the number of interstate fatalities, Lave says, opponents of repeal fail to account for the safety benefits of setting more reasonable speed limits: police allocate their resources more efficiently and drivers switch to the less dangerous interstates. These benefits can only be accounted for by studying overall fatality rates. Lave calculated that from 1986-88, overall statewide fatality rates actually <i>fell</i> by 3.4 to 5.1 percent in the 40 states that adopted the new 65 m.p.h. maximum.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, engineering studies by Samuel Tignor, Davey Warren, and Martin Parker for the Federal Highway Administration show that average speeds increase negligibly when highway speed limits are raised. Indeed, Tignor and Warren write, "Raising the speed limit by various amounts up to 15 m.p.h. has little or no effect on speeds over a broad range of road types and speed levels."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This would seem to indicate, as traffic engineers like to say, that motorists tend to ignore posted limits, instead picking a speed at which they feel comfortable. But advocates like Retting and Stone see it differently. "If you let drivers set a speed that is reasonable and prudent, as Montana has," Retting says, "they can't do it." Adds Stone, "Yes, it's true that people were exceeding 55 before, but at least they were staying below 65. Now, with states raising limits to 70 and 75 m.p.h., the percentage of drivers exceeding 70 is going up, average speeds are going up. In Kansas and Missouri, fatalities have gone up."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	True, April 1996 traffic fatalities in Kansas and Missouri <i>did</i> increase 20 and 28 percent, respectively, from the same period last year. But in Missouri, fatalities in May <i>dropped</i> by one from last year. And in Kansas, fatalities rose from 25 in April 1995 (before repeal) to 30 in April 1996 -- but in April 1994, Kansas highways claimed 37 lives under the former speed limit. Since the repeal of the federal limit, troopers and engineers in California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas report that average speeds have not increased significantly -- 1 to 2 m.p.h. in most states -- and fatalities have actually decreased in some states. Says Kiser of the Nevada DOT: "I think the only thing that really changed out there was the numbers on the signs."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To drivers, though, the changes are far more significant. Under the old federal limits, drivers seldom knew how far over the speed limit they could travel without receiving a ticket. Now, report many patrolmen, the limit is higher but enforcement is stricter. Says Howes of the Florida Highway Patrol, "70 is 70 is 70." Patrolmen can concentrate on ticketing the dangerous drivers -- those traveling over the highway's design speed -- and law-abiding citizens can relax and drive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"[The police and I] are not adversarial anymore," says Raymond Kasicki, an independent truck owner-operator in Ohio. "Before you looked at them as someone who was out to get you. Now we're both looking for the same thing: people who are driving dangerously."<P><b>The Bureaucratic Disposition</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is easy to dismiss the repeal of the federal speed limit as token legislation, more of a statement of principle than legislation that improves our standard of living. The benefits, however, are palpable. In the Western states, motorists may drive hundreds of miles on flat roads with no other cars in sight. Why shouldn't they be allowed to pick a speed at which they feel comfortable? Why shouldn't the police be allowed to distribute their resources as they see fit? Why shouldn't state departments of transportation, working with the highway patrol, be allowed to set the speed limit according to local conditions? The repeal allows all of this to happen.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	More importantly, the repeal of the national speed limit may signal new attitudes in Washington. The law was a typical Washingtonian notion: a one-size-fits-all rule that usurped state responsibility. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. Says Soltani of Oklahoma, "I strongly believe that there is no relationship between higher speed limits and higher fatalities. If I did not believe that, I would not have recommended [speed limit increases] to the legislature." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others? The repeal recognizes two principles at the core of any argument for limiting the federal government: that federal legislation can be extremely inflexible, and that states will seek to protect their citizens. This renewed faith in local officials and doubts about the wisdom of federal solutions may be a bellwether of further devolution.

<b>Targeting Teen Pregnancy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	In his 1995 State of the Union address, Bill Clinton challenged parents and leaders "from all over the country . . . [to] join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy." A new private, nonpartisan group has emerged to accept that challenge. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy notes that more than 40 percent of American girls become pregnant by age 20, the highest teen pregnancy rate in the industrialized world. Eighty-five percent of these pregnancies, according to the group, are unintended. The premise of the Campaign is that teenage pregnancy contributes mightily to many social problems, that national leaders shy away from declaring that it is wrong, and that initiatives to reduce teen pregnancies are disjointed, little noticed, and poorly supported. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Campaign's goal is to reduce the U.S. teen pregnancy rate by one-third by 2005. Its strategy is to help organize local coalitions of community-based groups to confront the problem at the local level, prod political leaders to raise the public profile of the issue, evaluate the successes and failures of various teen-pregnancy programs, and enlist the news and entertainment media in the effort to change cultural norms.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Perhaps the most significant feature of the Campaign is its acknowledgment, rare in public policy, that "part of a strategy for reducing teenage pregnancy should be a more overt discussion of religion, culture, and public values." To pursue that goal, the campaign is dedicating one of its four task forces to "religion and public values." This task force is chaired by William Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Clinton, and includes Heritage Foundation analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, Mary Rose McGeady of Covenant House, scholar Jean Bethke Elshtain of the University of Chicago Divinity School, and a representative of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, among others. Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean and Urban Institute scholar Isabel Sawhill are the board chairman and president, respectively. The Campaign will accept no government funding.<p><i>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Leading a coalition of scientists, business groups, property-rights advocates, and conservationists, the National Wilderness Institute recently released its "American Conservation Ethic." The document comprises a set of principles for protecting the environment and managing resources without recourse to "old-style environmental thinking" that relied on federal mandates. Sound environmental policy, says executive director Rob Gordon, should enlist "liberty, free markets, property rights, scientific inquiry, technological advancement, and a realistic understanding of the natural world." Among its principles: <ul><p><li>Renewable resources are resilient and can be used and managed wisely;<p><li>Efforts to control pollution should measure both benefits and costs in a scientific fashion;<p><li>Management of natural resources should take into account the conditions of particular situations and sites;<p><li>Public policy should be guided by science;<p><li>The most "promising new opportunities" for conserving and improving the environment lie in protecting private property and "unleashing the creative powers of the free market."</ul><p><i>

<P> <b>School Choice in Milwaukee</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Supporters of school choice generally frame their argument in economic terms. They compare public schools to "monopolies" that can get away with a shoddy "product'' -- substandard education -- because poor parents have nowhere else to go. By giving these "consumers" more educational choices, it is said, vouchers will introduce an element of "competition" into public education, thereby forcing public schools to raise their educational standards or risk losing their "customers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In <i>Break These Chains</i>, former presidential speechwriter Daniel McGroarty looks at the school-voucher controversy through the eyes of a journalist, not an economist. He offers a "battlefield account" of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, which claims to be "the first ever 'voucher' plan, providing public funds for private school choice." In the process, he makes some important modifications to the standard arguments for school choice.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
For example, McGroarty challenges the view that public schools are not responsive to incentives. On the contrary, he argues, the problem is that they're <i>too</i> responsive: "Not only is there no penalty for failure, the objective fact is that <i>poor schools prosper</i>. When funding follows failure, bringing underachieving schools more social workers and school psychologists, special 'stay-in-school' programs, an army of 'at-risk' coordinators and early intervention experts, schools faithfully produce the failure that begets funding. Failure, in this Orwellian inversion, is success. Schools, predictably, sink to the challenge."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	McGroarty also points out that choice in practice is sometimes very different from choice in theory. "At an abstract, theoretical level," he notes, "one can champion freedom of choice and condemn, for example, the faddish focus on multicultural curricula without confronting a simple fact: Some parents, given a choice, will choose multicultural schools." In McGroarty's view, the "Afrocentric focus" of many choice schools constitutes a positive aspect of the school culture. "Voucher advocates," he argues, "must have the courage of their convictions to accept choice in practice."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For McGroarty, the decisive argument for school choice is not an "economic" one -- promoting competition -- but a moral one: parental empowerment. He quotes the principal of one Milwaukee choice school who, when asked what made her school so special, cited parental involvement. "Choice parents are more active than our tuition parents are," she said. "Choice parents want the opportunity to get involved with their child's education."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	When parents become involved, the results are near-miraculous, as McGroarty demonstrates by comparing the educational effervescence at choice schools like Urban Day School and Messmer High School with the apathy and hopelessness of their public-school counterparts. All these schools are located in the same square mile of Milwaukee's poverty-stricken Near North Side, yet are worlds apart in their ethos and record of achievement.<p>
* Break These Chains: The Battle For School Choice <i>by Daniel McGroarty (Prima Publishing).</i><p><b>Technology and Home-Schooling</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"A concern for independent thought, a longing to strengthen family, and a frustration with the bureaucratic limits of conventional schools" are leading some families to opt for home-schooling, according to Britton Manasco, writing in <i>Reason</i>. "Home schoolers are a statistically small but rapidly growing and increasingly influential force in America. Their numbers have jumped from 15,000 to 20,000 in the late 1970s to perhaps 600,000 today (some estimates put the number above 1 million.) The trend is likely to continue, as new products and institutions develop that make it easier for parents to educate children at home."<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Home-schoolers have a powerful ally in the new information technologies that "make it possible for students to learn at their own pace and in their own way, with the teacher serving as a mentor and an intellectual coach -- guiding, supporting and questioning individual learners. . . . [Information technologies] decentralize learning, no longer tying it to the physical infrastructure and administrative overhead of schools."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Critics of home-schooling argue that "individualized learning" fails to develop social skills such as cooperation, collaboration, and communication, but Manasco disagrees. "No one is arguing that technology be employed to the exclusion of human contact and personal warmth. Individualized learning hardly implies learning in isolation. Communications technologies and networks can enlarge one's set of possible associations and even allow for collaborative learning projects that cannot be replicated in the classroom. In a proper setting, they can help facilitate both individual <i>and</i> interpersonal skills."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Equally important, the new educational technologies will also empower parents. "Whether or not political efforts to encourage taxpayer-funded alternatives to government-run schools ultimately succeed, families already have the option of withdrawing from the educational system. . . . As leaving or supplementing traditional schooling becomes more attractive and less costly, the egalitarian ideology and assembly-line pedagogy that dictate one-size-fits-all education cannot remain unchanged."<p><i>
* <a href="http://www.reasonmag.com/9607/Fe.MANASCO.html">"Special Ed,"</a> by Britton Manasco, </i>Reason, <i>July 1996.</i><p><b>The Catholic School Edge</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Studies have consistently shown that Catholic schools are educating minority students better than their public-school counterparts, despite the fact that per-pupil expenditures in Catholic schools are only one-third those of tax-funded public schools. "Catholic schools succeed where state schools fail," writes Sol Stern, "because they have virtually no central-office bureaucrats telling principals how to do their jobs. In public schools, teachers almost automatically get tenure -- a lifetime job guarantee -- after three years. Most Catholic schools around the country have no tenure system whatsoever. . . . And there is no rigid credentialing system: Principals can select teachers for their talent and commitment."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Given Catholic schools' success in educating minority youth, "you might expect that liberals, self-styled champions of disadvantaged children, would applaud [their] commitment and sacrifice," writes Stern. "You might even expect them to look for ways to get government money to these underfunded schools. Instead, they have done their best to make sure the wall of separation between church and state remains impenetrable. Liberal child-advocacy groups tout an endless array of 'prevention programs' that are supposed to inoculate inner-city children against delinquency, dropping out of school and teen pregnancy -- yet they consistently ignore Catholic schools, which nearly always succeed in preventing these pathologies."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Stern attributes the lack of liberal interest in Catholic schools to the fact that liberal opinion leaders are closely allied to the teachers' unions, "which have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of liberal candidates around the country." As a result, we are ignoring an inspiring laboratory of reform. "Catholic schools are a valuable public resource not merely because they so profoundly benefit the children who enroll in them. They also challenge the public school monopoly, constantly reminding us that the neediest kids are educable and that spending extravagant sums of money isn't the answer."<p><i>

<b>Age Will Be Served</b>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
According to economist Thomas J. DiLorenzo, "establishment seniors groups" like the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), and the National Council on Aging (NCOA) are little more than tax-supported advocates for Big Government. "They have a vested stake in maintaining the status quo," he writes in a <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/crc/books/elderly.html">new book</a> published by the <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/">Capital Research Center</a>, "even if it leads to the bankruptcy of programs that seniors depend on." As Baby Boomers age, two programs of critical importance to senior Americans -- Social Security and Medicare -- are certain to suffer financial collapse in the near future unless they are reformed now. Yet the "dependency lobby," as DiLorenzo calls the AARP, NCSC, and NCOA, steadfastly opposes needed changes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to DiLorenzo, the AARP is "the nation's second-largest nonprofit organization after the Catholic Church. It is perhaps the most influential political organization in America, devoting vast resources in efforts to expand welfare and entitlement programs for seniors. AARP has supported a higher minimum wage, more rent control, 'motor-voter' legislation, higher gasoline taxes, higher alcohol and tobacco taxes and higher capital gains taxes." AARP "continues to assure its members that the Social Security system is financially sound," and its lobbying for higher Medicare and Medicaid spending "has helped bring these programs to the point of bankruptcy." About a quarter of its revenues come from federal funding.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The NCSC, which in 1993 received 96 percent of its funding from federal revenues, supports "income tax increases, cuts in defense spending, 'motor-voter' legislation, a national health-care plan including long-term care, more government housing, and expanded government programs for seniors." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In contrast to these groups, DiLorenzo reports that millions of seniors are joining "a new generation of seniors groups that emphasize voluntarism, consumer choice, and fiscal responsibility. They understand that the welfare-state policies championed by the groups comprising the so-called dependency lobby are as harmful to seniors as they are to younger Americans." Although the combined budget of these organizations -- The Seniors Coalition, the United Seniors Association (U.S.A.) and the 60 Plus Association -- is about $20 million, compared to the $450 million budget of the "Big Three" seniors groups, the influence of pro-market seniors groups is growing. Unlike their counterparts in the "dependency lobby," notes DiLorenzo, these new seniors groups recognize that Social Security and Medicare are in trouble, and favor market-oriented reforms to avert a crisis.<p>

<p><b>The Crisis of Fatherlessness</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If present trends continue," writes David Popenoe, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University, "the percentage of American children living apart from their biological fathers will reach 50 percent early in the next century." This "massive erosion of fatherhood contributes mightily to many of the major social problems of our time. . . . Fatherless children have a risk factor of two to three times that of fathered children for a wide range of negative outcomes, including dropping out of high school, giving birth as a teenager, and becoming a juvenile delinquent."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In his new book, <i>Life Without Father</i>, Popenoe attributes the erosion of fatherhood to two causes: the "divorce revolution" and the sharp increase in nonmarital births. These two trends, in turn, reflect a dramatic change in American culture over the past 30 years -- a shift away from any sense of communal responsibility towards a radical individualism.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Until quite recently, Popenoe argues, American individualism was "tempered by a strong belief in the sanctity and importance of social units such as families, neighborhoods, schools, religious organizations, local communities, and the nation as a whole."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But today's "radical, expressive, or unencumbered individualism is devoted much more to self-aggrandizement at the expense of the group. In place of group purposes serving as personal goals, self-expression, sexual freedom, and even impulsiveness have been substituted. . . . No longer having a strong institutional repository, moral authority has become increasingly centered within the psyche of each individual. At the extreme, we are becoming a nation of asocial hedonists and narcissists."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The crisis of fatherhood, then, is ultimately a cultural crisis, a sharp decline in the traditional sense of communal responsibility. It therefore follows that to rescue the endangered institution of fatherhood, we must regain our sense of community. Popenoe offers several "community-building guidelines designed to promote marriage and family life." These include the fostering of "residential stability," the revitalization of "community moral standards," the "development of smaller cities and towns," and the protection and promotion of "family-oriented neighborhoods." "Without violating the Bill of Rights," Popenoe concludes, "local communities should have more autonomy in establishing and enforcing their own values and moral standards," and "homogenous neighborhoods made up of families with children, possibly up to the size necessary to support neighborhood schools, should be protected and encouraged."<p>

<h2>The Prisoners' Accomplice</h2>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">T</font>he 288 most dangerous convicts in Maryland are incarcerated in "Supermax," the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Supermax is a prisoners' prison, one in a growing class of "supermaximum security" facilities that take the worst of the worst--murderers and rapists who have continued their violent behavior while on the inside -- and lock them away in a redoubt of fortified walls and high-technology surveillance equipment. Supermaxes exist to isolate "bad" prisoners from the general population, and in turn, these incorrigibles from each other.<p>

<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he Clinton Justice Department undermines local efforts to seize control of prisons from litigious prisoners and autocratic judges.</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5> 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While some see supermaxes as civilized society's last line of defense against its most violent predators, others see them as cruel and unusual punishment. This latter group includes the ACLU's National Prison Project, the National Campaign to Stop Control Unit Prisons, and, most recently, the Clinton <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">Justice Department</a>. 
</td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, has threatened to sue Maryland for alleged violations of prisoners' civil rights at Supermax. Maryland officials vehemently deny the charges. The Clinton administration, they claim, is conducting a quiet campaign on behalf of prisoners that belies its tough-on-crime rhetoric. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even as President Clinton proposes a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims, these officials charge, his Justice Department is trying to expand the rights of prisoners by singling out Supermax. And although the president has signed legislation to liberate state prisons from activist federal judges and groundless prisoner lawsuits, his political appointees are attempting to micromanage the incarceration of the states' most dangerous convicts. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rico Marzano is one such convict. In a 1987 drug deal that went bad, Marzano shot and killed four people, including two pregnant women. He was convicted of first-degree murder and placed in a maximum security facility. After his second escape attempt, he was sent to Supermax.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland's highest security prison houses three kinds of inmates: "serious institutional rule violators" (typically inmates who have assaulted or killed guards or other inmates); serious escape risks, like Marzano; and prisoners awaiting death sentences, like Anthony Brandison, who paid a man $9,000 to kill two witnesses scheduled to testify against him in a 1983 federal drug case. In all, 105 murderers and 19 rapists spend their days in Supermax in what the corrections system calls "restricted confinement."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Inmates remain alone 23 hours a day in their 65-square-foot concrete cells. They are allowed no physical contact with other prisoners or guards; meals are passed through a narrow slit -- a "beanhole" -- in solid metal cell doors. Out-of-cell time is spent alone, in a windowless prison dayroom. "When we were letting them rec [recreate] together they were killing each other, so we had to stop," said William Sondervan, Maryland's assistant commissioner for security operations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite such concern for the safety of inmates -- not to mention the prison staff -- the Clinton Justice Department insists that the isolation of inmates at Supermax is "the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe." But the staff must maintain order among prisoners who regularly hurl "correctional cocktails" of feces, urine, and other bodily fluids and often have to be forcibly removed from their cells. It is obviously frustrating, then, that prison officials must also fight a legal battle to protect what they see as a valuable -- and legal -- correctional tool. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Each year, the 50 states spend $81 million defending themselves against prisoner lawsuits seeking redress for civil rights "violations" ranging from insufficiently stylish footwear to faulty television reception. This epidemic of prisoner litigation -- one-fourth of the civil cases filed in federal trial courts last year were initiated by prisoners -- is complemented by federal judges who impose "voluntary" consent decrees on states. In 1990, more than 1,200 state prisons were operating under judicial edicts covering everything from inmate population caps to how many electrical outlets each cell must have. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This litigation explosion has greatly circumscribed the control of states over their own prison systems. Some states have passed legislation curbing prisoner lawsuits, but attorneys general from Tallahassee to Phoenix have looked to Congress for federal relief. Congress responded earlier this year by passing the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.866:">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a>. The legislation, which forces prisoners to pick up the tab for lawsuits and limits the ability of judges to impose consent decrees, was signed by Clinton as part of a larger spending bill last April. But the ink had barely dried on Clinton's signature before his Justice Department stepped in to substitute for the liberal federal judges  whose meddling in state prison systems had been curtailed by the legislation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a 13-page letter to Maryland governor Parris Glendening, Deval Patrick charged that Supermax was violating inmates' constitutional rights through a range of offenses from inadequate exercise equipment to lukewarm meals. He gave the state 49 days to comply with a three-page list of "necessary remedial measures," or else face a federal lawsuit. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thirty states, the federal government, and Canada all have supermaxes -- one-third of which have been created since 1991. These facilities have already established a track record of success as pressure-release valves for overburdened state prison systems. In the 1970s, before California built its supermax, one out of every 1,200 prisoners was murdered by a fellow inmate. Today, that rate has shrunk by tenfold, to one in 12,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tom Coughlin, a former New York State Corrections Commissioner, says he saw a "dramatic reduction" in violence in his prisons following the construction of the New York supermax a decade ago. Despite their success -- or perhaps because of it -- supermaxes have become the target, many corrections officials believe, of a systematic bias within the Department of Justice. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland prison commissioner Sondervan says he is  "shocked" and "insulted" by the charges leveled against Supermax by Patrick. Department of Justice investigators, he believes, came into the facility with their minds already made up. "They came in with a political agenda," Sondervan says. "Their charges don't reflect the truth" about conditions at the prison. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Prisoner litigation typically germinates in the expansive environs of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment." Federal civil rights investigators, Maryland officials charge, seem to believe that supermaximum facilities by their very existence are cruel and unusual. In his letter to Glendening, Patrick admitted he was "unable to find evidence of a pattern of physical abuse by Supermax staff against inmates." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What he did find, however, was a host of violations of prisoners' "rights." Among them were the "rights" to outdoor exercise, piping hot meals, and daily visits by medical personnel. In a sharply worded rejoinder, the Maryland attorney general's office told Patrick that his charges reflect his civil rights division's "philosophical opposition to 'super maximum' facilities without regard to constitutional criteria." They noted that the law allows the Department of Justice to redress only "egregious" constitutional violations, a standard, they argued, that was not met by the charges leveled by Patrick. Former New York prisons commissioner Coughlin agrees that the Justice Department too often acts without legal cause. "Look up the word 'egregious' and the meaning is not lukewarm food," says Coughlin. "There is no constitutional right to rehabilitation. You have to protect people from harm -- that's the constitutional right. The Department of Justice says isolating prisoners is causing harm. But as far as I'm concerned, if officers are not hitting individuals with sticks, there is no constitutional harm being done." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials suspected Department of Justice investigators of a broader political agenda because Patrick's letter referred to Pelican Bay prison, a notorious facility in California that has been referred to as a "neo-Orwellian hell." Conditions at Supermax, Patrick wrote, were "similar" to those found at Pelican Bay, a supermax that had been the object of a huge 1991 class-action suit alleging physical and mental abuse of prisoners. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials believe that the Department of Justice has set out to expand prisoners' rights by building on the case law established by Pelican Bay litigation. A federal judge found extensive abuses at that prison and ruled that the severe isolation of inmates there could exacerbate and even cause psychosis and other mental problems. Maryland officials strenuously object to the comparison. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> that it was "outrageous" and "inflammatory" to compare Supermax with Pelican Bay. "The fact that they have to reach so far to make the comparison makes you suspicious of the people who wrote this," she said of the Justice Department report.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Such an agenda, officials admit, is perplexing given the anticrime sentiment prevalent this election year. And the timing of the investigation of Supermax -- coincident with the president's approval of the Prison Litigation Reform Act -- only muddies the Clinton administration's message on criminal-justice issues. "Deval Patrick has painted himself into a box on this one," a Maryland prison official says. "The Prison Litigation Reform Act really captures the national view of how people feel about prisons." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile, Maryland corrections officials remain in a tense standoff with federal officials over the future of Supermax. Unfortunately, they can't look to the Prison Litigation Reform Act for relief; it spares states the tyranny of liberal federal judges and litigious inmates, but not federal regulators.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<a href="http://www.senate.gov/~hatch/">Senator Orrin Hatch</a>, one of the authors of the Act, recently decided to try the direct approach: He appealed to the Clinton administration to drop its insistence that inmates at Supermax have a constitutional right to fresh air. "Many, if not all, of the murderers in this group are lucky to be breathing indoor air at all," the senator says, "which is more than their victims are doing right now."

<h2>A Solution Waiting to be Adopted</h2>
<b>by Charmaine Crouse Yoest</b>

</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">W</font>hen 48-year-old Hillary Rodham Clinton confessed to <i>Time</i> magazine recently that she wanted to adopt a child, it set off a small tempest of controversy. Her comment was hailed by supporters as evidence of her bona fides as a child advocate and decried by detractors as yet another reincarnation of the First Lady as First Mother. Some dismissed the remark as an effort to minimize the fallout from her husband's veto of the bill to ban partial-birth abortions. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Interpretations aside, the incident highlights the unique position adoption occupies in our political firmament. Although many in the adoption community wish it were otherwise, adoption is closely tied to the abortion question. And as abortion politics grow more heated, adoption demands attention as the nearest thing to middle ground in a polarizing issue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But adoption is enmeshed in politics of its own. It continues to suffer from the controversy over transracial placements and from the bureaucratic delays of the foster-care system. President Clinton, for example, says he will support a House bill that would prohibit states from denying adoptions based on race, but the proposal faces intense opposition from special interest groups attached to the Democratic Party. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This complex issue has two sides: infant adoption and adoption out of foster care. For many years now, only 1 to 2 percent of women faced with unwanted pregnancies have made adoption plans. At the same time, the number of couples waiting to adopt is usually estimated at around 2 million. The tragic paradox is that while many families desperately wait for children, many children wait for families. According to the Institute for Children, state welfare agencies have adoption plans for 100,000 foster-care children nationwide, and 50,000 are legally free to be adopted but are languishing in foster care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The National Association of Black Social Workers has for years decried adoption of black infants by white families as "racial genocide." Accepted social-work practice holds that a child be held in foster care until an "appropriate" -- read "racially correct" -- family is found. This sometimes occurs even when a white family is waiting to adopt a particular minority child. In theory, race-matching of infants and adoptive parents makes sense; in practice, it means that minority children in some states typically wait two to three years longer for new homes than white children.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, children are often trapped in foster care by the false hopes of the "family preservation" philosophy. With misguided compassion, social workers and judges work to preserve families broken apart by drug addiction and physical abuse, when the children need loving, stable homes. Moreover, the foster-care system is sustained by monetary incentives to keep children in care: Federal money comes into the system based on each day a child stays in foster care. The hurdles to get a child into a permanent adoptive home are high, while the incentives are low. As a result, children can drift in the system for years, waiting for the elusive "family reunification."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Eva is one of those children. She last saw her biological mother 10 years ago, when she was eight. Her biological father is not involved in her life in any way. But 1996 was a year of exciting milestones for Eva. She graduated from high school, and a court finally approved her adoption by her long-term foster parents. It took the law a long time to sanction the family they'd already formed--eight and a half years ago.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why the delay? Eva's biological father refused to consent to the adoption. Eva wants her story told because it isn't over. Her two younger brothers have been living in a residential placement center for nearly nine years, even though her new family would like to adopt them as well. Compassion and common sense say yes; red tape says no. Eva's story is much too common. The time that children spend in foster care before their situations are resolved can be excruciatingly long. Ten percent of children in foster care stay more than 7.4 years. And the number of children in state care keeps increasing. Between 1982 and 1992, the number rose 69 percent, from 262,000 children to 442,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Behind the statistics are thousands of Evas yearning for homes. Fortunately, reform is in the air. Frustration with lengthy stays in foster care, rising incidents of child abuse, and concern over persistently high abortion rates are helping to focus renewed attention on adoption. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Various efforts -- by private groups, state governments, and Congress--aim to reform the system to let needy children connect with a loving family. The following are some recent initiatives:<p><b>The Texas Model</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Texas governor George W. Bush presides over one of 10 states in which 75 percent of the nation's foster-care population resides. Texas currently has 12,000 children in foster care, of whom 1,400 are available for adoption. But even the children ready for permanent homes may face a long journey: It usually takes the state two years after termination of parental rights to place these children in permanent adoptive homes. Most important from a child's view, foster care itself is a pretty bumpy ride: children average four different placements before they get a permanent adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 annual report of the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services found that, since 1991, the average length of stay for children who were ultimately adopted was 40.8 months. It took 15 months to terminate parental rights after entering foster care, another 18 months to be placed for adoption, and another seven months to finalize the adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Bush wants to cut the time kids spend in foster care in half, and has established the Governor's Committee to Promote Adoption to help make Texas a model of adoption reform. The 13-person committee includes several adoptive parents, pastors, and representatives of private adoption efforts such as One Church and One Child. It is due to hand the governor a report in September identifying state policies that hinder adoption. State adoptions, for example, are subject to challenge up to two years after the finalization of the adoption decree -- leaving families and children in a legal limbo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So far the committee has targeted two areas for reform: judicial and administrative. Beverly Jimmerson,  Policy Advisor to the governor, notes that courts waste a lot of time when they fail to schedule prompt hearings concerning a child's adoption status. In addition, the committee has discovered that state agencies providing social services to adults fail to prioritize parents who need mental services or addiction treatment. Parents may wait months, or even years, for treatment while their children languish in foster care. The committee's goal is to propose a legislative reform agenda for the 1997 legislative session. <p><b>Kids and the Race Card</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A significant reason for adoption delays in Texas and other states is the ongoing debate over leaving minority children in foster care until suitable minority parents can adopt them -- even though white families are willing and able to take the children in. That battle is now being waged in Washington in the form of the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act. The bill, which passed the House and remains in Senate committee, proposes three significant policy changes:
<ul><li><b>	Give a $5,000 tax credit to middle-class families that adopt children.</b> The bill provides a tax credit for families with income under $75,000 to offset their expenses in adoption. Agency fees, court costs, and attorney fees can create an insurmountable hurdle for many families that might otherwise be able to adopt.<p>
<li><b>	Prohibit the practice of denying adoptions based on race.</b> The goal is to stop state agencies from using racial considerations to delay or prevent adoption of children under their care. In 1994, former senator Howard Metzenbaum shepherded to passage the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to eliminate racial barriers to adoption. In designing regulations to implement the bill, the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Donna Shalala essentially nullified its race-neutral intent.<p>
<li><b>	Amend the Indian Child Welfare Act to prevent tribes from nullifying adoptions.</b> The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a federal law passed in 1978, grants Indian tribes the legal standing to contest the adoption of any baby with any Indian ancestry. At the time, the law was necessary to halt unethical adoption practices that preyed on Indian babies. But the act, which assigned the tribe a legal interest in the child "on a parity with the interest of the parents," has strayed into reverse racism. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A current Ohio adoption case illustrates how convoluted and damaging this mindset can be. The Rost family adopted two twin girls. Subsequently, the birth-grandmother decided she wanted the babies. Grandparents do not have standing to contest an adoption; under the ICWA, Indian tribes do. The grandmother then retroactively enrolled herself, her son, and the twins in the Pomo Tribe of California. The tribe is now contesting the adoption on the grounds that three of the twins' 32 great-great-great-grandparents were Pomo Indian. Courts have previously decided that as little as one-256th of Indian blood (that's one great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent) qualifies a case for consideration under the ICWA.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ramifications for adoption could be enormous. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado informed the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that, although there are just over a million people officially enrolled in tribes, at least 15 million Americans can claim Indian ancestry. Echoing the National Association of Black Social Workers, Congressman Don Young of Arkansas told the committee that adoption of Indian children outside the tribe amounted to "a form of brain drain and genocide." While adults argue over rights and racism, children are the ones who wait and suffer.<P>

<b>Casey Goes to Bat for Kids</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A new private project to promote both infant adoption and adoption out of foster care is the Fund for the American Family, founded last summer by former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey. A prominent pro-life Democrat, Casey is marshaling his political clout to raise the profile of adoption, which he believes is a cornerstone in rebuilding the American family. He is lobbying heavily on adoption reform and recently testified before Congress in support of the adoption tax credit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Making adoption a national priority is one of the group's top four projects. It has already sponsored two adoption summits, bringing together leading experts to discuss ways of breaking down the barriers to adoption. Casey expects to publish a set of reform proposals this fall to spur state and federal officials to reform the system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Our goal is to see 100,000 adoptions each year for the next five years," up from 50,000, says Chris Casey, the executive director of the fund. To realize this goal, Casey is trying to bring together all 50 governors for a summit similar to the 1989 governor's conference on education.

<b>A Memo for Reform </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1993, the Cambridge-based Institute for Children began Assignment Adoption to change foster-care and adoption practices in all 50 states. In the first 12 months after Massachusetts governor William Weld signed on to the initiative, adoptions from foster care increased by about 47 percent. The Institute is now working with Texas governor George Bush and recommended to his Adoption Committee the following plan for reform:<p>1. Make foster care a truly temporary form of caring for vulnerable children; enact policies and practices that have as their goal a 12-month maximum stay for children in substitute care. <p>2. Grant biological parents no more than 12 months to prove their fitness to resume custody of their children.<p>3. Give biological fathers 30 days from the birth of the child to formalize paternity, or forfeit the right to contest adoption.<p>4. Prohibit any race-based delays in adoption.<p>5. Terminate parental rights for abandoned children after 30 days, and allow them to be adopted through a private agency--without placement in long-term foster care.<p>6. Find adoptive homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental rights or contract the process out to a private agency.<p>7. Make entrance requirements for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.<p>8. Hold the state Department of Human Services accountable for reporting its progress in finding homes for children in foster care.<p>9. Encourage private-sector involvement in improving components of the substitute-care system.

<h2>Who Owns the Sidewalks?</h2>
<b>Stephen Goldsmith</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">I</font>t does not take a legal scholar to recognize that transferring authority to the federal government undermines the whole constitutional structure designed by our Founders. Few realize that this shift is also destroying local self-government in towns and cities all across America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ours is a national government whose only powers are those delegated to it by the people. These powers are enumerated and therefore limited by the Constitution, the <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/const/bor.html">Tenth Amendment</a> of which specifies that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the People." Jefferson called the doctrine of reserved powers "the foundation of the Constitution" and said that "to take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn . . . is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition." The resulting federalist system meant that most political activity in America would occur at the local and state level, rather than at the federal level. <p><table width="160" align="left" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, of course, the opposite is true. Over the course of the 20th century, the federal government has vastly grown in size and power. This expansion occurred largely because Congress, with the acquiescence of the Supreme Court, has long acted beyond its authority and outside the limited powers granted to it. The Tenth Amendment has become, in the eyes of the Supreme Court at least, "but a truism."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But my complaints are more practical than theoretical. Never before have local authorities exercised less control over local life. Federal judges run our jails, bus our children, manage our schools, determine the rights of municipal employees, detail the conditions under which art can be displayed on city property, and the list goes on. The weakening of the Tenth Amendment directly and unduly circumscribes my authority, as the mayor of a large American city, to perform my legitimate duties. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Several recent statutes, in my opinion, are in clear violation of the Tenth Amendment. Consider the Americans with Disabilities Act. Although it was passed with good intentions, the ADA mandates compliance with some of the most minutely detailed specifications ever issued by Congress. Under this statute, we are now negotiating with the Justice Department the precise angle of slope on sidewalk ramps we want to construct for the wheelchair-bound. If we don't even control our sidewalks anymore, what exactly is left of local authority? What Congress views as "good deeds" often undermine both the principles of federalism and the value inherent in a government that is close to the voter. By mandating another set of federal laws, the much heralded Motor Voter Act denies states and local authorities discretion in how best to register their own voters. And it all but orders the use of local tax dollars to achieve this federal objective.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most pestiferous offender is the federal judiciary itself. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling had the effect of extending the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local governments. This decision raised eyebrows among even the most liberal interpreters of constitutional law. FLSA rates do little more than "protect" our cities' strongest unions by mandating generous overtime rates and work weeks. (I was recently sued by a police captain I had prosecuted for theft back when I was the D.A.; he argued that his punishment entitled him to overtime pay.) The practical effect of this ruling is that nonfederal units of government must negotiate employee compensation and overtime rates in the fashion that Congress demands--however minute the level of detail.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	American tax policy is being increasingly decided by unelected federal judges, rather than by elected local representatives. By delving even deeper in state and local matters, federal courts are increasingly mandating nonfederal tax hikes by requiring things like new prison construction or huge property-tax increases to pay for federal social experiments like forced busing. The first time an unelected authority in a faraway place imposed taxation without representation on this country, our forefathers declared independence from England.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Yet, despite our best chance in a generation to right this constitutional wrong, conservatives have focused their collective energies on preventing unfunded mandates. Although unfunded mandates allow Congress to avoid tough decisions, this crusade misses the point. Let's concentrate on reducing the federal government, not making sure its excesses are well funded.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Disregard for the Tenth Amendment endangers the very notion upon which the whole American experiment is based. If the design of the Framers is to survive into the next century -- if local authority is to be preserved in the face of an ever-expanding national government -- the federal government's focus must be readjusted to concentrate on its national role and purpose. Weaving the limited government principles of the Tenth Amendment back into the basic fabric of American politics is a good place to start.

<p><blockquote>
	"We must, however, continue to express our concerns about mandated Medicaid expansions. States do not have the luxury of operating a budget deficit. Every mandated dollar that we spend is a real dollar that has to be taken from another program."  Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, June 7, 1990

<a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Relationship Between Total Expenditures and Medicaid Spending, 1990-2002<br>
<a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a>: States With More Than 50% Increase in Medicaid Payments Supported by Their Own State Revenue, 1990-2002<br><p>
While attention recently has focused on the problems of the Medicare system, Congress shortly will try to tackle another health care financial time bomb in the form of Medicaid, the health care program serving the nation's poor. If significant reforms are not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to Medicaid. And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the rate for total state spending, states will be forced either to increase taxes or to divert money from other programs.
<p>
Medicaid is a state-administered program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
	The cost of Medicaid to the federal government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid costs will almost double by 2002.
<p>
	Although the financial impact on the federal government under current law is alarming, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid. States can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal rules requiring that certain levels of coverage be provided to certain populations.
<p>
	To examine the probable future budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend using certain assumptions to forecast the state share of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002. First, the Heritage analysis assumes no change in the current Medicaid program. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level Medicaid burden if Congress does nothing to reform this program. Second, where possible, a state's Medicaid spending trend is adjusted by expected changes in state economic activity, by forecasted changes in the eligible population, and by the trend in federal Medicaid transfers to the state.
<p>
	The forecasts for future state Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between historical Medicaid spending changes and fluctuations in the state's economic activity and Medicaid-eligible population. In four cases, however, the relationship was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in spending; these are identified with an asterisk on <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Table 1</a>. This table shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the states are to meet their projected Medicaid expeditures.
<P>

Highlights
<p>
	Between 1995 and 2002, if no reforms are enacted, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money on Medicaid. Total state Medicaid spending over this period is projected to be $1,730 billion, of which $1,042 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 19 percent of its revenues to the health care program.
<p>
	As <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the twelve-year period between 1990 and 2002.
<p>
	Some individual states will be particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $21.5 billion in new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $20 billion; Florida, $15.2 billion; Pennsylvania, $13.7 billion; and Texas $8.6 billion. If these states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $294 per year; New York, by $427; Florida, by $441; Pennsylvania, by $427; and Texas by $211.
<p>
	This rapid growth in the state's Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation infrastructure (see <a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state Medicaid spending that is growing at a rate of 11 percent, while total state spending should grow at an 8 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8 percent rate.
<P>
	Again, some states will be hit particularly hard. <a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a> shows those states that are forecasted to have increases in Medicaid spending from their own revenues that are greater than 50 percent.
<p>

Technical Assumptions
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the additional funds states would need to raise to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<P>
	We assumed no change in the current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. We used this as the basic structure of future Medicaid spending.
<P>
	These baseline forecasts of state Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher federal Medicaid program spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $98 billion over the period 1996 to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Terrorism is a cancer that has plagued the Middle East for
decades. It is now metastasizing into new and more deadly forms that
pose grave challenges to the United States and the West. Middle
Eastern terrorists are striking outside their home region, boldly
attacking high-profile targets, and killing in a more indiscriminate
manner. Last year the U.S., which had never suffered a major terrorist
attack on its soil by Middle Eastern terrorists, was rocked by the
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, which killed six
Americans and wounded over 1,000. This was the highest casualty toll
ever recorded for a single terrorist incident. A subsequent bombing
campaign against targets in New York City was stopped in its tracks in
June 1993 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombing embodies several ominous trends in
Middle Eastern terrorism. It epitomizes the drift toward large-scale,
indiscriminate violence. It also underscores the degree to which
radical Islamic extremists have supplanted radical nationalists, such
as the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the chief Middle Eastern
terrorist threat to the U.S. Moreover, radical Islamic groups are
inciting Sunni (orthodox) Muslims to support revolutionary terrorism
in Egypt and Algeria, just as radical Shia Muslims were incited by the
Iranian revolution. Finally, the Sudanese connection of several of the
bombers demonstrates how Sudan has become the "new Lebanon" -- a host
for a wide variety of terrorist groups and an important bridge between
Shia Iranian radicals and the new wave of Sunni Arab radicals.
<P>
     The United States cannot afford to ignore the wake-up calls
presented by the World Trade Center bombing and the foiled Iraqi-
sponsored assassination attempt against former President George Bush
during his April 1993 visit to Kuwait. The taboo against international
terrorist attacks inside the country and against important national
symbols has been broken. Washington must lead a concerted
international effort to make such terrorist attacks more difficult,
more costly to the perpetrators, and more risky for the states that
back them.

<P>
     The Worldwide Spread of Middle Eastern terrorism. The U.S. is by
no means the only country to feel the wrath of Middle Eastern
terrorists in recent months. In July, 117 people were killed in a
series of four bombings in nine days that swept Argentina, Panama, and
Britain. Most, if not all, of this carnage is believed to be the
handiwork of the world's most deadly terrorist organization --
Hezbollah (Party of God), an Iranian-sponsored and Syrian-backed
terrorist group based in Lebanon that perpetrated the October 1983
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. In August, radical
Islamic terrorists seeking to overthrow the Algerian government killed
two Chinese and five French citizens in Algeria, as part of a
terrorist campaign against foreigners that has claimed 60 lives since
September 1993.
<P>
     Yet, the U.S. and its citizens have been the world's foremost
targets of international terrorism in recent years. The FBI estimates
that 32 percent of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1982 to 1992 were
targeted against Americans or American property. (FBI Terrorist
Research and Analytical Center, "Terrorism in the United States:
1982-1992" (Washington D.C., 1993), p. 11.) Middle Eastern terrorism
remains the greatest terrorist threat to the United States. Although
some 20 percent of all international terrorist incidents from 1982 to
1992 have been traced to Middle Eastern quarrels, these incidents have
accounted for about 35 percent of terrorist-related fatalities.
(Testimony of terrorism expert Brian Jenkins before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on International Security,
International Organizations and Human Rights, March 12,1993.) Middle
Eastern terrorist incidents repeatedly have drawn the U.S. into
international crises. State-sponsored terrorist attacks against
Americans have triggered U.S. military retaliation against Iran, Iraq,
and Libya. 
<P>
     Iran has been the foremost state sponsor of terrorism since the
1979 Iranian revolution. But terrorist attacks against Western targets
dropped off after the 1989 election of President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who was more interested in rebuilding Iran with Western
help than in exporting revolution. Now that Rafsanjani is steadily
losing ground to more radical leaders in a bitter internal power
struggle, there could be an escalation of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.
Indeed, this may already have started to happen with Hezbollah's July
bombing campaign.
<P>
     Despite the growing danger, the Clinton Administration has failed
to mount a credible effort to stem the tide of terrorism. Although it
pays lip service to counterterrorism, the Administration unwisely
remains wedded to a State Department reorganization plan that would
downgrade the Office of Counterterrorism and signal friends and foes
that fighting terrorism is not a high priority. To more fully protect
American citizens from the scourge of Middle Eastern terrorism, the
Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
  <P>   The Administration should shelve its plan to downgrade the status
of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and make
terrorism a top permanent agenda item at the annual G-7 summits.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare.
<P>     Treating it as a purely criminal matter does not effectively
address the issue of state-supported terrorism.
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible.
 <P>   Raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military costs of
state terrorism to the point where they exceed the expected benefits.
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups. 
 <P>    Washington increasingly should apply public pressure on allied
governments, particularly in Europe, that appease terrorist states.
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
 <P>    The use or threat of force is an essential deterrent to state-
supported terrorism.
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism.
 <P>    Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey require firm U.S. support and
close cooperation against international terrorism.
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
 <P>    The FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies need to expand
their sources of human intelligence on international terrorism and
consult closely with allies and other concerned states.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security.
<P>     Deportation proceedings should be streamlined, political asylum
requests should be screened more quickly and decisively and visas
should be denied to members of groups that use, support, or advocate
terrorism. Federal criminal penalties for visa and passport forgeries
should be toughened.
<P>
Work to restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist
groups thrive. 
  <P>   The U.S. should back efforts by the governments of Lebanon and
Afghanistan to roll back the influence of Islamic radicals and
dismantle terrorist training camps.
<P>
THE UPSURGE IN RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM OUTSIDE THE MIDDLE EAST
<P>
     Middle Easterners are the prime suspects in a series of four
terrorist attacks against far-flung Western targets in July. On July
18 a car bomb destroyed a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires,
killing 96 people and wounding more than 200. The next day a bomb
destroyed a commuter plane in Panama, killing 21, most of them Jewish
businessmen. A car bomb exploded outside the Israeli Embassy in
Lebanon on July 27, wounding 13 people. The next day another car bomb
demolished the London offices of a Jewish charity organization.
<P>
     A previously unknown group calling itself Ansarallah (Partisans
of God) claimed responsibility for the Buenos Aires and Panama
bombings. American intelligence specialists believe that the group is
a subsidiary of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based radical Shiite terrorist
organization. Sheik Sobhi Toufeili, the leader of Hezbollah's most
militant faction, is suspected of being the leader of the group.
(Louise Lief, "Partisans of Terror," U.S. News and World Report,
August 8, 1994, p. 36.) There has been speculation that the attacks
were meant to derail the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, because the
bombings straddled Jordanian King Hussein's July trip to Washington to
sign a non-belligerency accord with Israel. A more likely explanation,
however, is that this spate of terrorism was a spillover of the
intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon. 
<P>
     Hezbollah undoubtedly was smarting over Israel's capture of one
of its leaders, Mustafa Dirani, in Lebanon on May 21. The radical
Islamic terrorists also may have been angry over Israel's June 2 air
strike that killed some 45 of its cadres in Lebanon. Israeli and
American intelligence officials are said to have little doubt that
Iran also was behind the July 18 Buenos Aires bombing. (Testimony of
Steven Emerson, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations
and Human Rights, August 1, 1994.) Up to 20 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, who train and equip Hezbollah forces, apparently were killed
in the June 2 air strike. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore World's
Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.) Iran
was implicated in a similar terrorist operation in Argentina that took
the lives of 29 people in March 1992. Hezbollah claimed responsibility
for that bombing, which destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires,
possibly retaliating for an earlier Israeli attack that killed its
military chief. Electronic intelligence intercepts and an extensive
forensic investigation revealed that Iranian officials had helped
acquire the plastic explosives used in that 1992 bombing. (Steven
Emerson, "Diplomacy That Can Stop Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal,
July 22, 1994, p. A10.) Iran also has been implicated in the July 18
Buenos Aires bombing by an Iranian defector questioned by Argentine
criminal investigators. (Gabriel Escobar, "Iranian Diplomats Said to
Be Suspects in Blast at Argentine Jewish Center," The Washington Post,
July 29, 1994, p. A27.) 
<P>
     The string of bombings in July greatly concerns U.S.
counterterrorism officials. They are worried about the ability of
Hezbollah terrorists to mount a sustained, coordinated, and well-
organized terrorist campaign against targets all over the globe. (The
car bomb used against the Israeli Embassy in London was delivered by a
woman, a fact that has led some experts to doubt involvement of
Hezbollah in that particular attack, because the organization
previously has condemned the use of women in terrorist actions.
Nevertheless, the possibility that a secular terrorist group carried
out that attack does not necessarily let Iran off the hook, because
Tehran has used secular groups such as the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine - General Command.) The attacks apparently
were planned well in advance and utilized local support networks for
reconnaissance and preparation. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore
World's Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.)
The July 19 mid-air bombing of a Panamanian commuter plane is
especially troubling because it may be the first suicide terrorist
attack on an airliner. (British counterterrorism officials secretly
have warned British airlines to be on guard for suicide bombers. Jamie
Dettner, "Airlines Warned of Suicide Bombers," The Washington Times,
August 8, 1994, p. A15.) 
  <P>   

 THE CONTINUING MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING
<P>
     The February 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center was a
curious terrorist operation. On the one hand it was well-planned and
professional; the terrorists were able secretly to construct and
deploy a massive truck bomb. On the other hand, it was a surprisingly
amateurish operation. The four terrorists convicted of the attack took
unnecessary risks, such as giving a correct name and address when
renting a vehicle for delivering the bomb.
<P>
     So far, no foreign state has been found responsible for the World
Trade Center attack. But there are disturbing shreds of circumstantial
evidence that point to possible Iranian or Iraqi involvement. Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and
possibly directed the bombers, long has been on the Iranian payroll,
according to Vincent Cannistraro, the former head of CIA
counterterrorism operations. (Bill Gertz, "Iran Backs Terrorist
Networks in U.S., Canada," The Washington Times, March 17, 1993, p.
A7.) Sheik Omar regularly was given large sums of money by Iran's
intelligence service, using Iran's delegation to the United Nations as
a conduit. ("Washington Whispers," U.S. News and World Report, May 31,
1993, p. 23.) U.S. government investigators discovered that about
$100,000 was transferred to the suspects before the bombing from banks
in foreign countries, including Iran, but it is not known if this was
payment for the attack or for other activities such as propaganda or
recruitment. (Ralph Blumenthal, "$100,000 Is Linked to Trade Center
Suspects," The New York Times, April 25, 1993, p. 41.)
<P>
     Other signs point toward Iraq. For instance, the attack took
place during the second anniversary of the ground offensive against
Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. Terrorist attacks launched on
anniversaries historically have been a common means of seeking
vengeance in the Middle East. Another troubling circumstance is that
Ramzi Yousef, who apparently set the plot in motion, entered the U.S.
in 1992 on an Iraqi passport on a trip that began in Iraq. Moreover,
Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi suspect who cooperated with the FBI and was
released from jail, later flew back to Iraq and is now believed to be
living in Baghdad. Many New York law enforcement officials reportedly
believe that Iraq was involved, although they can not prove it.
(Laurie Mylroie, "World Trade Center Bombing -- The Case of Secret
Cyanide," The Wall Street Journal, July 26, 1994, p. A16.)
<P>
     Iraq also would seem to have more to gain from such a terrorist
operation than Iran. Saddam would have had a strong incentive to
punish the U.S. for its role in Desert Storm. Iraq also may have
wanted to provoke a confrontation between the U.S. and its arch-rival
Iran by casting suspicion on Tehran for the bombing. This would
strengthen Iraq's perceived value in the Middle East as a bulwark
against revolutionary Iran, an argument Iraqi diplomats have made in
attempts to persuade members of the United Nations Security Council to
lift the U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq. (Iraq also had
sponsored a similarly deceptive terrorist operation in June 1982, when
it ordered the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian
terrorist group, to shoot the Israeli Ambassador to Britain, an act
which provoked Israel to punish the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) by invading Lebanon to destroy its base camps. The payoff for
Iraq was that the Israelis dealt Iraq's rival Syria a sharp military
setback in the course of the Lebanon War, and precluded Syria from
joining its ally Iran in its 1980-1988 war with Iraq.)
<P>
     A final disquieting consideration was the nature of the World
Trade Center bomb itself. Not only was the bomb huge, loaded with
1,200 pounds of explosives, but it was customized with compressed
hydrogen to magnify the blast and sodium cyanide to create a poisonous
cloud after the explosion. (The sodium cyanide apparently burned up
completely instead of turning into a gas. See Mylroie, op. cit., p.
A16.) A bomb that big and sophisticated has never before been
detonated by a terrorist group that did not have state sponsorship or
long-standing experience in building explosive devices.
<P>
THE NEW BREED OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombers are a new breed of terrorist.
Unlike the tightly disciplined cells that dominated terrorism in the
past, they functioned in a loosely organized ad hoc manner. Three of
the six charged with the bombing were dedicated followers of Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the fiery spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, a
radical fundamentalist movement that has waged a terrorist campaign to
overthrow the Egyptian government.
<P>
     At least three of the six bombers had fought in the war in
Afghanistan against Soviet and Afghan communists. The Sheik also made
at least three visits there since 1980 and two of his sons reportedly
fought there. Thousands of Muslims from roughly 40 countries flocked
to Afghanistan following the 1979 Soviet invasion. (Pakistani
officials estimated that at least 2800 foreign Muslims remained in
Afghanistan in 1993. Edward Gargan, "Where Arab Militants Train and
Wait," The New York Times, August 11, 1993, p. A8.) Radicalized
veterans from the Afghan war -- called by some journalists the
"University of Jihad"(Holy War) -- have returned home and have become
the spearheads of radical Islamic movements in Algeria, Azerbaijan,
Bosnia, Egypt, Sudan, and many other places around the world. (Tim
Weiner, "Blowback From the Afghan Battlefield," The New York Times
Magazine, March 13, 1994, p. 53.) Hundreds of these "Afghanis" are
being trained by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Sudanese training
camps.
<P>
     Radical Islamic movements have mushroomed not only in the Muslim
world, but also among Muslim immigrants in the West. The World Trade
Center bombers were all either recent immigrants or illegal aliens.
Although they may have been drawn to America by economic opportunities
and political freedoms, these terrorists rejected America's values and
what they considered to be its degenerate culture of materialism and
secularism. Rejecting assimilation into the resented society of their
host country, they were susceptible to incitement by Sheik Omar. What
they did mirrors what happened in several other terrorism cases, such
as Hezbollah's 1985-1986 bombing campaign in France and its bombings
in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994. In all three cases, small portions
of local immigrant communities provided support for the terrorist
operations. 
<P>
     Ironically, many radical Islamic movements outlawed in their own
countries have found sanctuary in Western countries. So long as they
are in the West, they cannot be arrested by the police back home. Like
Sheik Omar, leaders of these radical movements lambaste their host
countries while taking advantage of their open political systems to
travel freely, organize politically, raise funds, recruit new members,
support underground opposition movements in their home countries, and
sometimes to direct terrorist activities. Germany long has been a base
for Islamic extremists. (German intelligence officials estimate that
about 700 Arab extremists live there, along with over 42,000 other
foreign extremists. Jim McGee, "U.S. Pledges Global Pursuit in
Bombing," The Washington Post, March 13, 1993.) The U.S. has become a
safe haven for Hezbollah, the Islamic Group, Algerian fundamentalists,
and Palestinian fundamentalists. Israeli officials claim that Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement), the radical Palestinian Islamic group
that is using terrorism to undermine the nascent Palestinian-Israeli
peace, actually is directed from a headquarters in the United States.
(Ehud Yaari, "A Safe Haven for Hamas in America," The New York Times,
January 27, 1993.) 
<P>
     The support networks that these terrorist groups are forming
inside the U.S. for fundraising, recruitment, and propaganda
activities could become the nucleus for terrorist attacks on American
soil. These potential terrorists are dangerous because, unlike hit
teams dispatched from the Middle East, they are now blending into
Western societies where they have established personal and communal
roots. U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that "sleeper cells"
already established inside the U.S. could lie dormant for many years
until activated for specific terrorist actions. (The FBI discovered a
sleeper cell of the Abu Nidal organization inside the U.S. in 1986 and
arrested four Palestinian members in April 1993 after one member of
the group murdered his daughter. See William Carley, "A Trail of
Terror," The Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Moreover, the decentralized structure of many of the radical
Islamic movements makes it difficult for host governments to detect,
defend against, or apprehend terrorists lurking within these
movements. The loosely linked informal webs of Islamic militants,
often organized in small groups around a charismatic cleric, are
harder to track and infiltrate than the more rigidly organized
Palestinian terrorist groups that have been a major threat for
decades. The Palestinian groups had a more straightforward
organization and often were corrupt and therefore susceptible to
bribery. They also were easier to penetrate because infighting between
rival organizations led them to provide information on each other.
<P>
     The new breed of radical Islamic terrorist is more intractable,
less likely to betray other terrorists, and more unpredictable. In
contrast to long-established Palestinian terrorist groups who had more
predictable targets and objectives, Islamic radicals have more unclear
motives and a wider variety of targets. They not only attack Israel,
secular governments in Muslim countries, and states that support the
secular regimes they oppose, they also target reporters with whom they
disagree, intellectuals they despise (such as Salman Rushdie, the
author of The Satanic Verses), and Western cultural institutions such
as the American University in Beirut. 
<P>
     Most Palestinian terrorist groups refrained from assaulting
Americans or launching attacks on American soil. The reason: they
wanted to influence American public opinion to change U.S. foreign
policy and to drive a wedge between Israel and America. They made the
cold-blooded political calculation that killing Americans would hurt,
rather than help their political cause. 
<P>
     This self-imposed restraint often is not as strong among Islamic
militants. This new breed of terrorist is hostile not only to American
policies, but to many American values. For example, they reject
secular law and democracy and the separation of church and state. They
view American culture as a threat to Islamic piety and revile what
they perceive to be the degenerate secular and materialist bias of
American society. To Islamic radicals, the U.S. is the villainous
successor of the European colonial empires that have sought to
dominate the Middle East since the time of the crusades. In their holy
war against the West, terrorism is an acceptable instrument for
carrying out the will of God. Because they are motivated by
apocalyptic zeal, and not sober political calculations, their choice
of possible targets is much wider and more indiscriminate than that of
other terrorists. Since they are less predictable, they can be more
dangerous than Palestinian or other Middle Eastern terrorists.
<P>
     Islamic radicals also often have a different audience in mind
than Palestinian nationalists. Instead of using terrorism to influence
Western powers to change their policies, they often use terrorism to
punish Western powers and inspire other Muslims to rise up against the
West. This focus on the Muslim audience rather than an American
audience helps explain how the bombers of the World Trade Center could
rationalize their bloody actions. The bombing was meant to demonstrate
the power of Islamic radicals and the vulnerability of the U.S., not
to lead the U.S. to rethink its Middle East policy.
<P>
THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM
<P>
     The Middle East is a hotbed of state-sponsored terrorism. Five of
the seven states that have been branded by the U.S. government as
sponsors of international terrorism-- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and
Syria--are located in the region. (Cuba and North Korea are the other
two on the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism.)
Moreover, 22 of the 41 major international terrorist groups described
in the State Department's annual report on global terrorism are based
in the Middle East. (See U.S. Department of State, Patterns of Global
Terrorism: 1993, April 1994, Appendix B.) The region not only is
infested with more terrorist groups than any other region, but these
groups subscribe to a wider variety of ideologies and causes, ranging
from Marxism to secular Arab, Armenian, Kurdish, and Palestinian
nationalism to radical Islamic fundamentalism. Each year the Middle
East is the world's foremost exporter of terrorism, with most of the
spillover afflicting Western Europe. (Between 1980 and 1989 over 400
terrorist actions spilled over from the Middle East to other regions,
with 87 percent of these actions occurring in Western Europe. Paul
Wilkinson, "Terrorism, Iran and the Gulf Region," Jane's Intelligence
Review, May 1992, p. 222.)
<P>
     Because of the heavy concentration of terrorist states and
terrorist groups, most new trends in terrorism develop in the Middle
East, then spread quickly to other regions. Radical Palestinian groups
such as the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP) pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings after the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. When improved airport security measures made hijacking
more difficult, Palestinian groups such as the 15 May organization
were in the forefront of the trend of airline bombings. 
<P>
     Most terrorist groups prior to 1970 were autonomous organizations
of indigenous dissidents that pursued their own agendas without
outside support. (Neil Livingston and Terrell Arnold, eds., Fighting
Back: Winning the War Against Terrorism (Lexington, Mass: D.C. Heath,
1986) p. 12.) During the 1970s the Soviet Union and its satellites
greatly expanded their support for terrorist groups. Moscow often used
Middle Eastern client states such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, and the
former People's Democratic Republic of South Yemen as intermediaries
to mask Soviet arms, training, intelligence, and logistical support
for a wide variety of terrorist groups. 
<P>
     The radical Arab states, which regularly used terrorism as a tool
of repression against internal opposition, sought their own terrorist
surrogates to wield as weapons against Israel, Western powers, and
other Middle Eastern states. Libya, Syria, and Iraq courted
Palestinian splinter groups or created their own Palestinian puppet
organizations to buttress their claims to Arab leadership. These
puppets also were used as proxy terrorists who, if caught, would not
bring down retaliation on the head of the state sponsor.
<P>
     The 1979 Iranian revolution brought Iran into the forefront of
international terrorism. Iran organized, trained, equipped, and
financed Shiite revolutionary movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon
and Ad Dawa (The Call) in Iraq and the Gulf States. Under Iranian
supervision, Hezbollah unleashed a lethal terrorist campaign in 1983
to drive the Western peacekeeping forces out of Lebanon, bombing the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April and the Marine barracks in October.
After Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected President in 1989,
Iranian support for international terrorism was toned down and the
Western hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon gradually were released
by the end of 1991. But assassinations of Iranian exile leaders
continued at an alarming pace. Government-sponsored terrorism also was
supplemented by terrorism financed by Iranian so-called charitable
foundations, many of which are controlled by radical clerics opposed
to many of Rafsanjani's policies. One of these, the Fifteenth of
Khordad Foundation, has put a $2 million bounty on the head of Salman
Rushdie, condemned to death as a blasphemer by Ayatollah Khomeini in
1989. (Rushdie's publishers, translators, and bookstores that sell his
books have been targeted for terrorist attacks. In the last five years
113 people have died in violence related to the Rushdie affair in more
than 20 countries. See Bizhan Torabi, "The West, Iran Deadlocked Over
Rushdie," The Washington Times, February 16, 1994, p. A13.) 
<P>
     President Rafsanjani's power steadily has been eroded by radical
rivals who have gained dominance over the Iranian parliament. He is a
lame duck, prohibited by the Iranian constitution from running for re-
election for a third term in 1996. As the struggle to succeed him
intensifies, there is a good chance that Iran's support for terrorism
will escalate. The West and the U.S. make convenient targets for hard-
liners in their fight to seize power. In fact, Iran already has become
more aggressive in supporting terrorism. In addition to suspected
Iranian involvement in the July bombings in Buenos Aires and London,
three Iranians await trial in Thailand for an attempt to bomb the
Israeli Embassy in Bangkok in March. In April, the British government
charged that it had clear evidence of growing contacts between Irish
Republican Army terrorists and Iranian embassies in Europe. (In
addition to providing money and possibly arms to the I.R.A., London
charged that Iran also was building links to the Syria-based Japanese
Red Army. Stewart Dalby, "Iran Accused of Terrorist Links," Financial
Times, April 29, 1994, p. 1.) In May, more than 300 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards arrived in Bosnia to organize Muslim militias and
terrorist groups, according to U.S. intelligence sources. (Bill Gertz,
"Iranians Move into Bosnia to Terrorize Serbs," The Washington Times,
June 2, 1994, p. A1.)
<P>
TOWARD A MORE EFFECTIVE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY
<P>
     The U.S. has an historic opportunity to crack down on Middle East
terrorism. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Empire
have deprived Middle Eastern terrorist states of superpower backing.
The embryonic peace agreement between Israel and the PLO has reduced
one source of terrorism, although Palestinian rejectionists both
within and outside the PLO continue their terrorist war against
Israel. Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War and subsequent isolation has
constrained state support from that quarter, particularly as long as
Baghdad moderates its policies in an effort to wriggle out of U.N.-
sponsored economic sanctions. Iran and Libya are isolated and beset by
substantial economic problems caused in part by low oil prices.
Sudan's radical Islamic regime is drained by a long-running civil war
and a grim economic situation. Syria faces a precarious future as
President Hafez al-Assad, not in the best of health, plots his
personal political endgame. 
<P>
     All of these Middle Eastern regimes, which have exported so much
terrorism-related misery, are simultaneously vulnerable on a number of
different fronts. In the past they have been able to shrug off Western
demands to halt their support of terrorism. But now that they have
lost Soviet backing and have become increasingly dependent on the West
for economic support, that is no longer true. The West now has more
influence and leverage over these states. Moreover, many of these
regimes are threatened by internal political opposition, or the
prospect of such opposition in the near future. The U.S. and other
Western powers, therefore, gain potential leverage by supporting or
threatening to support opposition groups hostile to terrorist regimes.
<P>
     While the threat or actual use of force is the ultimate deterrent
to terrorism, experienced terrorist states and groups often are
successful in concealing their responsibility for terrorist outrages
to avoid military reprisals. To deter terrorism, Washington must
convince its allies and other concerned states to increase the
diplomatic, economic, military,and political costs of state-supported
terrorism. A unified Western campaign to curtail Middle Eastern
terrorism now has a greater chance for success than ever before. Only
the U.S. can forge and lead such a coalition. To build an
international consensus to combat terrorism and to follow through and
act on that consensus, the Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration must drop its short-sighted plan for
downgrading the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism. This
reorganization plan would fold that office into a new Bureau for
Narcotics, Terrorism and Crime and demote the Coordinator for
Counterterrorism from the current equivalent of an Assistant Secretary
of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. L. Paul Bremer,
a former Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism, noting that the
office would be "gutted," charged that: "The Clinton Administration
has neglected the terrorist threat, with our public officials paying
only lip service to the problem." (L. Paul Bremer, "With Assad, Talk
About Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal, January 14, 1994, p. A10.)
   <P>
	Congress has temporarily blocked the Administration's plans.
Under the leadership of Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), the
House voted on April 18, 1994, to retain an independent Office of
Counterterrorism. But the Administration has not given up on its
reorganization plan, which originated in the Bush Administration as a
cost-cutting measure. 
<P>
     Congress will again have to wrestle with the reorganization plan
after April 30, 1995, when the Gilman amendment expires. At that time,
Congress should consider insisting that the Administration permanently
shelve its plans to downgrade State's counterterrorism office. This
office instead must be given the bureaucratic clout to champion tough
anti-terrorism policies against other bureaus in the State Department,
or in other departments, that have little or no interest in combating
terrorism. Therefore, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, who is the
U.S. government's senior full-time counterterrorism official, must
have direct access to the Secretary of State, and not be relegated, as
the Administration plans, to the bottom of a cumbersome reporting
chain. To secure the diplomatic clout that is needed to impress U.S.
allies and terrorist nations, the Coordinator should be restored to
the status of ambassador-at-large, as was the case during the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
     Washington should aggressively raise the profile of the
counterterrorism issue by injecting it into every multilateral
diplomatic forum and every high-level bilateral meeting with officials
from allied governments or terrorist regimes. The U.S. should ensure
that the issue of terrorism appears automatically on the agenda at
every G-7 summit. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism should become a
permanent fixture at the summits as the prime mover in a multilateral
working group on counterterrorism.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare. 
<P>
     Terrorism is the most ubiquitous kind of low-intensity conflict.
Yet, it is too often treated primarily as a law enforcement issue.
While bringing the rule of law to bear on terrorists is desirable, it
is not always possible, particularly when terrorists are being
protected by a state sponsor. In cases of state-supported terrorism,
which the CIA estimates comprise up to 80 percent of all international
terrorism, it is not realistic to rely solely on law enforcement
agencies to fight terrorists. 
<P>
     State-supported terrorism is in effect an act of war and should
be approached as a form of surrogate warfare. The U.S. should not
unnecessarily hobble itself in this war against terrorism by treating
state-sponsored foreign terrorists the same as it treats domestic
terrorist groups. Counterterrorist forces should not require courtroom
standards of evidence before they take action. Adopting a narrow
legalistic approach to fighting terrorism would lead to American
paralysis and terrorism would proliferate unchecked. 
<P>
     The U.S. should make use of the full arsenal of its weapons
against terrorism by relaxing self-imposed restrictions on special
operations. For example, Executive Order No. 11905, signed in 1976,
was designed to prohibit assassinations of foreign leaders, but it
also has been interpreted as prohibiting commando assaults on
terrorist groups. This executive order should be refined to permit
such special operations, particularly against terrorist groups that
have killed Americans in the past, such as Hezbollah or the Abu Nidal
organization. Counterterrorist teams also should be deployed to
apprehend terrorists in anarchic areas such as Lebanon or Afghanistan,
and not just in international waters or airspace.
<P>
     The U.S. should also make greater use of non-violent covert
actions, such as the dissemination of disinformation to create
dissension inside terrorist groups and psychological warfare to
aggravate the terrorists' sense of vulnerability and to encourage
distrust of their state sponsors. Agents of influence, wherever they
can be inserted, would help to disrupt terrorist operations and turn
terrorists against each other. Sabotage operations also should be
launched against the safehouses, logistics support networks, and
financial assets of terrorist groups. 
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern states have relied heavily on state-sponsored
terrorism because it is a cost-effective tool to their foreign
policies. The U.S. should work with its allies and other concerned
states to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military
costs of supporting terrorism so high that it outweighs the strategic
benefits.
<P>
Diplomatic sanctions. 
<P>
     Countries victimized by terrorism in the past have broken
relations or reduced the size of the diplomatic mission of the state
sponsor. This helps limit the threat of terrorism, because much of it
is directed, supported, and financed by intelligence personnel
operating under diplomatic cover. But diplomatic sanctions usually
have been unilateral, ad hoc responses that have had little effect on
terrorist states. Washington should propose an agreement among the G-7
and NATO allies that would require all of them to expel large numbers
of diplomats, if not break diplomatic relations completely, with
states that support terrorist attacks. Moreover, diplomatic personnel
of these states should be expelled for each confirmed terrorist attack
by a surrogate terrorist group. 
<P>
     This measure would raise the public uproar over terrorism and
increase the costs of each attack. This may give pause to some
terrorist states, particularly those such as Iran and Sudan, that want
the West to bail them out of dire economic predicaments. At a minimum,
reducing the diplomatic presence of terrorist states will make it
harder for them to support terrorism out of their embassies. For
example, the expulsion of diplomats greatly undermined Iraq's ability
to export terrorism during the 1991 Gulf War. 
<P>
     Regardless of whether it can gain G-7 support for such an
agreement, the U.S. should pressure its allies to pare down the
diplomatic presence of Iranian and Sudanese diplomats in their
countries. Diplomats from Iran and Sudan have been implicated in the
July bombing in Buenos Aires and in the 1993 bomb plots in New York
City. The Iranian diplomatic presence particularly should be cut back
in Germany and Venezuela, which are centers for Iran's intelligence
and terrorist networks.
<P>
     Economic sanctions. Washington should persuade its allies to
participate in developing a multilateral version of the State
Department's list of states that support terrorism. Once placed on the
list, a terrorist state should be denied economic assistance, arms
sales, and preferential trade privileges from all participating
states. Further, the allies would be committed to voting against
financial aid for that state in international financial institutions
such as the World Bank. If Western Europe and Japan presented a united
front in threatening to impose sanctions, it could have a sobering
effect on the five Middle Eastern terrorist states. All, with the
possible exception of Libya, will require Western or Japanese economic
assistance, loans or renegotiation of existing loans in the near
future. Iran already is staggering under the financial burden of its
$30 billion foreign debt. Iraq owes foreign creditors more than $14
billion, Syria owes $16.5 billion, and Sudan's foreign debt is in
excess of $16 billion. Now that the Soviet Union has dissolved, they
have no place else to go. The U.S. should convince its allies to take
advantage of their financial leverage and elevate counterterrorism to
the forefront of economic aid and loan renegotiation decisions. 
<P>
     Trade sanctions against terrorist states will be more difficult
to extract from the Western Europeans and Japanese since they see
Iran, Iraq, and Libya as potentially lucrative export markets and
important sources of oil supplies. France and other countries already
are impatient to lift the U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq.
To block this, Washington should make Iraq a high-priority test case
for Western anti-terrorism cooperation. The U.S. should stress Iraq's
abortive plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his
visit to Kuwait in April 1993 (For more on Iraq's assassination plot,
see James A. Phillips, "Punish Saddam's Terrorism With Military
Action," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 358, June 11,
1993.) and Baghdad's continuing terrorist attacks on the Kurds and on
U.N. personnel in northern Iraq. To test Baghdad's intentions,
Washington should request the extradition of Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi who
participated in the plot to bomb the World Trade Center, who returned
to Iraq. (Yasin was seen outside his father's house in Baghdad by an
ABC News reporter earlier this year. Mylroie, op. cit.) If Baghdad
balks at observing the terms of the extradition treaty that it signed
with the U.S., then it clearly will be in violation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution Number 687 (April 1991), which called on Iraq to
abandon its support of terrorism. This violation could become a
justification for maintaining the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
<P>
     The Europeans have been more cooperative in imposing economic
sanctions on Libya for its refusal to extradite two suspects in the
1988 Pan Am flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. But these
U.N.-imposed sanctions have fallen short of an embargo on Libyan oil.
The U.S. should expand the sanctions to include Libya's oil exports.
Washington should work through the U.N. Security Council to impose an
oil export regime similar to the one imposed on Iraq: oil revenues
would be funneled into a U.N.-administered escrow account that could
be used to pay reparations to the families of victims of Libyan
terrorism. This could be a model to punish other terrorist states that
block international efforts to apprehend terrorists.
<P>
     Another terrorist state that is extremely vulnerable to concerted
international economic sanctions because of its crumbling economy is
Sudan. It already has sought to appease the West by turning over the
notorious Venezuelan-born terrorist Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias
"Carlos the Jackal," to France on August 15. (Carlos was a terrorist
playboy who had outlived his usefulness to Syria, which had harbored
him until 1991. Carlos's leftist politics did not endear him to
Sudan's radical Islamic regime.) 
<P>
     Iran will be a more difficult case because of the reluctance of
America's allies, particularly Germany and Japan, to sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests in exporting to Iran. Now that Iran is
having difficulty repaying its debts, foreign creditors may be more
willing to consider trade sanctions against Tehran. In any case, the
U.S. could strengthen its case for economic sanctions against Iran if
President Clinton blocks the proposed $750 million sale of up to 20
Boeing 737 jetliners to Iran and prohibits U.S. oil companies, the
largest purchasers of Iranian oil, from buying Iran's oil exports.
(American oil companies currently are prohibited from importing
Iranian oil into the U.S. but are allowed to buy it for resale
elsewhere. See James Phillips, "Containing Iran," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 980, March 9, 1994.)
<P>
     The U.S. should drive up the prospective political costs of
state-sponsored terrorism. This can be done by supporting opposition
groups in countries that engage in international terrorism. All Middle
Eastern terrorist states have generated domestic opposition.
Washington should provide diplomatic, economic, and even military
support to the most viable opposition groups in terrorist states. The
Kurds in Iraq, the resistance movements in southern Sudan, pro-Western
exile groups and the increasingly restless Azeris, Baluch, and Kurds
in Iran, and Libyan dissidents all merit increased American and
Western support. The Assad regime in Syria has brutally eliminated
most domestic opposition, but President Assad's persistent health
problems and the recent death of his son and heir apparent, Basil, has
increased uncertainty about the political durability of Syria's
minority Alawite regime. Although there may be no viable opposition
inside Syria in the short run, the U.S. should increase its diplomatic
support for an independent Lebanon free from Syrian domination. 
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups.
<P>
     Western Europe has borne the brunt of the spillover of Middle
Eastern terrorism, yet historically has been reluctant to take
determined action against it. Too often, European states have sought
to appease terrorist states and cut separate deals with them, rather
than take a unified stand against terrorism. Last October, Germany
hosted a visit by Iran's Minister of Intelligence and Security, Ali
Fallahiyan, the overseer of much of Iran's terrorist operations.
France appeased Iran last December by expelling two suspected Iranian
terrorists whose extradition had been sought by Switzerland for the
1990 assassination of an Iranian opposition leader in Geneva. 
<P>
     The U.S. must drive home to its allies that appeasement of
terrorism is a self-defeating policy that only encourages more
terrorism. France may be ripe for persuasion, now that an upsurge in
terrorist attacks against French citizens in Algeria led Paris to
crack down on exiled Algerian radicals in France in early August.
France now criticizes the U.S. and Germany for allowing exiled
Algerian radicals to continue to operate freely within their borders.
Washington should cooperate with France and closely monitor the
activities of Algerian radicals in the U.S., while pressing Paris to
support greater international cooperation in isolating terrorist
states, particularly Iran.
<P>
     Germany and Japan, the two biggest exporters to Iran, are the
weak links in Western efforts to isolate Iran. Both states argue that
they aid Iranian "moderates" by maintaining good trade and diplomatic
relations with Iran. This rationale has grown increasingly threadbare
in view of Iran's continued support of terrorism. Besides, Iran's
"moderates" are losing ground to more radical elements in Tehran who
are likely to escalate terrorism unless confronted with firm
international pressures. The U.S. should strongly warn Germany and
Japan, first privately and increasingly in public, that appeasement
only encourages Iran and other terrorist states to believe that
terrorism is cost-free. Worse, by conducting preferential trade
relations with Iran and granting it foreign aid and loans, Germany and
Japan are subsidizing Iran's terrorism. 
<P>
     Washington also should press its allies to establish a high-level
central office for coordinating counterterrorism policies. These
offices could act as liaisons with allied counterterrorism agencies.
Modeled on the U.S. Office of Counterterrorism, these offices would
help raise the profile of counterterrorism as an international issue
and make international cooperation more effective and timely.
Washington also should lobby all its allies to adopt stiffer penalties
for terrorism, including longer jail terms and the seizure of the
assets of terrorist groups or states. The Europeans, in particular,
should be pressed to stop releasing terrorists before their sentences
have been completed.
<P>
     Washington also should press Saudi Arabia to halt the flow of
financial aid to radical Islamic movements. Substantial sums of money
from private Saudi religious foundations and individuals have
bankrolled Sheik Abdul Rahman and other radical fundamentalists.
Riyadh placed restrictions on the flow of these funds outside the
country in 1993 but needs to more carefully control the activities of
the Islamic foundations to prevent them from meddling in the internal
affairs of other Muslim countries. 
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
<P>
     The use or threat of use of military force is essential for
punishing and deterring state-sponsored terrorism. The military
response should be designed to raise the cost of terrorism above the
price a terrorist state is willing to pay. The U.S. should not get
bogged down in a tit-for-tat exchange by limiting its attacks merely
to terrorist training camps. Instead, it should strike targets that
the terrorist state highly values, such as its internal security
forces and secret police. For example, if Iran or one of its
surrogates, such as Hezbollah, lashes out at an American target, the
U.S. should not content itself with destroying a few easily
replaceable terrorist camps in Lebanon or Iran. Rather, the U.S.
should attack Iran's Revolutionary Guards which train terrorists and
provide internal security, as well as Iran's Ministry of Intelligence
and Security.
<P>
     A sharp and decisive military reprisal not only can have a
deterrent effect on the terrorist state attacked, it also can have a
strong demonstration effect on other states that support terrorism.
For example, the April 1986 air strikes against Libya had a
significant impact on Syria as well as Libya. According to the State
Department, Libya reduced its involvement in international terrorism
from 19 incidents in 1986 to six in 1987, while Syrian involvement
fell from 34 in 1985 to six in 1986 and to one in 1987.
<P>
     Special operations are an important option for fighting
terrorists close to innocent civilians, in hostage rescue operations,
and in efforts to apprehend terrorist leaders. The Pentagon must make
an effort to maintain the strength and readiness of the Special
Operations Command which includes the elite "Delta Force," Army
Special Operations Forces, Navy Seals, Marine Reconnaissance teams,
and a special assault unit from the 101st Air Assault Division. These
forces should be periodically dispatched on anti-terrorism training
exercises in friendly Middle Eastern states to give them familiarity
with the region and experience with desert warfare. 
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorists pose much more of a threat to secular
and moderate regimes in the Muslim world than to the West. Islamic
revolutionary movements have used terrorism to undermine and
demoralize ruling governments, polarize societies, and intimidate
secular opposition. Terrorists have become the shock troops of Islamic
revolutionary movements seeking the overthrow of the governments of
Egypt and Algeria. The U.S. has a major stake in both countries. A
radical Islamic revolution in either of them would send shock waves
throughout the Arab world.
<P>
     Washington should steadfastly support the governments of Egypt
and Algeria in their efforts to reach an accommodation with political
opposition groups while firmly suppressing terrorists. American
diplomats should not meet publicly with radical Islamic leaders
because this could undermine the existing government. Nor should
Washington permit radical Islamic leaders, such as Tunisian
revolutionary Rashid el-Ghanoushi, to visit America unless they reject
terrorism. Nor should it pressure any government to enter talks with
any group that supports terrorism. Whenever possible the U.S. should
share its intelligence on terrorist groups and their supporters with
the governments battling revolutionary terrorists.
<P>
     In addition to supporting moderate Arab regimes threatened by
terrorism, the U.S. should cooperate closely with Turkey and Israel in
combating terrorism. Both countries are valuable sources of
intelligence on international terrorism and should be furnished with
American intelligence on terrorist activities in a timely manner. The
U.S. also should maintain relentless pressure on Syria to halt its
support for the Kurdish Workers Party and the Armenian Secret Army for
the Liberation of Armenia, two terrorist groups that have killed
scores of Turks. Moreover, Washington should strongly back Israel's
demand that any Syrian-Israeli peace agreement must include guarantees
that Syria will cease its support for Palestinian terrorists and help
end Hezbollah's rein of terror in Lebanon. 
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
<P>
     Fighting terrorism effectively requires detailed and timely
intelligence about the operations of terrorist groups, their support
networks and their state sponsors. The FBI has made effective use of
intelligence information to pre-empt at least 78 terrorist plots since
1982. (Estimate provided by Kevin Giblin, Senior Intelligence Officer
for Counterterrorism, FBI, in an August 3, 1993 Forum of the U.S.
Global Strategy Council entitled "Terrorism: The Next Phase?") But the
new breed of radical Islamic terrorists, organized in informal
amorphous groups, presents a new challenge for intelligence-gathering.
To maintain and expand its intelligence network, the FBI should make a
systematic effort to recruit Arab-Americans and American Muslims.
<P>
     The CIA needs to upgrade the volume and quality of its human
intelligence on terrorist groups and states. It must develop a more
extensive network of agents dedicated to counterterrorism intelligence
and infiltrate terrorist groups on a long-term basis. The CIA should
make every effort to recruit American and foreign personnel with
extensive knowledge of and experience in the cultures and societies of
their terrorist adversaries. The CIA's Counterterrorist Center,
created in 1986 by President Reagan after the hijacking of TWA flight
847, should be expanded and devote more resources to surveillance of
the new breed of radical Islamic terrorists. The National Security
Agency and various defense intelligence agencies should be directed to
give counterterrorism a higher priority in their intelligence-
gathering efforts. The Defense Department also should consider
dedicating more of its reconnaissance satellites to gathering
information on possible military targets related to terrorism, such as
terrorist bases and training camps in terrorist states and the Syrian-
controlled areas of Lebanon.
<P>
     In addition, the U.S. should improve its efforts to reward
informants who provide useful information about terrorist activities.
The State Department's International Counterterrorism reward program
provides monetary awards of up to $2 million for information on
terrorist activities against Americans. It has led to the defection of
more than ten terrorist informants and the prevention of nearly a
dozen acts of terrorism against Americans. This program should be
publicized more widely in the Middle East. A recent report that a
valuable informant was treated shabbily by the U.S. government is
disconcerting because it could lead the trickle of informants to dry
up. (See Jill Smolowe, "A Hero's Unwelcome," Time, May 9, 1994, p.
50.) Informants who risk their lives to provide important intelligence
should be promptly rewarded for their efforts.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. 
<P>
     Sheik Abdul Rahman and two of the World Trade Center bombers
entered the country illegally. They eventually were caught but were
allowed to remain in the country pending subsequent legal proceedings.
This situation is intolerable. Congress should reform the immigration
laws to accelerate deportation proceedings and simplify and
consolidate the lengthy procedural hearings and appeal system that
permit illegal and undocumented aliens to evade immigration controls.
Applicants for political asylum should be screened to weed out and
immediately deport those without a credible basis for asylum.
<P>
     Tougher penalties should be imposed on the production or use of
fraudulent passports and visas. Nine of the original 35 indictable
counts in the 1993 New York bombing plots involved visa or passport
offenses. The recently passed crime bill contains a measure that will
double the maximum prison terms for such crimes from 5 to 10 years
(and increase to 20 years if the documents were used to facilitate
terrorism) and boost fines from $2,000 to $250,000. A companion
measure sponsored by Representative Gilman, which currently is under
consideration by the House Judiciary Committee, would allow the
government to seize the assets of criminals convicted of creating or
using false documents for terrorism or drug smuggling. If passed, this
measure would make it harder for terrorists to obtain false documents.
<P>
     Finally, the U.S. government should automatically deny visas to
members of groups that advocate, support, or participate in terrorism.
Unfortunately, the 1990 Immigration and Naturalization Act killed the
provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act
that allowed the U.S. government to restrict the entry into the U.S.
of members of a group deemed a threat to U.S. security. The State
Department now wrings its hands over denying visas solely because of
membership in a terrorist group. This loophole, which puts the nation
at risk, needs to be closed. Congress should pass legislation that
enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners because of
membership in terrorist groups rather than requiring proof of personal
involvement in terrorist acts, as is now the case.
<P>
Restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist groups
thrive.
<P>
     Many of the World Trade Center bombers were supporters of the
radical Afghan group Hezbi Islami (Party of Islam) led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, a virulently anti-Western Islamic militant. Some reportedly
were trained in Hezbi Islami camps and fought in the Afghan war. The
U.S. should drop its short-sighted hands-off policy in Afghanistan
that has led it to remain neutral in the fighting between Hekmatyar's
Islamic zealots and the provisional government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani. With a limited commitment of financial aid, the
U.S. can greatly strengthen the ability of the moderate Afghan forces
to defeat Hekmatyar's drive to transform Afghanistan into a
revolutionary Islamic state. By bolstering Rabbani's regime, the U.S.
could help end the anarchy that gives terrorists a foothold in
Afghanistan. (See James Phillips, "Winning the Endgame in
Afghanistan," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 181, May 18,
1992.)
 <P>
    In addition, Washington should press Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to
end their support of Hekmatyar.
<P>
     The U.S. also should revive its efforts to build a stable and
independent Lebanon. Syria has sought to keep the Lebanese weak and
divided to assure its own dominance there. It has vetoed the efforts
of the Lebanese government to extend its control into southern Lebanon
and disarm Hezbollah. The U.S. should insist that Syria abide by the
terms of the 1989 Taif agreement, which require Syria to withdraw its
40,000 troops to eastern Lebanon and permit the Beirut government to
extend its control over its own territory. Only then will Lebanon
cease to be a staging area for international terrorism.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorism has become more unpredictable and
audacious. Radical Islamic terrorists inspired by Iranian, Algerian,
and Egyptian revolutionary movements have overshadowed Palestinian
nationalist terrorists as a threat to the West. These new terrorists
often are supported by networks of radical Islamic activists who live
in Muslim communities in the West. Even more worrisome is the
training, arms, financial support, and guidance which radical Islamic
terrorists receive from such states as Iran and Sudan. 
<P>
     International terrorism is not likely to be eradicated, but it
can be weakened considerably if increased diplomatic, economic,
political, and military pressure is brought to bear on the state
sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. must lead an international campaign to
raise the costs of terrorism. This will require a coordinated, firm,
and relentless international effort. This kind of cooperation paid off
in disarming Iraqi terrorism during the Gulf War, and it can work
again. The U.S. must convince its allies that they now are involved,
whether they want to be or not, in an international war against
terrorism.
<P>
     To do so, the Clinton Administration must do more to stop
international terrorism. It must shelve its misguided plan to
downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, toughen
its approach to terrorist states, and remain vigilantly on guard
against terrorist movements. Only then will its allies sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests to advance the long-term security
interests of the West and other targets of Middle Eastern terrorists.

<p>
<H2>NEW LAW REDEFINES THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<P>A new law pushed by the Clinton Administration redefines "family"
to include unmarried partners, including gays and lesbians.  This
promotes homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was signed into
law by President Clinton on October 22, 1994.  The Act permits
a federal employee to use sick leave to attend to the medical
needs of a family member.  The Act requires the Office of Personnel
Management to use the definition of "family member"
as found in the pre-existing leave transfer program.[1]
<P>
The leave transfer program defines "family member"; based
on the term "immediate relative" as it is used for funeral
leave purposes.  OPM clarifies the definition in the <I>Federal
Register:</I> "We recognize that there may be cases in which
the traditional concept of a family relationship is not applicable,
yet a close relationship to the leave recipient exists that is
the equivalent of a family relationship.  Examples include foster
children and step children."[2]
<P>
In December 1994, the Clinton Administration twisted the definition
of "family member" as outlined in the leave transfer
program to mean something entirely different when applied to the
new leave law.  OPM Director of Communications Janice Lachance
confirms that "family member" now includes "domestic
partners" of either sex.  "It's a recognition of how
family relationships have evolved," Lachance said.  "It's
an effort to respond to the realities that federal employees face
each and every day....The key thing to remember is the government
is getting out of the business of defining relationships."[3]
<P>
OPM's new definition for "family member" includes: "spouse,
and parents thereof; children, including adopted children and
spouses thereof; parents; brothers and sisters, and spouses thereof;
<I>and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close
association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship</I>."[4]
<P>
Representative Constance Morella (R-MD), a co-sponsor of the bill,
said the definition of family is "reasonable" because
it "covers everybody without getting into the particulars.
 It is accommodating different lifestyles without favoring one
over another."
<P>
<CENTER>
 <H3>WHAT TO DO?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
OPM has liberalized the definition of "family" in the
Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act to mean something
not allowed by the law.  The definition should be changed to mean
unambiguously only the natural family.  This could be accomplished
by striking the word "affinity" from OPM's new regulation.
 Alternatively, the Clinton Administration can grant this benefit
to other-than-family members by amending the regulation to allow
for "non-family members."  The 104th Congress has oversight
of any change.  
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was not designed
to expand the official definition of "family" to include
domestic partners, whether homosexual or heterosexual.  Rather,
it was intended to help federal employees in crisis and should
not be manipulated by the Clinton Administration to advance a
political agenda.

<TITLE>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE, NOT WELFARE</TITLE>
<BODY>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE,<BR>
NOT WELFARE</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The new Congress is planning to pass a major welfare reform initiative
that will encourage states to test some creative ideas for reducing
the number of people on the welfare rolls.  To date, much of the
debate has focused on ways to help welfare recipients become self
sufficient by requiring them to work for their benefits.
<P>
While "workfare" is a worthy idea, welfare reformers
need to do more than just get people off welfare.  They need to
devote serious attention to developing "preventative"
strategies for reducing the number of people who ever need welfare
in the first place.
<P>
A "preventative" strategy should focus squarely on the
primary cause of welfare dependency:  illegitimacy.  Three out
of ten births in the U.S. today are out-of-wedlock.  And few of
these never-married mothers bear any resemblance to the affluent,
upwardly-mobile Murphy Brown.  Instead, unmarried women who bear
children are five times more likely to live below the poverty
line than are married mothers.  And their children are much more
likely to suffer from abuse and neglect, and to drop out of school,
abuse drugs, commit crimes, and get pregnant out of wedlock.
<P>
To curb illegitimacy, Congressional reformers should step up efforts
to teach abstinence in schools, streamline adoption for out-of-wedlock
births, and reverse welfare policies that penalize marriage. 
The House GOP Contract With America takes some important first
steps in these areas.  It makes adoption expenses tax deductible,
eliminates welfare payments for all future cases involving unmarried
teen mothers, and sets aside money for developing a pro-marriage
tax credit for the poor.  
<P>
Moreover, some states have already taken modest steps to address
the welfare system's bias against marriage.  For example, under
the leadership of Governor Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin adopted a
"bridefare" policy in 1991 which provides higher benefits
for low-income married couples who marry or remain married.  More
recently, California has passed a "wedfare" law which
allows poor moms who marry an opportunity to retain health coverage
rather than being cut off from continued benefits.
<P>
Congress would do well to encourage states to adopt more pro-marriage
reforms of this kind.  Doing so would acknowledge that the primary
escape route from poverty 30 years after the adoption of liberal
Great Society programs is not welfare or workfare.  It is marriage.

<TITLE>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 1994</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN<BR>
ACT OF 1994</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act"
passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton on September
13, 1994 authorizes $1.6 billion to combat and study violence
against women, stiffens laws against sex offenders, and creates
prevention and treatment programs.[1]  The comprehensive statute
has seven subtitles, outlined below.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE STREETS FOR WOMEN"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Federal Penalties for Sex Crimes.  The law doubles prison sentences
for repeat sex offenders and mandates restitution for sex crimes.
 Sex offenders will pay the full amount of the victim's loss to
include medical services, transportation, temporary housing, child
care expenses, lost income, and attorney's fees.  Court decisions
to award restitution to victims will not consider the economic
circumstances of the offender nor the fact that the victim received
compensation from other sources.  The provision also authorizes
the appropriation of $1.5 million over three years to appoint
victim/witness counselors.
<P>
<LI> Law Enforcement and Prosecution Grants.  This provision amends
the 1968 Safe Streets Act to authorize grants to combat violent
crimes against women.  It is designed to develop and strengthen
law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes
against women.  It authorizes $800 million over six years.
<P>
<LI> Safety for Women in Public Transit and Public Parks.  This appropriates
$20 million to increase the safety of public transportation and
public parks by enhancing lighting systems, camera surveillance
and emergency telephone lines to contact law enforcement personnel.
<P>
<LI> New Evidentiary Rules.  This amends the federal rules of evidence
for sex offense cases.  It prohibits the admission of evidence
offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior
or establish a victim's "sexual predisposition."  Exceptions
are permitted in cases where the evidence proves that "a
person other than the accused committed the crime" or to
prove that the victim consented to the act.
<P>
<LI> Assistance to Victims of Sexual Assault.  This section of the
law has six provisions.
<P>
<UL><LI> It amends Title XIX of the Public Health and Human Services
Act to create education and prevention grants to reduce sexual
assault against women.  It authorizes $205 million over five years
for rape prevention seminars, hotlines, training programs for
professionals, and the production of information materials.
<P>
<LI> It provides $2 million over two years to train probation and
parole officers who work with released sex offenders.
<P>
<LI> It requires that a study be conducted to develop model legislation
that provides the maximum protection for the confidentiality of
communication between sexual assault or domestic violence victims
and their counselors.
<P>
<LI> It requires the Attorney General to ensure that all incarcerated
sex offenders are apprised of available sex offender treatment
programs.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $30 million over three years for the Runaway
and Homeless Act.  Grants may be made under this provision to
agencies that provide a street-based outreach, including treatment,
counseling, and referral for runaway, homeless, and street youth
who have been subjected to or are at risk of being subjected to
sexual abuse.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $38 million over five years for the Victims of
Child Abuse Act of 1990.</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE HOMES FOR WOMEN ACT OF 1994"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> National Domestic Violence Hotlines.  This provision creates
a national domestic violence hotline for $3 million over six years.
 It will be run by a private agency and will be toll-free, operate
24-hours-per-day and offer information relating to services for
victims of domestic violence to which callers may be referred
throughout the U.S., to include the availability of shelters that
serve battered women.
<P>
<LI> Interstate Enforcement.  The law was changed to increase punishments
for persons who cross state lines with the intent of harming a
spouse or to violate protection orders.  This provision also authorizes
$120 million over three years to encourage states to treat domestic
violence as a serious criminal act.
<P>
<LI> Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.  This Act is amended
to authorize $324 million over five years.
<P>
<LI> Youth Education.  It creates four youth education and domestic
violence model programs for young people.  It authorizes $400,000
for one year.
<P>
<LI> Community Programs on Domestic Violence.  It grants $10 million
over two years for nonprofit organizations to establish projects
that coordinate intervention and prevention of domestic violence.
 The nonprofit organizations may include religious community personnel.
<P>
<LI> Confidentiality for Abused Persons.  The Act requires the U.S.
Postal Service to write regulations that protect the confidentiality
of domestic violence shelters and abused persons' addresses.
<P>
<LI> Data and Research.  It requires the National Academy of Sciences
to study violence against women, including rape and domestic violence.
 The one-year study will report on how states may collect centralized
data on the incidence of sexual and domestic violence offenses.
 It also tasks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to obtain a national projection of the incidence of injuries resulting
from domestic violence and to recommend how to reduce the incidence
and cost of associated injuries.
<P>
<LI> Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement.  It authorizes
$30 million over three years to expand and establish efforts among
rural law enforcement agencies, victim advocacy groups, and victims
of domestic violence and child abuse.  The grants will provide
treatment, counseling, and education strategies directed to domestic
violence and child abuse.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDIES FOR GENDER-MOTIVATED VIOLENCE
ACT"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> This provision creates a federal civil rights cause of action
for victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender.  Victims
of a crime of violence motivated by gender can now sue the offender
for restitution.
<P>
<LI> The Act includes a "Sense of the Senate Concerning Protection
of the Privacy of Rape Victims."  It encourages news media,
law enforcement officers and others to exercise restraint and
respect a rape victim's identity by not disclosing it to the general
public.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"EQUAL JUSTICE FOR WOMEN IN THE COURTS
ACT"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>  Educates Judges.  Authorizes $600,000 for fiscal year 1996
to develop, test, present, and disseminate model programs to be
used by states in training judges and court personnel in the laws
of rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other crimes of
violence motivated by the victim's gender.
<P>
<LI> Studies Gender Bias in Federal Courts.  Authorizes $600,000
for fiscal year 1996 to study the nature and extent of gender
bias in federal courts and their administrative offices.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT IMPROVEMENTS"
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Tests for STDs.  This provision authorizes payment of the cost
of testing victims of sex offenses for sexually transmitted diseases.
 Victims can be tested at government expense up to twice during
the 12 months following a sexual assault that poses a risk of
transmission.  The provision also provides a mechanism for the
victim to obtain an order requiring the offender to be tested
and for the results of the test to be communicated to the victim
and the offender.
<P>
<LI> HIV Crimes.  The Act requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission
to conduct a study to recommend for revision sentencing guidelines
that relate to offenses in which an HIV-infected person engages
in sexual activity that exposes another to the virus.
<P>
<LI> Studies Campus Sexual Assaults.  The Act requires the Attorney
General to examine the scope of the problem of campus sexual assaults
to include the estimated number of assaults, the existing laws
pertaining to campus sexual assault, and the adequacy of policies
and practices addressing campus sexual assaults.
<P>
<LI> Battered Women's Syndrome.  Requires the Attorney General and
the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report within one
year on the impact of "Battered Women's Syndrome" in
criminal trials.  
<P>
<LI> Abusive Spouse Information.  Requires the Attorney General to
study the means by which abusive spouses may obtain information
concerning the location of estranged or former spouses.  
<P>
<LI> Domestic Violence Records.  Requires the Attorney General to
study and report within one year problems associated with record-keeping
of criminal complaints involving domestic violence.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"NATIONAL STALKER AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
REDUCTION"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Authorizes $6 million over three years to improve processes
for entering data regarding stalking and domestic violence into
databases which are accessible to civil or criminal courts.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"PROTECTIONS FOR BATTERED IMMIGRANT WOMEN AND
CHILDREN"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to protect from deportation
legal aliens who have been the victim of "extreme cruelty
perpetrated by the alien's [citizen] spouse."   
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 104th Congress will re-examine portions of the 1994 crime
bill.  The Republican Party's "Taking Back Our Streets Act
of 1995," which is part of their Contract with America, does
not propose revisions to the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.[2]

<TITLE>HEARINGS NEEDED ON END TO COMBAT EXEMPTIONS FOR

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>HEARINGS NEEDED ON END<BR>
TO COMBAT EXEMPTIONS<BR>
FOR WOMEN</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The Clinton Administration has rescinded combat exclusions for
women without justification and contrary to the recommendations
of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women
in the Armed Forces.  These changes have stripped women of more
than one-quarter million combat-related exemptions.  Consider
the changes in the last two years:

<P>
<LI> <B>Combat aircraft.</B>  On April 28, 1993 Former
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced that women could be assigned to combat aircraft.
<P>
<LI> <B>Combatant vessels.</B>  On November 30, 1993
Congress rescinded, at the Administration's request, the law exempting women from permanent
assignment aboard combatant vessels.
<P>
<LI> <B>Military's risk rule.</B>  On January 13, 1994
Aspin rescinded the military's risk rule, which resulted in the end of more near-combat and
combat exemptions for women.
<P>
<LI><B>Combat and near-combat positions.</B>  On July 29, 1994 Secretary
of Defense William Perry ended 80,000 more exemptions for women. Women can now be
assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions and virtually all Air Force (99.7
percent) and Navy positions (94.0 percent).  The Army (67.2 percent) and Marine Corps (62.0
percent) are more restrictive.[1]
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>LITTLE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces
recommended that "military readiness
should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
 The Pentagon, however, has yet to cite the military readiness justification for the recent changes.
Additionally, Congress has not publicly heard from the commission.  
<P>
On October 6, 1994 former chairman of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee
on Military Forces and Personnel Rep. Ike Skelton (D-MO) hosted the sole Congressional
hearing considering the latest changes.  He limited the hearing to one three-member panel which
supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) had asked to hear dissenting
views from a panel consisting of commissioners from the 1992 Commission.  His request was
denied.

<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to "raise and support
armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and
regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and
their assignments.

<P>
The 103rd Congress virtually ignored the Clinton Administration's radical assignment policies. 
These changes do not improve readiness and threaten to leave women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to
reverse the Clinton Administration's current course.

<TITLE>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Homosexual activists often use the power of the government and
media to try to force society to accept their behavior.  But the
homosexual lobby is also active in corporate America.
<P>
Some companies are actively promoting the homosexual agenda through
direct financial support, advertising campaigns and corporate
policies such as extending domestic partner benefits to homosexuals.
<P>
One of the companies most actively pushing the homosexual agenda
is AT&T.  AT&T's pro-homosexual activities include:
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "Homosexual Marriage."</B>  According
to <I>Diversity Digest</I>, a publication of AT&T's Information
Research Center, the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay United Employees
at AT&T (LEAGUE) held a conference in which members were encouraged
to "help devise a legal definition of marriage, so the company
can work on extending domestic partner benefits to employees in
states that do not recognize marriages between same-gender partners"
(<I>Diversity Digest</I> August 1994, p. 10).
<P>
<LI><B> Homosexual Direct Mail Advertising.</B>  Last year AT&T
sent about 70,000 direct mail packages targeted at homosexuals.
 The package included brochures featuring smiling homosexual couples
and a flier about AT&T's homosexual employee group.  The materials
were sent in envelopes decorated with a rainbow-colored telephone
cord and the phrase, "It's time for a change..." (<I>The
Washington Blade</I> June 10, 1994, p. 23).
<P>
<LI><B> Indoctrination of Employees.</B>  AT&T has held workshops
and "diversity training" sessions in an effort to force
employees to accept homosexuality.  The company has used Brian
McNaught's video, <I>On Being Gay,</I> in these workshops.  The
video is filled with misleading claims and presents homosexuality as a normal, healthy lifestyle. 
<P>
McNaught, who has done several workshops for AT&T, shows his
bias against those who hold traditional religious values in his
book, <I>Gay Issues in the Workplace</I>.  McNaught links religious
conviction with hate and bigotry.  He suggests that people who
hold strong religious convictions need "counseling"
(p. 100).  He shows contempt for those who hold traditional family
values by suggesting that these values fuel "anti-gay bias."
<P>
The following endorsement by an AT&T official appears on the
back of McNaught's book:  "Every manager and employee who
takes our course on 'Homophobia in the Workplace' will receive
a copy of this book.  Brian McNaught has an incredible skill in helping people understand
and respond to gay issues in a nonthreatening way" (Sheila
Landers, Personnel Services Manager at AT&T Network Systems).
<P>
AT&T has also urged employees to observe Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week and to place posters and pink triangles on walls to show
that the office is "gay friendly." 
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "The Gay Games."</B>  According to <I>Businessweek</I>
magazine, AT&T helped sponsor a series of sporting events
featuring 11,000 athletes and a budget of $6.5 million.  <I>Businessweek</I>
described the "Gay Games" as "less a series of
sporting events than a nine-day celebration of culture, complete
with parades, plays, music, art shows and food feasts" (<I>Businessweek</I>
July 4, 1994 p. 38).  
<P>
<LI><B> Donations to the Gay Men's Health Crisis.</B>  According
to Brenda Leake of AT&T, the company gave $25,000 to the Gay
Men's Health Crisis in 1992.  Among other things, GMHC distributes
graphic, sexually explicit material to young people in an attempt
to "educate" them about the dangers of AIDS.  The brochures
encourage young people to engage in dangerous and perverse sexual
practices.   
<P>
 <CENTER><B>CONCLUSION</B></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of pro-homosexual policies cite the need to be "tolerant"
of other people.  But the question is not one of civil rights
or ending "bigotry."  Homosexuals have the same rights
as any other Americans, but are seeking special privileges. 
<P>
Christians and other believers in traditional morality are coming
under enormous pressure in AT&T and other corporations to
ignore their most deeply held beliefs.  "Diversity"
sessions that attack or distort scripture and church teachings
constitute religious harassment.
<P>
The real issue is whether or not people will be forced to accept
homosexual behavior, something that no successful culture has
ever done.  Homosexual behavior is not normal or healthy.  Opposition
to the homosexual agenda is not bigotry; it is common sense.
<P>
If you are concerned about AT&T's promotion of the homosexual
agenda, contact them to express your concern.  Tell AT&T that
it is irresponsible to promote an immoral and unhealthy lifestyle.
 AT&T should incorporate policies that strengthen the family,
not undermine it.

<TITLE>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT CONDOM USE?</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT
<BR>CONDOM USE?</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that
condoms, in order to be effective, must be put on prior to genital
contact, must remain intact and, most importantly, must be used
<I>consistently and correctly</I>.  But while millions of dollars
are spent each year on public education campaigns to promote &quot;consistent
and correct&quot; condom usage -- from pamphlets in public health
clinics to AIDS education classes in schools to the recent CDC
public service announcements on both radio and television -- many
Americans still do not use condoms consistently or correctly.
<P><UL>
  <LI> A 1990 study published in the <I>American Journal of Public
Health</I> found that most adults in the United States who have
multiple sexual partners do not use condoms consistently.  Among
currently sexually active adults studied, 13 percent had had sex
with more than one partner in the year preceding the study, but
only 8 percent of this group had used condoms consistently.  Moreover,
of the 13 percent of adults who had more than one partner, two-thirds
provided data on primary versus secondary partners, but only 23
percent of these respondents reported using a condom every time
with their nonprimary partners.  (B.C. Leigh, M.T. Temple, and
K.F. Trocki, &quot;The Sexual Behavior of U.S. Adults:  Results
from a National Survey,&quot; <I>American Journal of Public Health</I>,
83:1400-1408, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> The 1988 National Survey of Family Growth found that only
13 percent of the 1,887 never-married, sexually active women aged
15-49 used condoms &quot;consistently.&quot;  It is significant
to note, however, that this survey's definition of &quot;consistent&quot;
use did <I>not</I> mean using a condom for each <I>act</I> of
intercourse, but rather that the woman had used condoms in every
<I>month</I> throughout the reference period.  In addition, only
41 percent of the entire sample of never-married, sexually active
women had <I>ever</I> used a condom.  (L.B. Potter and J.E. Anderson,
&quot;Patterns of Condom Use and Sexual Behavior Among Never-Married
Women,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</I>, 20:201-218,
1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1989 study of patients at a public sexually transmitted
disease (STD) clinic found that consistent condom use is rare,
even among populations at high risk.  Of the 300 patients who
participated in the survey, 51 percent of the men and 64 percent
of the women reported having had an STD in the past, and 47 percent
of all subjects were diagnosed with an STD on the day they were
interviewed.  Forty percent also agreed that their sexual behavior put them at risk of HIV
infection.  However,
only 25 percent of respondents had used a condom at the most recent
intercourse, and only 16 percent of black respondents and 13 percent
of Hispanics reported having used a condom at their last sexual
encounter.  The participants appeared to understand the benefits
of using condoms regularly; however, only 60 percent said they
had used a condom at least once in the previous two months.  (H.S.
Weinstock, et al., &quot;Factors Associated with Condom Use in
a High-Risk Heterosexual Population,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted
Diseases</I>, 20:14-20, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1991 study published in <I>Family Planning Perspectives</I>
found that more than half of all unmarried male participants (60
percent of Hispanics and 54 percent of non-Hispanics) had had
two or more heterosexual partners in the year preceding the survey.
 Among married men, 18 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of non-Hispanic
whites had had two or more sexual partners.  However, while 51
percent of Hispanic men and 49 percent of non-Hispanic men did
<I>not</I> always use condoms with their secondary partners, theoretically
putting both themselves and their primary partners at risk, only
20 percent of Hispanic men and 9 percent of non-Hispanic men used
condoms with their primary partners.  (B. Van Oss Martin, C.A.
Gomez, and N. Hearst, &quot;Multiple Heterosexual Partners and
Condom Use Among Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Whites,&quot; <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I>, 25:170-174, 1993.)</UL>

<TITLE>IMMIGRATION AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>IMMIGRATION
<BR>AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In recent years, the debate over immigration has broadened and
intensified.  A growing segment of the population would like to
reduce or stop the flow of foreigners entering the United States,
while many others want to adhere to America's historic policy
of welcoming newcomers to our shores.
<P>
Ignored in this increasingly bitter debate is the question of
whether or not our immigration policies are friendly to the preservation
and nurture of family life.
<P>
The American family is in trouble.  Over the past three decades,
the rise of divorce, an increase in nonmarital cohabitation, soaring
rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,
widespread drug abuse, an epidemic of juvenile crime and the alarming
proportion of out-of-wedlock births provide hard statistical evidence
that this basic social institution is under siege.
<P>
Clearly, many people interested in immigrating to the United States
have an old-world sense of familial loyalty and an unshakable
belief in the sanctity of marriage.  To such people -- and to
existing U.S. citizens -- we owe a commitment to craft immigration
law in a manner that respects and undergirds the marital institution.
<P>
To that end, we have two concerns that we would like to see the
Commission address:
<P>
1)  Current law allows adult children and siblings to apply for
permanent citizenship on the basis of family relationships.  This
essentially well-meaning policy should be reexamined and modified.
<P>
On the surface, the law here seems to work on behalf of families,
allowing adult children to be reunited with parents, and brothers
and sisters to join those siblings who have already immigrated
to this country.  In fact, it imposes hardships on family members
who are in greater need of reunion.  Here's how:
<P>
Since immigration is limited by quotas, the adult children of
U.S. citizens are often admitted to this country while the spouses
and children of green card holders are kept waiting on a distant
shore.
<P>
Because existing preferences for nuclear family relatives of U.S.
citizens are not extended to green card holders, a husband and
wife in one family might be separated for years while an adult brother in another family comes
to the U.S. under a law intended to reunite families.
<P>
To address this problem, the Family Research Council recommends
that current law be modified so that all backlogs in nuclear family
categories be cleared before adult children and siblings are granted
entry under family reunification status.  (It may even be well
to consider eliminating the preference for adult children and
siblings altogether, since backlogs in those categories are already
so large.)  Giving preference to all nuclear family relationships
would allow more spouses and minor children to enter as family
members -- and American family life would be strengthened correspondingly.
<P>
2)  Current law has been implemented inappropriately as cohabiting
couples and same-sex couples have been admitted on temporary visas
under the rubric of &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
While current law does not recognize such couples as &quot;family,&quot;
the federal government reportedly has allowed this interpretation
in cases of temporary visas.  The continuation of this practice
would mean that:
<P>
<LI> The number of cohabiting couples in the United States would
increase, albeit temporarily, as the result of official immigration
action;
<P>
<LI> The number of homosexual couples would also increase with the
official sanction of the INS;
<P>
<LI> The precedent set by such a practice might well be used in the
future to justify similar action in the case of permanent immigration.
<P>
In order to eliminate this practice -- which undermines the sanctity
of marriage and the stability of family life in America -- the
U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform should call upon the appropriate
federal agencies and congressional oversight committees to take
whatever steps necessary to ensure that non-marital couples are
not granted visas as a &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The current larger debate over immigration might well be tempered
if immigration policy were more deliberately crafted to encourage
the immigration of families and those most likely to support traditional
family values.
<P>
Many of the problems we face as a nation can be attributed, either
directly or indirectly, to the breakdown of family life.
<P>
To be successful, immigration policy should support family values
rather than contribute to their further erosion.  An overtly pro-family
stance on the part of the INS and other government agencies would
ease the fears of those who believe that our borders should be
closed completely to avoid the further collapse of American society.
<P>
The importance of stable marriages and families to the health
of a nation cannot be underestimated.  The late Pitirim Sorokin,
chairman of Harvard's Sociology Department and President of the
International Institute of Sociology, warned Americans nearly
40 years ago that the decline in family life must be reversed
or America would go the way of other nations that suffered cultural
breakdown.  In 1956, he wrote in <I>The American Sex Revolution</I>
(Boston: Porter Sargent Publisher): 
<P>
<UL><I>...marriage has been regarded by all societies as the culminating
point of human existence, and as the most decisive factor in the
survival and well-being of the societies themselves....the candle
of the American marriage and family is being burned at both ends
-- both as a union of husband and wife, and as a union of parents
and children.  And with their disintegration, marriage and the
family progressively fail in the performance of tasks of maintaining
the well-being of the individual and ensuring the survival of
the nation itself.</I></UL>
<P>
Immigrants like Sorokin (a refugee from the Soviet Union) have
contributed immeasurably to the moral health of the United States.
 We should make certain that, regardless of how the current debate
over influx is resolved, our nation's immigration policies are
always structured to ensure the survival and continuing strength
of America's families.

<TITLE>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN<BR>OF TABLE 34</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In 1948, zoologist Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his
study <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>.  In 1953 a companion
volume, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>, was published.
 Although many scientists were critical of Kinsey's methods, the
media popularized Kinsey's findings. But serious questions have
been raised about Kinsey's research:
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of fraudulent data and child sexual abuse.</B>
The book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court,
Muir; Huntington House, 1990) shows that either the Kinsey data
on child sexuality were manufactured or that children were sexually
abused in the name of science.  Table 34 in Kinsey's study contains
detailed data about molestation of young boys.  According to a
review in the British medical journal, <I>The Lancet,</I> the
authors of <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> &quot;demolish&quot; Kinsey's
credibility.
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of improper sampling. </B> Kinsey relied heavily
on data gleaned from prison inmates, including sex offenders,
and extrapolated those findings to the general population.  Although
criminals made up less than one percent of the population, inmates
made up a sizable portion of Kinsey's male sample. 
<P>
<LI><B> Issue of &quot;volunteer&quot; error raised -- and ignored.
</B> Esteemed colleagues of Kinsey such as psychologist Abraham
Maslow warned Kinsey that his survey suffered greatly from &quot;volunteer
bias.&quot;  Maslow told Kinsey that such surveys tend to be skewed
toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Kinsey ignored
the advice and terminated their collegial relationship.
<P>
Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many ongoing federally-sponsored
programs.  His conclusions have permeated America's educational
institutions and are the major behavioral model on which sex education
programs are designed.  The Kinsey ideology has affected everything
from sex offender laws to the sexual portrayal of children in
pornographic publications.
<P>
The reliance on reports of sexual abuse of children under the
auspices of federally-supported research demands investigation.
 FRC's new video, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot; asks such
important questions as:   
<P>
<LI><B> How were the children procured for the experiments?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Where are the children now?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Did the parents of the children give consent to the experiments?</B>
<P>
It is essential that these and other questions be answered by
the Kinsey Institute and the surviving associates of Dr. Kinsey.

<title>FAMILY CAP TALKING POINTS</title>
<body>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<h2>FAMILY CAP TALKING POINTS</h2></center>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
*  Two wrongs don't make a right.  It is foolish to fight abortion
by embracing welfare subsidies.  There are no data to support
the contention that the current welfare system suppresses the
abortion rate -- in the short-term or the long-term.  In fact,
the welfare state peacefully coexists with the world's highest
abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
<P>
*  All the data demonstrate that subsidizing illegitimacy will
actually increase the number of abortions because it increases
promiscuity and discourages marriage.  Illegitimacy and abortion
spring from the same misconception that life is cheap and motherhood
bears no sacred responsibility.                         
<P><UL>
The correlation between abortion and illegitimacy in a state-by-state
analysis is astronomically high (between .67 and .72, with 1.0
designating a perfect correlation).  Likewise, abortion and illegitimacy
trends track together over time.
<P>
 States that have more generous welfare benefits also have higher
abortion rates.  When the 50 states are organized into quintiles,
for example, the rank order correlation between abortions per
1,000 live births and average monthly AFDC benefits is perfect.
<P>
 Welfare promotes family disintegration, and girls who are born
out-of-wedlock are much more likely to engage in premarital sex.
 Premarital sex is 9 times more likely to engender abortion, and
women who have never married are more than 5 times as likely to
have abortions as their married counterparts. 
<P></UL>
*  State by state analysis demonstrates that small changes in
welfare payouts do not appear to correlate closely with short-run
changes in the abortion rate.  Texas, for example, experienced
a 27% drop in abortions in the 1980s, while welfare payouts remained
consistently low relative to the national average.
<P>
*  The termination of benefits may in fact reduce the number of
abortions in the short-term because many pregnant young women
will turn to pro-life crisis pregnancy centers.  Teenagers will
be more likely to remain at home with parents, and parental notification
laws have proven effective in reducing the number of abortions.
<P>
*  Abortions are less likely to increase in the short-term because
many low-income girls deliberately choose to have a baby.  Abortion
would deny them an important status symbol.  Surveys also demonstrate
that moral opposition to abortion is strongest among the poor.
<P>
*  The logic of pro-life opposition to welfare reform is that
we should increase entitlements tenfold in order to save even
more lives and that we should forgo any crackdown on deadbeat
dads, since more men might pressure more women into abortions.
 Pro-lifers should support marriage and adoption, instead of opposing
welfare reform.
<P>
*  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on demand requires more
than legal reform.  The question we should be asking is &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;  The answer certainly includes
welfare reform that reduces illegitimacy.

<H2>A FEW FACTS ABOUT ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Today, nearly one out of three children is born out of wedlock,
as opposed to one in ten in 1970.  If current trends continue,
by the year 2015 half of all American children will be born to
a single mother.
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, 1.2 million births were illegitimate -- the highest
number ever reported in the U.S.  In 1993, 6.3 million children
were living with a single parent who had never married.  In 1960,
the number was 243,000.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among black Americans was 26% in 1965.
 Today the rate is 68% and climbing.  In inner cities, the figure
is typically in excess of 80%.  Only 6% of black children born
in 1980 will live with both parents through age 18, according
to some projections.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among white Americans has risen tenfold,
from 2.29% in 1960 to 22% today -- almost the same as the black
illegitimacy rate in the early 1960s that motivated Daniel Patrick
Moynihan to write his famous report on the breakdown of the black
family.  The figure in low-income, working-class white communities
may already be twice that.  According to the latest Census Bureau
runs, the illegitimate birth rate in many white communities now
exceeds 40%, and out-of-wedlock births are increasing more rapidly
among whites than minorities.
<P>
<LI>  Women with college degrees contribute only 4% of white illegitimate
babies, while women  with a high school education or less contribute
82%.  Women with family incomes of $75,000  or more contribute
1% of white illegitimate babies, while women with family incomes
under $20,000 contribute 69%.  For white women below the poverty
line in the year prior to giving birth, 44% of births have been
illegitimate, as opposed to only 6% for women above the poverty
line.
<P>
<LI>  In 1992, 30% of all non-marital births were to females under
the age of 20.  The federal government has a particular interest
in preventing unwed teenage childbearing because teen mothers
who enter the welfare system are far more likely than older mothers
to rely on government to support their children and to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
<LI>  By 1992, 71% of teen mothers were unmarried -- a more than
doubling of the rate in just one generation.  In 1970, the proportion
of teen mothers who were unmarried was 30%.  In 1950, 14% of births
to teenagers were to unmarried mothers.
<P>
<LI>  Almost half of unwed teen mothers go on welfare within one
year after the birth of a first child.  By the time the baby is
age 5, 72% of white teens and 84% of black teens have received
AFDC. 
<P>
<LI>  Nearly one out of five teens who have a premarital pregnancy
will become pregnant again within one year.  More than 31% experience
a second pregnancy within two years.

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY'S DISASTROUS EFFECTS</H2>

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Out of wedlock pregnancy is a near certain predictor of poverty.
 The one-parent family is six times more likely to be poor than
the two-parent family.
<P>
 
<LI>  Women who bear illegitimate children (especially before finishing
high school) are far more likely to rely on government to support
their children and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled.
<P>
<LI>  Children born outside of marriage are three times more likely
to depend on welfare themselves when they reach adulthood.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy feeds itself.  Young white women who grow up without
a father in the home are more than twice as likely to bear children
out of wedlock.  And boys living in a single-parent family are
twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as boys from
intact homes.
<P>
<LI>  More than 70% of all juveniles in state reform institutions
come from fatherless homes.  The relationship between crime and
one-parent families is so powerful that controlling for family
structure erases the relationship between crime and race or poverty.
<P>
<LI>  The likelihood that a young male will engage in criminal activities
doubles if he is raised without a father and triples if he lives
in a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-parent families.
<P>
<LI>  The greater the incidence of single-parent families in a neighborhood,
the higher the incidence of violent crime and burglary.
<P>
<LI>  Teenage single-parent mothering is the single greatest contributor
to low birth weight babies.  Studies show that the high rate of
out-of-wedlock births to young mothers is the primary explanation
for America's low international standing on measures of infant
mortality.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are much more likely to experience
abuse or neglect.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are more likely to experience
impaired physical development and low cognitive/verbal development.
 Among children aged 3-5 in one study, those with teen mothers
were twice as likely to have few children's books in the home.
<P>
<LI>  Children from single-parent families are two to three times
more likely to have emotional or behavioral problems than children
from intact families.  They also exhibit weaker peer adjustment
and a weaker sense of right and wrong.
<P>
<LI>  Children from fatherless homes have lower educational aspirations
and a low level of educational achievement.  Studies also show
that illegitimacy reduces job performance, professional attainment,
individual income, and the overall health of the economy.

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY TALKING POINTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  The essential purpose of welfare reform must be to reduce illegitimacy.
 A system that subsidizes illegitimacy perpetuates illegitimacy
-- and poverty.  
<P>
<LI>  Welfare is bondage:  women bear illegitimate children in exchange
for benefits that can never compare with the benefits of an intact
family.
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of grants to unwed teenage mothers is necessary
to restore the integrity of the family unit for future generations.
 Even Frances Perkins, the most liberal member of the Roosevelt
Administration, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried
mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would
escalate family breakdown.
<P>
<LI>  As the one policy option that promises to effect change in
the current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.
<P>
<LI>  We are combatting not material poverty, but a poverty of the
spirit.  Every individual, regardless of income level, is capable
of moral autonomy.  Welfare is demeaning because it denies that
truth.
<P>
<LI>  Even Democrats now concede Dan Quayle was right.  Families
bestow advantages that simply come no other way.
<P>
<LI>  Every individual deserves equal access to the privilege of
family, and welfare denies its recipients that privilege.  In
communities where illegitimacy has reached a critical mass, many
children don't even have the opportunity to see what a family
looks like, much less live in one.
<P>
<LI>  By eroding our nation's moral capital, illegitimacy jeopardizes
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  If citizens
cannot govern their own lives, how can they govern the republic?
<P>
<LI>  The role of the two-parent family is essential in sustaining
a free society because it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted
from generation to generation.  Only a virtuous people can be
free.  Welfare erodes first the freedom of dependents and then
freedom at large. 
<P>
<LI>  If we succeed in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work, we will still be left with roughly the same number of fatherless
children.  If current trends continue, one of every two babies
will be born to a single mother within the next 20 years.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy is not a race issue.  Out-of-wedlock births are
increasing more rapidly among whites, and the illegitimacy rate
in many white communities now exceeds 40%.

<TITLE>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE KINSEY RESEARCH</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE
<BR>KINSEY RESEARCH</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Since the publication of <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>
(1948) and <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I> (1953) there
has been much criticism of the findings and methods of Dr. Alfred
Kinsey. 
<P>
The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court
and Muir; Lochinvar-Huntington House) examined the work of Dr.
Kinsey.  The book revealed a number of serious flaws in his research,
including shocking evidence that Kinsey used data from the sexual
abuse of children.
<P>
According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of problems in Kinsey's
research is "compelling.... disturbing...and requires investigation."[1]
 Problems include:
<P>
<LI> <B>Sexual Experiments on Children --</B> The Kinsey male report
contains data on sexual activity of 317 children aged 2 months
to 15 years.  These data were either manufactured or these children
were sexually molested by adults in the name of science.  The
data are contained in graph tables which chronicle attempts to
bring children to "orgasm."
<P>
<LI> <B>Sampling Errors --</B> Kinsey's sample was entirely voluntary
and not representative of the U.S. population.  White people were
overrepresented while Blacks and Latinos were underrepresented.
 In addition, college students, college graduates, and white-collar
workers were overrepresented.  Prison inmates comprised 25 percent
of Kinsey's male sample, even though they made up less than one
percent of the total U.S. population at the time.  Among women,
58 percent of Kinsey's sample were unmarried, three times the
actual number at the time.  Religious people were not adequately
represented and since only 10 states were included, the survey
was regionally skewed.
<P>
<LI> <B>Volunteer Error --</B> Psychologist Abraham Maslow raised
this issue by pointing out that sex surveys are skewed toward
the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Many people, especially
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, were not willing to talk openly
about their most intimate lives.  Those who did often exaggerated.
 Maslow proved the volunteer error in a test he conducted at Brooklyn
College and concluded that "the whole basis for Kinsey's
statistics was proven to be shaky."[2] 
<P>
Further evidence of Maslow's contention that sex surveys are inherently
slanted is found in a book written by Wardell Pomeroy, one of
Kinsey's co-authors.  Pomeroy writes:

<P>
"As types, those who took the most romantic view of sex were,
understandably, people who were the most religious -- clergymen
and their wives especially.  Those who were bubbling over to tell
us everything they could were usually homosexuals, particularly
when they discovered by our use of homosexual argot that we knew
about the kind of lives they led.  They would almost visibly expand
with relief and eagerness to talk."[3]
<P>
<LI> <B>Intimidation/Coaching of Respondents --</B> Kinsey instructed
his interviewers to goad their subjects into revelations of their
sexual behavior, especially if the results didn't match the interviewer's
assumptions. Wardell Pomeroy admitted that such coaching was quite
common in the Kinsey team's data collection.[4]  These tactics were
particularly effective with prison inmates.  If the inmates did
not provide answers they would have to return to their cells,
thus losing access to the free candy, soft drinks and cigarettes
provided by the Kinsey interviewers.
<P>
When some interviewees said that they did not do a particular
sex act, the interviewer would say: "Yes, I know you have
never done that, but how old were you the <I>first</I> time that
you did it?"[5] 
<P>
Kinsey's team intimidated subjects when they suspected that the
subject was being dishonest.  According to Kinsey, the interviewers
"...should denounce the subject with considerable severity..."[6]
Kinsey admitted that these tactics were highly unusual: "Such
an attack on a dishonest subject is quite contrary to the usual
rules for interviewing, and a procedure which we at first hesitated
to employ in the present study.  We have, however, decided that
it is a necessary technique in dealing with some individuals."[7]
  
<P>
<LI> <B>Ideological Bias --</B> According to Kinsey biographer Paul
Robinson, Kinsey consistently favored nontraditional forms of
sexuality in the way he constructed his books.  Marital intercourse
was "rudely confined to a single chapter in the back of the
book, where it received about one-third the attention devoted
to homosexual relations... a remarkable feat of sexual leveling...the
fundamental categories of his analysis clearly worked to undermine
the traditional sexual order."[8] A 1989 National Academy of
Sciences report explained that Kinsey "attempted to counter
the traditional religious view that sexual virtue was entirely
composed of heterosexual activity...inside the bonds of marriage..."[9]
Kinsey himself summarized the Old Testament's and the Talmud's
injunctions against sexual relations with animals by saying: "The
student of human folkways is inclined to see a considerable body
of superstition in the origins of all such taboos..."[10]
<P>
In addition to Dr. Walter Stewart and Dr. Abraham Maslow, critics
of the Kinsey reports include a committee appointed by the Commission
on Statistical Standards of the American Statistical Association.
 In 1954 the committee reported several statistical flaws and
concluded that "Kinsey should have been more cautious in
boldly drawing highly precise conclusions from their limited sample."[11]
<P>
The 1989 National Academy of Sciences report warned that the sampling
flaws limited "the comparability and appropriateness of the
Kinsey data as a basis for calculating the prevalence of any form
of sexual conduct."[12]
<P>
The Kinsey data are flawed and have been contradicted by subsequent
research.  However, Kinsey's work continues to be widely used
by policy makers and the culture at large in dealing with sexuality.
 The Kinsey data must be discarded.

<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
Forty-two years after its release, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human
Male</I> by Alfred C. Kinsey remains a highly influential document
in government funding of sex education and health programs despite
a general understanding that its research methods were unscientific.
 The Kinsey ideology has altered the nation's legal codes for
sex crimes and has been used as a touchstone for numerous federal
policies, particularly the funding of sex education, research,
and prevention programs for AIDS, drug abuse, and youth suicide.
 
<P>
<LI>  Based on the Kinsey ideology that premarital sexuality is superior
to marriage-based sex, federally-funded sex and health education
curricula have been geared almost entirely toward sexually active
teens, implying that abstinence before marriage is abnormal. 
The federal government began funding adolescent pregnancy prevention
programs during the 1970's under Title X of the Public Health
Service Act.  Curricula funded through Title X often include ideas
and "facts" derived from the Kinsey studies.  After
$3 billion in taxpayer-funded programs, America's teenage pregnancy
rate is far higher than when the programs began.  And there is
growing evidence that such programs actually increase sexual activity
among teens.[1] Yet the programs, which emphasize how teens should
engage in sex rather than why they shouldn't, continue to receive
heavy subsidies from taxpayers.  In fiscal 1995, the federal government
will spend $190.4 million on Title X projects.  By contrast, the
Adolescent Family Life Act, or Title XX of the Public Health Service
Act, whose abstinence-based programs reduce teen pregnancies,[2]
is slated to receive only $6.7 million in federal funds in fiscal
1995.
<P>
Planned Parenthood receives about $50 million annually from Title
X grants.  This money is used to design and implement sex education
and health programs for thousands of schools across America and
to operate clinics.  Giving lip service to the idea of abstinence
before marriage, Planned Parenthood-designed programs openly support
sexual experimentation.  For instance:
<P>
1)  An adolescent curriculum prepared for the Alameda-San Francisco
branch of Planned Parenthood tells young people that it is a "myth"
that "[y]oung women who have more than one sexual partner
are easy.  Some people, both men and women, prefer to relate sexually
to more than one person at a time.  This is an individual preference."[3]
 

<P>
2)  The Planned Parenthood Center of Syracuse, New York, issued
a pamphlet for teens that says:  "Many people believe that sex relations
are right only when they are married.  Others decide to have sex outside of marriage. 
This is a personal choice."[4]
<P>
3)  In a family planning magazine published under a federal grant,
a Planned Parenthood affiliated physician gives this advice to
teens:  "If we have sex for our own reasons, then there is
nothing wrong with sexual activities."[5]
<P>
4)  In 1991, Planned Parenthood of Maryland joined several government
agencies to sponsor the Affirming Diversity Conference.  Conference
coordinator John Hannay told an interviewer:  "We use the
Kinsey studies as a starting point to determine how many youth
would fall into this [child homosexuality] category.  As the cross
section of society goes, you would probably expect to see a good
10% will have predominantly or exclusively homosexual tendencies...
There haven't been any studies done on sexual orientation among
adolescents, so we're just going on estimates on adults and the
10 percent figure.  The thing is that many students will be aware
that they are different, but they would probably not describe
their difference as being a homosexual."[6]
<P>
<LI>  AIDS prevention programs are funded through grants from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  In fiscal 1989, the CDC
spent $266.6 million on AIDS education.[7]  In fiscal 1995, the
CDC is spending $589 million on HIV/AIDS projects, plus another
$105 million on sexually transmitted diseases.  This amounts to
about a third of CDC's total $2.1 billion budget.[8]
<P>
<LI>  The Sex Information and Education Council of the United States
(SIECUS) is supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, which gave SIECUS two grants totalling $360,397 in fiscal
1994.[9] One of the founding board members of SIECUS was Wardell
B. Pomeroy, a co-author of the 1948 Kinsey male sexuality study.
 In 1980, another SIECUS co-founder, Mary Calderone, told a group
of doctors that the primary goal of SIECUS was to educate society
"very broadly and deeply with the awareness of the vital
importance of infant and childhood sexuality."[10]
<P>
A 1985 SIECUS report says:  "...homosexuality is an essential
quality of humanness, and that its expression is the right of
every human being."  In March 1991, SIECUS published a report,
"Winning the Battle:  Developing Support for Sexuality and
HIV/AIDS Education."  The report suggests that one way to
deal with opponents of some types of sex education is to determine
their religious affiliation and publicize it in order to stigmatize
them.[11] SIECUS also advocates the teaching of "alternative
lifestyles" and the use of "values clarification"
to help youth "question, explore, and assess sexual attitudes
and feelings in order to develop their own values..."[12]
<P>
Debra Haffner, executive director of SIECUS, in a 1988 SIECUS
report says:  "Colleagues and I have fantasized about a national
'petting project' for teenagers... to help them learn courting
behaviors and to, once again, give teens time to learn slowly
about their sexuality... Today's teens also need to have that
opportunity for unpressured discovery of sexual feelings and responses...
A partial list of safe sex practices for teens could include...
massaging, caressing, undressing each other, masturbation alone,
masturbation in front of a partner, and mutual masturbation."[13]
<P>
In a 1990 SIECUS report, Haffner asked readers to "Imagine
a world where:  School sexuality education is compulsory.  Contraceptives
are readily available.  Abortion is free until the 18th week of
pregnancy.  There is a law that states that, 'Cohabitation between
people of the same sex is entirely acceptable from society's point
of view.'... I was most impressed by the sense that in Sweden
sexuality is truly accepted as a natural and healthy part of living.
 Young people have a right to their sexual feelings and to sexual
education."[14]  
<P>
<P>
<LI>  In 1950, Alfred Kinsey testified before the California Assembly's
Subcommittee on Sex Crimes on behalf of liberalizing state laws
regarding sex offenders.  Kinsey argued specifically for granting
immediate paroles to child molesters and also counseled that parents
should not warn children about strangers because it might frighten
them.  In his testimony, he included little or no information
about sex crime victims, and noted that societal disapproval of
the acts posed more harm that the acts themselves.[15]  Kinsey also
worked with other state legislatures to liberalize sex crime laws
and openly called for changes in molestation laws in his second
study, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>:  "It is
difficult to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched, or disturbed
at seeing the genitalia of other persons, or disturbed at even
more specific sexual contacts."[16]  
<P>
<LI>  Following the advice of such a prominent scientist, federal
and state officials began altering the penalties for molestation
and other sex crimes, as noted in a paper by Dr. Judith Reisman.
 In 1977 and 1985, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Survey
of Crime Severity, a perennial list of more than 200 crimes that
is used by the legal community to establish sentencing guidelines,
omitted child rape, child pornography, and child prostitution
as serious crimes.[17]
<P>
Writing in <I>Scientific Monthly</I> in 1955, law enforcement
scholar Morris L. Ernst explains Kinsey's importance:  "The
Kinsey report is the single greatest contribution of science to
the rule-making part of the law in my lifetime."[18]  
<P>
<LI>  The Kinsey influence also extends into federally-funded projects
at sex research institutes, including the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, which was founded by
Kinsey at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana in 1947.
 Indiana University provides support to the Kinsey Institute,[19]
and the Institute also provides support to federally-funded researchers.

<P>
Former Kinsey Institute Director June Machover Reinisch was awarded
three grants from the National Institutes of Health totalling
more than $3 million from 1981 to 1989.[20]  In 1989, the <I>Chicago
Tribune</I> reported that the National Institutes of Health launched
an investigation into "how millions of federal research grant
dollars were spent" by Reinisch.  In the case of one grant
for $658,307 from the National Institutes of Child Health and
Human Development, an NIH investigator found "no financial
illegalities" but did find that payments made to a subcontracted
researcher had been placed in a special bank account under the
names of the Kinsey Institute, Reinisch, and another Kinsey employee.[21]
 "This procedure is unconventional and highly questionable,"
the report stated.[22]  The bank account was closed "as a result
of the initial internal review conducted by the University."[23]
<P>
Another example of a federally-funded researcher under Kinsey
auspices is Howard B. Kaplan, co-author of a chapter in the Kinsey
Institute's 1990 book, <I>Homosexuality, Heterosexuality:  Concepts
of Sexual Orientation</I>.  Kaplan received a grant for this work
from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the Centers for Disease
Control.[24]
<P>
In 1987, two federal agencies -- the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases and the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development -- sponsored The Fourth Kinsey Symposium,
titled, "AIDS and Sex:  An Integrated Biomedical and Biobehavioral
Approach."  The conference, which was also sponsored by the
host organization, the Kinsey Institute, was co-chaired by Bruce
Voeller, the late homosexual activist who was president of the
Mariposa Education and Research Foundation of Topanga, California.
 A conference statement describes Mariposa's purpose:  "to
foster a society more honest and at ease with its own sexuality.
. ."[25]  According to <I>Who's Who in America</I>, former
Kinsey Institute President June Reinisch is also affiliated with
Mariposa.[26]
<P>
<LI>  One of the most common myths derived from Kinsey's research
is the estimate that 10 percent of the population is homosexual.
 Until recently this figure has been accepted without question.
<P>
The overblown 10 percent figure is actually an exaggeration of
Kinsey's claim.  Kinsey said that 10 percent of males are homosexual
for at least three years during a portion of their lives.  For
females, Kinsey said, the figure was less than five percent. 
Homosexual activists along with the media repeatedly cited the
10 percent figure and it was generally accepted by the culture.
<P>
The figure has been used to lobby for homosexual affirmation programs,
the extension of family benefits to homosexual employees of corporations,
and to frighten elected officials and business leaders into believing
that they have to accommodate a sizable minority.
<P>
A huge body of evidence has emerged challenging the 10 percent
figure.  Studies from the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Norway,
Denmark and other nations show a homosexuality prevalence of one
percent or less.[27]

<P>
New research data released by the National Center for Health Statistics
shows that adopted children fare better than children in single
parent households on a number of practical health indicators.
 The study, &quot;Health of Our Nation's Children,&quot; is based
on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
<P>
Specifically, the study found that adopted children are far more
likely than fatherless children in single parent households to:
<UL>
<LI><B>Wear seatbelts</B> -- While 20.6 percent of adopted children
rarely or never wear seatbelts, nearly 40 percent of children
in single-mother homes do not wear seatbelts.  This disparity
is especially marked when the children are under the age of 12.
 Among fatherless children, 30.1 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds
and 44.6 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds rarely or never wear seatbelts;
only 12.3 percent of adopted children in either age range do not
wear seatbelts.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>See a dentist</B> -- Only 10.3 percent of  adopted children
aged 3-17 have not seen a dentist in the past 2 years, compared
with 19.7 percent of children living in single-mother homes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Live in a smoke-free home</B> -- Less than 32 percent of
adopted children currently live or have lived during the past
year in a household with a smoker, but the percentage increases
to nearly 50 percent for children in single-mother households.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Have a regular bedtime</B> -- While 8.3 percent of adopted
children have a late or irregular bedtime, fully 22 percent of
their fatherless counterparts have a late or irregular bedtime.
</UL>


<P>
These data show that children from adoptive two-parent homes are
at significantly lower health risk than children in fatherless
homes.  Such practical measurements add a unique contribution
to the overwhelming empirical evidence which demonstrates that
children living with two continuously married parents, whether
biological or adoptive, are healthier than children in single-parent
or stepparent households.  In light of the current national debates
over welfare reform and the adoption tax credit, the NHIS findings
take on even more significance.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
At a time when some are attempting to shift the emphasis of welfare
reform away from discouraging illegitimacy these new data show
just cause to squarely focus attention on combating illegitimacy.

<P>
The evidence regarding illegitimacy is clear:  there is nothing
&quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of families.  Children of
never-married mothers are at elevated risk in the long term: 
they are more likely to use drugs, to be promiscuous, and to engage
in violent crime, among other high-risk activities.  But even
in the immediate, concrete terms of everyday life, measured by
seatbelt use or living in a smoke-free home, illegitimacy places
children at increased risk.  These findings are reason enough
for the welfare system to halt the subsidizing of illegitimacy
by increasing benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As an alternative to illegitimacy, adoption ranks as one of the
best options.  In fact, when presented with four options as the
best means to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies among teenagers,
Americans ranked adoption as the best alternative (33 percent),
followed by keeping the child and marrying the child's father
(25 percent), keeping the child and raising it by herself (13
percent), and having an abortion (10 percent), according to a
recent Family Research Council poll.
<P>
Adoption is indeed a good option, and the aforementioned NHIS
data only adds more weight to the large and growing body of evidence
which shows that <B>adoption benefits children</B>.  Adopted children
are not only very often the recipients of a loving, two-parent
home, but they also exhibit high levels of self-esteem and self-identity,
as a recent Search Institute study shows.
<P>
Thus, it is encouraging that the U.S. House of Representatives
recently passed a proposal to make adoption a more affordable
choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing a tax credit
of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.  These expenses
could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other
expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of the
child.

<TITLE>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by
<P>Gracie S. Hsu, M.H.S.</I></CENTER>
<P>
Congress should restore the original intent of the Hyde Amendment, preserving
states' and voters' rights to set limitations on the use of taxpayer
funds to pay for certain abortions.  
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  Since 1976,
Congress has annually approved the Hyde Amendment, named for its
original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), which bans the use of
federal Medicaid funds for abortion except when the life of the
mother is endangered.  In 1993, Hyde's exception clause was expanded
to include cases of rape and incest.  The expansion was reluctantly
agreed upon by  many pro-lifers so that President Clinton's attempt
to repeal the Hyde Amendment altogether could be successfully
halted.  Also, House floor debate made it clear that these &quot;rape
and incest&quot; exceptions were only intended to be options for
states because many states' laws prohibit the taxpayer funding
of abortion.
<P>
However, in December 1993, the Clinton administration
issued a series of directives which &quot;interpreted&quot; the
revised Hyde Amendment as a mandate that states <B>must</B> provide and
co-fund Medicaid abortions in the cases of rape and incest.  Under
Clinton's  directive, the abortionist may simply make the unverifiable
assertion that a woman is the victim of rape or incest but is
unable, for physical or <I>psychological</I> reasons, to comply with
a reporting or documentation requirement.  Any state which refused
to comply, the directives said, would risk losing <B>all</B> federal
Medicaid funding.  At the time the directives were issued, 32
states had laws or regulations prohibiting public funding for
abortion except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered.
 Many of these states' laws were passed by public referendum (rather
than by state legislatures).  And yet, since that time, many states
have been forced to repeal or change their laws -- either through
legislative action or court order.
<P>
In fact, Arkansas' and Colorado's
constitutional amendments prohibiting state funding of abortion
except when the life of the mother is endangered -- an amendment
supported by then-Governor Clinton -- were struck down <B><I>in their
entirety</I></B> by a federal court, opening the door to state funding
of abortion on demand. 
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  Several members of
Congress have sought to restore the pre-Clinton intent of the
Hyde Amendment to respect states' (and voters') rights.  Spearheaded
by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.),
the Exon-Istook Amendment would preserve the rights of states
to opt for or against state taxpayer provision and funding of
abortion in cases of rape and incest, thereby rescinding the Clinton
administration's mandate to the states.
<P>
The first
attempt to include the Exon-Istook Amendment in the "Rescissions
Bill" earlier this year failed due to pro-abortion Republicans
threatening to vote against the important rescissions package
unless the Exon-Istook Amendment was dropped.  However, the Exon-Istook
Amendment will be re-introduced in Congress this summer as an
attachment to and clarification of the Hyde Amendment.  The Hyde
Amendment has been annually offered by Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.)
as an amendment to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes
before Congress for a vote every summer.
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>  The prospects
are hopeful that the Exon-Istook Amendment will be passed by both
Congressional houses if it is included with the Hyde Amendment
in the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill this summer.  But expect
the same pro-abortion Republicans as well as the heavy rhetoric
of the Clinton administration to try to thwart the passage of
the Exon-Istook Amendment.

<TITLE>STOP TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>STOP TAXPAYER FUNDING OF
<BR>ABORTION THROUGH THE
<BR>FEDERAL EMPLOYEE 
<BR>HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>

</CENTER>
<P>
Currently, federal taxpayer
dollars are being used to fund abortions for federal employees
through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
 Congress should seek to end such funding by amending the Treasury/Postal
Service Appropriations Act.
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  The Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program covers about 9 million federal government employees
(including dependents and retirees).  It provides enrollees with
a broad selection of private health insurance plans, offering
a rich menu of between 18 and 35 individual benefit packages.
 Monies for the FEHBP are allocated through the Treasury and Postal
Service Appropriations Act, and the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) administers the program as the sole negotiator of health
benefits for federal employees.
<P>
Federal taxpayer dollars fund the
greater portion of employee health benefits.  The government contributes
about 60 percent of the funds needed to purchase each employee's
health insurance.  In some plans, the federal contribution is
much higher (e.g., the government's share of the premium for Kaiser
HMO is 75 percent).
<P>
In 1980, before the Smith-Ashbrook Amendment
was instituted, the Office of Personnel Management reported that
an estimated $9 million in taxpayers' money was spent to pay for
17,000 abortions.
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  In 1983, the Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment was passed in the Treasury/Postal Service Appropriations
bill, prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortions
for federal employees enrolled in the FEHBP.
<P>
The Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>Sec. A:  &quot;No funds appropriated
by this Act shall be available to pay for an abortion, or the
administrative expenses in connection with any health plan under the federal employees health
benefit program
which provides any benefits or coverage for abortions.&quot; </UL>
<UL>Sec.
B:  &quot;The provision of section A shall not apply where the
life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried
to term.&quot; </UL>
<P>
However, in 1993, through the urging of the Clinton
Administration, pro-abortion members in Congress proposed and
passed a bill which did not include the longtime restriction on
abortion coverage in federal employee health plans (207-206 in
the House, 73-27 in the Senate).  And on October 28, 1993, President
Clinton signed H.R. 2403 into law (P.L. 103-123), folding abortion
coverage into the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>
 The FEHBP bill was able to pass in 1993 because it was introduced
in Congress almost simultaneously with the Clinton Administration's
proposal to repeal the Hyde Amendment.  As a result, most pro-lifers
concentrated their efforts to preserve Hyde.  The sole attempt
to counter FEHBP's expansion sought to permit abortion coverage
only through a separate rider to federal employee health benefit
plans.  This attempt, spearheaded by Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.),
was defeated by only three votes (48-51).
<P>
The makeup of Congress
today, however, is quite different from what it was in 1993. 
The current pro-life majorities in both Houses of Congress make
it possible to introduce and pass a Smith/Ashbrook-type of amendment
this summer when the Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill comes
up for a vote.

<TITLE>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S WAR ON THE FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S
<BR>WAR ON THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<CENTER>

<P>
The Legal Service Corporation (LSC) is an independent, nonprofit
corporation funded by the federal government to the tune of $415
million a year.  LSC's purported purpose is to provide poor people
access to expensive legal services.  But, actually, LSC has become
a deep well for anti-family litigation.  By using carefully-selected
&quot;test cases&quot; in carefully selected courts, liberal activists
have used the LSC to litigate their agenda, sidestepping democracy
and the legislative process.
<P>
Since 1974, LSC has spent $5 billion working against the interests
of the family on many fronts.  Following are some examples:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PROMOTING ABORTION AND DIVORCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Legal Services Act, as amended in 1977 and in subsequent appropriations
acts, prohibited LSC from being involved in abortion related cases.
 Nonetheless, LSC has remained firmly committed to abortion on
demand and has worked around the law in an attempt to secure unlimited,
taxpayer-funded abortions.  In several cases throughout the country,
LSC has worked against waiting periods, parental consent, parental
notification and spousal notification.
<P>
In <I>Planned Parenthood Association, Inc. v. Department of Human
Resources, </I>Oregon Legal Services represented Planned Parenthood
in a challenge to a limitation on the number of elective abortions
that the state's medical assistance program would fund.  LSC argued
that poor women should have access to an unlimited number of taxpayer-funded
abortions.[1]  LSC took a similar line in a Pennsylvania case, arguing
that such limitations were an unconstitutional infringement of
a woman's right to have an unlimited number of abortions.[2]   In
another Pennsylvania case, LSC filed a class action suit to discard
parental consent for minors and spousal consent.[3]
<P>
In testimony on the reauthorization of LSC, Linda Jones of Concerned
Women for America of California testified that LSC has been involved
in most major abortion cases.  According to Jones, &quot;The list
reads like a virtual hall of fame for abortion rights litigation.&quot; [4]
<P>
LSC seems to be more interested in facilitating divorce in troubled
families than in helping to repair them.  An example of LSC's
lack of commitment to keeping families intact is their view on
mediation. The National Center on Women and Family Law, an LSC-funded
center, argues that mediation, one important means of resolving
domestic disputes, should be avoided because the woman is always
at a disadvantage.[5]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>EXPANDING WELFARE, SUBSIDIZING DESTRUCTIVE
BEHAVIOR</H3></CENTER>
<P>
LSC has also been active in blocking attempts to reform welfare
and in increasing the number of people dependent on public assistance
programs.  In the case of <I>C.K. v. Shalala,</I>[6] LSC joined the
ACLU and the National Organization of Women's Legal Defense Fund
in a class action suit to block New Jersey's law capping welfare
payments to mothers who have additional children while on welfare.
 LSC argued that such a law was an unconstitutional violation
of a woman's right to procreate at will.  LSC has filed similar
suits against California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas and Maine.
<P>
Lawsuits filed by LSC have also helped to subsidize the destructive
habits of alcoholics and drug addicts.  In recent years, LSC has
helped some 250,000 substance addicts obtain monthly disability
checks.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AIDING THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In the case of <I>Rush v. Parham,</I>[8] the Atlanta Legal Aid Society,
an LSC grantee, tried to force the state of Georgia to pay for
a sex change operation.  The suit challenged the Georgia Department
of Health's prohibition on Medicaid reimbursement for such operations.
 
<P>
The Legal Aid Society of Kentucky, another LSC grantee, represented
a lesbian mother who contested the custody of a two-and-a-half-year-old
child to the father, who had remarried.  In the case of <I>S.
v S.,</I>[9]  LSC lawyers challenged the customary preference for
the traditional family as the best environment in which to raise
children.
<P>
In a  1986 New York Case involving a lease agreement,[10] LSC claimed
that a &quot;gay life partner&quot; should be treated as a family
member.  Arguing that equal protection required that the gay partner
be treated as a family member, attorneys from the Legal Aid Society
successfully argued the case in the New York Supreme Court, calling
into question laws that favor and protect the traditional family.
  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PUSHING THE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Children's rights,&quot; is another area where LSC lawyers
have pursued an anti-family agenda.  The notion that children
have rights independent of their parents is a concept that undermines
parental authority and opens the door to state interference in
the raising of children.  In the case of <I>Nafzinger v. Blum</I>,[11]
LSC lawyers successfully argued that minors who no longer wanted
to live at home should get their own welfare benefits.  The Legal
Aid Society of Central Texas, an LSC grant recipient, filed a
suit to force public housing officials to rent apartments to minors.[12]
 In 1992, Legal Services of Greater Miami argued that children
should have standing to sue their parents.[13] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>GOING SOFT ON CRIME AND AIDING CRIMINALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Criminals often find a friend in LSC.  In a bizarre and disturbing
case from Pennsylvania,  Lehigh Valley Legal Services represented
a convicted rapist in prison who was suing for custody of the
child he fathered by the rape of a 13 year old girl.  A psychologist
found the rapist unfit to be a parent and determined that any
child in his custody would be endangered.  After a three-day non-jury
trial the judge ruled that the rapist had no parental rights.[14]
 In cases like <I>Duran v. Elrod,</I>[15] LSC grantees have worked
hard to make sure that prisons look more like country clubs than
places to protect society from dangerous people. Such lawsuits
have had the additional consequence of increasing the costs of
incarcerating criminals, and putting many of them back on the
street, often in neighborhoods where the poor become their main
targets.[16]  LSC lawsuits have also made it difficult to evict drug
dealers from public housing units and to keep them out in the
first place.[17]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By advancing this radical, anti-family agenda, LSC has done far
more to hurt poor people than to help them.  The poor, as well
as the rest of the country, can't afford LSC.  In recent testimony
to a House Judiciary Sub-Committee Howard Phillips, former head
of the Office of Economic Opportunity,  said that the true cost
of LSC should include the impact of actual, threatened and feared
LSC-related suits as well as increased federal state and local
government spending.  According to Phillips, &quot;viewed in this
way, the LSC is properly seen as a central player in our current
national deficit and debt problem.&quot; [18] Attempts to reform LSC
have failed and the agency should be abolished.  The poor are
better served by state and local initiatives as well as private
foundations and bar associations.  These institutions have demonstrated
the ability to adequately meet the legitimate legal needs of the
poor.  Non-federal contributions to LSC-type programs amounted
to $255 million in 1994.[19]  At a time when Congress needs to carefully
assess budgetary priorities it makes no sense to continue funding
LSC.

<title>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE 
IN BEIJING</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS<br>
TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE IN<br>
BEIJING</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The Family Research Council (FRC) is an organization dedicated
to preserving and strengthening the traditional family unit. 
As such, FRC is strongly opposed to major elements of the agenda
for the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women which is to be held
in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995.
<P>
FRC finds this conference objectionable not only because the conference
-- which claims to uphold women's rights -- is being hosted by
a country with a long track record of abuses against women (i.e.,
female infanticide, coerced abortion policies, involuntary sterilization,
the one-child-per-couple mandate, etc.), but also because the
platform document under consideration denigrates motherhood, undermines
the traditional family unit, and erodes the foundations of marriage
and family life while upholding abortion and the dissemination
of contraceptives to minors as positive alternatives.
<P>
Among its most egregious violations, the document:
<UL>
<LI><B>Denigrates the values of motherhood and traditional family
life.</B>  For example, the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed
throughout the entire platform so that it might be changed to
the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;  Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot;
has been bracketed so that it might be changed to &quot;household.&quot;
 [Bracketed sections indicate that delegates could not agree on
the text.  These sections are to be discussed further, with each
alternative weighed equally.]  In addition, the word &quot;family&quot;
almost always appears in a negative context, i.e., in relation
to domestic violence or as a vehicle for female oppression.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power
play. </B>  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform: &quot;Inequality
in the public arena can often start within the family when <I>power
relations</I> between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on<I> unequal
power relations</I> also limits women's potential...for participation
in decision-making in wider public forums&quot; (emphasis added).
 Thus, rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are nowhere to be found
in the document even though the populace of every country participating
in the conference honors the marital relationship.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Fails to uphold traditional morality by leaving the term
&quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</B>
While &quot;gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform 
document, the U.N. fails to define the term.  During a preparatory
committee meeting for the conference, one of the delegates asked
that the term &quot;gender&quot; be defined as the traditional
biological classifications of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot;
 Others, however, sought to define &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the
socially-constructed roles which society assigns to men and women.&quot;
 This latter definition has been used in feminist literature to
mean that gender is subject to change and that there exists a
spectrum of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual,
female heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual). 
The U.N. rejected both definitions and decided that &quot;gender&quot;
was to be understood &quot;in its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;
  One can only hope the commonly accepted meaning of gender in
the United States remains that which acknowledges the biological
classifications of male and female.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</B>
 In various areas relating to sexuality, reproduction, and AIDS,
the document repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling,
recognizing their rights to privacy, confidentiality, and informed
consent.&quot;  Only rarely does the document make mention of
the &quot;rights, duties, and responsibilities of parents,&quot;
but it seems to do so as a concession because parents are still
legally responsible for their children.  The document, however,
refuses to recognize parental <I>authority</I> in regards to their
children's reproductive health.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</B>
 The efforts of the previous U.N. conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen
to promote abortion and unrestricted contraceptive availability
are well-known.  The Beijing document follows in this tradition.
 While the platform fails to recognize the role of men as husbands
and fathers, it does express the notion that women should be completely
autonomous in their reproductive decision-making.  Indeed, the
platform urges governments to &quot;take action to ensure that
women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized and
respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  Furthermore, the platform seems
to elevate reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights,
stating that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).

<title>CAPRICORN RECORDS GOES TO POT</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAPRICORN RECORDS<br>
GOES TO POT</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>David J. Chamberlin and Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Unfazed by the hit that Time Warner has received in the last two
months for peddling sex, drugs, and violence, Capricorn Records
will soon release <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit album with a portion
of the proceeds going to the National Organization for the Reform
of Marijuana Laws (NORML).
<P>
It is not surprising that pro-drug musicians support NORML  --
 at least 45 bands have declared their support for legalizing
marijuana.[1]  It is surprising however, that Capricorn Records'
president Phil Walden didn't learn from Time Warner's recent public
flogging over the promoting of music that glorifies drug use,
puts down women, promotes Satanism, or encourages violence.
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recently emphasized
the dangers of marijuana, saying,  &quot;Young people must understand
that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous
drug that can have acute and hazardous effects. . .Drug use --
 including marijuana. . .is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.&quot;[2]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  Marijuana
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem solving, and forming concepts.[3]
<P>
More than 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana
damages brain cells and the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction
in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns
of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[4]
<P>
The effects of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those already
outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with crime.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent of inmates
have used cocaine and that half had used drugs in the month before
their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used marijuana
in the past.[5]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders, depression, and low self esteem.  A high proportion
of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.  
<UL>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana, killed
a stranger for no obvious reason.[6]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer, rum,
marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a tourist
from Brooklyn.[7]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother and
stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of marijuana.[8]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana when one
accidentally shot and killed the other.[9]</UL>
<P>
Not all users become violent, but social scientists confirm the
relationship between drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990
study published in the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found the
strongest association between the severity of the crime and the
type of substance abused  --  the more intoxicating the substance,
the more serious the incident.[10]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[11]
<P>
Fortunately, Walden still has time before <I>Hempilation's</I>
Sept. 26 release to reverse his blatant pro-drug decision.  Capricorn
ought to follow Simon &amp; Schuster's example of five years ago,
when it canceled plans to publish <I>American Psycho</I>, a novel
by Bret Easton Ellis, after advance complaints about objectionable
passages detailing the sexual torture and mutilation of women.[12]
<P>
It's time that record companies meet their responsibility to distribute
music that doesn't glorify drug use.  It's time Capricorn Records
heeded the timely warning that Time Warner received from angry
parents.

<title>CAREERS: A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAREERS:<br>
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
On Sept. 19, 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in
favor of the CAREERS Act (H.R. 2332), a bill which would consolidate
about 100 job training programs into three.  They call it a victory
because they've streamlined programs and saved money.  We call
it a failure to uproot key elements of the Goals 2000 agenda.
<p>
While sponsors of the bill accepted some of the changes suggested
by pro-family groups, they were unwilling to strike references
to the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) and a requirement
that state skill standards be referenced to the national skill
standards to be developed by that board.  NSSB was a creation
of the National Skill Standards Act of 1994, a part of the same
public law as Goals 2000 (Pub. Law 103-227), and in keeping with
its philosophy.  NSSB would fund, oversee, and endorse the creation
of a national system of skill standards, certificates, and assessments;
it is to occupational skills what the National Education Goals
Panel is to academics.  Yet some conservative members of Congress
failed to see the flaws in such a system.
<p>
One small victory was the addition of language to prohibit any
requirement that a student meet federally funded or endorsed skill
standards or obtain a federally funded or endorsed skill certificate.
 Because this provision has the potential to undermine significantly
the influence of the National Skill Standards Board, this provision
could be a prime target as the bill goes to conference.
<p>
CAREERS will now go to a House-Senate Conference Committee to
work out differences between versions passed in the two houses.
 Unfortunately,  Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kan.) job training
bill (S. 143) embraces the philosophy advanced in the liberal
School-to-Work Act of 1994 even more than CAREERS does.  This
may threaten even the minor improvements gained in the House bill.
<p>
The 104th Congress has unfinished business in education.   No
adequate proposal to repeal Goals 2000 has yet been advanced.
 Rep. Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.) claims his &quot;Education Reform
Consolidation Grant&quot;  would repeal Goals 2000,  but it does
so only in name.   Its core elements remain intact:  the National
Education Goals Panel, the National Education Goals, and bullying
the states on how to reform.  Does it make sense for a &quot;reformist&quot;
Congress to pass on the meddlesome, bureaucratic, centralizing
legacy of Goals 2000 and School-to-Work, rather than put an end
to it?
<p>

<title>BIRTHS TO UNMARRIED WOMEN: HOW THE STATES ARE MEASURING UP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>BIRTHS TO<br>
UNMARRIED WOMEN:<br>
HOW THE STATES ARE<br>
MEASURING UP</h2></center>
<p>
Thirty-one percent of all births in the United States are to unmarried
women, according to a September 1995 report issued by the National
Center for Health Statistics.  Only 10 states have an illegitimacy
ratio below 25 percent.
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.  Indeed, among the southern rim states,
only Alabama and Texas have illegitimacy ratios lower than 35
percent.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a rate of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.
<p>
There is a strong relationship between the percentage of births
to unmarried women and race.  Nationally, 68.7 percent of all
black births are out of wedlock, while 23.6 percent of white births
are to unmarried women.  Thus, states with high percentages of
births out of wedlock also tend to have relatively high percentages
of unmarried black women.
<p>
Between the years of 1991-1993, the proportion of all births to
unmarried women rose 3 percentage points.  During this same time
period, non-marital childbearing rose for white women, declined
slightly for black women, and remained essentially unchanged for
Hispanic women. Individual state percentages declined in only two states 
from 1992 to 1993:  Michigan by 0.8 percent and Texas by 0.5 percent.
<p>
Of the nation's 20 most populous states, only Minnesota (with
a ratio of 23.4 percent) and Texas (with a ratio of 17.0 percent)
rank among the few Top Ten states with the lowest percentage of
births to unmarried women.

<title>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Definition:  Denial of AFDC cash benefits to women who
have additional children while on welfare.  The family cap passed
by the House includes a state option to provide vouchers for goods
and services in lieu of cash benefits.</b>
<p>
<li>The family cap represents a minimum standard of acceptability
for new welfare legislation.  Because being born out-of-wedlock
increases the likelihood that an individual will live in poverty,
depend on welfare -- and parent another child out-of-wedlock --
we cannot begin to address welfare dependency until we address
illegitimacy.
<p>
<li>The problem is NOT that too many women are on welfare.  The
problem is that too many single women are bearing children they
are neither financially nor emotionally prepared to support --
and welfare has almost certainly played a role in increasing that
trend.
<p>
<li>The family cap simply asks women on welfare to meet the same
social expectations and live by the same rules that the rest of
us do.  By insisting that women on welfare are every bit as capable
of personal responsibility and rational decision-making, the family
cap accords much more dignity to welfare mothers than the current
system.
<p>
<li>The family cap is a question of simple justice.  The working
poor certainly don't receive an increase in their salary when
they add children to their families.  And is it really fair to
children to encourage a generation of irresponsible parents by
dispensing checks willy-nilly?
<p>
<li>The family cap is a responsibility issue -- not a constriction
of reproductive freedom.  It is the current welfare system that
is manipulating fertility rates.  The fact that we are now confusing
an end to social engineering with social engineering itself is
simply evidence of how far wrong we've gone in the past 30 years.
<p>
<li>The argument is NOT that women have additional children in
order to get the additional dollars.  The existence of the welfare
system shields women from the natural economic consequences of
irresponsible decisions -- and thereby encourages a lack of parental
responsibility, which in turn harms marriage and hurts children.
<p>
<li>The preliminary results from New Jersey (the first state to
implement a family cap) are a powerful demonstration that the
family cap is an effective and necessary reform.  In an initial
experiment, the birth rate dropped for women in <I>both</I> the
treatment and control groups.  Meanwhile, there has been no real
increase in abortions -- the slight rise in the raw numbers is
well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  And in
fact, the pre-cap monthly average abortion rate is slightly <I>higher
</I>than the post-cap monthly average abortion rate.
<p>
<li>The fact that the birth rate dropped in both the treatment
and control groups suggests that the cap has sent a powerful symbolic
message about personal responsibility that has reinforced the
impact of erasing the economic incentive.  The evidence suggests,
then, that we must work to reform the culture at the same time
that we are reversing the perverse economic incentives of the
welfare system.  The goal, in other words, is to instill moral
knowledge while eliminating the tension between morality and the
incentives of the current welfare system.
<p>
<li>We hope to instill morality by rebuilding strong families
and by shifting functions from the state and federal governments
to character-forming institutions in the local community -- families,
schools, churches, and voluntary organizations.  Rebuilding strong
families will require a concerted effort to reduce illegitimacy,
and rebuilding the moral-cultural sphere will require scaling
back government benefits so that local communities are once again
free and able to care for their own.

<title>SEX EDUCATION: WHAT WORKS?</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>SEX EDUCATION: WHAT WORKS?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The institutionalization of &quot;family life&quot; or sex education
classes in public and private schools around the country has created
a demand for curricula on the subject.  Unfortunately, the broad
reach of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and SIECUS has
left many school boards and parents thinking that there is no
alternative except to teach &quot;safe sex.&quot;  But there <I>is</I>
an alternative that has shown to be even more effective than &quot;safe
sex&quot; in reducing teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted
diseases -- abstinence.  This paper is designed to help concerned
school board members and parents choose a solid abstinence curriculum.
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ABSTINENCE EDUCATION?</h3></center>
<p>
Abstinence is the only strategy for preventing teenage pregnancy
and sexually-transmitted diseases that is 100 percent effective.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
it is &quot;the most effective solution&quot; to unwanted pregnancy
and sexual disease.[1]
<p>
Given the effectiveness of abstinence, a number of states -- including
Texas, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana -- have
passed laws in recent years stipulating that public school sex
education programs be abstinence-based.[2] Many of these programs
have produced promising results:
<p><ul>
<li>San Marcos Junior High in San Marcos, California, adopted
an abstinence-only curriculum developed by Teen-Aid, Inc., titled
<I>Sexuality, Commitment, and Family</I>.  The year before the
curriculum was implemented, 147 girls were reported pregnant.
 But two years after the program's adoption, only 20 girls became
pregnant.[3]
<p>
<li>Historically, the eighth-grade class at Nathan Hale Middle
School in the Chicago suburb of Crestwood included a number of
already pregnant girls. When the school decided to adopt an abstinence
program for the kids, many adults were skeptical.  But after three
years of quality sessions with the abstinence program <I>Project
Taking Charge</I>, the school graduated three pregnancy-free classes
in a row.[4]
<p>
<li>In the Washington, D.C. chapter of &quot;Best Friends,&quot;
only one out of 400 girls has become pregnant since the program
began.  Elayne Bennett, director of &quot;Best Friends,&quot; says that 
between 20 and 70 pregnancies are common
for the same-sized group of fifth- to ninth-grade girls in the
District of Columbia.  One &quot;Best Friends&quot; member explains,
&quot;I want to save my virginity for the man I marry....And I
want my child to have a daddy.&quot;[5]
<p>
<li>An evaluation of the abstinence-based program <I>Sex Respect:
 The Option of True Sexual Freedom</I> found that students participating
in the program had considerably lower pregnancy rates than those
in a comparison group.  Only 5 percent of the female program participants
and 9 percent of the non-program students became pregnant in the
two years following the program.[6]
<p>
<li>Emory University's abstinence-only curriculum, <I>Postponing
Sexual Involvement</I>, teaches kids about abstinence through
skill-building exercises on &quot;how to say no.&quot;  An evaluation
of the program showed that its participants were less likely to
become sexually active than those not involved in the program.[7]
<p>
<li><I>AANCHOR</I>, an alternative national curriculum on responsibility,
stresses the importance of family involvement and individual responsibility
to prevent adolescent pregnancy.  An evaluation of the curriculum
found three statistically significant differences between students
receiving the AANCHOR curriculum and students receiving the standard
school curriculum. The students participating in AANCHOR were
significantly more likely to report (1) higher family strengths,
i.e., loyalty, emotional support, cohesion, (2) greater discussions
with parents about sexual values and beliefs, and (3) more abstinent
attitudes regarding premarital sexual involvement.[8]
<p>
<li>Students who participated in the abstinence-based <I>FACTS</I>
curriculum showed significant pre-post effects occurring on the
measures of (1) affirmation of abstinence, (2) rejection of permissiveness,
and (3) future orientation and peer support for abstinence.  These
attitudinal data are important indicators of delaying sexual activity.[9]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD ABSTINENCE CURRICULUM</h3></center>
<p>
In order to choose an appropriate abstinence curriculum, parents
and school board members should study curricula for their focus,
methodologies, and content.
<p>
<b>Focus of Curricula:</b> The growing interest in abstinence
curriculum has caused many contraception programs to frame themselves
as &quot;abstinence-based,&quot; &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; or
&quot;comprehensive&quot; because they mention abstinence as one
of several options.  Such programs, however, communicate a mixed
message to students which thereby tremendously weakens the abstinence
message.  Some common characteristics of these &quot;comprehensive&quot;
or &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; programs are that they (1) assume
that teenagers are inevitably sexually active, (2) emphasize contraception
and abortion, and (3) include affective decision-making (presenting
abstinence as one of many options from which to choose).  Thus,
parents and school boards should choose a curriculum that avoids
these danger points, and instead upholds abstinence as the way
to handle teen sex issues.
<p>
<b>Methodology of Curricula:</b> The method used to deliver sex
education material heavily influences the way students will respond
to the abstinence message.  Effective abstinence programs are
directive in their approach.  Dr. Onalee McGraw provides a comparative
analysis of competing delivery models of sex education in her
book <i>Foundations for Family Life Education</i>:[10]
<p><hr><p>

Abstinence is defined as a positive     Abstinence is taught within the

Parental guidance is essential.         Only a minority of parents are willing

</pre>
<p><hr><p>
Directive abstinence education emphasizes the importance of values
and attitudes, which is consistent with a U.S. Department of Education
study, &quot;The Role of Responsibility and Knowledge in Reducing
Teenage Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing,&quot; which found that &quot;adolescents
with strong feelings of control over their lives, with higher
educational expectations, and with parents who show concern and
have higher educational expectations for their daughters have
lower chances of experiencing teenage childbirth.&quot;[11]
<p>
Furthermore, students want help in saying &quot;no&quot; to sexual
activity.  When Emory University surveyed 1,000 sexually active
girls and asked them what they would most like to learn to reduce
teen pregnancy, 84 percent responded, &quot;How to say no without
hurting the other person's feelings.&quot;[12]  Moreover, a recent
study done by Roper Starch in association with the Sex Information
and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) found that,
of the teens who have had sex, 54 percent wish they would have
waited until they were older.[13]
<p>
<b>Content of Curricula:</b> Sex education curricula vary greatly
by content, and parents should be particularly concerned if the
curriculum contains information or pictures too explicit for the
intended audience.  Caution is recommended even in cases in which
a particular sex education curriculum is widely used or endorsed
by prominent organizations.  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>The two-million member National Education Association (NEA)
endorses sex education programs that promote birth control and
homosexuality.[14]
<p>
<li>The influential Sex Information and Education Council of the
United States (SIECUS) has published a widely used set of goals
for sex education curricula entitled, &quot;<U>Guidelines for
Comprehensive Sexuality Education:  Kindergarten - 12th Grade</U>&quot;.
 The report promotes abortion, unmarried couples living together,
and homosexual relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships.[15]

<title>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY<br>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT TYPES OF PORNOGRAPHY ARE FREELY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
The entire spectrum of pornographic material is available on computer
networks including images of soft-core nudity, hard-core sex acts,
anal sex, bestiality, bondage &amp; dominion, sado-masochism (including
actual torture and mutilation, usually of women, for sexual pleasure),
scatological acts (defecating and urinating, usually on women,
for sexual pleasure), fetishes, and child pornography.  Additionally,
there is textual pornography including detailed text stories of
the rape, mutilation, and torture of women, sexual abuse of children,
graphic incest, etc.
<p>
<center><h4>WHO CAN ACCESS PORNOGRAPHY ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Virtually anyone with an account or access to the Internet can
access pornography.  Once &quot;on-line&quot; there are no truly
effective safety measures to prevent children from accessing all
of the pornography described above.  This unlimited access to
pornography, with no accurate, enforceable age check and no verification
procedures, has never occurred in the print, broadcast, satellite
or cable media before.  Cyberspace is currently the free speech
absolutist's dream world.
<p>
<center><h4>WHERE DO CHILDREN AND ADULTS FIND PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Pornography is publicly available through the Internet by accessing
sections in the hierarchies of the Usenet and at a number of sites
on the World-Wide-Web.  It is also traded daily via Internet e-mail
and sites set up for the exchange of pornography.
<p>
<center><h4>ARE THESE SITES POPULAR OR IS THIS REALLY A SMALL PROBLEM?</h4>
</center>
<p>
Although surveys done by on-line administrators indicate that
pornographic sites are among the most often used on the Internet,
the relative percentage of pornographic sites is not certain.
 Regardless of the actual number of sites, which is on the rise, the 
problem of pornography continues to be a very serious one.  Like drugs, 
pornography's destructive effects are felt far beyond the &quot;pusher&quot;
and &quot;user.&quot;
<p>
<center><h4>DON'T WE NEED FURTHER STUDY BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION ON AN ISSUE 
THAT AFFECTS THE FUTURE OF CYBERSPACE?</h4></center>
<p>
Proposals to &quot;study&quot; the issue of computer pornography
are attempts by the ACLU and other ideological groups to delay legislative 
action on this problem.  They fight virtually any legislative restriction on
materials distributed on-line,  and want to dump all responsibility
for action into the laps of parents, many of whom are far less
technologically capable than their children.
<p>
<center><h4>ISN'T THE ON-LINE COMMUNITY AGAINST PROPOSALS FOR &QUOT;DECENCY&QUOT;
ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Some of the on-line community and many of the media are opposed
to any proposals to regulate the Internet or children's access
to pornography.  However, out of an estimated 20 million predominately
male users of various on-line networks, fewer than 2 percent have
opposed the proposals.
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBSCENITY AND INDECENCY?</h4>
</center>
<p>
<I>Obscenity</I> is hard-core sexual material so graphic and unredeeming
that it meets the Supreme Court's three-part test: (1) it appeals
to an abnormal or excessive interest in sex; (2) it depicts or
describes sexually explicit conduct in a patently offensive way;
and (3) it lacks serious literary artistic, political, or scientific
value. <i>Miller v. California</i> (1973). <I>Indecency</I> is
a pattern of patently offensive depictions or descriptions of
sexual or excretory activities or organs.  <i>Pacifica v. F.C.C.</i>
(1978).  This material is legal for consenting adults, but can
be regulated so that it is kept from children.
<p>
<center><h4>WON'T THE BANNING OF &QUOT;INDECENT&QUOT; MATERIALS JEOPARDIZE
SERIOUS WORKS OF LITERATURE OR LIBRARY ART?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  This argument is no more credible now than it was when used
against indecency laws in other contexts.  No serious literary
or artistic works would be banned by an indecency law.  Society
has long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful
material have the obligation to keep the material from children.
 Computer indecency should be no exception.
<p>
<center><h4>AREN'T THERE &QUOT;TECHNICAL FIXES&QUOT; THAT ARE LESS INTRUSIVE
THAN A REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL LAW APPROACH?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  To date, only a few software programs have been released
to regulate children's access to pornography, such as SurfWatch
and NetNanny.  Also, these programs can be bypassed by users with
a good knowledge of the Internet and some technical sophistication.
 Even if better technical solutions become available, this approach
is inadequate in and of itself because:
<ul>
<li>children can walk down the street to another computer
<li>parents' technical ability often pales in comparison to their
children's expertise
<li>pornographers aren't legally discouraged from peddling their
materials to children
</ul>
<p>
<I>The above material includes excerpts adapted from &quot;Children,
Pornography and Cyberspace: The Problem, Solutions &amp; the Current
Congressional Debate&quot; published by the National Coalition
for the Protection of Children &amp; Families.</I>

<h2>STATE-BY-STATE<br>
DIVORCE RATES:<br>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank first and second, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation, according to
new 1994 divorce data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Both states experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between
1992 and 1994 to remain at the top of the list. Massachusetts
fell from 2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from
3.1 to 2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period. Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to 9.0
in 1994.
<p>
The divorce rate per 1,000 population for the entire United States
was 4.6 in 1994, down from 4.8 in 1992. Generally, rates were
lower in the Northeast and Midwest and higher in the West and
Southeast.
<p>
Only four states (New York, South Dakota, Missouri, and Mississippi)
experienced a rise in divorce rates between 1992 and 1994. Eight
other states held the same rate during 1992 and 1994. Vermont,
with a drop in the divorce rate from 5.2 to 4.0, rose in rank
from 27th to a tie for 15th position.

<title>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Remove all the frills and Goals 2000 is essentially an application
process.  These are the terms:  a state agrees to report to the
federal government on its standards and assessments in exchange
for federal grant money.  Signing on the dotted line means a state
will submit its plan for improvement -- standards, assessments
and all -- for federal critique.  There are strings attached to
the Goals 2000 money, and they cannot be avoided unless a state
refuses to participate.
<p>
The only way Goals 2000 can rightly be termed &quot;voluntary&quot;
is that states currently have the option not to participate in
the program.  However, the Goals 2000 application process can
be attached to any piece of federal legislation.  As its requirements
are added to more and more legislation, there will be no way for
states to get federal money for education without submitting to
Goals 2000.
<p>
What's wrong with the terms of the Goals 2000 application agreement?
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  American tradition and law have held that
education is a matter of state and local concern.  As the federal
government began to usurp the control of education, curriculum
was still set apart as an issue reserved for state and local decisionmakers.
The U.S. Education Department was specifically prohibited from
dealing with curricular issues when it was created in 1980.  Yet
Goals 2000 ignores the prohibition.  It calls for federal involvement
in the funding, development and approval of standards and assessments.
These are curricular issues in which the federal government should
not be involved.  Thus, the Goals 2000 application requires a
state to submit to an inappropriate role for the federal government.

<title>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Goals 2000 proponents are conceding flaws in their prized program.
President Bill Clinton himself recently confided to writer Ben
Wattenberg that his education program wasn't what he had hoped
it would be.
<p>
Nevertheless, Goals 2000 spin doctors are now suggesting that,
with the right makeover, the program will emerge irresistible
even to those who previously spurned it.  So they're willing to
undergo an utterly painless procedure:  removal of two controversial
surface elements of Goals 2000 -- the National Education Standards
and Improvement Council (NESIC), and opportunity-to-learn standards.
<p>
<h4>Leaders in the U.S. Congress, governors' offices and state
legislatures should understand that lifts and tucks aren't enough.
The core elements of Goals 2000 are unacceptable:</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>National Education Goals written as federal law (Public Law
103-227); 
<li>a federally funded National Education Goals Panel;
<li>a federally funded National Education Standards and Improvement
Council (NESIC);
<li>a new formula for reform:  federally funded standards and
assessments; and
<li>a prescription that states use this formula for reform and
submit their standards and assessments to the federal government
for approval.
</ul><p>
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  When the U.S. Education Department was
created back in 1979, it was prohibited from dealing with curricular
issues.  Standards and assessments are curricular matters, and
the federal government has no business formulating or reviewing
them.
<p>
<h4>New Twist:  A Dangerous Liaison</h4>
<p>
Some officials, however, have no problem with federal review of
state plans -- in fact, they extend the offer to local districts
as well.  They propose that the federal government disregard the
authority of states like Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana and
Alabama, which have chosen not to participate in Goals 2000, and
go straight to the local districts interested in making a few
bucks by hitching up with Goals 2000.  What better way to invite
federal intrusion into local schools than to have local districts
bypass state authority and submit their plans directly to the
federal government for approval?
<p>
Goals 2000 is built on the flawed thesis that a greater federal
role in the education system will improve schools.  It hasn't
and it won't.  The program and the systems it spawned should be
discontinued immediately.  The money freed up will be spent more
effectively on real education needs -- not systems management
-- if left in the hands of parents and teachers closest to the
student.

<title>FAMILY TIME: WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A poll conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the Families
and Work Institute and the Whirlpool Foundation indicates that
56 percent of all women want more flexibility in their job structures
and work hours without losing their benefits. Similarly, about
one-third of women would work part-time if they could afford to
do so.[1]

<p>

<li>According to this same poll, more than one-fourth of all women
cited the lack of family time as their greatest concern, surpassing
even concerns about neighborhood crime and safety.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1994 University of Connecticut-Storrs study of young mothers
found widespread &quot;ambivalence about returning to work&quot;
and a widespread concern about &quot;loss of time and experience
with their infants.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>A 1995 poll entitled &quot;Women: The New Providers&quot;
found that 88 percent of women say they are pressed for time and
that their greatest concern is not having enough time together
as a family.[4]

<p>

<li>This same poll found that if money were not a consideration,
33 percent would like to work part time, 31 percent would choose
to work at home caring for the family, 20 percent would select
volunteer work while only 15 percent would choose to work full
time.[5]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, according to the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I>.[6]

<p>

<li>A 1992 <I>ABC News</I> poll found that while 59 percent of
adult women nationally believe that &quot;the changes in American
life caused by more women working outside the home have been worth
making,&quot; but 58 percent sometimes long for the days in which
women didn't work outside the home.[7]

<p>

<li>Women who work are &quot;spending less time being married
and having children,&quot; according to researcher John Robinson,
in order to cope with the time constraints created by employment.[8]

<p>

<li>In 1994, 41.6 percent of all women were not in the labor force.
Thirty-nine percent of all women were employed full-time.[9]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT PARENTS WANT</title>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT PARENTS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 Families and Work Institute study found that 66 percent
of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide wanted more time with
their children.[1]

<p>

<li>Parents today spend only 17 hours per week with their children,
40 percent less than in 1965, according to a University of Maryland
study.[2]

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[3]

<p>

<li>Sixty-six percent of employed parents with children ages 18
and under indicated that they did not have enough time with their
children, and another 50 percent indicated that they did not have
enough time with their spouses.[4]

<p>

<li>Thirty-five percent of all workers with children would be
willing to change jobs in order to receive flexible scheduling
around their home concerns.[5]

<p>

<li>The 44 percent of parents who do not feel that they spend
enough time with their children cite work as the most frequent
culprit.[6]

<p>

<li>Half of America's moms have said no to job advancement compared
with only 29 percent of dads. This trend is more prevalent in
younger mothers, where 62 percent have turned down promotions
in favor of spending more time with their children. However, two
out of three dads say they have not turned down a job promotion
in favor of spending more time with their kids.[7]

<p>

<li>Half of all fathers feel that they do not spend enough time
with their children.[8]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Gallup poll found that nearly half of all parents feel
that they spend too little time with their children. Fewer than
one-third of these respondents ate dinner together on a regular
basis.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents' top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking 
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot; 
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by 1986 
parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with their 
children then they did in 1960.[10]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT AMERICANS WANT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT AMERICANS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 study conducted by the Families and Work Institute
found that 66 percent of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide
wanted more time with their children.[1]

<p>

<li>&quot;The Changing Workforce,&quot; a national study conducted
by the Families and Work Institute, found that 66 percent of employed
parents with children ages 18 and under indicated that they did
not have enough time with their children, and another 50 percent
indicated that they did not have enough time with their spouses.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1991 Gallup poll found that when asked what was most important
to them, Americans ranked family life and betterment of society
above &quot;having a nice home, car, and other belongings.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>On average, parents today spend only 17 hours per week with
their children, according to a University of Maryland study.[4] This
is roughly 40 percent less than in 1965.

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[5]

<p>

<li>Sixty percent of all employees consider their jobs effect
on their personal or family life to be a &quot;very important&quot;
factor in their decision to take the job. This is not surprising,
as 42 percent of all U.S. workers have children under 18 years
of age living at home. Furthermore, 32 percent of all U.S. workers
have children under 13 years of age at home, and in 66 percent
of these families both parents work (18 percent for kids under
6 years of age).[6]

<p>

<li>According to a survey commissioned by the Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Company, half of all fathers feel that they do
not spend enough time with their children.[7]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, while 48 percent of men would prefer
more time than money.[8]

<p>

<li>Most workers (57 percent) would trade early retirement in
favor of family time, according to a survey commissioned by the
Family Research Council. Roughly a third (36 percent) said they
prefer to work longer hours now and retire sooner.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot;
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by
1986 parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with
their children than they did in 1960.[10]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Wharton School study found that people who placed high
importance on finding the right spouse and creating a good family
life actually ended up earning more money than those who were
willing to sacrifice home life for their careers. Peter Capelli,
a management professor at the Wharton School, explains that building
a good family life is particularly important early in careers
as &quot;that's where the serious mistakes get made. People who
didn't take time for their families spend a lot of time putting
Band-Aids on family problems&quot; later on, which hurts work
performance and commitment.[11]

<p>

<li>Seventy-eight percent of Americans feel that a father should
choose to spend more time with his children if given the choice
between that and earning more money for his family, and 75 percent
felt that a mother should choose to spend more time with her children
if given the same choice.[12]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT CHILDREN WANT</title>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT CHILDREN WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Half of all children watch more than two hours of television
a day, but three-fourths of these children say that if they could
choose between spending time with their families and watching
television they would choose family time.[1]

<p>

<li>Among children ages 8 to 12, 31 percent say that they do not
spend enough time with their fathers.[2]

<p>

<li>On any given day, nearly 400,000 children -- none of them
eligible for adoption -- can be found in government foster homes,
group homes, and shelters.[3] As one child says, &quot;I'm all 
wrapped up in programs....What I need is a mom.&quot;

<p>

<li>According to the American Public Welfare Association, the
population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the U.S. child population in general. During each
of the past 10 years, more children have entered the system than
exited.[4]

<p>

<li>Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from foster
care by turning 18 with no permanent family. Forty percent of
all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.[5]

<p>

<li>Judith S. Wallerstein conducted a study of 60 families who
experienced divorce between 1971 and 1981. Ten years after the
divorce, the children affected felt &quot;less protected, less
cared for, less comforted...these children [had] vivid, gut-wrenching
memories of their parents' separation.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In the same study by Wallerstein, many 5- to 8-year-old boys
showed &quot;an intense longing for their fathers&quot; after
the divorce -- a longing that seemed physically painful.<B> </B>Not
only did the children's need for their father continue, but it
also tended to recur with new intensity at adolescence, especially
when it was time for the children to leave home.[7]

<p>

<li>Almost 20 percent of sixth- through 12th-graders have not
had a good conversation lasting for at least 10 minutes with at
least one of their parents in more than a month.[8]

<p>

<li>More than one-half of all children who don't live with their
father have never been in their father's current home.[9]

<p>

<li>&quot;Father hunger&quot; often afflicts boys age one and
two whose fathers are suddenly and permanently absent. Sleep disturbances,
such as trouble falling asleep, nightmares, and night terrors
frequently begin within one to three months after the father leaves
home.[10]

<p>

<li>The National Commission on Children reported that children
from step-families were more likely to say they often felt lonely
or blue than children from either single-parent or intact families.[11]

<TITLE>ILLEGITIMACY AND ABORTION:</TITLE>
<BODY>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<P>
<H2>ILLEGITIMACY AND ABORTION:<BR>
TWO SIDES OF A SINGLE COIN </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Republicans in Congress have a vested interest in precluding further
debate about the impact of the family cap on marginal abortion
rates.  A united front will send a stronger message to the states
that the welfare system must be radically changed and, at the
same time, will suggest more powerfully than words that neither
politicians nor the party need be hamstrung by an unequivocal
commitment to life.
<P>
By offering cash bonuses to states that reduce out-of-wedlock
births <U>and</U> abortions, the House Ways and Means committee
has seized upon an ideal opportunity to showcase pro-life consensus
-- without muting the emphasis on illegitimacy.
<P>
The incentives measure explicitly avoids reducing illegitimate
births by increasing abortions because changes in the amount of
the grant depend upon a ratio that defines <U>both</U> illegitimate
births and abortions as negative outcomes.  The current bill defines
the &quot;negative outcome ratio&quot; as the total number of
out-of-wedlock births plus abortions, divided by the total number
of births in the state in the applicable year.
<P>
 
By including abortions and out-of-wedlock births in the same total,
the measure eliminates all incentive for states to promote abortion
-- instead of abstinence and marriage -- as the means to ensure
that fewer children are born out of wedlock.  In fact, if passed,
the measure would represent the first time the federal government
has actually rewarded states for implementing policies that contribute
to a lower abortion rate.
<P>
At the same time, the incentives provision strengthens the anti-illegitimacy
provisions in the Republican bill.  The subcommittee bill, for
example, targeted only welfare mothers under the age of 18; but
the new language encourages states to reduce the illegitimacy
rate in all age groups.
<P>
One of the greatest appeals of an incentives solution is that
it explodes the myth that reducing illegitimacy and eliminating
abortion are mutually exclusive goals -- a pernicious misconception
that has been manufactured by liberal observers with a vested
interest in dividing conservative support for welfare reform.

<P>
Pro-lifers should combat that perception at all costs, short of
compromising our principles.  What we think about the right to
life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of
society we should institute -- and spiraling illegitimacy rates
erode our national character in ways that inevitably warp our
vision of the good society.
<P>
While we know that abortion is not an acceptable means to reduce
illegitimacy, we do not know which strategy will work best to
stem the tide of family breakdown.  James Q. Wilson argues that
&quot;the federal government cannot have a meaningful family policy
for the nation, and it ought not to try.&quot;  Codifying that
admonition, the new amendment guarantees the maximum amount of
flexibility that is consistent with a rigorous emphasis on the
reduction of illegitimacy -- and with an insistence on state accountability
for the use of federal funds.
<P>
One caveat Professor Wilson cites (and Speaker Gingrich has reiterated)
is that &quot;every major new [state] initiative must be evaluated
by independent observers operating in accordance with accepted
scientific canons.&quot;  By linking the funding mechanism to
changes in the negative outcomes ratio, the incentives provision
guarantees that states will generate objective data regarding
the number of non-marital births and abortions each fiscal year
-- and that policymakers can assess the &quot;success&quot; of
state experimentation accordingly.  By measuring &quot;outputs&quot;
independently of the dollar inputs which produce them, the amendment
ameliorates one of the worst non-market failures of the current
system.
<P>
By contrast, block grants without any semblance of accountability
threaten to turn the governors into the country's 50 biggest welfare
clients.  Lacking profit as a measure of performance, a state
welfare agency would view its budget as the proxy goal to be maximized.
 In studying the Reagan-era strategy of devolution-by-block-grant,
liberal analysts Richard Nathan and Fred Doolittle discovered
what they termed &quot;the paradox of devolution&quot;:  devolutionary
initiatives activated state and local governments to increase
their own support for programs cut at the federal level -- and,
in turn, to lobby heavily for the restoration of cuts and creeping
increases in grants.  In the end, the Reagan block grants failed
to reverse the growth of government at any level.
<P>
Nathan and Doolittle conclude: &quot;Our advice to politicians
would be for liberals to support state role enhancement in policymaking
and administration in conservative periods.&quot;  The advice
should give conservatives pause before they promote schemes that
give unfettered latitude to the states without also eliminating
all federal funding.
<P>
Short of radical devolution, the best alternative is a measure
that will turn the current incentives structure on its head. 
By rerouting federal dollars to reward the reduction of illegitimacy
rather than the expansion of bureaucracy, an incentives amendment
models a useful mechanism for revising federal-state relations
as well as accomplishing other worthwhile policy goals.

<H2>FREE SPEECH DROWNS<BR>
IN THE WAKE OF THE PC NAVY </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has become so politically correct (PC) since the Tailhook
debacle that now sailors can't even express their opinion about
a controversial policy.
<P>
Last August, Navy pilot Lt. Cmdr. Kenneth Carkhuff told his boss
that he objected to women serving in combat and that his views
were based on religious convictions. As a result, Carkhuff was
removed from his unit and now faces dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate
leadership.&quot;
<P>
Since when does expressing an opinion translate into a leadership
failure? According to the Navy, Carkhuff's disagreement with its
full-steam-ahead women in combat policy warrants a discharge without
benefits after 13 years of outstanding service.
<P>
Carkhuff believes that women should not be subjected to the violence
of combat. His religiously-motivated beliefs are shared by many
less vocal members of the military who understand that PC reigns
and stating a contrary belief is grounds for dismissal.
<P>
This case is really about Constitutionally guaranteed free speech.
During the Second World War the Supreme Court heard a case involving
religiously based speech. In <I>Barnette v. West Virginia State
Board of Education</I>, the high court found that education authorities
could not force a Jehovah's Witness to pledge allegiance to the
American flag. The court ruled that, &quot;Freedom to differ is
not limited to things that do not matter.&quot;
<P>
Women in combat matters to Cmdr. Carkhuff because it's contrary
to his religious beliefs. The 34-year-old Naval Academy graduate
does not dispute the Navy's authority to place women in combat,
but he respectfully disagrees and exercised his Constitutional
right to express that opinion privately.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women. Today, women can serve in 95 percent of
all Navy billets. Feminists say this is progress, but combat veterans
and our combat-hardened allies know this portends future disaster.
<P>
In 1992, uniformed female military officers descended on Capitol
Hill to lobby against the female combat ban labeling it an &quot;equal
opportunity&quot; issue. The

Pentagon ignored the regulations which restrict uniformed sailors
from lobbying.
<P>
These women won their fight. But in contrast, when a lone man
objects to the same radical changes, suddenly an anchor from Washington
drops on his berth threatening to sink him along with his wife
and five children.
<P>
Cmdr. Carkhuff was assigned to an SH60B Seahawk unit which had
five pilots; two were female. He disagreed with the Navy's women-in-combat
policy but agreed to fly with female pilots if ordered. His boss
chose the PC route and booted Carkhuff overboard.
<P>
On January 25th, the Chief of Naval Personnel sent Carkhuff a
letter charging him with &quot;substandard performance&quot; and
failure to demonstrate leadership for not supporting the Navy's
female policy. A board of three Naval captains will soon determine
his fate.
<P>
The issue for Congress is whether the Navy has so embraced political
correctness that it no longer stands by objective truth. Sample
evidence of the Navy's ongoing PC revolution.
<UL>
<LI>Top admiral Jeremy Boorda made one of his first visits to Capitol
Hill a session with Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Co.) -- Tailhook's
grand inquisitor -- and promised to do better. He now oversees
the rapid feminization of the Navy.
<P>
<LI>Three top admirals -- Kelso, Arthur and Mauz -- suffered direct
hits from unsubstantiated feminist accusations. These wounded
warriors were put to sea by the PC Navy.
<P>
<LI> The Navy deceived the public about the pregnancy problem aboard
the first aircraft carrier with women. Five pregnancies became
29 and the count is still climbing.
<P>
<LI>The Navy wrote a pregnancy policy that all but endorses abortion
and takes no position on out-of-wedlock births much less pregnancies
that result from extramarital affairs. But two-thirds of all uniformed,
one-time mothers have never been married and more than half of
all pregnant women who abandon ship never return.
<P>
<LI>The Navy hosted &quot;Diversity Day '94&quot; last September
which was attended by six PC admirals and included seminars that
promoted homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>
<LI>The Navy leads the services in the number of open homosexuals
serving. This violates the military homosexual law signed by President
Clinton in 1993.</UL>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to place more women in combat
is not based on military necessity. It is a political decision
to buy feminist favor and in time it will backfire. In the meantime,
we must pretend.
<P>
Cmdr. Carkhuff should be awarded a medal for declaring the &quot;emperor
has no clothes.&quot; 
Instead, the Pentagon's PC crowd is working overtime ridding the
Navy of people of character who dare oppose a misguided policy.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;  He also conceded
that &quot;there's no question that ending welfare for unwed mothers
would work.  The question is `Is it morally right?'&quot;
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for far more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood that the
way to reintegrate the deviant into society is to cultivate in
them the values of the mainstream culture.
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart 
virtues that temper and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms
must give way.  So, too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders
understood it.  Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said,
is the only true basis of equality and 

the only requisite for citizenship.  Either we act now to reduce
illegitimacy and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment
to higher and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  Given the
consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community,
and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without
a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be regarded as a
morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is
also wrong to sanction such activity by subsidizing it.  Himmelfarb
writes that &quot;after making the most arduous attempt to objectify
the problem of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions
and conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and
material dimensions of that problem are.&quot;
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.  &quot;Welfare programs,&quot; he said, &quot;must
contribute to the attack on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy.
. . .  Unless such problems are dealt with effectively, they fester,
and grow, sapping the strength of society as a whole and extending
their consequences in troubled families from one generation to
the next.&quot;  Kennedy's insight about the consequences has
proven historically accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach
to curbing illegitimacy worked no better than the current President's
will.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, an unnamed aide on the
Clinton welfare task force confided to <U>Newsweek</U> reporter
Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around
the country that were trying to deal with this problem, and not
one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
 A formal study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration, sponsored
by the Department of Health and Human Services in response to
&quot;persistently high rates of teenage pregnancies and births,&quot;
found that &quot;[t]he program had an unusual and disappointing
pattern of impacts on pregnancy and birth rates . . . despite
. . . the substantial efforts of the programs to empower [the]
young mothers to take control of their fertility.&quot;
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <U>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</U>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young
women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect
of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately,
tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else.&quot;  Eliminating
grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient,
to restore the integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers - of any age -
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
As the one policy option that promises to effect change in the
current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.  If compassion is once again properly
understood, perhaps then it will become more obvious that the
object of our concern must be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot;
not economic poverty, and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident
today is the spiritual and moral deprivation visited upon dependents
of the welfare system.  It is time that we stop suppressing the
moral responsibilities that make life precious for a resident
of the inner city just the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.
 It is time, in short, to secure equal access to the central satisfactions
of family, virtue, and freedom.

<P>
<H2>A PRO-LIFE DEFENSE<BR>
  OF THE FAMILY CAP</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both the concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.
<P>
All right-to-life activists should realize that, as one of the
few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy arsenal, the family cap not
only serves their cause in the long-term but deserves their active
support in the present debate -- subject to the critical qualification
that there must be no attendant funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data is available to demonstrate that the family cap stimulates
the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that the family
cap will <U>not</U> increase abortions, even in the short-term.
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.
<P>
Policy data collected by the Family Research Council suggests
that abortion is even less acceptable to poor women; and an article
recently published in <U>Family Planning Perspectives</U> found
that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U>
than national averages for all teenage girls.
<P>
Other research suggests that, whether conception was intended
or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women today are
&quot;wanted.&quot;  Certainly, there is 

anecdotal evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because
they want &quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because
their peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.
<P>
Others simply believe that abortion is wrong and choose not to
compound their first mistake by committing another.  While poverty
dispirits some lives, in others it serves to highlight the intangibles
that make life most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration
among the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every
person, regardless of economic status, is capable of the very
moral commitments that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap is the number of
lives saved in the short-term.  The question itself is a red herring
because it obscures the larger and more important issue: &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Liberal observers with a vested interest in dividing conservative
support have manufactured a pernicious myth that reducing illegitimacy
and eliminating abortion are mutually exclusive goals.  Pro-lifers
should combat that perception at all costs, short of suspending
our principles, because there is no question that reducing illegitimacy
by reducing the federal subsidy will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women who are
pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local organizations,
including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups, that will counsel
against abortion and discourage further irresponsible behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
<P>
Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
We should bear in mind that what we think about the right to life
has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of society
we should institute.  Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks
of &quot;life&quot; in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot;
and &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; -- two conditions that
speak directly to the question of how best to organize society.
<P>
By opposing the current system of welfare benefits, we advocate
a transformation of the political and social culture that will
sustain both &quot;happiness&quot; and a more enduring pro-life
consensus than even legal reform can hope to accomplish.

<P>
<H2> FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES<BR>
 TAXPAYER MONEY TO PROMOTE<BR>
 FEMINIST AGENDA</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
The federal government used taxpayer money to buy packets of radical
feminist literature that denigrates men, promotes abortion on
demand, and declares homosexuality to be the moral equivalent
of heterosexuality.
<P>
The Postal Service and the United States Information Agency have
purchased these packets from the feminist Ms. Foundation for Women
and distributed them nationwide.  The materials were designed
to help plan the annual &quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day,&quot;
which occurred Thursday, April 27th.  
<P>
The Ms. material:
<P>
<LI> Demonizes men and makes girls appear to be uniformly victimized
in a patriarchal society.
<P>
<LI> Presents an unbalanced analysis of educational opportunities
for the sexes.
<P>
<LI>Promotes abortion and warns that unnamed factions want to take
away the &quot;right to choose.&quot;
<P>
<LI> Severely exaggerates statistics.
<P>
The 136-page packets include parent, employer and school guides;
lesson plans for girls and boys; a synopsis of gender bias research;
and merchandise and literature order forms.  
<P>
The Ms. Foundation claims responsibility for creating and sponsoring
&quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day&quot; as a public-education
campaign about girls and self-esteem.  According to its mission
statement, the Ms. Foundation &quot;directs resources to break
down barriers based on ...sexual orientation...[and promotes]
reproductive rights.&quot;  &quot;Sexual orientation&quot; is
code for homosexuality.
<P>
The packets include books such as <U><I>Medicine Women</I></U>,
for girls age 13 and up, which teaches about women who were midwives,
witches, high priestesses, female warriors and more.  Another
book, <U><I>Reinventing the Family: the Emerging Story of Lesbian
and Gay Parents</I></U> &quot;dramatize[s] the ingrained antipathy
of the larger society toward homosexuals [and] refute[s] the
detrimental assumptions hampering wider acceptance of gay parenting.&quot;

<P>
The packet further profiles facts about &quot;male dominance,&quot;
e.g., &quot;Between 1980 and 1990, the number of senior girls
in high school interested in engineering dropped by 25%.  Nationally,
the number of college women going into science and graduating
in science is declining.  Women and girls continue to be enrolled
in education and training programs that prepare them for low-wage
jobs in traditionally female occupations.&quot;
<P>
The materials often lack balance.  For example,  no mention is
made that more bachelor's and master's degrees are awarded to
women; boys get better scores in math and science, but girls get
higher scores in reading and writing; boys in eighth grade are
50 percent more likely to be held back a grade; and boys in high
school constitute 68 percent of the &quot;special education&quot;
population.
<P>
Feminist heroines like professor Anita Hill, Planned Parenthood
founder Margaret Sanger and activist Gloria Steinem are highlighted,
as are events like the Supreme Court decision, <I>Roe v. Wade</I>,
which legalized abortion.
<P>
Anita Hill is accorded &quot;victim&quot; status in the Clarence
Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearing because she testified
&quot;before an all-male, all-white Senate judiciary committee.&quot;
<P>
Ms. Founder Gloria Steinem is credited with the statement: &quot;A
woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.&quot;  What
does this have to do with the self-esteem of little girls?
<P>
The pro-abortion message is clear.  Under the name of Margaret
Sanger the material reads: &quot;Still, in the 90s, 40,000 teenage
girls drop out of school each year because of pregnancy.&quot;
 Next to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>: an &quot;estimated 1.2 million additional
unintended pregnancies would occur each year in absence of publicly
funded women's health services.&quot;
<P>
The material also includes the statement: &quot;10% of American
women are lesbians and approximately 3.5 million lesbian and gay
Americans have had children.&quot;  The 10% figure is based on
Alfred Kinsey's thoroughly discredited estimate of the incidence
of homosexuality in the population.  Kinsey, an Indiana University
zoologist who authored <U><I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I></U>
in 1948, based his research on 12,000 interviews, relying heavily
on data gleaned from criminals.  He extrapolated his findings
to the general population.  A number of recent studies have found
the population indulging in homosexual behavior to be considerably
less than 10 percent, and probably no more than 1 to 2 percent.
 
<P>
In a blatant attempt to redefine the family, the material lists
an unknown court case that declared &quot;[t]wo women make up
a `family of affinity.'&quot;  Also, the wildly exaggerated estimate
that 3.5 million children are being raised in homosexual homes
has no foundation in fact.
<P>
On another &quot;hot&quot; feminist issue, the Ms. Foundation
claims that &quot;Every 15 seconds in the U.S. a woman is battered.
 It is the greatest single cause of injury to women, more than
car accidents, muggings and rapes combined.&quot;  This, too,
is an exaggeration.
<P>
There are 31,536,000 seconds in a year.  If an American woman
is battered every 15 seconds then there are 2,124,000 such incidents.
 According to the Justice Department there are only 133,228 single-offender
assaults each year attributed to an offending spouse.  That's
one every 237 seconds.  
<P>
The Justice Department's 1994 report, &quot;Violence Against Women,&quot;
found that women are almost twice as likely to be victimized by
a boyfriend or ex-spouse than by a current spouse.  It projects
each year that there are 367,462 assaults by boyfriends or ex-spouses
compared to 195,980 by spouses.  And women are more likely to
be assaulted by a friend than by an intimate or relative.
<P>
Although the Ms. Foundation claims that &quot;girls are 4 to 5
times more likely to attempt suicide,&quot;  it neglects to mention
that boys actually kill themselves at a rate six times that of
girls.
<P>
The Census Bureau found that for all Americans 15 to 24 years
old in 1991, 11.8 percent of boys and 9.8 percent of girls used
cigarettes.  But Ms. says, &quot;Girls smoke more than boys.&quot;
<P>
While the feminist organization claims that girls are neglected
in classrooms, the fact is that most of the attention boys receive
is disciplinary.  Factoring-out conduct-related exchanges makes
the numbers similar.
<P>
The Ms. Foundation is a highly partisan political advocacy organization
which relies on unvetted research.  Ms. literature routinely has
promoted division between the sexes and has denigrated women who
do not work outside the home.  The federal government should not
embrace -- and thereby endorse -- materials which are anti-male,
pro-abortion, and pro-homosexual.

<P>
<H2>A GENERATION XER'S<BR>
 PERSPECTIVE<BR>
  ON PROMISE KEEPERS</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
Thirteen &quot;Promise Keepers&quot; events will be held across
the nation this summer, equipping and encouraging an estimated
half-million men to keep their promises to God, to their wives
and children, and to their fellow man.  While this laudable movement
to honor one's word is not aimed at a particular age group, some
might believe its &quot;traditional values&quot; message would
have more appeal among older generations.  Perhaps.  But public
opinion data indicate that one age group which might be especially
receptive to this message are young adults -- the so-called &quot;Generation
X.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Generation Xers (adults aged 18-29) are more likely than
any other adult age group to say that &quot;divorce should be
harder [rather than easier] to obtain,&quot; according to a recent
compilation of public opinion polls by the American Enterprise
Institute.
<P>
This finding is significant because it deviates from previous
generational trends.  Those in the younger age ranges have typically
held more liberal views toward divorce than their elders.  For
example, Baby Boomers (those between age 30 and 48 today) said
20 years ago that divorce should be easier to obtain -- a view
to which fewer of their elders subscribed.
<P>
Why, then, would Generation X be <I>more</I> likely than their
elders to hold traditional values on the permanence of marriage?
 The reasons are admittedly complex.
<P>
Some attempt to explain this anomaly by remarking that Gen Xers
are too young to understand the difficulties of marriage, and
that once Gen Xers are exposed to the hardships of married life,
their attitudes toward liberalized divorce policies would also
change.
<P>
But a more compelling reason -- the one on which most people agree
-- is that far from being ignorant about the hardships of marriage,
Gen Xers personally understand the devastating effects of <I><B>divorce</B></I>.
<P>
Indeed, Generation Xers are more likely than any other adults
to be children of divorce.  During the years in which today's
Generation Xers were born (1965-1977), the divorce rate in the
U.S. doubled.  The percent of children born
outside of wedlock also doubled during that time period -- the
result not so much of a broken <I>marriage</I> vow as of a broken
promise to <I>love</I>.  Consequently, more than 40 percent of
today's young adults spent at least some time in a single-parent
family by age 16.
<P>
The argument that Generation X's aversion to divorce developed
from their witnessing too many broken marriage promises is strengthened
by the attitudinal consistency which Generation X exhibits in
other areas of life.
<P>
For example, articles analyzing the Gen X culture often describe
Xers as &quot;skeptical,&quot; &quot;insecure,&quot; or &quot;cautious&quot;
-- attitudes which have largely been influenced by broken or flippantly-made
promises.
<P>
To expound, Generation X analysts say young adults are &quot;skeptical&quot;
of media hype because too many commercials and advertisements
make far-flung promises which they cannot deliver.  Analysts also
say that Xers are &quot;insecure&quot; about finances and future
stability because the American dream they were promised of surpassing
the wealth of their parents has, in reality, dim prospects.  And,
according to a recent <I>American Demographics</I> article, Gen
Xers are &quot;cautious romantics.&quot;  They marry at later
ages, increasing their economic and emotional stability in the
hopes of avoiding divorce and the broken promises of a marriage
vow.
<P>
Clearly, the message of Promise Keepers responds to the anxieties
of today's young adults.  But the fact that Promise Keepers is
not limited to the young should make the young, in particular,
celebrate.  For, perhaps now more than ever, young adults <I>need</I>
role models.  Far too many of their primary role models (i.e.
parents) have failed to model successful marriages.  And as a
result, Generation X could well be the most well-intentioned but
least-equipped adult age group in terms of keeping their marriage
vows.
<P>
Thus, encouraging older men to be &quot;Promise Keepers&quot;
will, among other benefits, help the young maintain their resolve.
 And that is the hope of the Promise Keepers movement -- that
the advancements begun by these rallies will positively impact
generations to come.
<P>
Lest there be any misunderstanding:  I am not suggesting that
the Promise Keepers movement is a cure-all for divorce or that
it is the singular solution for eradicating broken promises. 
But, this movement is definitely promising...for both young and
old alike.

  DRUG LEGALIZATION</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
ABC television recently aired a documentary which suggested that
America has lost the drug war and now must embrace legalization.
 &quot;America's War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions&quot; includes
a litany of distortions:
<P>
<LI>Anti-drug programs are called a failure.  In fact, America's
balanced strategy of prevention-treatment-enforcement turned the
drug problem around in the 1980s.  Drug pushers are gaining today
because the Clinton Administration has abandoned the offensive.
   
<P>
<LI>ABC argues that legalizing drugs will reduce crime.  It cites
anecdotal information from foreign countries as proof.  But these
&quot;facts&quot; are refuted by reports from the same countries
and from America's own experience.
<P>
<LI> ABC touts drug treatment as a better alternative to enforcement.
 It profiles closely controlled and very limited foreign experiments
as evidence.  But those countries still have major illicit drug
problems and ABC admits that drug treatment more often fails than
it succeeds.  
<P>
<LI>ABC labels those opposed to legalization or &quot;harm reduction&quot;
as motivated by fear.  In fact, there is clear scientific evidence
to demonstrate that even &quot;mild&quot; drugs like marijuana
have serious health consequences.
<P>
ABC correctly reports that drug abuse is once again on the rise,
especially among children, and that &quot;America shows few signs
of rethinking its drug strategy.&quot;  Although hostess Catherine
Crier claimed that her objective is to &quot;stir up public debate&quot;
and &quot;not to advocate any specific policy,&quot; many of the
program's guests are known members of the drug legalization movement.
 The program promoted a drug philosophy called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
which includes legalization.
<P>
Harm reduction, endorsed by most legalizers and to a certain extent
by the Clinton Administration, calls for more treatment and less
enforcement.  It views the use of illegal drugs as a health issue
rather than be a crime problem.  
<P>
ABC's presentation ignores history.  The U.S. experimented with
legalization from 1919 to 1922, when government-sponsored clinics
handed out free drugs to addicts in hopes of controlling their
behavior.  The effort failed.  Society's 
revulsion against drugs, combined with enforcement, virtually
eradicated the menace at the time.
<P>
Crier cites society's high cost for illegal drug use each year
at $67 billion.  But she fails to compare those costs with the
high costs of two popular legal drugs: alcohol, $99 billion and
smoking, $72 billion.  At the program's end, Crier admits that
decriminalization will lead to more use. 
<P>
The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that drug decriminalization
will cost society more than alcohol and tobacco combined, perhaps
$140-$210 billion a year in lost productivity and job-related
accidents. 
<P>
An article in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>
found that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial
accidents, 85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase
in absenteeism.&quot;  Insurance companies would pass accident
expenses on to consumers.
<P>
Once drugs are legal, it will be very difficult, if not impossible,
to turn the clock back.  Today, there are few calls for recriminalization
of alcohol even though the evidence shows that prohibition saved
lives.  Alcohol use declined by 30 to 50 percent during prohibition
and deaths from cirrhosis of the liver fell dramatically.  Mark
Moore, Harvard professor of criminal justice, wrote: &quot;The
real lesson of prohibition is that society can, indeed, make a
dent in the consumption of drugs through law.&quot;
<P>
Unfortunately, ABC provides one sympathetic anecdotal account
of a drug abuser entrapped by stiff laws; meanwhile, it ignores
thousands of families who have been devastated by drug abuse.
 There was no reference to diminished public safety, increased
victimization, or increased family violence and child abuse caused
by individuals under the influence of illegal drugs.  And statistics,
such as the claim that 15 percent of the population smoke pot,
go unsubstantiated.
<P>
Instead, the viewer is introduced to &quot;harm reduction&quot;
programs in Holland and Britain and told that tolerance rather
than punishment works.  A Dutch official explains that legalizing
marijuana resulted in no increase in crime.  
<P>
ABC was either unaware of or ignored a study by Dr. K. F. Gunning,
President of the Dutch National Committee on Drug Prevention,
who found a 250 percent increase in cannabis use among students
from 1984 to 1992.  During the same period, shootings rose 40
percent, car thefts increased 62 percent, and hold-ups rose 69
percent.
<P>
American social scientists have confirmed a relationship between
drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990 study published in
the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found a strong association between
the severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the
more intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.
<P>
Although ABC reported that in Britain, heroin addicts in small
experimental programs have not committed many crimes, Great Britain's
previous &quot;harm reduction&quot; efforts dispute these claims.
 The British sponsored a program of controlled distribution of
heroin between 1959 and 1968.  According to the <I>British Medical
Journal</I>, the number of heroin addicts doubled every 16 months
and the increase in addicts was accompanied by an increase in
criminal activity as well.
<P>
Undoubtedly, getting money for drugs is a motive for some crime,
but many criminals use drugs when committing crimes.  For example,
the U.S. Justice Department reports that most inmates (77.4 percent
male and 83.6 percent female) have a drug history and the majority
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their
current offense.  
<P>
ABC cited California's experiment with marijuana legalization
which allegedly saved a billion dollars in law enforcement costs.
 What it didn't mention is a study that found that within the
first six months after decriminalization, arrests for driving
under the influence of drugs rose 46 percent for adults and 71.4
percent for juveniles.  Decriminalizing marijuana in Alaska and
Oregon in the 1970s resulted in the doubling of use and efforts
to recriminalize.
<P>
Crier reports that we have more than 300,000 people in jail for
drug-related offenses and later says that drug use would rise
with legalization.  She fails to reconcile more abuse with less
crime.  In fact, the 1993 Justice Department &quot;Sourcebook&quot;
shows 97,999 inmates charged with a drug offense and that most
inmates (79.4 percent) have used drugs. 
<P>
ABC also failed to mention that if drugs were legalized some restrictions
still would be necessary.  For example, Holland restricts the
sale of legalized drugs to minors, pregnant women, police, military,
pilots and prisoners.  There is no way the government could legally
sanction demonstrably harmful drugs like PCP and LSD, and less
potent marijuana would not satisfy users when far stronger pot
became available on the black market.  A black market niche for
these drugs would be inevitable.
<P>
Former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano
cautions that in a post-legalization world, &quot;Madison Avenue
hucksters would make it as attractive to do a few lines [of cocaine]
as to down a few beers.&quot;  This would line the pockets of
legal drug producers and clearly hurt the American taxpayer and
American families.
<P>
Despite significant evidence that all hard drug users used gateway
drugs (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana) before they used hard drugs
(cocaine, PCP, heroin), ABC includes comments by &quot;harm reduction&quot;
advocates who dismiss the &quot;gateway&quot; theory of drug abuse
and the health risks associated with marijuana.
<P>
A 1992 article in <I>The Journal of Primary Prevention</I> found
that marijuana use is essentially a &quot;necessary&quot; condition
for the occurrence of cocaine use.  Other research shows that
involvement with illicit drugs is a developmental phenomenon,
age correlates with use, and cigarette and alcohol use precedes
marijuana use.  Polydrug use is often an indication of transition
to the more addictive substance.   
<P>
Dr. Carlton Turner, former  director of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the
University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There is no other drug
used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular
actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does.&quot;
<P>
Since the 1970s there have been more than 10,500 scientific studies
which demonstrate the adverse consequences of marijuana use. 
The short term effects of marijuana include impairment in motivation
learning and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.
 Pot consumption can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.
<P>
The long-term effects are far more serious.  One study found large
numbers of marijuana smokers among younger cancer patients.  A
study in <I>Cancer</I> found that children of women who smoke
marijuana are 11 times more likely to contract leukemia.  Mothers
who smoke marijuana also contribute to low birth weight and developmental
problems for their children and increase by as much as 500 percent
the risk of abnormalities similar to those caused by fetal alcohol
syndrome. 
<P>
ABC may stir up public debate but &quot;America's War on Drugs&quot;
was not a responsible and balanced presentation.  &quot;Harm reduction&quot;
creates more problems than it solves.  Although a balanced policy
of treatment, prevention and strong enforcement works, the Clinton
administration has cut enforcement while Congress is cutting prevention
programs.  
<P>
America needs leaders committed to the drug war.  At present,
the debate is mired down in rhetoric while drug abuse among children
worsens.

<title>Gary Bauer's December, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

December 6, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>It was a great comfort to feel, all during the
last days when affairs looked doubtful, that no matter how things
came out the really important thing was the lovely life I have
with mother and with you children and that compared to this home
life everything else was of small importance from the stand point
of happiness.

<p><ul><ul>

Theodore Roosevelt<br>
from a letter to his son Kermit<br>
1904</i>

</ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Christmas comes to Washington, D.C., much the
same way it comes to your hometown.  Street lights come on earlier,
stores stay open later, there are smiles on more faces, and bell-ringing
members of the Salvation Army brave the cold and take up their
posts.  Around the city seasonal decorations are hung from every
pillar and post, multi-colored bulbs burn in windows and on trees.
Fervent prayers for safe travel go forth, as we remember Christmases
past and eagerly anticipate the arrival of family members, including
sons and daughters from college or military assignments around
the globe.

<p>

Yes, Christmas comes to Washington as it does
to every other city, but it comes here with a rather peculiar
force.  Partly it's because of the history of our nation's capital,
but even more significantly, I think, it's because of the political
nature of this city.  Throughout most of the year, an air of aggressive
secularity reigns in Washington.  Faith is not absent here, but
it too often takes a backseat to the public business being conducted.
Not so at Christmas-time, however.  As an anonymous writer once
noted about Christmas in Washington, &quot;Officially, the government
of the United States does not celebrate religious holidays.  Unofficially,
of course, it does.&quot;

<p>

That &quot;unofficial&quot; celebration of the
birth of Christ has irresistible power.  The white columns of
government buildings are festooned with wreaths and ribbons.
Christmas trees are lit at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
On the open Ellipse just south of the White House the National
Christmas Tree stands proudly, established by President Calvin
Coolidge and lit every year since 1923.  Each year, thousands
of visitors come to visit the tree and to see the life-sized Nativity
scene that even the Scrooges at the ACLU have been unable to dislodge.

<p>

On one occasion our National Christmas Tree
was nearly darkened -- not by church-and-state lawyers, but by
the nightmare of a nation at war.  On December 7, 1941, Japanese
forces attacked Pearl Harbor.  America entered the war and Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy declared war upon us.  In those first
days of the conflict blackouts were declared along the East Coast
as American leaders feared the worst.

<p>

In Washington, too, a blackout was ordered.
Our military and the Secret Service compiled a list of actions
they wanted taken to protect the Executive Mansion and the Congress,
including even the repainting of the White House in standard Army
Air Corps camouflage.  President Franklin Roosevelt resisted many
of their recommendations, rightly sensing that they would seriously
depress the indomitable American spirit.  But one security demand
made him bristle the most:  <I>no Christmas Tree on the Ellipse</I>,
the agencies said, <I>it would be too obvious a target</I>.

<p>

But Roosevelt refused to give in, and on Christmas
Eve, 1941, President and Mrs. Roosevelt stood on the south portico
of the White House and threw a switch to light the National Christmas
Tree, as a national radio audience tuned their receivers.  In
the midst of the blackout, the tree provided the only light for
miles around.  Beside the Roosevelts on the portico stood Winston
Churchill, who had traveled secretly to Washington and arrived
only that morning to encourage his American partners.  That night,
the British leader delivered a message that captured the essence
of the symbol Roosevelt was defending in lighting the tree.  Churchill
spoke to (and for) all Americans when he said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Let the children have their night of laughter . . . Let us
grown-ups share . . . in their unstinted pleasures
before we turn again to the stern tasks and the formidable
years that lie before us, resolved that by our sacrifice
and daring these same children shall not be robbed
of their inheritance or denied their right to live in
a free and decent world.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Today, of course, the clouds of war are not
gathered on every side.  But Churchill's words, and the meaning
of Christmas, retain all of their urgency.  Sacrifice and daring
are still needed in this fight, fought with words of persuasion
and prayers of petition, for the right of our children and our
grandchildren to live in a free and decent world.  If I have any
goal at the Family Research Council, it is to continue to frustrate
the Scrooges and the nay-sayers by keeping the lights burning
brightly on the Christmas trees of family, faith and freedom all
throughout this great land.

<p>

Christmas truly is the feast of childhood.
On this holy day, we mark the event where our God in heaven came
to us as a child, with a message that we must come to Him as children
if we want to see His face.  The words of Teddy Roosevelt that
I quoted at the beginning of this letter offer us another reminder
of the meaning of our work in this life.  Teddy was a remarkable
president, but an excellent book about him called <I>A Bully Father</I>
reminds us of the priorities that ruled his life even in the midst
of political turmoil. Teddy Roosevelt placed his family first,
no matter what the season.

<p>

His ardent devotion to conservation led him
to refuse to place a freshly cut Christmas tree in the White House.
But during his White House years he turned a blind eye when his
sons carried a tree up into the residence and hid it in their
closet.  On Christmas morning, his letters to his children reveal,
he rejoiced in the family custom of gathering in his and Edith's
bedroom as the six children romped and peered into their stockings
and opened their presents.  These events recalled for TR &quot;just
such a Christmas&quot; as he had known in his youth, and it was
&quot;just such a Christmas&quot; he endeavored to reproduce exactly
for his own family.

<p>

This Christmas season, I'm sure your family
has its own traditions to relive, customs you seek to renew time
and time again.  It doesn't really seem to matter what they are:
large or small, children remember and treasure each one.  My prayer
is that you will enjoy each and every moment that you have together.

<p>

For my family, Christmas will be particularly
special this year.  For a short while, life once again will be
exactly as it was ... Carol and me coming down the stairs each
morning to find all of our children under our roof.  Our daughter
Elyse will be home from college after a long semester.  She hasn't
chosen a major yet, but increasingly she feels drawn toward political
science and law.  On campus, she really enjoys her involvement
in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  Our high school sophomore,
Sarah, is learning to drive.  In addition to that excitement,
every Tuesday she and a dozen classmates gather at our house at
6:30 in the morning to pray and share their love for God and His
Son Jesus Christ.  Our son, Zachary, just celebrated his 10th
birthday.  He continues to grow in his faith, while he uses his
God-given talents and abilities to play every sport possible.
His soccer season just ended and basketball practice has already
begun.

<p>

Now that I have filled you in on my family,
it occurs to me that we would like to have an update from you, too. 
A few years ago, I asked readers of my monthly letter to send us
a family picture and tell us about their family.  We still treasure
the pictures and letters we received.  With permission, many of
those letters and the incidents they relate have found a place
in one of our publications, like <I>Reunion</I> or <I>Let Freedom
Ring</I>, or in the military exhibit at our new location in 
Washington.

<p>

If you have a moment -- perhaps while you're
sending out your Christmas cards or in the quieter days after
Christmas -- could you send us an updated photograph and tell
us how your family is doing?  If you haven't written before or
are new to my letters, we're all the more anxious to learn something
about you and your family.  Your photos and letters mean a lot
to all of us at FRC.  They remind us, just as Teddy Roosevelt's
letter to Kermit does, why we're here and whom we represent. They
also remind us that our happiness rests on a foundation that no
one can take away.

<p>

Thank you for all you do in partnership with
us to help build and preserve that &quot;free and decent world&quot;
of which Churchill spoke.  Next month, I'll be writing to share
with you the specific policy steps we will be pursuing with the
105th Congress to help achieve that &quot;world&quot; -- steps
to protect the sanctity of human life, to clean up our polluted
culture, to ease the economic pressures on families, and to promote
education reforms that help ensure that every child hears the
kind of historical truths that are recounted in this letter.

<p>

From all of us at FRC to all of yours, both near
and far, we wish you a peaceful and blessed Christmas.  May God
be with you this holiday season and throughout the coming year.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  End-of-year gifts represent a major portion
of the funds the Family Research Council receives from our supporters.
As you consider the gifts you intend to make this Christmas,
I sincerely hope you will consider FRC worthy of your continued
support.

</center>

Since 1991, Kristi Hamrick has served the Family Research Council 
as director of communications, aggressively taking the pro-family 
message forward both in paid media (advertising) and earned media 
(news).  Mrs. Hamrick manages a broad operation that handles all 
in-coming requests from the news media -- from CNN to <I>The New 
York Times</I> -- and out-going media strategy, developing the 
framework for taking the pro-family message nationwide, via 
television, radio and print, and through such vehicles as op-ed 
articles or policy pieces.

<p>

The news operation at FRC, a pro-family policy and lobbying group, 
works to respond to breaking events and to look ahead at the trends 
that are shaping the American family.  The goal is to influence the 
cultural mindset by taking part in every pro-family debate as it 
happens.  Mrs. Hamrick is a spokesperson for FRC as well as a 
representative of the organization at events and conferences. She 
debates regularly on television, and her appearances include ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America, CBS This Morning</i>, NBC's <i>Today Show, 
The Montel Williams Show, Fox News</i>, CNN's <i>Jesse Jackson Both 
Sides</i> and numerous other CNN programs.  Her articles have appeared 
in <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/hamdoc.html"><I>USA Today</I></a>, 
and she has been quoted nationwide, in publications including the 
<I>New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Washington 
Times, USA Today, Boston Globe</I>, Gannett News, Knight Ridder News, 
and The Associated Press. Her voice can be heard daily on radio 
programs throughout the United States.

<p>

As part of the coordinated FRC effort, Mrs. Hamrick also develops 
media strategies as part of FRC's work in government relations, 
grassroots coalition building, research and policy development, 
corporate and community outreach and publication marketing.

<p>

Before joining FRC in 1991, Mrs. Hamrick worked as press secretary 
in the Hopkins for Governor Campaign.  Mrs. Hamrick was a spokesperson 
for the campaign and directed the media operation for the U.S. 
congressman from Kentucky when he won his primary bid. Earlier in her 
career, Mrs. Hamrick also worked in the press operations of the late 
U.S. Senator John Heinz and Senator Arlen Specter, both of Pennsylvania.

<p>

Most of Mrs. Hamrick's experience is in the media.  In Washington, 
D.C., she was an on-air correspondent for CBN News Washington, D.C. 
Bureau, covering social issues.  In print, Mrs. Hamrick worked for 
<I>The Muncie Star</I>, covering courts, crime and politics, after 
completing a Pulliam Fellowship at <I>The Indianapolis Star</I>. In 
fact, Mrs. Hamrick worked her way through college as a writer and 
journalist.  She continues the crafts of a wordsmith, working on 
occassion as a freelance journalist.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick's extensive speaking experience includes many appearances 
in schools and colleges.  She also taught news writing and advanced 
news writing at Ball State University in Indiana.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with honors in 
communications from Anderson University in Anderson, Ind. She and 
her husband, Michael Hamrick, reside in Northern Virginia.

THOUGHTS FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD ON DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT
<P>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee.  I was pleased to accept your invitation to discuss some corporate approaches to organization and downsizing and their possible relevance to the federal government.  I believe I do have a somewhat unusual perspective on this issue, having spent roughly 20 years in the corporate world.
<P>
I am pleased to be back in these chambers.  As a young member of the Congress during the 1960s, I had the opportunity to serve on this Committee when it was known as the Government Operations Committee.  At the beginning of my tenure, the government we oversaw was much smaller and simpler than the complex and overwhelming behemoth that so many of you in this Congress have pledged to reform.
<P>
With your permission, I thought what I would do this afternoon would be to merely summarize some of the concepts in my prepared text, which all of you have received in advance, and then allow the maximum amount of time for questions.
<P>
If my memory serves me correctly, one of the issues of my time in Congress was whether or not to close a dairy at the U.S. Naval Academy.  That example may be good for a laugh today, but those who tried to sell off the dairy were accused of not understanding the importance of a captive milk supply for the Midshipmen.  Heaven forbid that the Naval Academy would have to buy milk from the private sector like everyone else.
<P>
While that may seem like a trivial example compared with the sacred cows that must be challenged today if you are to balance the budget by 2002, the fact remains that the federal government is one of the few institutions that still thinks itself able to afford the luxury of sentimentality at taxpayers' expense.  Businesses eventually cannot afford to hold on to activities, people, practices, divisions or subsidiaries that have become not central to the core business, outmoded, inefficient or a financial drain on the rest of the company.  Rather, they have to figure out what they should and should not be doing and then take decisive action to get their financial affairs in order.  If they fail to do so, they die.
<P>
When taking over a troubled company, a knowledgeable CEO checks his or her "teeth to tail" ratio, as they say in the military.  It involves undertaking a thorough review of the company's assets and resources and then promptly divesting those that are not central to the future success of the institution.  This forces the company to focus on its "core" business and to avoid wasting manpower, time and money on ventures that are secondary to what is vital to the long-term health and success of the company.
<P>
A good example of a corporation recently undergoing such a top-to-bottom restructuring is Sears, Roebuck and Company.  Sears in recent years decided to move from a widely diversified company to a company focused on its core businesses.  During this restructuring it closed a hundred unprofitable stores, took Dean-Witter, Discover, Allstate Corporation, PMI, and S.P.S. public, sold off unneeded assets and even disposed of the famed Sear Tower in Chicago.  Some of the cash raised from these sales was used to buy out thousands of middle managers, and the rest was plowed back in to strengthen its basic businesses.
<P>
One of the most painful and visible aspects of their restructuring was the decision to close Sears' catalog division--the business on which Sears was built.  The truth is that the catalog division was unprofitable and a drain on the company's main businesses.  As difficult as it was, however, this break with the past told Sears stockholders that management was serious about fundamentally restructuring the company and putting it on a path for growth.
<P>
The experience at Sears, and the experiences at hundreds of other companies, including two I helped to downsize--G.D. Searle & Co., a pharmaceutical company, and General Instrument Corporation, an electronics company--can provide valuable lessons on how to and how not to downsize and overhaul the federal government.  There is no one formula for successfully reorganizing a major corporation or the federal government, beyond the fact that it requires making tough, serious decisions, and it is often easier for someone from outside the institution who understands that this is his or her assignment to do it than it is for an insider.  Also, not surprisingly, it is best done by someone who knows how to do it.
<P>

<B> Define The "Core" Business</B>
<P>
As overseers of the federal government, an institution which, for the sake of discussion, is arguably in Chapter XI, Members of Congress will need to treat the job of restructuring it in the same urgent, tough-minded manner so many corporations around the country are now doing.  The goal must be to earn back the confidence of the taxpayers, who are the real stockholders of the federal government.  This does not mean simply "patching," as management guru Peter Drucker has characterized Vice President Gore and his associates of doing.  The reason National Performance Review (NPR) efforts have received so little public attention, said Drucker, is that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway.  They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own--without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards."(1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Certainly the NPR is a worthwhile effort -- a good idea.  But, much more is needed.  Techniques such as Total Quality Management, procurement reforms, or streamlining middle management will improve government, but they will only affect the problems in government programs at the margins.  Well-intended corporate managers have used the same sort of techniques and still failed or suffered.  It is vital that many of these things be done, but only after one has decided and dealt with the more central issues of what businesses to be in.
<P>
The first task is to decide what the core business is.  Once this decision is made, then everything else is secondary.  For the federal government, the four basic departments -- State, Defense, Justice, and Treasury -- have a solid basis for existence.  The other departments were either more narrowly based, were an afterthought, or both.  Some had utility when they were established, but no longer do.  Others, in my view, probably did not have a need to be at the Cabinet level even when they were first established.  A number of them were recommended and created less for organizational reasons and more to gain favor with a particular interest group.  Once one has determined the core functions to be performed by the federal government, all other activities should be scrutinized for elimination, downsizing, reorganization, movement to state and local governments or privatization.
<P>
I begin with the conviction that the first place activities should be undertaken is with the individual citizens and private organizations; next, if government must be involved, by local governments, state governments, and only last by the federal government.  In the past, this was not a workable principle in some instances because of the issue of civil rights, even though in theory it was compelling and rational.  It was clear that if some activities were left to local or state government or to individuals there would not be appropriate protection against discrimination.  Given the many civil rights laws on the books today and the progress that has been made, it is no longer the problem it was in earlier periods.  Today government services are being delivered to minorities in a nondiscriminatory manner.
<P>
My conviction is that as overseers of the federal government, Congress ought to use federal solutions only as a last resort.  The question must be asked whether a problem is truly a federal responsibility, or can it better be handled privately, by voluntary organizations, by local governments, or state governments.  I understand how difficult this is in Washington, DC, given the fact that all the institutional pressures seem to run the other direction.  But I'm reminded of a sage warning former Missouri Congressman Tom Curates once said, "Public money drives out private money."  And it does.

<P>
<B> Cut Sharply and Rapidly</B>
<P>
I read an article recently which set out some useful advice on downsizing from CEO Al Dunlap, who apparently did a skillful and swift job of restructuring Scott Paper Co.  On downsizing, he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Do it once, do it severely, and get it over with.  When a company says it is going to restructure over the next three years it won't happen . . . Don't do it!  You paralyze the company."(2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is sound advice for the Congress as it undertakes the massive task of balancing the federal budget by the year 2002.  Cut severely and rapidly.  Don't wait.  Whatever it is you do the odds are overwhelming that you should have done more, rather than less, and that you should have done it sooner, rather than later.  There are so many pressures in Washington, D.C., to keep the status quo, that the most frequent mistake is to make too few changes or to cut too little.  If in fact one cuts too much, which is very rare -- indeed probably unprecedented -- it is easy to add back.  But, once you cut and then find you have to go back and cut again, it is harmful to an organization.  Do it once.  Do it well.  Don't under do it.  And then let people get back to work.  Don't try to cut the dog's tail off one inch at a time, hoping it won't hurt as much.
<P>
And, a caution.  After the reductions have been accomplished, don't turn your head for a second or you will find the waste moving right back in.  It is inevitable that it will happen, and fast, unless the overseers are vigilant.  As the saying goes, "If you're coasting, you're going down hill."
<P>
Although the balanced budget plan drafted by the House Budget Committee is remarkable in its specificity and scope, in my view it ignores the principle of "cutting decisively and rapidly," in that it proposes phasing out some programs and agencies over a period of three to five years.  If a program or agency is outmoded and inefficient, phasing out its funding over a period of time will not make it less so.  For instance, I agree with those who propose to eliminate taxpayer funding for Amtrak, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and dozens of other programs that are not, or are at least no longer, appropriate federal responsibilities.  But why inflict on these programs the "death of a thousand cuts."
<P>
If Amtrak, for example, should be given the flexibility and the challenge to compete in the private sector, then why can't it be done sooner, say over the next 12 months, rather than over the next five years?  My advice is to sever public ties with much greater speed.
<P>
The Small Business Administration continues to dodge reform.  It was not even ten years old during my freshman term, yet, in a 1963 article on pork barrel spending, Life magazine exposed the SBA as a new "device for soaking up money and getting rid of it."  Based upon its early track record, we should have had the good judgment to close down the SBA decades ago.  I hope that this Congress will have the courage to act this year.  It is never to be desired, but given the current budget situation, good intentions and throwing money at problems hoping some of it will stick and do some good is unacceptable.

<P>
<B> Downsize</B>
<P>
I also recommend that Congress move swiftly to cut management and get personnel costs under control.  It is guaranteed that there are more managers and more staff in the federal government than are needed.  In less than seven months, Scott Paper eliminated 11,200 people, one-third of the work force.  The company cut 71 percent of the headquarters staff, 50 percent of management, and 20 percent of the hourly employees.  They discovered they really weren't needed.
<P>
Another example is G.D. Searle & Co., where I served from 1977 to 1985.  There we reduced the centralized corporate activities down to about 20 percent of their prior size, divested some 30 to 35 businesses, sold a variety of assets, downsized the company to close to 65 percent of its prior employee base, with the not surprising result that it worked better, earned more, and investors and owners moved the stock from about $12 a share to $50 to $60 a share.
<P>
So too at General Instrument Corporation where I served from 1990 to 1993.  There we divested five or six businesses, sold a number of assets, downsized and focused on the core business, and dramatically reduced the size of corporate headquarters, with the result that the investors and owners of the company moved the stock from below $15 a share to $50 a share.
<P>
There are hundreds of companies that are doing the same thing.  Some do it after they should have, others do it ahead of the curve.  Some wait too long, and they suffer and die.  Clearly the U.S. government is well behind the curve.
<P>
No doubt the federal government suffers even more waste on a percentage basis throughout the bureaucracy than even poorly run companies.  According to the NPR, the federal government has over 280,000 persons formally classified as "supervisors, managers, and executives, all of whom perform control functions, costing billions of dollars."  "At times," reports the NPR, "the federal government's management control system resembles a theater of the absurd."3    To make the point, if one used the Scott Paper model on downsizing as a guide, theoretically some 140,000 of these managers could be cut immediately, saving taxpayers billions of dollars.  For example, I see fewer and fewer companies where every manager has a special assistant or two.  But in government, it seems even special assistants have assistants.  Don't get me wrong.  I used to be one and I used to have one or two.  And I suspect many of you do.  Indeed, some are needed.  But, the revolution in information technology has changed the way work can be done so that excessive layering of organizations can be avoided.
<P>
<B> Reordering the Flow Chart</B>
<P>
There are a variety of ways to merge federal agencies and departments, and certainly no one way is perfect.  For example, over 20 years ago, Richard Nixon and the Ash Commission recommended that there be four basic areas:  defense, foreign policy, the economic, and domestic.  One can find powerful reasons for either merging or terminating many of the newer departments.  Some of their functions will, or course, need to continue, but certainly much of the overhead is not necessary.
<P>
While I have no special insight as to which is the preferred way to reorganize our government, I am persuaded that probably one-half to two-thirds of the non-central departments are no longer needed in their current form.  For example, the Republican proposal to close down the 93-year-old Department of Commerce seems reasonable to me.  It lacks a clear sense of mission and the fact that it duplicates the work of dozens of other departments and agencies is a sign that taxpayers could do without it in its present form.  The same could likely be said for others of the newer departments, such as Energy, HUD, Education, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Appalachian Regional Commission and EDA.  For example, the veterans were served before the VA was made a Cabinet rank department, as they should have been.  And they can be well-served, possibly better served, if it were to move out of the Cabinet and have some of its functions turned over to the private sector.

<P>
<B> Don't Micromanage</B>
<P>
There is no one perfect organizational arrangement.  The right people can make a poor organizational structure work well, and wrong people will assure that the best possible organizational arrangement will work poorly.  People are the key.  That is why the delays in the Presidential appointment process have been so damaging.  In many cases, cabinet and sub-cabinet posts have not been filled until after a non-trivial fraction of their entire term is over.
<P>
An important rule for a corporate board is to avoid trying to micromanage the CEO and the company.  Boards need to give management the direction to be sure, but also the freedom to run the company in the most effective and profitable way they see fit, and then hold them accountable.  One of the problems in government, and something that contributes to waste and mismanagement of the Executive branch.  My recollection from my days in the Executive branch is that Congress imposes so many restrictions, requirements, and requests on the Executive branch, no one of which is debilitating, but in the aggregate are like the threads the Lilliputians used to prevent Gulliver from moving.  This was certainly a problem at the Pentagon and I suspect still is, because of the blizzard of requests for studies and the directives and rules generated by the multiplicity of Congressional committees and subcommittees.  I want to commend you for taking steps to reduce the number of committees and subcommittees earlier this year.  It was a good start.
<P>
However, smaller government is an unachievable goal if Congress continues to try to tell the Executive branch when to turn right, turn left, speed up, or slow down.  What Congress needs to do is tell the Executive branch generally the direction to go, where the sides of the road are, and what the speed limit is.  Then Congress should stand back, oversee, and evaluate the administration on how well they do it, and if necessary calibrate the directions or change the drivers.  Too many hands on the steering wheel will put the truck in the ditch.

<P>
<B> Big Government and Big Business</B>
<P>
Anytime anyone proposes a change, there will be opposition and concern.  Change is not easy for people.  However, the fact that there is opposition and concern about proposed changes does not mean that the changes are undesirable.  Indeed change in both people and organizational assignment can bring in fresh thinking and approaches.  Certainly the entire country has seen the fresh breeze blowing through the Congress since the changes earlier this year.  It is refreshing, as even a number of my friends from the new Minority agree.
<P>
In Washington, D.C., change is a particular problem for several reasons.  Any change in the Executive branch tends to result in changes in people and organizational structure.  The effect is that it makes life less certain for people in the bureaucracy, which not surprisingly they resist.  It also makes life difficult for those they deal with -- Washington lawyers and lobbyists.  These folks have invested many, many years in the relationships and knowledge they have achieved, which, for them, is the coin of the realm.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that they often become the earliest and most effective opponents of change.  This is not because they think the change is unwise or unnecessary, but because they could lose their investment in the people and the structure as currently arranged.  They would have to start over again developing such relationships and knowledge.  This is certainly not a reason not to change.
<P>
Further, any change proposed in the Executive branch tends to result in difficulties for Congressional committees in that jurisdictions of committees can be affected.  There will be winners and losers.  Therefore, the predictable result of any proposed change tends to be that some Members of the Congress oppose it.  Here again, it is not a reason not to change.
<P>
It is important not to lose sight of the reality that Washington, D.C. is arranged in a way that only large companies are able to hire the lawyers, lobbyists, and representatives necessary to effectively interact with the Executive branch of the federal government and the Legislative branch to their advantage.  Only large companies have the resources to stay the course while the Executive departments and agencies study and delay decisions on matters that directly affect them.  Indeed, that is a competitive advantage large companies have -- they have the resources and they have the staying power.  Big businesses have the institutional capability to effectively interact with big government.  That is not true of small businesses.  Dealing with the federal government can suck the very life out of small companies that have to compete with big businesses in trying to avoid having government unintentionally take actions that are harmful to them.
<P>

<B> A Thought for Congress</B>
<P>
Thirty years ago, I testified before the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress.  One of my recommendations was to terminate the practice whereby Members of the House and Senate frequently announce federal grants, contracts and projects in their states and districts.  It didn't happen.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I said then:
<P>
" . . . to encourage or assist Members (of Congress) in making initial announcements of Federal grants, projects, and particularly Federal contracts, leaves at least a shadow of a question as to whether or not the contract or project was awarded solely, as it should have been, on factors such as cost, performance, and national interest.  I would think that a procurement officer or Corps of Engineers' official, for example, who based his decisions on needs, cost, and performance, would not be pleased to see Members' announcements of these contracts or projects leaving the impression that they may have influenced his decision."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

I suggest that government likely would shrink if Members ended this policy and thereby eliminated the incentive to have the federal government become involved in so many activities that belong in the private sector or in state or local government.  In short, implementing that recommendation would help.  As long as this practice remains, the incentive will be upside down and more and more activities are likely to move toward Washington, D.C.

<P>
<B> Privatization Insures Accountability</B>
<P>
"Corporacy" is a term relating to the private sector, meaning corporate "bureaucrats running corporations for their own good and the shareholder be damned."  Fortunately, and not surprisingly, the competitive marketplace punishes companies that become "corporacies."  Indeed, the most valuable thing that exists in business and in the non-governmental sector is the opportunity to fail.  And fear of failure focuses the mind.  Government programs are effectively insulated from the rigors of the marketplace and therefore are denied the possibility of failure.  The task for government is to find some substitutes or proxies for the possibility of failure -- for the "bottom line" -- in business.  One approach would be to have more "sunset" provisions to force legislative review after a period of years.  While not always appropriate, one other essential way of bringing this  level of accountability to the delivering of services is privatization.
<P>
Some thirty years ago, Nobel Prize Economist Milton Friedman told me that the best way of curing the problems of waste and inefficiency in the U.S. Postal System, then the Post Office Department, was to amend the law so it would no longer be a monopoly, and thereby would be forced to compete.  He was correct.  I have questions about some of the so-called "government-owned" corporations.  One effect can be to insulate such an activity from being accountable to either the marketplace or to Congress.  And, everyone needs to be accountable to someone.  The U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak are two examples.  Still other so-called government corporations, such as the Legal Services Corporation, aren't really corporations.  All the word "corporation" in the their title does is befuddle and confuse.
<P>
Certainly a number of these activities should be cut loose from taxpayers' purse and allowed the privilege of competing in the marketplace.  Competition is what brings out the best in people and organizations.  As the saying goes, "it is your enemies who make you strong."  I am attracted to the idea of divestiture or privatization of a number of government-owned enterprises such as the Air Traffic Control System, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, the Government Printing Office, public housing, defense stockpiles, and unneeded federal buildings and real estate.  I have no view as to whether it might make sense to make some of these activities "corporatized" government agencies as an interim step toward full divestiture.  In some cases, such a step might be useful in getting the some enterprise's books in order, providing time to inventory their assets, and in preparation for selling them off to people who know how to run such activities.
<P>

<B> Asset Sales</B>
<P>
I have trouble understanding why the federal government should be borrowing over $200 billion per year to cover its deficit when it is sitting on billions worth of assets that could and should be sold to the private sector to raise cash and which would then be forced to operate on a more cost-effective basis.  As the Dunlap article points out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Inside every corporation is the biggest bank one is ever going to find -- its own assets.  My philosophy is, before you go looking for outside funding, look inside first at what you don't need.  We sold S.D. Warren, a paper subsidiary, for $1.6 billion.  It was a fine company but I believe you can't be in two capital intensive businesses and do well at both.  We sold other operations and have another $1 billion of assets on the block.  We are on track to be debt-free in 1995.  All this from a company that was heavily in debt, whose bonds weren't investment grade, when I arrived."
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some twenty years ago, I chaired the Property Review Board in the Nixon Administration, which supervised the review of literally hundreds of federal real properties for movement to their highest and best use outside of government.  The resistance in both the Executive and Legislative branches was enormous.  That opportunity is still there and, given the current budget situation, must be seized.
<P>
Unfortunately, I am told that for the past decade or so, asset sales have been seen as somewhat of a gimmick here in Washington, D.C.  It is not a gimmick in the business world and need not be seen as such in government.  The goal of such sales is to use unneeded or under-utilized assets to reduce liabilities and to free up funds to be focused on more important needs.  This is a business-like strategy I believe the U.S. Government could usefully adopt.  I understand that the Majority's balanced budget plan does target a number of assets for sale to the private sector such as the Power Marketing Administration, the Helium Program, and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation.
<P>
That would be a start, but there are billions of dollars in assets which could still be tapped to reduce government's borrowing.  For example, the Heritage Foundation, in its very useful study, has suggested selling the government's $150 billion portfolio of direct loans to the secondary market.  This is an idea that could generate as much as $100 billion in cash.  Such steps could save taxpayers billions in future interest payments as well as have the advantage of moving such assets out of the government and into the more productive private sector.
<P>

<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
As the Congress goes about the business of putting meat on the bones of the balanced budget plan passed last month, it will have to make tough decisions.  I recognize the difficulty of that task, having served here in the House.  But I've learned that the decisions that are made every day in the corporate world are sometimes even more difficult, because the very survival of a company can be at stake.  The choices you make affect people with real careers, mortgages, and families to raise, to be sure.  But since you oversee an enterprise facing bankruptcy, you can have confidence that the decisions you make, however tough, can help to restore the long-term health of the government, our economy, and our country.
<P>
I thank you for this opportunity to share these thoughts, and I would be happy to entertain questions.

<blockquote>

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
<P>
It is a pleasure to address this Committee on a subject which
has wrought enormous devastation on large parts of American society.
It has been well documented that during the last 15 years, American
society has experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.
Almost every social pathology got worse, and many got much worse.
But during this pedod--specifically from 1979 to 1992--there
was one area where we made significant progress: curbing drug
use. Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of
drugtaking which began in 1993 and continues to get worse.
<P>
The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural
shift. During the late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was
widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun
or mere selfindulgence.  But by the late 1970s and throughout
the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use became impossible
to deny, it became increasingly -- and far more accurately --
seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.
<P>
Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even
the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.
Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many
states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies. As a result,
overall drug use went down. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s,
casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty percent. Between
1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declilied by almost eighty
percent. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.
<P>
But last year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.
 Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise. According
to the latest study from the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, one in four students has used illegal drugs
before reaching high school; among 8th graders, 13 percent say
they have smoked marijuana in the last year ~ double the rate
of 1991; and over 40 percent of all 10th graders and nearly 50
percent of all 12th graders have used some illicit drug, induding
LSD, inhalants, stimulants, barbiturates, and cocaine and crack.
<P>
And hospital emergencyroom visits -- dominated by aging, inner
city drug addicts -- have increased to the highest number ever.
Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to
new levels.
<P>
In the words of the Michigan study's principal investigator, Lloyd
D. Johnston, the drug trend is &quot;a problem that is getting
worse at a fairly rapid pace,&quot; and is being abetted by a
dedine in peer disapproval and a general softening of teenagers'
attitudes towards drugs.
<P>
These findings are part of a disturbing pattern, in a series of
studies which have documented a sharp rise in drug use. This increase
in drug use<B> should</B> have mobilized the federal government
to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the
law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens. Instead,
the Clinton administration has abdicated its responsibility. The
Clinton administration has been AWOL in the war on drugs. It has
said or done little to encourage those fighting the good fight
and has proposed fundatientally misguided policies. Indeed, it
has shown much more interest in the baseball strike than in the
devastation of the young by drugs. Consider the record:
<UL>
<LI>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office
of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80 percent.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Soon after assuming of fice, Attorney General Janet Reno announced
that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for
drug trafficking and related federal crimes. Her focus? She is
engaged in a neverending search for the &quot;root causes&quot;
of crime and drug use.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for
a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions
of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the PBI, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and other federal agencies. It is to the United States
Congress's credit that this proposal was largely rejected.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100
drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut
in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs
from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment
strategy that will do little to target hardcore users.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Last year, the Clinton Administration directed the US. Military
to stop providing radar tracking of cocaine trafficker aircraft
to Colombia and Peru.  Congress again had to reverse this senseless
policy directive.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This week, for the first time in history, the nation's drug
control strategy was introduced without the participation of the
president.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>If present trends continue, by 1996 the Clinton Administration
will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern
American history.</I> And let me reiterate: this will have occurred
after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent
between <TT>1979 </TT>(the peak) and <TT>1992, </TT>and a reduction
of almost <TT>80 </TT>percent in cocaine use between <TT>1985
</TT>(the peak for cocaine) and <TT>1992.</TT>
<P>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.
The Clinton admir istration suffers from moral torpor on this
issue. Policy follows attitude. In 1991, when asked about his
past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never &quot;broken
any drug law.&quot; A year later, he admitted that when he was
in England, he had experimented with marijuana but &quot;I didn't
like it. I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again.&quot; Later,
when asked whether he would inhale if he had it to do over again,
he answered, to laughter: &quot;Sure, if I could. I tried before.&quot;
<P>
Keep in mind, too, that former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
has been the administration's most prominent voice on drugs during
the last two years. Throughout her tenure, Dr. Elders had favorable
words to say about drug legalization. And apparently her dismissal
had nothing to do with her irresponsible and outspoken views on
drug policy.
<P>
These statements&#151;as well as massive policy failures&#151;are
significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals
they send. One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic
to occur in the first plate was the collapse of institutional
authority. Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it
stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who served as
President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that &quot;cocaine is
probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread
use.&quot; Today such institutional collapse is echoed in some
segments of the public Just yesterday a Baltimore grand jury recommended
that marijuana be &quot;decriminalized&quot; and that other drugs,
such as cocaine and heroin, be distributed to addicts by doctors.
It's time for all of us to reread <I>A Brave New World.</I>
<P>
Government officials, through legislation and public discourse,
can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts. In a free society,
few things matter more than speaking about the right things in
the right way&#151;and making moral common sense the touchstone
of social policy.
<P>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her &quot;Just
Say No&quot; campaign. But it turns out that &quot;Just Say No&quot;
is far more effective than &quot;I didn't inhale.&quot;
<P>
Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first
two years of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless
poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations. But
today, on one of the issues that disproportionately harms the
poor&#151;that is wiping out many of the children of the poor&#151;he
and his administration have demonstrated indifference.
<P>
That being said, the question remains: where do we go from here?
During the question and answer time, I expect to get into some
spedfics of an effective drug strategy. But here, briefly, is
a framework for what I think would work based on my experience
in the Bush administration.
<P>
If we mean to renew our efforts in the fight against drugs, the
federal government needs to do a number of things. They include
allowing communities to choose their own antidrug priorities by
combining federal antidrug support with that from states and localities;
putting the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal
drugs from abroad, and giving the military control over the entire
interdiction process. We need to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocainesource countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine, and require the Attorney
General first to identify all major drug trafficking organizations
known to be operating in the U.S. and then to create a plan to
dismantle them. In short, there is a lot which the federal government
ought to be doing which it is not now doing.
<P>
Mr. Chairman, I want to conclude by making an obvious but often
overlooked point: success in the drug war depends above all on
the efforts of parents and schools and churches and police chiefs
and judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush's
&quot;drug czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made
a point to go where the problem was the worst and to visit and
to learn from the people who made things better. I saw, as just
one example, Reuben Greenberg's heroic efforts in Charleston,
South Carolina, where he cut the crime rate to its lowest point
since the 1950s. I went to public housing projects and innercity
schools and drug treatment programs; I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies. The
people I visited and people all over the country are doing great
work. Ant that work will surely go on. But they deserve to have
the federal government meet its responsibilities, too. And right
now, that's not happening.  It's a disgrace.

Between 1980 and 1992, casual drug use in America declined sharply.  Strong presidential leadership helped cut casual drug use in half between 1977-1992, and reduced the number of cocaine users from almost 3 million in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.
<P>
Since 1992, however, a sustained, intelligent and integrated anti-drug effort has been largely abandoned.  The results are not surprising:  the last four years have brought the greatest increase in teen drug use ever measured.  Consider the facts:
<P>
Illicit drug use is soaring among Americas young people.  Overall use of drugs among 12-17 year olds rose 105 percent between 1992 and 1995.  Fully 2.42 million youths ages 12-17 use drugs on a monthly basis.

Marijuana use functions as the "gateway" to hard drugs.  According to the Center on Addiction and substance Abuse (CASA), teens who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to "graduate" to cocaine than those who abstain.  As CASA director, Joseph Califano noted, "The jump in marijuana use among Americas children from 1992-94 signals that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime . . . Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular users and cocaine a ddicts.</blockquote></td></tr>

<center><h3>
Statement by William J. Bennett<br>
on results of the<br>
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
</h3>
<p>
<I>August 20, 1996</I>
</center>
<p>
The huge increase in drug use reported today in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1995 is a national disgrace.  And the Clinton administration should be ashamed of its complete abdication in fighting illegal drug use.
<p>
Since 1992, we have watched the number of drug users go up -- way up -- year after year.  Today we learn that drug use among young people has surged again -- this time by 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Monthly use of marijuana use among the young is up by 37 percent between 1994 and 1995, and up 141 percent since 1992.  This has occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992 and a reduction of almost 80 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (peak for cocaine) and 1992. 
<p>
There has been a well-documented and complete failure of public policy.  But make no mistake: there is more involved here than merely a failure of public policy.  Public policy, after all, is a manifestation of attitude.  And the "root cause" of the Clinton administration's abdication in the battle against illegal drug use is moral confusion and moral weakness.   
<p>
The Clinton administration, for whatever reason, is cavalier, unengaged, and unconcerned about illegal drugs.  It is unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  Democratic congressman Charles Rangel expressed the opinion of many when he said, "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."  The motto of the Clinton administration seems to be, "We Just Don't Care" -- and so they are unwilling to act in responsible and effective ways.  Unfortunately this nation is paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's diffidence, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.  
<p>
On the one issue that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many children of the poor -- Bill Clinton and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  The burning of black churches has caused justifiable outrage in the country.  President Clinton has taken it upon himself to speak out, time and again, against church burnings.  And he is right to do so.  But drugs have destroyed many, many, many more black families than church burnings.  Yet on the drug issue Bill Clinton is virtually silent -- in word and in deed.  Even before today's news, we knew that since Bill Clinton became president the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured.  The Clinton administration keeps adding to its infamy.  Fighting the drug epidemic requires courage, intelligence, determination, and above all, moral clarity.  Moral clarity is precisely what is missing at the top of this administration, as well as among the White House staff.

<H2>DRUGS IN AMERICA</h2>
</center>
<p>
<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
<dd>	From 1980 to 1992, under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the federal government mounted a strong offensive against drugs, with real results.  The combined effect of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough law enforcement and a morally firm attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in significant reductions in both the consumption and availability of drugs. <p>
<dd>	Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned the drug war.  Americans have witnessed a failure of public policy brought about by a moral torpor; policy follows attitude.  But, as recent polling suggests, the public's attitude is not one of indifference to the drug issue.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug control policy with the federal government rightfully leading the fight.
<p>
<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drug use is a major contributing factor to violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, and poverty.  Drugs -- particularly crack cocaine -- have made these and other social pathologies more acute and often unmanageable.
<li>Between 1970 (the peak) and 1992, overall drug use decreased by over 50 percent.   Between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992, overall cocaine use declined by almost 80 percent.  And between 1984 and 1992, annual illicit drug use trends among 12th graders declined by 41 percent.
<li>The latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug use beginning in 1993.  Annual use among 12th graders is up for 1994 by 33 percent.  Marijuana use among 12-17-year-olds nearly doubled from 1992 to 1994.  And high school use of cocaine and hallucinogens has risen precipitously from a low in 1988.
<li>Drug-related hospital emergency room cases have escalated to their highest numbers since 1978.   In 1994 a record high half-million Americans were treated for drug-related problems, with serious increases in those induced by cocaine. 
<li>In a  survey released in December, 1995 by the Gallup Organization, Americans ranked drugs as the second most important problem (behind crime) facing the nation.
<li>The public strongly supports anti-drug education, strict law enforcement and interdiction; and offers little support for increased treatment programs. 
<li>Legalization of drugs is overwhelmingly rejected by Americans.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CURRENT POLICY</H3>
<ul>
<li>Shortly after taking office, President Clinton weakened the power and slashed the staff of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  He proposed cuts in other agencies that have been at the forefront in the war on drugs -- the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- cuts that were largely rejected by the  U.S. Congress.
<li>The Clinton policy abrogated interdiction, tough law enforcement and mandatory minimum sentences. 
<li>The strong moral message of "Just say no"  gave way to "I didn't inhale;" and to a surgeon general who advocated drug legalization. 
<li>The Clinton administration has concentrated its efforts on an unfocused treatment policy that is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  
</ul>
<p>
<H3> RENEWING THE WAR ON DRUGS</H3>
<ul>
<li>The government should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction process.
<li>America must establish trade and diplomatic sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail to reduce their production.
<li>The federal government must identify and dismantle all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating in the United States.
<li>Law enforcement, drug treatment and prevention education are state and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should be block granted without mandates.
<li>The President should send a clear and frequently-heard anti-drug message from his bully pulpit, making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>JUST SAY NO TO DRUG LEGALIZATION</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and threatening to American society because they are illegal.  They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to American society.
<li>Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
	
It is the first obligation of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.  Nothing poses a greater threat to both than the scourge of drugs and the violence associated with it.   It is time for the federal government to renew its war on drugs through moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

<center><h3>Written Testimony by<br>
William J. Bennett<br>
Former Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
<p>
Delivered before the<br>
United States Senate<br>
Caucus on International Narcotics Control<br>
April 25, 1996</h3>
<p>
======================================================
<p>
</center>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Caucus: 
<p>
Little more than a year ago I came before both the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on the drug resurgence in America and the need for strong leadership and serious action.  The situation was serious then.  It is worse now.   Consider these events of the last fifteen months:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported that in 1995, almost three million 12 to 17 year olds used marijuana.  Among high school seniors, the users number one in three, according to the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
<li>LSD was tried at least once by 11.7 percent of the class of 1995 -- the highest rate since record keeping began in 1975. [Monitoring the Future Study, December, 1995]
<li>The Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that "on the Texas border, the popular practice of smoking cocaine-laced 'blunts' [cigar-like marijuana cigarettes] may also be leading to an increase among teens of smoking crack."  
<li>In Chicago, a marijuana cigarette laced with both PCP and crack, called "Ozone," was marketed over the summer for $15.
<li>The popular culture, emboldened by a softened attitude toward drugs, escalated its glorification of marijuana.  Adidas brought out the "Hemp" shoe; Capricorn Records produced the album, "Hempilation;" and  20,000 young people gathered in Seattle to attend Hempfest '95.
<li>During the past year there has been a startling rise in the use of methamphetamine in California and the Southwest.  Last July we read the horrifying story of Eric Smith who, high on methamphetamine, murdered his son, cut off the boy's head, and threw it out the window of his van.
<li>It has been reported that having discovered how much money can be made, the citizens of Bolivia have gone into cocaine production rather than simply supply the raw material to other countries.  
<li>And, finally, the advocates of drug legalization have stepped into the breach and made their case vociferously during the past year.
</ul>
<p>
These are troubling trends.  But the good news is that the American people are not 
complacent.  The will to fight drugs is very much alive in the land.  Late last year, 
the Gallup Organization released the results of an extensive survey on American attitudes toward drugs.  The poll found that more than nine in ten Americans are intensely concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  When asked what they wanted to see a lot more of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law enforcement and education of the young, and two-thirds cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United States.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent, those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should be legalized in America.  By contrast, fewer than half -- 43 percent -- asked for more treatment programs.
<p>
Clearly, citizens are aware of the devastating effect that drugs are having on 
society.  We are watching the addicts at the end of the pipeline getting 
older and sicker while seeing record numbers of young people enter the pipeline 
that leads to addiction.  In the face of all this, failure of leadership and lack of 
moral seriousness simply cannot be tolerated.  The federal government has to do a 
better job in this area.
<p>
There is no mystery to fighting drugs effectively.  This job is doable.  The
combined effort of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough and intelligent law
enforcement, accountability within the drug treatment system, and a morally firm 
attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in the last decade.  From the late 
1970s to the early 1990s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty 
percent.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost eighty 
percent.
<p>
I commend you for holding these hearings and for the attempt to bring the drug 
issue to the top of the national political agenda.  That is certainly where it belongs.  
I urge the legislative branch to put all possible pressure on the executive branch
seriously to take up the fight.  We've done it before, and it was successful.  
Let's do it again.

<h2>Colombia, America 's Favorite 'Narco-Democracy'</h2>
<h3>By WILLIAM J. BENNET AND JESSE HELMS</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
The deluge of illegal drugs flooding into the U.S. has become one of the principal threats to our national security. More Americans die each year from the use of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs than from international terrorism. Yet, while the Clinton administration has rightly maintained a tough line with Libya, Iran and other governments known to be sponsoring terrorism, it has let Columbia -- which ships more cocaine into the U.S. than any other country -- completely off the hook. It is time for the administration to stiffen its spine and show some resolve in its anti-drug efforts.<p>

The administration's recent annual review of international cooperation on counter-drug efforts by major drug-producing and trafficking countries is instructive. Under this review, countries that fail to meet certain minimum standards of performance in combating drug trafficking are supposed to be denied U.S. aid. The Clinton administration acknowledged in its report that Colombia has indeed failed to meet minimum standards, yet, amazingly, granted Colombia a "national interest waiver" allowing U.S. aid to flow into Colombia despite its miserable record.<p>

This is a grave moral and geopolitical mistake. All available evidence clearly indicates Colombia has totally capitulated to the drug lords. By extending certification to Colombia, despite overwhelming evidence that its government is rife with narco-corruption, the Clinton administration has sent a troubling signal to all drug producing nations: The U.S. will impose no penalty for collusion in trafficking with the drug lords.<p>

Colombia is no borderline case. It has indisputably, become a "narco-democracy" -- a country with a facade of democratic government that is effectively controlled by drug kingpins who manipulate the political establishment with cocaine money. According to the administration's own background papers on Colombia:<p>

<ul>
<li>The Cali cartel has been left free by the Colombian government to exploit the banking system and launder vast sums of drug money with impunity.

<li>There is practically no effective investigation or prosecution of the more than 15,000 current cases of corruption involving government officials (more than half of them senior level authorities).

<li>A "guilt-laundering" system exists, in which Cali drug lords surrender, and submit to a jerry-rigged plea-bargaining system that leaves their assets intact and allbws them to plead to minor charges.

<li>The government's eradication programs have been half-hearted at best, despite massive increases in the growing of opium and new cocaine cultivation.

<li>High-level government collusion enables the shipment of enormous quantities of cocaine into the U.S., with 727 jets transiting in Mexico with tons of the drug.

<li>There is evidence of the corruption of many members of the Colombian Congress, and increasing evidence of presidential ties to the drug cartels.
</ul>

The Clinton administration cannot plead ignorance as the excuse for its abdication of responsibility. But conditions in Colombia are in fact worse than even the administration's report acknowledges. The influence of the cartels and their blood money pervades almost all aspects of Colombia's political, social and economic life. Cartel money finances political campaigns. It silences journalists. It buys judges. It infiltrates virtually every major business activity in Colombia-from cut flowers, to oil, to paper, to banking.<p>

Colombia is now the primary base for the cartels to extend their drug operations throughout the hemisphere. Despite the fact that the Cali cartel now supplies more than 80% of all the cocaine entering the U.S., the Colombian government has failed to arrest or prosecute even one significant cartel member. To the contrary, Colombia has given the cartel cover and protection from international extradition, allowing these drugs to end up on American streets and in American schools, where they destroy the lives of American children.<p>

We believe the Colombian government's collusion with the drug lords poses a direct threat to the national security of 'the U.S.  It is time to meet this threat head-on.  And since the Clinton administration has failed to provide leadership on this issue, it is all the more important that Congress assume responsibility.  That is why a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee will hold a hearing today on the issue.  And why legislation will be introduced this week to cut off all economic support, trade benefits, and military assistance to Colombia by Feb. 6,1996, unless the president of the United States can certify that Colombian President Ernesto Samper has implemented the reform agenda he promised the U.S. Congress he would enact.<p>

Elements of this agenda include investigating the financing by drug traffickers of political parties and candidates in Columbia; putting law enforcement resources behind investigating, capturing, convicting and imprisoning major drug lords in Colombia; ending the "guilt-laundering" system; confiscating assets of cartel leaders; and destroying 44,000 hectares (108,680 acres) of coca and poppy plants in Colombia by Jan. 1,1996 (and all remaining acreage by Jan. 1, 1997).<p>

The Colombian leaders must be sent a clear and unmistakable message: In the war on drugs, they can either continue to ally themselves with the cartels, and thereby become a pariah state like Libya and Iran; or they can return to the community of civilized nations, fulfill the promises President Samper made, and join with the U.S. in an effort to put the cartels out of business. The choice is theirs.<p>

<h2>Suddenly losing the war against drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[President Bush] hasn t fought a real war on crime and drugs, I will."</I><br>
	-Bill Clinton, Democratic National Convention, July 16, 1992.<p>

During the first half of the Clinton presidency, the morally serious and tough-minded anti-drug policies of the Reagan and Bush years have been replaced with such Clinton-era messages as the president's infamous "I didn't inhale" comment and the former Surgeon General's repeated calls to study the legalization of drugs.<p>

Enforcement has been de-emphasized and Attorney General Janet Reno has decried the harshness of federal mandatory minimum prison terms for drug crimes, complaining that too many dealers are in prison.  Over the past two years, the administration and its Democratic congressional allies have slashed drug interdiction and domestic drug eradication activities.  Offering enforcement assistance to -- and if that did not work, sanctioning -- foreign countries where cocaine and other drugs are produced and shipped to the US. has ceased to be a foreign policy priority.  And the Clinton administration's announced priority?  Drug treatment.  Yet neither the president nor the Democratic leaders in the 103rd Congress provided the treatment resources they said were needed most.  In this area, as in so many others, the President al said one thing and did another.<p>

The results of the administration's indifference are now in.  And they are not good.<p>

Last July, the White House released a "Pulse Check" on "national trends in drug abuse" reporting that supplies of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other illegal drugs were plentiful.  And in mid-December, the Clinton administration announced that, in 1994, illegal drug use by teenagers -- specifically 8th, 10th, and 12th graders -- rose sharply in 1994.  (See chart.)<p>

In response, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University warned, "If historical trends continue, the jump in marijuana use among America's children (age 12-18) from 1992 to 1994 signals that 820,000 more of 3 these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts."<p>

The administration also revealed that drug-related emergency-room cases-- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached the highest levels ever, in reporting going back to 1978.  Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to record levels.<p>

Put another way: if these trends continue, by 1996, the Clinton administration will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern American history. And this will have occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992, and a reduction of almost 30 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992.<p>

President Clinton has shown little concern about the carnage drugs cause.  Where violent street crime once seemed to be fed largely by battles between cocaine and crack dealers, drug testing of urban arrestees reveals most of them are drug users and under the influence of drugs when they commit a wide array of violent crimes.<p>

Drug use is also a major contributing factor to child abuse. Last April, Newsweek magazine published a long article on child abuse. It reported what those working in the field have known for years: "Drugs now suffuse 80 percent of the caseload; sexual and physical assaults that once taxed the imagination are now common." In the same month, The New York Times Magazine ran a cover story which profiled of a group of homeless, street people in New York City.  All the individuals featured in the article were drug addicts.  Whether it is violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, or inner-city poverty, drugs, -- and in particular crack cocaine -- have made those social pathologies far more acute and in some places, unmanageable.  While there are other factors contributing to these pathologies, it is crack that sustains the violence that is ripping apart large segments of American society.<p>

We believe two myths present serious obstacles to reducing such drug use.  First is the mantra that the root causes of drug use are poverty, racism and slow self-esteem."  And second is the more general view that therapy by a team of counselors, physicians and specialists is the only effective way to reduce drug use.  At their core these myths deny individual responsibility and, assume that drug use is not the product of an individual's decision, and that decisions are somehow made in a vacuum where things like f ear of getting caught, public disgrace and punishment are never considerations.  This attitude is precisely what got us in trouble in the first place.  Reversing the new drug epidemic and finishing the job of the Reagan and Bush years, requires restoring common sense about the drug problem and a recognition of the primary importance of the things contemporary liberalism has sought to discredit: enforcement, individual responsibility, and reducing the supply of drugs on our streets.<p>

Drug enforcement and individual responsibility are important because drug use can be intensely pleasurable.  The desire for drugs must be countered by certain moral precepts: drug use is wrong and those who use and traffic in illegal drugs deserve to be punished.  A responsible community teaches these things by what those in positions of authority -- parents religious leaders, teachers, friends, employers and political officials -- say about drugs and how they act toward drug use and sale.  If those in authority do not address the issue seriously, they teach that drug use is not a serious matter. And if they say
 drug use is intolerable but fail to act effectively to stop and punish those who sell and use drugs, their actions convey a much more powerful lesson than their words.<p>

Reducing the supply of drugs is important because drug use -- whether by non-addicts or
 addict -- is fueled by the desire to use and by the ease with which those who want drugs can obtain them. A nation that permits wide availability of dangerous drugs is sending its citizens particularly its youngest citizens an unwitting message: We are indifferent to drug use. The harsh reality is that drug use begins with experimentation, with a substantial portion escalating to addiction, which often ends in death. A free democratic society ought to display a special intolerance for those things that destroy people's
 virtue and eventually, destroy people's lives.<p>

There are some who believe the drug war is unwinnable.  They argue that the federal government has spent enormous sums of money to no effect and they assert that the drug trade is too rich and too powerful to be defeated. This is the "big lie" about the drug problem, and it is demonstrably false  The success of the 1980's gives witness to the lie.<p>

First the energy and resources devoted to the anti-drug effort during the last two administrations, combined with hardening public attitudes, produced dramatic declines in the drug problem. No other contemporary social pathology has declined by 50-80 percent.  The drug war was a huge domestic policy success that some have simply denied and are now dismantling.<p>

Second, while federal spending on the drug war was substantial, it only approached $12 billion at the end of the Bush years. At no time did such spending exceed federal spending for, say, NASA. The point here is that neither the space program nor the federal and-drug effort ever represented a serious burden in terms of the federal budget And busting the budget today is not required either. In fact, for the president to devote only a modicum of his valuable time seriously, to the drug issue can make a significant difference.<p>

Finally, there is no question that the drug trade has created some very wealthy and powerful criminals here and abroad. But they are not invincible. They corrupt and terrorize third-world countries and inner-city communities, largely because they are not seriously challenged. In 1989, Pablo Escobar was the well-known king of the Medellin Cartel, the seemingly unconquerable "King of Cocaine." A year later he was on the run. Eventually, even the corruption-plagued Colombian government was able to hunt him down and destroy the Medellin Cartel in the process.<p>

Our drug problem will continue to get worse until we once again pursue responsible, intelligent, and tough-minded policies. We have the means, it is simply a matter of whether we have the will. Consider this question: what would be the national response if a foreign-produced poison was contributing to the large-scale killing of white children in Chevy Chase, or Scarsdale, or Scottsdale? Would we have long debates about "root causes" -- or would we do whatever it took to close open-air drug markets, put an end to the killing, and stop the poison from reaching our children? We all know the answer to this question. It's time federal policy showed the same kind of concern for poor black inner city residents as it does for residents of upper middle class white neighborhoods.<p>

<h2>A record of failure in drug treatment</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[We] should deal with the drug problem in a far more heads-up manner than we are now with two things.  Number one, treatment on demand without delay . . . The second thing we ought to do is find an alternative for first-time drug offenders."</I><br>
	--Bill Clinton, address at Georgetown University, December 12, 1991.<p>

Today's addicts are the most visible casualties of both the permissive culture and the drug fad of the late 1960's, 70's, and early 80's.  These addicts have moved up in the ranks from casual users.  They are largely aging, never married, and predominately male.  Most commit crimes - including selling drugs - as a means of income to purchase drugs. They are also largely concentrated among blacks and live in our inner cities.  While these addicts constitute the single largest demand for heroin and cocaine in the United States, they  also use a variety of other drugs (particularly marijuana) and alcohol.<p>

The overwhelming reaction to this problem has been a call for more drug treatment.  "Treatment on
 demand" is the preferred weapon of many in the drug fight. In fact, many liberals have argued the rational and humane response to drug addiction is to shift resources from drug enforcement and supply reduction to drug treatment.<p>

There are a number of very sophisticated and very effective drug treatment programs (many of which we visited), including very modest ones sponsored by churches and using
 variants of the 12-step method.  These are often every bit as effective as much more expensive and elaborate programs.  But the typical discussion of drug treatment in the press and by the government reflects a dangerous ignorance of the most basic facts.<p>

First, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  From fiscal 1988 to fiscal l994, federal drug treatment spending almost tripled.  At the same lime, however, the number of treatment slots remained virtually unchanged and the estimated number of people treated actually declined by 145,000.  Why?  As with much of government, it is because the bureaucracies have consumed more and more of the resources, leaving less and less for services.<p>

Bureaucratic waste and inefficiency aside, the number of addicts served per year, measured in terms of persons served per year, is equivalent to more than half the total estimated number of cocaine and heroin addicts.  Clearly, when given the chance, the bulk of these programs are not that successful.<p>

A substantial number of addicts have attended several treatment programs.  The real-world fact is that many treatment programs are simply not effective.  In addition, federal treatment funds continue to e distributed largely on the basis of population, even though we know that addicts are concentrated in our major cities.  And there has been no effort to ensure that addicts are placed in appropriate programs.  Today, out-patient treatment slots predominate when most experts argue that the only reasonable hope of successfully treating today's hard-core addicts is to place them in long-term, residential treatment.  Bush Administration efforts to make programs accountable - to cut off support to those that did not produce results, and match resources with the need-were not enacted by Democratic leadership in Congress.  And the Clinton Administration has abandoned all such efforts.<p>

In last year's crime bill large sums were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were highlighted by liberals who announced that they were being "smart and tough."  The model, and essentially the justification, for this funding was the Miami Drug Court and Attorney General Janet Reno's personal involvement with it as prosecutor.  But last August, as the crime bill fight was near its peak, the Miami Herald published a lengthy report raising serious questions about the effectiveness of the program.  In particular, the program established to divert first-and second-time drug offenders into treatment instead of prison was being used by robbers and burglars to serves as little as 45 days.  .And in December the Herald reported that the chief judge overseeing the Miami drug court order an audit of the entire program, expressing alarm that it "had no mechanism to measure whether it was succeeding" A central flaw in the rush to embrace drug courts as a major answer to addiction and crime is that a very large number of addicted offenders today are long-term, hard core addicts who are poorly suited for diversion program.  Drug courts, properly run, may hold promise for treating young addicts.  But young addicts are not the primary problem.<p>

Last year, two groups of studies were released that purport to demonstrate the effectiveness of drug treatment and its superior cost effectiveness to all other categories of drug-enforcement and supply control.  One, funded by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, received attention for its conclusion that treatment "averages [a] $7 return for every invested."  But it included both alcohol and drug addiction and was thus too broad to be enlightening in regard to the cost-effectiveness of treating cocaine, and particularly crack, addiction -- the most destructive addiction threat today.  None of the sympathetic news reports noted that such "benefits-to-society-for-every-dollar-invested" studies for expenditures on prisons and jails have produced estimates as high as 17-to-1.<p>

A second, widely-reported study, was funded in part by the White House drug office, and conducted by the RAND Corp.  It was entitled "Controlling Cocaine," and concluded that "treatment is seven times more cost effective in reducing cocaine consumption than the best supply control program." Most of the press reports on the release of this study failed to mention that even Clinton Administration drug office officials participating in the release distanced themselves from the reliability of the methods RAND used to measure the effectiveness of supply control programs. And to our knowledge none of the press reports explained what the study actually found in regard to the effectiveness of programs treating cocaine addicts.<p>

In reviewing all forms of cocaine treatment, RAND found that 20 percent of addicts continue using drugs while in treatment and only 13.2 percent of the cocaine addicts treated reduce their drug use below weekly or more frequent use (what RAND defined as "heavy use") during the year following their treatment Overall, RAND reported, only "6 percent of heavy users leave heavy use each year [i.e., to something less than heavy use, not to be equated with no use]. About two-thirds of that out flow is apparently due to existing treatment programs . . . [and] one third of the total annual outflow from heavy use is estimated to be due to unassisted desistance from heavy use."<p>

In other words, overall, cocaine treatment is only 4 percent effective in reducing heavy use and only two percent more effective in reducing heavy use than no treatment at all. Needless to say, if the effectiveness of cocaine treatment were measured in terms of the percentage of addicts who stopped using cocaine altogether and for good, these numbers would be much, much smaller.<p>

While we should continue to support treatment programs, we need to face the harsh reality of cocaine and crack addiction: most addicts are likely do die from the effects of their addiction, sometime in their 40's, if not earlier.  This is yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use by young people -- the first step on the path to addiction -- is so important.<p>

As long as the drug problem is discussed in terms of treatment vs. Enforcement or supply vs. demand, it will remain fundamentally misguided. These dogmatic positions are at odds with both reality and common sense. An effective drug policy should begin with this assumption: as long as young people and those who receive treatment reside in communities where the supply of dangerous, addictive drugs remains plentiful -- i.e., where there is de facto legalization -- prevention and particularly treatment efforts will be severely undercut and for purposes of national policy, ineffective.<p>

<h2>Why aren't we attacking the supply of drugs?</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
In August, 1989, the Medellin Cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, assassinated Colombian presidential candidate, Carlos Galan and publicly declared war on the Colombian government In response, Colombian-President Virgilio Barco launched an intense attack on the cocaine cartels.  Shortly after that crackdown began, the US military deployed the most extensive detection, tracking, and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries north.  These events produced a substantial disruption in the cocaine supply to the US from 1989 to 1991, with striking consequences for cocaine and crack addicts.  For example, during the fall of l989, and well into1991,federal law enforcement agencies reported that cocaine trafficking groups were experiencing problems securing cocaine or securing it in a timely manner, even at a higher price.<p>

Reductions in the supply of cocaine to the US market are reflected at the retail level by an increase in street prices, a decline in purity, or both, or by scarcity if the disruption is large and sudden enough.  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) compiles data on cocaine prices throughout the nation and issues quarterly and annual reports.  The data reveal that in gram amounts (the accepted retail measure), a downward trend in prices and upward trend in purity abruptly reversed in late 1989.<p>

The magnitude of the change in availability is best represented by using a standardized price; that is, a price that reflects both price and purity changes by calculating the cost of a 100 percent-pure gram of cocaine for each year.  Not surprisingly, the reduction in the availability of cocaine coincided with a 27 percent reduction in cocaine emergency room cases between 1989 and 1990.<p>

Medical examiner reports of deaths related to cocaine use during this period also declined. Analysis initiated by the White House drug office and released in the publication "Price and Purity of Cocaine: The Relationship to Emergency Room Visits and Deaths, and to Drug Use Among Arrestees, found declines in cocaine emergency room cases, deaths, and cocaine use among arrestees for the 17 US cities for which data are available. In addition, cocaine prices increased and purity decreased.<p>

Further, the cocaine supply reduction also coincides with a decline in the estimated number of heavy cocaine users (i.e., cocaine and crack addicts) throughout the country.<p>

Even though the data are limited, the forced reduction in cocaine availability between the latter part of 1989 and the first half of 1991 seems beyond question.  That it was a key causal factor in the decline of cocaine use, particularly heavy use, is the most obvious and reasonable conclusion in light of all the evidence.<p>

In addition, we know from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse that immediately prior to and during this period casual or nonaddictive use of cocaine dropped dramatically. While non-addictive users consume a much smaller quantity of cocaine than heavy or addicted users, an almost 80 percent drop in nonaddictive users between 1985 and 1992 certainly reduced demand significantly (though it cannot be measured by existing surveys and analyses). In order to increase cocaine retail prices and reduce purity, supply reduction efforts would have to cut supply beyond the surplus supply resulting from reduced demand by casual users. So the actual supply reduction was probably even greater in magnitude than the sizable change reflected in the price and purity data.<p>

The cost of the entire international drug control effort for programs and assistance to foreign countries rose from $209 million in fiscal year 1988 - to $660 million in 1992 (its peak); it moved from 4.4 percent to 5.6 percent of the federal drug control budget. Interdiction costs increased between 1988 and 1992, but almost that entire increase involved the estimated cost of Department of Defense (DOD) activities in support of the anti-drug effort.  And even with this increase, interdiction costs as a percentage of the federal drug control budget declined between FY 89 and FY92.<p>

If measured strictly by results, prevention efforts -- assisted by Presidents Reagan and Bush but primarily those carried out by parents, teachers, young people and communities throughout the nation -- made unprecedented progress in combating drug use (in particular, casual cocaine use declined dramatically). But contrary to what is viewed as settled fact by many in Washington, interdiction and cocaine source country programs seem to have been the crucial cause of the only reductions in heavy or addictive cocaine use in the past decade. The most intelligent approach to drug policy, then, is to work both the prevention and interdiction fronts; to integrate efforts instead of posing an either/or scenario.<p>

The obvious question to ask is: why didn't the reduction in cocaine supply continue throughout 1991 and beyond? The movement in the summer of 1991 of US. military resources to the Persian Gulf for Desert Shield and, later, Desert Storm, reduced interdiction coverage, particularly in regard to some of the most powerful airborne and surface naval systems.<p>

Those resources were never returned.  Today, all of the source-country governments are reducing efforts against the cocaine trade. And unfortunately there is no visible effort by the Clinton administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S. and throughout the world: which is a prescription for uncontrollable supplies of illegal drugs.  Which in turn is a prescription for even greater social chaos.<p>

<center><h2>Losing the Drug War Without a Fight</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
During the past 15 years, American society experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.  But during this period, there was one area against which we made significant progress: drug use.  Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug-taking.<p>

The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural shift.  During the  late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun or as mere self-indulgence.  But beginning at the end of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use was all but impossible to deny, it became Increasingly -- and far more accurately -- seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.<p>

Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.  Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies.  As a result, overall drug use went down.  From the late 1970s to the early lS90s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by almost one half.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost 80%. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.<p>

But earlier this year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.  Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise.  Survey results for 1993 indicate a sharp increase in marijuana use for eighth- 10th- and 12th-grade students, as well as an increase in the use of stimulants, ISD and Inhalants.  And hospitals reported a record number of drug-related emergency-room visits in 1992, suggesting that heavy drug use is also on the rise.<p>

These findings should have mobilized the federal government to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens.  Instead, the Clinton administration has said little to encourage those fighting the good fight and has proposed fundamentally misguided policies.  Consider the record:<p>
<ul>
<li>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80%. 

<li>Soon after assuming office, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related federal crimes.  Her focus? She is engaged in a never-ending search for the "root causes" of crime and drug use.

<li>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies.

<li>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100 drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment strategy that will do little to target hard-core users.
</ul>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy. The Clinton administration suffers from moral torpor on the  issue.  Policy follows attitude.<p>

In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but "I didn't like it.  I didn't Inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."<p>

And then there is Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, the administration's loudest voice on drugs.  While President Clinton dissociated himself once from Dr. Elders's favorable words about drug legalization, she has continued to make such statements --and the president has done nothing effective to stop her.<p>

These statements are significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals they send.  One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic to occur in the first place was the collapse of institutional authority.  Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who early on served as President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that "cocaine is probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use."<p>

Government officials, through legislation and public discourse, can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts.  In a free society, few things matter more than speaking about- the right things in the right way -- and making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.<p>

During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale."<p>

Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first 14 months of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations.  But today, on one of the Issues that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many of the children of the poor -- he and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  One would think that a little more concern and serious thought would come from a president who claims to "feel the pain" of those who suffer.<p>

<h2>Renewing the war on drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett<br>
and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Through its indifference to rising drug use and its erosion of the moral and governmental foundations of the successful anti-drug efforts of the past two administrations, the Clinton Administration has put the nation on a dangerous path. The President bears the principal political responsibility for this record. And only he can use his office to begin to correct it. Congressional leaders in both parties should give him every possible to that.  If the Clinton Administration does not see the light, it should feel the political heat.<p>

As the past two years demonstrate, the nation cannot sustain an effective anti-drug effort without leadership. Congress, governors, mayors, and community leaders, need to meet this challenge.  There are specific roles to fill for federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private institutions that support our families and communities.<p>

<I>Restoring effective federal action</I><br>
The cornerstone of national anti-drug efforts is to give force to the principle that drug use is wrong, harmful and will not be tolerated. This principle should be embodied in the institutions of society, which, in turn, should be organized to give force to that principle.  Without the federal government doing its part, this endeavor will be much more difficult<p>

1. While efforts by the federal government are not sufficient, they are a necessary element of an effective national anti-drug effort.  Executive leadership begins with the president and his appointees in relevant executive agencies. The White House drug policy office was created - at the insistence of a Democratic Congress - to organize and lead the war on drugs. Right now that office is not doing its job, and the Clinton Administration made it largely irrelevant. The President should give someone the responsibility and the authority to get the executive branch, and the federal government, back in the fight.<p>

2. The world headquarters for the cocaine industry is Colombia. The era of meaningful partnership with that government has ended. And there are reliable press reports that the current president of Columbia received campaign money from the cartels. But the heart of the matter today is that U.S. and Colombian enforcement agencies know who the leaders of the cartels are and where they are. The Colombians could arrest or force into hiding the management of the cocaine industry, and disrupt the cocaine trade as they have done in the past. But there is no evidence the Colombian government has any intention of doing so. Occasional showy enforcement operations continue, but no real efforts are mounted and therefore no real progress is made. The US. government has done virtually nothing to give the legitimate interests in Colombian society reason to undertake the risk and effort of making their government put the cocaine trade out of business. It is time to give them such a reason. During the recent embargoes on Iraq and Haiti, experts warned that these measures are most effective when applied rapidly and totally against a trading ally. The US. accounts for more than 35percent of Colombia's licit foreign exports. Such action against Colombia would change the priority of anti-drug efforts throughout the international community.<p>

3. Put the US. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from abroad. Require federal law enforcement agencies responsible for drug interdiction to operate under the overall command and control of the military. This mission will require continuous adaptation because traffickers will inevitably try new avenues as the old ones become too costly. Some in the military will object to this non-traditional mission and its cost. But no law enforcement organization will ever have the intelligence and operational capabilities for the interdiction task that the military already possesses. Over the last few years the US. has used its military resources to protect poor and endangered citizens of other countries.  It is time-it is past time- to stop overlooking the poor and endangered in our cities.<p>

4.  The drug trade inside the US. relies on sophisticated senior management.  Despite periodic law enforcement successes, federal domestic enforcement agencies have produced no serious disruption of major trafficking operations.  And for the last two years the Clinton Administration has allowed the DEA, FBI, and other drug enforcement agencies to curry political favor with local authorities by assigning federal personnel to augment manpower for cases with no federal significance.  This might be acceptable if important federal responsibilities were being met.  But they are not.  We therefore need to establish clear federal drug enforcement priorities and hold enforcement authorities accountable for meeting them.  For example, the Attorney General should be required to prepare a report every six months identifying all major drug trafficking organization know to be operation in the US and  a plan to deploy federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal drug enforcement agencies contingent on effectively implementing this policy.<p>

5.  The Congress should combine existing federal aid to the states and localities for drug enforcement, prevention, and treatment (now, roughly $3.5 billion per year) into a single block grant distributed on the basis of population.  Individual program mandates should be abolished so states and localities can establish and pursue their own priorities for fighting drug use and drug crime.  Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are local responsibilities.  Washington's bureaucratic regulation has utterly failed to engender programs that foster local accountability.  Therefor, the new block grand should be designed to restore local responsibility by phasing them out after three years.  In this way, communities will have an incentive to use these funds for those activities that demonstrate sufficient merit to deserve long term support entirely from local sources.<p>

<I>Creating effective local action</I> <br>
6.  Drug prevention is central to all effective anti-drug efforts.  Young people who do not use drugs in their teens are unlikely to ever become involved with illegal drugs.  But each generation bust be taught that illegal drug use is wrong and harmful.  This lesson must be taught by the community as a whole; indeed, by our culture.  Children learn about drugs by what the adults around them as a whole say and do.  Parents teach by precept and example.  The same is true of schools and the communities.  If drug use and sale is not aggressively opposed and prevented, children learn it is acceptable despite what some adults may occasionally tell them.  Teaching drug prevention must be apart of teaching children right from wrong.  It will always fall to parents to provide that education in home and act to ensure that schools and their communities are teaching this lesson effectively.  This task is easier if national leaders set the right example and speak in support of parents.  But since that national support has seriously eroded, parents, churches, schools, youth organization, and communities are more important than ever.  They have always been, and will always remain, the first line of defense for children.<p>

7.  Open-air drug markets feed addiction and are a visible sign of the toleration of the drug trade in our nation.  It is a national disgrace that such markets are tolerated in virtually every major American city. Drug pushers cannot operate effectively when law enforcement personnel are present.  Forcing drug deals from open spaced makes their lives more difficult and dangerous and hence their activities less frequent.  Many communities have demonstrated that creating a law enforcement presence and maintaining it in response to relocation efforts by drug dealers is doable - but only if closing drug markets is made a priority.  In the next year, mayors, city councils, and police chiefs should pledge and make clear that they will insist that these officials keep it.  We need to stop claiming that the crime and drug problem in our communities is someone else's responsibility.  Decisive action can be taken by local officials and community members now.<p>

8.  Drug testing is a proven tool to discourage drug use by individuals in treatment and those in the criminal justice system.  Good treatment programs require regular testing and apply sanctions against individuals who relapse.  Drug testing arrestees provides a basis for using bail, sentencing, release conditions and other aspects of the criminal justice system to compel individuals to stop using drugs.  Including an extended period of regular testing after offenders complete their sentences, discourages a return to drug use and crime.  Positive drug tests must involve steadily escalating penalties (starting with a one or tow-day return to jail or a half-way house and moving to reincarceration for an extended period).  Most heavy drug users pass through the criminal justice system and any short-term of a drug testing program will save larger costs to the community in repeated criminal justice expenditures on the same individual land the damage their crimes do to the innocents.<p>

These eight steps - involving federal, state, local, and individual action - will reverse the dangerous resurgence of drugs that has occurred during President Clinton's watch.  These actions will help turn the country away from its present course and go a long way toward making progress in the war on drugs.  And that, in turn, will help America to become a safer, more decent and more civilized society.<p>

<u><h3>Impact of Drug Use</h3></u>
<P>
 <B>Illicit drug use is extremely costly to society</B>.  One
study conducted by Columbia University's Center for Addiction
and Substance Abuse found that drugs cost New  York City alone
$20 billion annually, or 21 cents of every taxpayer's dollar.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug abuse is surpassed only by violent crime as the issue
Americans consider the most serious facing the nation</B>.  According
to a recent Gallup poll, 94 percent of Americans surveyed consider
the use of illegal drugs a &quot;crisis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<h3><U>Drugs &amp; Crime</h3></U>
<P>
 <B>The vast majority of criminals use drugs</B>.  Data from Bureau
of Justice Statistics studies show that 79 percent of state prisoners
in 1991, 60 percent of federal prisoners in 1991, and 83 percent
of youths in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987 had
used drugs at some point in their lives. <BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug use contributes to and exacerbates other crimes</B>.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics also found that 31 percent of
prison inmates in 1991 had reported being on drugs at the time
of their offense.  In addition, more than 80 percent of reported
cases of child abuse involve illicit drug use by the abusing adult.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>The percentage of prisoners convicted of drug charges has
increased</B>. The number of persons convicted of violating federal
drug laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981, an increase
of 190 percent.  The number of drug trafficking convictions in
State courts more than doubled between 1986 and 1990.  In 1960,
approximately one out of every 25 prisoners was incarcerated on
drug charges; today, around one in three is.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
higher rate of  conviction and punishment of drug offenders</B>.
 More than 170,000 people were convicted of drug trafficking charges
in 1992, more than four times as many people so convicted just
four years earlier (before mandatory sentencing requirements).
 About half of those convicted were sent to prison, compared to
around 37 percent in 1986.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
significant increase in the average length of sentences imposed
on convicted drug traffickers</B>.  Since the U. S. Sentencing
Commission set guidelines on November 1, 1987, the average drug
sentence has more than tripled from 23.1 months in 1987 to 84.2
months in 1991.<BR>

The skyrocketing increase in the use of illegal drugs has been accompanied by a softening of attitudes toward drug abuse.

Since its birth on Earth Day, 1970, the modern environmental movement can
claim many successes:  Air and water are cleaner; automobiles operate more
efficiently and pollute less; "smokestack" industries are more
environment-friendly than ever before.  

<P>
Perhaps more impressive than these tangible achievements is the impact the
environmental movement has had on American culture.  The vast majority of
Americans now think of themselves as "environmentalists," and most people
engage on a regular basis in some activity (e.g. recycling newspapers) that
allows them to act personally on their environmental beliefs.  The
environmental movement fundamentally changed American values on a scale
comparable to such great historical movements as Methodism and the American
suffrage movement.<p>

<h2>Hijacking the Broadcast Spectrum</h2><br>
<b>Opinion Editorial by 
Karen Kerrigan,
President
Small Business Survival Committee
&
Founder,
Campaign for Broadcast Competition</b>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Here is a story you won't see on network shows such as "60 Minutes," "Dateline," or
"Prime Time Live." <p>
America's network broadcasters are scurrying to preserve one of the greatest government giveaways in history.  In an era when telecommunications companies are paying the government for the use of our nation's airwaves, the broadcasters are on the verge of gaining additional spectrum for free.   A gift of taxpayer assets which, if auctioned, could raise more than $100 billion for federal debt reduction.  Even in Washington, that's a big number.<p>
This sweetheart deal will double the amount of spectrum each broadcaster currently
controls, and will allow them to offer new services such as two-way paging and wireless voice and data services, in addition to multiple channels of digital television.  It should cause considerable consternation to the telecommunication companies who have had to pay billions for their right to use the airwaves.<p>
The deal originated as part of the government's attempt in 1991 to develop an American version of High Definition Television (HDTV).  Experts were afraid that the Japanese would dominate the next generation of television technology and eliminate any American presence in the high-profile consumer electronics industry.  In a classical case of wrong-headed industrial policy, the FCC coordinated the technology development effort, and agreed to provide the broadcasters with additional spectrum to transmit the HDTV signal in order to create a market and make the transition from analog television.<p>
But a funny thing happened on the way to the market.  Technological gains made HDTV a technological dinosaur -- especially in the broadcaster's eyes.  They realized that they could provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves, making way for multiple television channels, while leaving space for other lucrative services.<p>
Given the market and technological realities, the broadcaster's reneged on their
commitment to deploy HDTV.  However, they still want the spectrum.  They argue that -- without the additional spectrum -- they will never be able to compete with the new players in television, such as cable and telephone companies.  This, despite a fifty year head start.  They also argue that paying for additional spectrum will sound the death knell for "free T.V." <p>     
This line of reasoning rings hollow, especially with a budget-focused and  market-oriented Congress.  For the past fifty years the broadcasters have profited handsomely from their current business;  there is certainly no need for the federal government to guarantee their future success as participants in a competitive communications environment.  It is also hard to feel sorry for an industry whose performance last year was the most profitable in history.  It is difficult to see this as the end of advertiser-supported television.<p>
A few Members of Congress and concerned citizens are finally raising this issue for what it really is -- a multi-billion dollar giveaway.  It is an insider deal that will come at the expense of others.  With increasing pressure to reduce the national debt, Congress cannot let this deal pass by unchallenged.<p>
More importantly, an extremely expensive and profoundly wrong presumption remains
untouched:  that the government should continue to be in the business of promoting certain technologies such as HDTV, or attempting to guarantee the success of an industry by shielding, for example, the broadcasters from competition.  Recent communications success stories such as direct broadcast television and cellular telephone service offer compelling evidence that the market remains the only effective vehicle for selecting industrial winners.<p>
The recent wireless auctions, where telecommunications companies bid $10 billion to
offer a new generation of cellular services, provide an effective model for allocating the public airwaves.  It would work beautifully in allocating spectrum now being offered free of charge.  Allow the broadcasters to keep their current, free licenses to use for broadcast television.  Put the new spectrum allocation up for auction.  And forget about foisting HDTV technology onto the American public -- if they want it, someone will figure out a way to offer it to them and make the necessary investment.<p>
     The current proposal reflects wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset.  At a time ofheightened awareness of our budget limitations, Congress should not be bullied into this giveaway.  Economics, not special-interest politics, should decide the allocation and uses of the spectrum.  In a competitive telecommunications environment, entrepreneurs will meet and create new demands.<p>
Allow the market to determine the value and use of this asset and let competition reign. It will pay great dividends to consumers, the economy and the Treasury.<p>

TO:  Concerned Citizens<br>
FROM:  Small Business Survival Committee<br>
RE:  <i><b>Broadcast Spectrum Could Cost Taxpayers Billions</i></b><br>
DATE:  August 3, 1995
<p>
<hr>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is about to give away billions of dollars worth of public airwaves to television broadcasters free -- this after the broadcasters have already made billions on the free television licenses they already possess.  Under the current plan, the broadcasters will double their spectrum and can use it for anything they want from pay television to cellular phone service to paging -- all at the taxpayers' expense.  The spectrum should be auctioned, creating a competing broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and granting up to $100 billion to reduce the deficit. <p>
Last week, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on broadcasters to forge a "Contract for Kids and Community" to meet the public interest obligations they have already shirked.  Hundt's efforts to expand education programming and attain concrete commitments for broadcasters to help parents choose high quality, nonviolent programming are well-meaning.  But he has failed to connect the dots.  The broadcasters have proven in the past (and backed by public opinion surveys) that they
do not use their spectrum to further the public good.<p>
<h3>WHY AUCTIONS?</h3><p>
Since Congress decided in 1993 to stop giving the airways away free, telecommunications companies have bid over $10 billion in auctions to obtain spectrum to provide services.  Why are the broadcasters entitled to twice as much spectrum at no cost?  Shouldn't they compete along with everyone else for the rights to use the public's scarce spectrum?  Hasn't the government proven that it is lousy at picking "winners and losers" in the marketplace?  Competition makes the best decisions for consumers not the government.<p>
Broadcasters claim that auctioning the spectrum will mean the end to free television. 
Competition has benefited not only consumers, but the broadcasters!  What they fail to mention is that the broadcasters have just enjoyed their most profitable year in history. <p>
Apart from denying broadcasters corporate welfare they do not deserve, auctioning the spectrum will provide funds and flexibility to truly use the spectrum for public good.  Auction proceeds could be used to reduce the national debt and better yet, new innovative broadcast companies will provide the public with the quality programming they are demanding.<p>
<h3>ACT NOW</h3><p>
The National Association of Broadcasters is a very powerful lobby in Washington.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on record saying no one will take them on.  FCC Chair <a href="mail to:kidstv@fcc.gov"> Reed Hundt</a> (e-mail address: kidstv@fcc.gov) and <a href="mail to:georgia@hr.house.gov">Speaker Gingrich</a> (e-mail address: georgia@hr.house.gov) need to hear from concerned taxpayers who will not sit idly by while the powerful NAB seeks protection from market competition and robs American consumers of innovative services and costs taxpayers billions of dollars.<p>
The FCC is considering this issue now, and must hear from concerned citizens when possible. We suggest that you send a letter to Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Hundt to send them the message that the public hopes that not all of its officials share their fear of the broadcasters.<p>

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the
best technological decisions for the consumer, not government," added Kerrigan.

<h3>Gift to TV Networks</h3>
<br>
To the Editor:<p>
Re "Media Mergers" (editorial, Aug. 2): Under pressure from the television networks,
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission will soon reward these
megacorporations with a multibillion-dollar deal to double their share of the airwaves free.  The broadcasters were to use this spectrum for the transition to high-definition television.  However, they are reneging on that deal -- to provide more "quality" television.  They will also use the airwaves for paging, and voice and data services.<p>
Recent auctions of public airwaves raised $10 billion to reduce the deficit; if these
companies paid billions, why shouldn't Disney, Group W and Rupert Murdoch?  The giveaway is valued at $10 billion to $100 billion.  Unless Congress reverses course, the taxpayer will pay.<p>

<B><h2><I><center>The U.S. Government's 1995 Budget Estimates Of The Costs
Of IRAs</B></I></h2></center>
<hr>
<P>
The U.S. government's 1995 Budget, for the first time ever, has
included discounted present-value estimates of revenue losses
for certain &quot;tax expenditures&quot; set forth elsewhere in
the Budget presentation (The 1995 Budget of the United States
Government-Analytical Perspectives, pages 59, 60, &amp; 61).
<P>
The government describes these present-value estimates as &quot;representing
the tax expenditure revenue losses, net of future tax payments.&quot;
The 1995 budget document explains that the tax deferrals on the
contributions, and on the accrued earnings thereon (i.e., tax
expenditures), will eventually be paid out upon an IRA withdrawal
when taxes will then be due.  Thus, these expected receipts are
included in these government present-value estimates.  The government
also points out that the discount rate used for the present-value
estimates is the interest rate on comparable maturity Treasury
debt.
<P>
Based upon the above, the government's 1995 Budget document presented
the following estimates for IRAs:
<P>
<pre>		1994 Tax Revenue Loss Estimates for IRAs
		----------------------------------------	
			(In Millions Of Dollars)

	Tax Expenditure 			$5,415 (a)

	Discounted Present-Value
 	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 		$1,735 (b)
</pre>

Based on the above figures, the &quot;present-value&quot; costs of IRAs (b
above) only equal 32% of the tax expenditure costs (a above) used by the
government in formulating tax policy. <P>

In view of the fact that the government recovers the full IRA tax
deduction with interest upon a withdrawal, the above present-value costs
(b above) reflect solely the cost arising from the &quot;second
layer&quot; of ordinary income tax (double taxation) that should not be
imposed in the first place (see pages 6 &amp; 7). <P>

Clearly, the government now admits that its alleged cost estimate for IRAs
in 1994 is not $5.4 billion, but 68% less, i.e., $1,735,000. <I>In effect,
the government admits by its own analysis that its alleged &quot;tax
expenditure&quot; costs for IRAs that are used in formulating tax
legislation are three times higher than they should be!<B> </B>($5.4
billion &#247; $1.7 billion = 3.18)</I>

<P> And even the above severely reduced alleged cost of $1.7 billion is
erroneous, because, as portrayed earlier in this analysis, the government
is assuming that all the saving in IRAs is old saving.  This means that
the government would have, if it had not been for the IRAs, collected its
&quot;second layer&quot; of tax.  This second layer of tax is an improper,
self-defeating form of taxation. 

<P> The government also ignores the fact that there is <I>no</I> cost to
the government if IRA contributions are <I>new</I> saving. Further, the
government calculation <I>omits</I> the dynamic economic gains from
tax-deductible IRAs that create more capital through increased saving,
thereby increasing production, creating more jobs, higher standards of
living, and yes-more taxes. 

<P> <I>The magnitude of the true costs to our nation's economy arising
from such erroneous tax revenue estimates is virtually beyond
comprehension.  It is shocking, scandalous, and worthy of imposed
investigation and correction.</I>

<B><h2><I><center>
Does It Really Matter How The Government Estimates The Revenue Gains And Losses From Changes In The Tax 
Laws?</h2></B></I></center>
<hr>
 <P>
Absolutely.  For example, in 1986 the government wanted more tax
revenue, so it effectively increased taxes on commercial real
estate.  Thus, investors' after-tax net rates of return on commercial
real estate were significantly reduced.  Naturally, and as a result,
real estate values and prices came tumbling down, leading to defaults
on mortgages, failed S &amp; Ls, failed banks, and jobs lost.
 Government bailouts (i.e., more taxpayer taxes) followed.
<P>
Every taxpayer has been severely damaged, directly or indirectly,
because of these ill-considered tax increases.  Far more tax revenue
and economic growth was lost (and will be lost) because of these
real estate tax increases than any related revenue gain estimated
by the government in 1986.
<P>
And, of course, there was the luxury tax on boats, enacted in
1990, that was supposed to increase tax revenue.  All it did was
wipe out jobs and lose tax revenue.  Government tax revenue estimators
do not take into account the rational, to-be-expected response
of taxpayers to tax law changes.
<P>
Further, as so clearly demonstrated in this analysis, the government's
revenue estimation methods as applied to tax-deductible saving
create a tax policy that faces 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
 The economic costs to our nation of this gigantic error can be
measured in trillions of dollars.
<P>
Government revenue estimation methodologies are scandalously wrong.
This must be corrected.

<B><h2><I>Congressional Misperceptions About Measuring The Costs Of
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P><blockquote>
 &QUOT;BUT, WE DON'T DO REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WAY.&QUOT;
<P>
 &QUOT;STAFF SCOREKEEPERS WILL SHOW THAT IRAS PRODUCE HUGE REVENUE
LOSSES.  THUS, THE MEDIA, AND MY CONSTITUENTS, WILL PERCEIVE ME
AS A BIG SPENDER.&QUOT;</blockquote>

<P>

The above remarks are typical Congressional responses (with some
notable exceptions) to the League's position and documentation
that universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are the proper
method for taxing saving.
<P>
Breaking through this mind-set and the policy inertia it inspires
is not easy, but it must be done.  How?
<P>
A determined, persistent, broad-based public attack on these negative
Congressional misperceptions is imperative.  Every taxpayer, every
segment of the media, every business, union, and association,
and every professional person, including economists, actuaries,
accountants, and lawyers, should assume  responsibility for pushing
Congress and the Administration to face up to the extremely serious
fiscal problem of how our nation taxes personal saving.  All of
us must work to persuade Congressional policy makers to legislate
the right kind of tax environment for personal saving.
<P>

Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans are the proper answer
to our nation's low saving dilemma and slow economic growth. These plans
are vital to our personal, family, business, and national prosperity. <P>
<blockquote>
&QUOT;BUT, THE GOVERNMENT WANTS AND NEEDS ITS MONEY NOW.&QUOT;</blockquote>
<P>
Far too often the above comment is used by members of Congress
and others to justify the government's contention that expanding
the tax deferral of saving is not possible, because the government
wants and needs &quot;its&quot; money now.
<P>
The government's money, of course, is extracted from taxpayers'
incomes and savings-the income that workers, savers-investors,
and business entrepreneurs earn as rewards for helping to produce
things people want to buy.  The more heavily government taxes
the income people save, the less saving people undertake, and
the less investment they make in adding to the nation's productivity
and output growth.
<P>
Government, therefore, should weigh these costs of taxing the
income people save-and taxing the income that savings earn-against
its need for tax revenue now.  Government impatience in raking
in tax dollars is extremely costly to the country and, in the
long run, to the government, too.  It must never be forgotten
that the economic strength of government is bound inextricably
with the economic strength of its taxpayers.
<P>
Government patience in collecting tax revenues is particularly
important when it comes to tax-deductible saving.  Until such
saving, unfettered by taxes, is consumed, it performs highly constructive
triple duty by (1) providing investment growth and/or income for
the saver, and (2) providing more capital to create production,
jobs, and profits, all of which (3) generate more taxes for the
government.
<P>
Only when the taxpayer wants to use for consumption some of the
income he or she has saved and invested should that income be
taxed.
<P>
Saving must come first for the government and taxpayer alike.
 Taxes must come last when saving stops.

<h2><B><i>&quot;Our Nation's Debt Is Sky High Already&quot;</center>
<br>
<center>&quot;More Debt From Universal, Unlimited IRA Tax Deferrals 
Scares Me To Death!&quot;</B></h2>
</center></i>
<hr>
Sound familiar?
<P>
According to the Committee on Ways and Means' Green Book (that
describes their income tax revenue estimates), tax-deductible
contributions to IRAs are considered as &quot;tax expenditures,&quot;
and &quot;...tax expenditures can be viewed as...spending programs.&quot;
<P>
In other words, the taxes deferred by tax-deductible IRAs are
treated by the government as if they were part of a spending program
that increases government debt.
<P>
The government, and many others, claim that these tax-deferred
saving programs are undesirable, because:  (a) government debt
is sky-high already; and (b) sound governance dictates that the
government's deficit and debt must be reduced.
<P>
Any debt, private or government, can finance either fruitless
spending or fruitful enterprise.  For example, a person's first
home mortgage probably sends his or her debt sky-high, but the
debt is collateralized by the home and reflects the borrower's
favorable prospect for repayment of the loan.  Such debt is not
considered fruitless.  Certainly, too, the lender treats the mortgage
as an asset upon which it expects to earn income.
<P>
In much the same way, IRA-related government debt is good, not
bad.  In reality, every penny of government debt arising from
IRAs is offset by the directly-related free-market investments
held within each taxpayer's IRA.  The tax money that wasn't collected
by the government didn't disappear-and it wasn't spent on consumption;
it was invested in income-producing assets, adding to the total
income of the economy, hence to total government tax revenues.
 
<P>
In accordance with law, all of this tax money is actually held
in trust within the IRA for the future payment of taxes and invested
in income-producing assets.  Each taxpayer has a legal liability
to pay his or her taxes upon any IRA withdrawal.  Thus, with every
dollar saved in an IRA, the government always obtains a tax receivable,
a governmental asset, that always matches the taxpayer's liability.
<P>
Certainly, too, if a bank loaned you money for a business and
you put up collateral equal to two to six times the size of the
loan, a bank wouldn't impose a second layer of cost upon you that
required you to pay a percent of the relevant increase in the
equity in your business each year until you paid off your loan
in full.  Such a second layer of cost is analogous to the government's
second layer of tax on saving under the ordinary income tax for
people in the various income tax brackets.  How long do you think
that bank would stay in business unless it had the sovereign power
of government to impose its will?
<P>
As shown in this analysis, with tax-deductible IRAs, the government
can make huge amounts of money by:  (a) not being so quick to
tax a taxpayer's income before he or she can even save and invest
it; and (b) not taxing the returns on that saving each year thereafter.
 Collecting taxes when saving ceases is proper and productive
taxation for the government.
<P>
Clearly, IRA-related government debt does not arise from any government
spending, it arises solely from taxpayers' saving.  Every home
owner with a mortgage knows that his or her liabilities (debt)
have increased-but so have his or her assets.  Thus, debt is not
inherently bad.  Our nation would be far poorer without it.  The
same accounting and economic perspectives are properly analogous
to tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Further, tax-deductible IRAs, in the aggregate and over time,
will create far more tax revenues for the government than can
flow from the suffocating financial and economic effects that
arise from the ordinary income tax on saving.
<P>
Tax-deductible IRAs increase new saving and private capital formation,
thereby creating more jobs and productivity growth.  From this,
our nation's economic fortunes will spiral upward, not spiral
downward, as currently induced by the ordinary income tax treatment
of saving.
<P>
<b>Existing Government Debt &amp; Existing IRA Assets</b>
<P>
Our nation's existing qualified plan assets (the assets of pensions,
profit sharing, 401(k) plans, IRAs, etc.) currently total more
than three trillion dollars.  In reality, these assets, primarily
investments in private enterprises, represent the present-value
of future taxable benefits payable to plan participants over some
future period of time.
<P>
If we assume that, on average, these taxpayers will be in the
30&#177;% tax bracket when benefits are paid, then 30&#177;% of
the $3&#177; trillion of qualified plan assets represent the present-value
of future taxes, or $900&#177; billion.  These mega-billions of
dollars currently held in trust for the payment of future taxes
offset an equal amount of directly-related government debt.  The
additional production that flows from these investments, and the
tax revenues on the additional income that production generates,
means that the government's finances are strengthened by these
savings.
<P>
These billions of tax receivables show up nowhere as assets on
our government's tax books.  That's as if the bank that loaned
mortgage money considered all such loans as spending (or losses)
until each repayment is received in some future year.  
<P>
Government debt arising from tax-deductible IRAs reflects a reservoir
of immense financial strength for our nation.  The dynamic tax
revenue gains for the government from universal IRAs will, in
reality, reduce and eventually eliminate that debt over a period
of time.
<P>
It is also very appropriate to point out that even though current
government tax policy decries tax deductions for IRAs, pensions,
and other tax deferred savings programs, the government simultaneously
casts covetous eyes at the wonderful, tax deferred, free-market
accumulations of assets now held within these plans.  The government
seems capable of ignoring the fact that this major reservoir of
free-market capital wouldn't be there without the tax deductions
and tax deferrals the government abhors.  
<P>
Every taxpayer must be constantly vigilant to protect this reservoir
of jobs creating capital from the social engineers within government
who would prefer, if permitted, to dictate how some, or all, of
these assets are to be invested, and/or who would prefer to tap
this reservoir of wealth by imposing more taxes thereon either
directly or indirectly.
<P>
<I>Tax-deductible, tax deferred, free-market assets are the lifeblood
of our nation.  They must be protected and nourished constantly
and vigorously.</I>

Geneva, Switzerland<BR>
May 5, 1995<BR>
by Jack Kemp<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>


Thank you for the opportunity to address WINCONFERENCE 1995.  I am especially honored to be in the company of such distinguished speakers as President Von Weizsacker, Minister Wu Ti, Arthur Dunkel, and Professors Robert Fogel and Grigory Yavlinsky.
<P>
As we begin the celebration in but two days, of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe, we are reminded of how far the world has progressed.  The victory of Nazism and Fascism are outdone only by the more recent victories over Communism and apartheid.  We are seeing, however, not just an ending but the triumph of those 18th-century liberal democratic ideas today in extraordinary ways and in places we could never have predicted just a few years ago.
<P>
Consider events in South Africa.  Many people--with good reason--expected the Mandela government to lean leftward toward socialism and collectivism.  But look at what South Africa is doing in the field of housing. <I> The Wall Street Journal </I>reported recently, "The new South African Government's approach to housing for the poor is quite different from those of Western nations: the emphasis is on private ownership, not subsidized rental. . . . the South African way offers a route for its poor to build a better life, step by step.  Moreover, it is a historic departure from those of first-world welfare states and merits consideration elsewhere."
<P>
We live in a historical moment of tremendous opportunity in the world economy--a moment when so many nations are finally escaping the prison of centrally planned economies to discover the new world of free markets, free economies, free trade and free people.  It isn't very orderly and it isn't inevitable, but it's an exciting opportunity for leadership.
<P>
In addition, the United States has experienced no less than a political revolution in the last six months.  The Republicans, led by Speaker Gingrich, now control the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954.  Due in great measure to that shift of political power, in my opinion, the United States is poised to make significant contributions to the global economy.
<P>
I've been asked to speak specifically about America's role in this new world.  I don't believe it is an exaggeration to say that America's policies and America's attitudes will help determine not only its shape but its future.  America's foreign policy, and that of our friends and allies, has, at its best, long sought to advance the inter-connected causes of economic freedom and liberal democracy.  After the Second Work War, the United States recognized it had a responsibility as steward of these ideals.  The policy of containment was conceived not merely as military and territorial, but also as economic and ideological.  In announcing the Truman doctrine before a joint session of Congress, President Truman warned:
<P>
The seeds of oppressive regimes are nurtured by misery and want.  They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife.  They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died.
<P>
We must keep that hope alive, indeed nurture and enhance it in the world.
<P>
The United States had enough faith in our democratic political system to help establish it in the lands of our former adversaries--and now close allies--Japan and Germany.
<P>
But we did more.  We recognized that a free international order requires certain international institutions to maintain it.  With the memories of beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism of the 1930s still fresh in our minds, the United States helped lead the world in establishing, at Bretton Woods, an international trading system and monetary regime based on a common and predictable unit of account, thereby removing exchange rate instabilities and fluctuations.  We have worked together in GATT to establish a system of open, free trade among nations.  All of this laid the groundwork for the incredible growth of work trade and the remarkable stability of the new quarter century as the West recovered from World War II.
<P>
It is my belief that an active, engaged America, and a United Europe, must help play that same vital role today;  promoting free markets, restoring stable and honest money, and helping build the institutions of democratic capitalism (particularly in the third world and former communist nations).  But fulfilling that promise directly depends on avoiding two great temptations.
<P>
One is the temptation of isolationism and protectionism which is sometimes found on the far-right.  The other temptation is the mindless multi-lateralism of the left.
<P>
With regard to the first temptation, two events have reshaped America's image of itself since World War II.  First is the recovery and prosperity of the Pacific Rim and Europe in particular.  Protectionist have attempted to use this fact to stir up resentment and fear.
<P>
Second, the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own brutality and broken promises.  Isolationist have tried to use this as an argument that America's international role has ended.
<P>
The goal of both isolationists and protectionists is the same;  to narrow America's focus to domestic concerns, protect our markets and allow a world of strangers to take care of itself.
<P>
But the whole approach is based on the myth that the world economy is a zero-sum game, where every winner must be matched by a loser.
<P>
Fortunately, I think that most Americans and Europeans recognize and understand that the growth and prosperity of a unified Europe is good for America, and the growth and prosperity of the United States is good for Europe.  I was a strong supporter of NAFTA and GATT because I believe they are a vision of the entire world's future--free trade that extends to the Pacific rim and Europe so all can share in new markets and new prosperity from expanding global markets.  Now is the time to link a new trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade zone to NAFTA.
<P>
Protectionism in any form undermines efficiency by creating privileged industries and reducing the standard of living of workers and consumers.  Free trade is the best way to promote international development and attack third-work poverty.  Open markets bring benefits to both consumers in developed nations and workers in developing ones and vice versa.
<P>
The second great temptation, which is more common on the left, is for the United States to remain involved in the world, but to pursue a mindless and counter-productive multi-lateralism which turns over the economies of Third World and Eastern European countries to the IMF.  Mexico has been the most disturbing and recent example of the zero-sum approach.
<P>
The crisis in Mexico was not caused by some unexplainable force or unavoidable economic law.  It was caused by an explicit policy decision by the Clinton administration and international financial institutions, a policy of competitive devaluation that is based on the idea that Mexico would be better off by repudiating its debt, devaluing its currency, and dramatically reducing its imports.  The United States and the IMF advised the Mexican Government to devalue the peso, which has led to the institution of wage and price controls, higher taxes, the adoption of a comprehensive austerity, and loss of jobs, wages and pensions.
<P>
But austerity and devaluation are the problem, not the solution.  You can not enrich poor nations by impoverishing their people.  The answer to poverty is economic growth and entrepreneurial capitalism, which flow from the freedom of individuals to work, save, invest, be entrepreneurs and produce new wealth.  The role of government is to protect these freedoms.  This means preserving the value of people's money, not cheating them out of their savings, pensions and wages through so-called competitive devaluation.
<P>
Governments have a moral and pragmatic responsibility to protect, promote, and preserve the value of their currencies.  Argentina's minister of finance, Domingo Cavallo, put it best when he said his currency, the peso, is "a contract between the government and the peso holder.  That contract guarantees that each peso-- as a unit of value that the holder has worked hard to get--will be worth as much tomorrow as it is today.  If the government breaks that contact, it's breaking the law.  The only role of the government in the economy should be to guarantee the integrity of market transactions."  He could have said the same thing about the U.S. Dollar, the Deutsche Mark, the Yen, the Swiss Franc or any other currency.
<P>
It is interesting that ten years ago, when the dollar was a at a peak, the U.S. was advised that the budget deficit was causing the dollar to soar, and thus causing a trade deficit.  Now the dollar has fallen compared to the Yen from 270 to 83, yet the trade deficit has increased.  The conventional wisdom is telling us that our budget deficit causes a weak dollar and thus a trade deficit.  The lesson in this?  There is no connection between exchange rates and budget deficits.  You cannot cure a monetary problem with a fiscal solution.
<P>
A nation's people are its primary source of wealth.  What they need most is honest money and low tax rates to create opportunity--access to capital, ownership, and entrepreneurialism, which create wealth, jobs and enterprises.  Jude Wanniski, author of<I> The Way the World Works</I>, explained it well when he wrote, "The difference between people is the difference in the amount of capital available to them--financial capital or education capital.  Men are the same everywhere in the world, insofar as you give them a shovel to dig a hole with.  They do about as well in Rwanda, Bulgaria, Morristown or Sacramento.  Because we dig with power tools here and with sticks in Rwanda, our real wages are much higher.  If you tax capital too heavily, you are taxing this type of capital, and thus limiting the incomes of people."
<P>
We in the developed nations of the world should use our resources to help foster third-world and former Soviet bloc countries in the skills of market capitalism.  We should help build the institutions that liberate individual enterprise--private property, access to market, access to credit, stable legal structures, and easy incorporation of new businesses.  This is the best hope of developing world and the best definition of true cooperation and compassion for the less developed world.
<P>
The conventional wisdom on the left and the right all too often says the same thing:  that economic recovery, if possible at all, will be painful, hard to endure, and of such duration that not much can be done except inject massive doses of government assistance and IMF austerity.  But this, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly the same thing people said and believed about post-war West Germany.
<P>
Devastated post-war Berlin was the essence of a zero-sum society.  History records that young men fought with senior citizens for food scraps in the ruins and trash bins.  The Reichsmark was all but abandoned and replaced by a so-called "Zigaretten Wirtschaft" or cigarette economy.  A carton of Lucky Strikes became the unit of account, food, construction costs, workers wages . . . just about everything was priced in cigarettes.  The German press speculated about a possible U.S. loan of 50 million cartons of cigarettes to support the worthless Reichsmark.
<P>
People were losing hope that life would ever rise above this bleak level.  In the United States there were worries that democracy itself would fail in Europe if prosperity could not be restored.  And then, suddenly, something happened.
<P>
A finance minister who had studied the classical writings of Smith and Ricardo came to the forefront.  In just a few strokes of incredible political courage and economic vision, Ludwig Erhard changed the course of German history, and thus Western hopes for reconstruction.
<P>
One day in June--the 20th of June, 1948--he reformed the currency by abolishing the Reichsmark and substituting the Deutschemark.  He crushed inflation by tying the new currency to the U.S. Dollar, which, in turn, was tied to the stable exchange rate system worked out at Bretton Woods and thus established the integrity of this new West German numeraire.
<P>
Henry Wallich, a one time U.S. Federal Reserve Board member, in his book<I> The Mainsprings of German Revival</I>, wrote, "The spirit of the country changed overnight.  The gray, hungry and dead-looking figures wandering about the streets in their ever-lasting search for food came to life as, pocketing their 40 D-Marks, they went on their first spending spree."
<P>
On June 22, because inflation had pushed West German people into extremely high tax rates, Erhard indexed the tax brackets, dramatically lowering effective tax rates.  On July 7, he abolished rationing, canceled hundreds of regulations and eliminated wage and price controls, against the advice of the U.S. State Department and the military command.
<P>
According to the history books, within a year, West German workers were eating more and better food than those in austerity-ridden Britain, which had turned to a socialist government and, incidentally, received more Marshall aid money.
<P>
In two years, West Germany's real income increased 40 percent.  By 1952, her exports had risen 60 percent.  Over 12 years, from 1950 to 1962, while the U.S. GNP was increasing by a healthy 50%, West Germany's rose at a rate five times as great--247%.  Within a generation an autocratic nation twice defeated in the century's most destructive wars had become not only a world economic power, but a trusted friend and ally.
<P>
What caused this <I> Wirstchaftswunder-- </I>this economic miracle?  Well, first of all, it was not a miracle at all.  chancellor Adenauer and his Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, both said the Marshall plan had little to do with it.  It wasn't some government industrial policy.  It certainly wasn't a world bank or IMF-imposed austerity program.
<P>
Ludwig Erhard did not discover some magic formula or experience a sudden Utopian vision.  He simply, yet profoundly, applied the socially responsible free market prescriptions of classical supply-side economics.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>He established a stable currency and maintained its integrity as a storehouse of value and a unit of account.
<LI>He slashed tariffs and other trade barriers.
<LI>He allowed the markets to work freely in setting prices and wages, and in allocating resources by eliminating, in one bold stroke, all rationing and price controls.
<LI>He dramatically rescued the steeply graduated tax rates on working, saving, investing, and producing.
<LI>He applied orderly principles of law to private property, patents, and contracts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Erhard's reforms all rested on one fundamental principle of democracy:  that prosperity, wealth, and opportunity can only be created by people acting freely and entrepreneurially--by strengthening the people and their markets and relying on free enterprise--not government planning.
<P>
This is a message for Mexico and, indeed, every nation on earth:  The key to wealth and prosperity is allowing people freedom--freedom to work, to save, to trade, to succeed, and yes, to fail and yet try again.  The ultimate causes of wealth of nations are free people, free trade, and free enterprise.
<P>
This means preserving the value of people's money; not cheating them out of their savings through devaluation.  This will encourage them to save more.
<P>
This means defending their property rights through the rule of law, so the people need not fear the confiscation of the fruits of their labors.  This will encourage them to produce more.
<P>
This means taxing solely to raise revenues for the legitimate needs of the state, not to punish wealth and success to promote so-called egalitarian ends.
<P>
This means preserving the competition of the marketplace at all levels of enterprise, resisting the impulse to protect big business and state enterprise at the expense of young entrepreneurs who ultimately create most new wealth and new jobs.
<P>
These are the lessons we have learned in the West in the last two centuries, beginning with the linkage of Jeffersonian democracy and Adam Smith's economic system of natural liberty.  We have relearned and refined these lessons with Erhard's miracle in Germany, President Reagan's revolution in the United States, Margaret Thatcher's revitalization of Great Britain, Vaclav Klaus' success in the Czech Republic, and in the dramatic achievement of Asian economies.  Once started in motion, ideological momentum is difficult to stop.  Having achieved a victory in one place, it transcends borders and cultures and acquires a life of its own.
<P>
This is the genius of economic freedom from which every nation can benefit, both rich and poor, north and south.  No one succeeds at the expense of another.  Everyone benefits from their neighbor's prosperity.  It is the common ground on which to build a stable international community.  Protectionism yields conflict.  Economic freedom yields cooperation.  We create the conditions for peace throughout the advance of trade.
<P>
And that same freedom provides hope to nations that have lived too long without it.  Poverty is not an immutable condition.  Every nation is richly supplied with the most important natural resource--human creativity.  This is the seminal message of democratic capitalism's triumph:  growth is the product of individual effort, where the link between effort and reward is both preserved and promoted.
<P>
As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day, we should look once again at the 1944 conference of Bretton Woods.  The agreement at Bretton Woods successfully established an international monetary regime and helped promote free and open markets throughout most of the free world.  Ultimately, the agreement was responsible for unprecedented growth, prosperity, and trade.
<P>
Now with the end of the cold war, we have the perfect opportunity to have a new "Bretton Woods" international conference of the leading industrial and developed nations of the world to conclude the work begun at the G-7 in 1985 under Secretary James Baker.
<P>
But before that, the United States must get our own monetary house in order by re-establishing the U.S. Dollar as a reliable numeraire.  It must once again be as good as gold, which will have the effect of lowering interest rates.  As Utah Senator Bob Bennett pointed out, "For every one percent [interest rate] deduction on $4.5 trillion debt, that is $45 billion dollars in annual savings."  Furthermore, the U.S. must reduce the deficit not by raising taxes but through spending restraint and cuts, and tax-rate cuts.  I have been asked by the Republican leadership in Congress to chair a commission to restructure the tax system in the United States.  It is my goal to work toward a flatter, simpler, and fairer code which broadens the tax base and stimulates growth and capital formation.  This would strengthen the U.S. Dollar without requiring higher interest rates.
<P>
We should also immediately expand NAFTA to include Chile and other Latin American countries.  And it is time to establish a trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific free trade agreement that would unite the European common market with a North American and Pacific common market.  We must then invite third-world and developing nations of both Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe to participate in a global free trade initiative to offset the growing protectionism of both the political right and the political left.
<P>
And fourth, restore the IMF to its original purpose, which was to manage the exchange rate system and provide short term balance payments assistance for developing nations.
<P>
Finally, we must remember that there are no limits to growth in our world--just frontiers waiting to be opened and opportunities waiting to be explored.  If the United States encourages those economic pioneers who cross those frontiers--with policies that favor enterprise over planning, sound money over devaluations, growth over austerity--it will play a leading role in the advance of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  It is a role that will not only serve the interests of the United States, but will help unleash the creative ingenuity and vast resources of the rest of the world as well and lead us to the peace and prosperity so long dreamed about by our founders.  We must remember the words of President Ronald Reagan in his 1982 address to the British Parliament:  "We must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings."  What a great challenge for us all to undertake.<P>

<B><h2><I><center>What's The Cost?</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P>

That question is immediately asked by every member of the Congress
who considers tax legislation.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA legislation is certainly no exception, because the words &quot;universal,&quot;
&quot;unlimited,&quot; and &quot;tax-deductible&quot; invoke the
prospect of a large &quot;cost.&quot;
<P>
Congressional policy makers' thinking in these terms is encouraged
by the treatment of tax provisions like IRAs in the government's
so-called Tax Expenditure Budget.  Estimates prepared by the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the tax expenditures (i.e.,
&quot;costs,&quot; in the vernacular of Congress) for various
&quot;Income Security&quot; budget functions are shown in the
following table.  By precedent or rule, all members of Congress
use these figures as the basis for their legislative considerations.
<pre>
 				Year &amp; Billions of Dollars 
			----------------------------------------------------	
Net Exclusion of 						Total
Pension Contributions 	1994	1995	1996	1997	1998	'94-'98
&amp; Earnings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employer Plans 		55.3 	58.5 	62.0 	65.7 	69.6 	311.1

IRAs			6.2 	6.5 	7.0 	7.5 	8.0 	35.2

Keogh Plans 		3.0 	3.1	3.3 	3.5 	3.7 	16.6

* From Joint Committee Taxation Report
</pre>

The April 22, 1993, Joint Committee on Taxation report states that these
&quot;Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct <I>spending
programs</I> which have no spending limits, and which are available as
entitlements to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the
programs&quot; (emphasis added). Direct spending entitlement programs
include:  Social Security, railroad retirement, federal employees
retirement and insurance, unemployment assistance, Medicare, Medicaid,
veterans hospital care, housing, nutrition, public assistance programs,
etc. <P>

As previously discussed in this analysis, the tax expenditure figures
cited above are not &quot;spendings,&quot; regardless of the label used by
the staff.  And, in no way are net exclusions of pension contributions and
earnings &quot;most similar to direct spending programs&quot; such as
those listed in the paragraph above.  In reality, pension exclusions
result in &quot;tax deferrals&quot; (a government asset) upon which the
government receives a free-market rate of total return. <P>

Over three trillion dollars of &quot;qualified plan&quot; assets are now
held by various qualified plan trusts.  Those assets include the past
&quot;net exclusions,&quot; such as those cited in the table above. 
Because most of these assets were acquired by <I>new</I> saving undertaken
in response to the tax deferral, the various plans' aggregate tax
liability to the government with respect to those assets far exceeds the
directly-related government debt arising from the past net exclusions. 
This is particularly true of employer pension plans that generated huge
amounts of new saving over the years.  Over more recent years, however,
senseless and self-defeating funding constrictions imposed by Congress on
the plans have resulted in cut-backs and the abandonment of plans to the
great detriment of our economy. <P>

Regardless of the dollar magnitude of the &quot;tax expenditure&quot; that
the staff may estimate for universal IRAs, it must be recognized that not
a nickel of that amount is spent on consumption; every bit of it is
invested by the IRA owner in income-producing assets. If the average
taxpayers' tax bracket is 25%, for example, the total sum that's invested
in these IRAs will be four times the alleged tax expenditure.  Most of
that investment will be saving that wouldn't have been undertaken if the
universal IRA tax treatment hadn't been provided.  That's the greatest
thing that could happen to our nation's low rate of private saving.  As a
result thereof, our economy will expand dramatically, thereby providing
more production, more jobs, an increasing standard of living, and more
taxes. <P> In reality, contrary to the government's position that the
above &quot;exclusions&quot; are a cost, they should be viewed as a
working asset invested in free-market enterprise.  Thus, the larger the
aggregate tax deductions, the more positive are the prospective real
economic results.  <I>The government's disastrous perception of the
economic effects of tax-deferred saving faces 180 degrees in the wrong
direction!</I> <P> 

A few years ago a highly respected Washington, D.C., actuary (Paul H.
Jackson, FSA, The Wyatt Company), who specialized in pensions, wrote a
brief analysis of the government's methodology in determining pension tax
expenditures.  This analysis was published in the Newsletter of the
Society of Actuaries.  Mr. Jackson noted that within Congress, tax
expenditure figures are generally accepted as &quot;fact.&quot;  He also
noted that the largest single tax expenditure is the exclusion of pension
contributions, and investment income thereon, from the taxable income of
covered individuals.  Mr. Jackson concluded that &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost useless
for budget purposes.&quot;  He also concluded that &quot;...any tax law
based on such arbitrary and capricious figures can only be good by
accident.&quot; Mr. Jackson hit the nail on the head in precise, actuarial
fashion. 

<P>
<I>It is shocking that our government's fundamental tax policy,
as it relates to the vitally important fiscal element of tax-deferred
saving, rests upon analyses that are aptly described as being
&quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; and that produce legislation
that &quot;can only be good by accident.&quot;</I>

<title>What Is The American Conservative Union?</title> 
 </head>
<body>
<CENTER><H2>What Is The American Conservative Union? </H2></CENTER> 
<HR> 
<center><a name="table"></a>
<a href="#ratings">Ratings</a><br>
<a href="#pubs">Publications</a><br>
<a href="#cpac">CPAC</a><br>
<a href="#staff">Staff and Officers</a><br><hr>
  </center> 
 <P> 
 The American Conservative Union is the nation's oldest conservative   
lobbying organization. ACU's purpose is to effectively communicate and   
advance the goals and principles of conservatism through one multi-issue,   
umbrella organization. The <a href="/conservative/acu.html">Statement of Principles</a> makes clear ACU's   
support of capitalism, belief in the doctrine of original intent of the   
framers of the Constitution, confidence in traditional moral values, and   
commitment to a strong national defense.  
 <P> 
Over the years, ACU has been on the cutting edge of major public policy   
battles. Among ACU's significant efforts, past and present, are opposing   
President Clinton's bureaucratic health proposal, his excessive spending   
and taxes, the Panama Canal giveaway, fighting to keep OSHA off the   
back of small businesses, opposing the SALT treaties, supporting aid to   
freedom fighters in Marxist countries, promoting the confirmation of   
conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, battling against higher taxes,   
and advocating the need for near-term deployment of strategic defenses.   
 <P> 
In 1994, through its Citizens Against Rationing Health coalition,   
sponsorship of national "town meetings," and a "Health Care Truth   
Tour," ACU spearheaded the conservative response on the health   
reform issue.  
 <P> 
Whether fighting for lower taxes and less government spending, more   
effective and efficient military protection, or the cause of freedom world-  
wide, by speaking for the entire conservative movement the American   
Conservative Union is always "Your Conservative Voice in Washington."  
 <P> 
<a name="ratings"><h3>RATINGS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1971, ACU has published annual ratings of Congress. Each   
member of the House and Senate is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, based on   
actual votes cast on a wide range of issues. The ratings are designed to   
show how members vote on all the major issues to gauge their adherence   
to conservative principles. As the conservative rating listed in all major   
political almanacs and reference guides, the ACU ratings are often quoted   
by the media and are extensively used by political strategists and   
candidates running for public office.  
 <P> 
The American Conservative Union has periodically published several   
special Voting Indices on specific important issue areas such as defense   
and SDI, judicial nominations, and pork barrel spending. In election   
years, the ACU has provided Interim Ratings of Congress to track votes   
that occurred during that Session before the elections.  
 <P> 
  
<a name="pubs"><h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>
 <P> 
ACU publishes selected legislative guides that are working manuals   
primarily used by members of Congress and their staffs. One example is   
<i>The Clinton Plan: More Power to Government</i>, documenting the  
Clinton record, and showing how he has consistently worked to give more power to Big Government -- and less to the American people.  
Another is <i><a href="/conservative/platformwelcome.html">The 1996 Committee for a Conservative Platform</a>  
</i>; a coalition effort by more than thirty groups to keep the Republican Party platform conservative.  
 <P> 
ACU has also produced audio and video messages, such as TV   
documentaries on the SALT treaties and the Panama Canal, among   
others. Recent productions have included hard-hitting ads on the Clinton   
gas tax, opposition to an invasion of Haiti, and an "infomercial" on health   
care reform. Complete A-V tapes of CPAC proceedings are also made   
available each year.  
 <P> 
<a name="cpac"><h3>CPAC</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1974, the ACU has hosted the annual <a href="http://www.cpac.org">Conservative Political   
Action Conference</a>. Thousands of conservative activists and leaders from   
around the nation meet for three days to discuss current issues and   
policies, and set the agenda for the future. Open to the general public,   
CPAC always offers a distinguished cast of participants. Among them   
have been Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Vice   
President Dan Quayle, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, numerous other Senators and Representatives, Cabinet   
officers, media correspondents, international celebrities and other key   
political figures. CPAC serves to bring dedicated and talented Americans   
into the conservative movement and to train and motivate them for   
political action.<P>

<title>William W. Pascoe, III -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the American Conservative Union, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bob McEwen (1992-93); Managing Partner of his own public affairs consulting firm, Pascoe, Norquist, Jones & Co. (1990-92); Executive Director of Krieble Associates, Inc., a private foundation and public affairs office in Washington dedicated to providing assistance to democratic activists behind the Iron Curtain (1988-90); liaison to the conservative community for Bush/Quayle '88, as Director of the Office of National Voter Coalitions (1988); Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation (1985-88); and consultant to the U.S. Department of State (1984-85).<p>
Mr. Pascoe was the Republican nominee for the 47th District seat in the Virginia General Assembly in 1987.<p>
Mr. Pascoe was graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Government and History in 1982, and an MA in Foreign Affairs in 1984.  He is a member of the Council for National Policy, the World Affairs Council of Washington, and MENSA.   <p>

<h2><center><I><B>The Need For Leadership, Initiative, And 
Speed</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
Accountants, actuaries, economists, lawyers, financial officers,
and the leaders of our businesses, unions, associations, and the
media must assume a strong leadership role in forcing our government
to come to grips with its existing budget and revenue estimating
methodologies as they apply to saving.
<P>
Leaders within the private and non-profit sectors of our nation
have failed to seriously address this key issue of &quot;personal
saving&quot; that means so very much to the success of their work
and our nation.
<P>
These individuals, and the institutions that they represent, have
an enormous stake in making certain that remedial legislation
is enacted.
<P>
These people and institutions can have an enormous, positive influence
through personal conversations, meetings, conferences, letters,
newsletters, the media, talk shows, etc.  
<P>
It has been demonstrated in this analysis that universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs will provide, in aggregate and over time,
far more tax revenue for our government than can ever be derived
from the ordinary income tax treatment of saving.  The exciting,
dynamic financial aspects of such IRAs will add solid growth and
economic strength to our nation.
<P>
The existing methods used by the government for measuring the
IRA's impact on tax revenues are totally destructive.  Tax revenues
are shown as losses where, in fact, ever-growing real revenue
gains exist.
<P>
Because revenue estimates by government scorekeepers allege that
tax-deductible IRAs are billion dollar losers, Congress' existing
revenue neutrality requirements require an increase in taxes elsewhere
to offset the alleged loss from tax deducted saving.  Such erroneous
estimates, and related offsets, create fiscal chaos.
<P>
Huge amounts of economic growth have been, and will continue to
be, totally misdirected, curtailed, and wasted unless these existing
revenue estimation methodologies are completely changed.
<P>
Leaders of professions, labor, businesses, and associations must
lead their groups to demand corrective legislation.  Everyone,
including the government, will benefit.
<P>
<center><blockquote>ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO CREATE UNIVERSAL, 
UNLIMITED, TAX-DEDUCTIBLE IRAS, AS EMBODIED IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT 
ACCOUNTS, MUST BE IMMEDIATE.</center></blockquote>

<B><h2><I><center>Pension Plans Can Become Sensible Again</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
IRAs are a form of pension.  Pension plans provide an important
and useful way for people to save.  Unfortunately, the effective
use of pension plans, including IRAs, has been more and more hampered
by one punitive change after another in the income tax laws and
regulations.  Most of these changes have resulted from the existing,
erroneous, self-defeating tax revenue estimation methodologies
of our government.
<P>
It is well-known to all pension plan sponsors, administrators,
advisers, and plan participants that pension plan tax laws, rules,
and regulations have reached the ultimate breaking-point in unfathomable
complexity and government micro-management.
<P>
These complexities are driven by the absurdity of trying to make
existing, outlandish, governmental notions of tax expenditure
revenue estimates of tax-deferred saving apply in the real world
of private enterprise.  It can't be done.
<P>
Billions of dollars are spent every year by the professions, industry,
labor, and government on examinations of the complex, interrelated
pension rules and regulations that are impossible to fathom, even
by those in government who create them or write them.
<P>
All of these complexities become unnecessary if unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs are available.  Such complexities exist because of:  (1)
the erroneous government notion that tax-deductible IRAs and other
qualified plans cost the government mega-billions of dollars of
lost revenue; and (2) the erroneous government perception that
high-bracket taxpayers are favored economically.
<P>
With universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, employers, unions,
and associations can again arrange their pension plans to fit
their own unique needs and circumstances.  Rather than having
pension plans sponsored by employers, unions, or associations
decline in number, they will increase.  Further, with universal,
unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, portable pensions become a reality.
 
<P>
Pensions of all types (defined benefit, defined contribution,
401(k), profit-sharing, thrift, annuities, etc.) will grow and
be better funded because of the recognition of the enormous contribution
of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving to the financial
well-being of our nation, our government, and of our taxpayers,
individually and collectively.
<P>
The absurdity of the ever-tightening governmental constrictions
on defined benefit pension plan funding is clearly evident when
such constrictions make the funding projections of The Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) ever-more alarming.  These
unfathomable, self-defeating, government-imposed pension plan
complexities are leading employers to abandon their defined benefit
plans to the detriment of the PBGC.  In short, the government
is fostering the abandonment of defined benefit pension plans,
with the net result that needlessly underfunded pension plans
are being dropped into the laps of taxpayers via the PBGC!
<P>
All of this convoluted government-created mess can only be corrected
when it is recognized by Congress and the Administration that
the unlimited tax deferral of saving <I>is not contrary to anyone's
interests,</I> including the government's.  It is the responsibility
of plan providers and plan participants to rise up in anger over
such irrational, self-destructive government.

<h2><center><I><B>Inertia</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>in*er*tia <I>n</I> The tendency of matter to remain at rest, if
at rest, or, if moving, to keep moving in the same direction,
unless affected by some outside force.</blockquote>
<P>
Common sense, as well as sound economic thinking, tells us that
punishing saving by double taxation just doesn't make sense. 
In fact, it's stupid (i.e., foolish; irrational-as, what a stupid
idea).
<P>
If so, why do we, as a nation, do it?  First and foremost, the
answer is that you, yes you, (and I), tend to be content with
bitching, moaning, wringing your hands, and never taking any action
on your own to change the direction of such taxation;  i.e., you
suffer from inertia-as do we all.
<P>
<I>Let it be stated clearly:  no Congressman, no Administration,
and no &quot;staffer&quot; can properly defend the way our government
taxes saving.  So, we, individually and collectively, must assume
the responsibility to take action to force change.</I>
<P>
Every voter/taxpayer must have the gumption to challenge and demand
of their Representative and Senators a clear statement of their
position on S. 929 and H.R. 3179 (a description of the Individual
Investment Account Act is included herein).  This Act is simple
to understand and is positive legislation from every perspective.
 There are, of course, an increasing number of legislative proposals
that include among their objectives the removal of the double
tax on saving.  It is not the specific bill that's so important,
<I>the most important objective is ridding our economy of the
double tax on saving.</I>  The singular advantage of the Individual
Investment Act is that it is simple to understand and simple to
implement after the legislation is enacted.
<P>
There is no valid reason why your Representative and Senators
should not cosponsor S. 929 or H.R. 3179, and other bills that
move in this positive direction.  Strange as it may seem to you
(if you're not a salesman), legislators have to be asked.  No
legislator has the desire to deny his or her constituents (and
himself, or herself) the fruits of personal saving.
<P>
Up to now, most all legislators have been content to follow the
lead of others (principally staff) who proclaim that &quot;there's
a large revenue loss from tax deferred saving,&quot; or &quot;this
legislation is not the way we do it.&quot;   Legislators, by tradition
or inertia tend to merely accept these proclamations as immutable
fact without digging deeper.  
<P>
Every legislator needs your personal push (i.e., outside force,
see above) to start him or her moving in the proper direction
away from his or her own inertia toward swift removal of the double
tax on saving.  S. 929 and H.R. 3179 certainly pave the way to
do the job completely.
<P>
Your personal note (handwritten  is best) is what it takes.  Have
your spouse, friends, family, and associates write letters, too,
in their own style.  Keep a copy, and if you wish, send the League
a copy, too-we'll follow up.  Don't settle for a bland response.
 Insist on &quot;cosponsorship&quot; or a sound reason why not.
 Be persistent.  And, if you need to be, even a pest.  After all,
it's your money and your financial health that's at stake.  And,
you know-you'll win!  And, so will our nation, including your
children and their descendants.
<P>
<I>An unstoppable force will grow from your personal and business
letters, and contacts, as they add their weight to those from
others.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>Home Ownership And Life Insurance</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<I>Home Ownership</I>
<P>
Owning one's home has been a major objective for our citizens
and our nation for well over a century.  Not only has this proven
to be of economic value to all, it has helped maintain and nurture
family values that are so important to any strong nation.
<P>
And, as would be expected, home ownership has proven to be the
largest investment made by most individuals during their lifetimes.
<P>
All of this has been fostered by attractive tax laws that permit
a tax deduction for mortgage interest on this investment, as well
as permitting any gain in the value of a home, to be carried forward
without income tax for lengthy periods of time, including no income
tax on any gain upon death.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can further facilitate
home ownership in a very attractive, sound way from both the taxpayers'
and government's perspective.  For example, such IRAs could be
expanded to include an &quot;IRA/Residence Rollover&quot; provision
such as:
<P>
  Up to $15,000 could be withdrawn from a universal IRA without
any income tax, provided the sum is used for a first-time home
purchase.  Note, however, that the individual's basis in the home
would be reduced in like amount.  Thus, Uncle Sam's tax on this
type of IRA withdrawal is deferred, not lost.
<P>
  Upon the sale of the home, the sale proceeds could be rolled
over into the IRA without any income tax.  Note, however, that
the individual's tax basis on the home (including the $125,000
tax-free amount after age 55) is also rolled over into the IRA.
 Thus, the tax otherwise imposed on the sale proceeds is deferred
and not lost to the government.  In effect, the home seller exchanges
an &quot;unproductive&quot; asset (the home) for &quot;productive&quot;
IRA assets (investments).
<P>
Even though the government's taxes would be deferred via this
primary residence rollover option, the government would make money
on this program.  All withdrawals in excess of tax basis would
eventually be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and the individual(s)
would be giving up a stepped-up basis at death.
<P>
<I>Life Insurance</I>
<P>
A family that is saving and investing for life's later years is
always subject to the calamity of a premature death.  Investments
in life insurance (either term or cash value) should be allowed
in universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, provided the proceeds
are to be paid into the account, or added to a policy's cash value.
<P>
By fulfilling the family's funding objective, enhanced, tax-deferred
financial resources can be available over ensuing years following
the death of the insured.  These proceeds, like the other account
assets, would be subject to tax upon subsequent withdrawal.

<h2><center><I><B>The Social Security Trust Fund And Tax-Deductible 
IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
The Social Security Trust Fund can be compared to the proverbial
cookie jar into which mega-billions of excess Social Security
taxes are deposited, only to have these mega-billions borrowed
out by the government for the government's current spending, thereby
leaving the cookie jar filled with governmental IOUs.  
<P>
When baby-boomers retire and the so-called trust fund is diminished,
these IOUs must be redeemed in order to pay benefits.  Who must
then pay off these government bonds?-none other than baby boomers,
their children, and their grandchildren.
<P>
Haeworth Robertson, former Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration, states that:  
<P>
&quot;The government would have us believe that Social Security
is accumulating huge trust funds that will be used in the 21st
century to help finance the high cost of retirement benefits that
will become payable.  This simply is not true.  The present trust
funds, and probably the future trust funds, are mere window dressing
and have no economic reality.&quot;  (Newsletter of the Society
of Actuaries, September, 1992.)
<P>
Regardless of how Congress lowers Social Security benefits (e.g.,
increasing the normal retirement age to 70 or 75) and/or increases
Social Security taxes (Congress <I>must</I> take one or both of
these steps for Social Security to survive), the financial burden
of Social Security will always rest on the shoulders of the then-existing,
younger work force.  Such &quot;transfer payments&quot; from the
younger generation (and unborn generation) to the older generation
are a way-of-life that can not survive politically nor economically.
<P>
Unlike Social Security, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are fully
funded by investments in real income-producing assets.  The income
produced by those assets provides the benefits distributed to
the IRA owners, and the taxes on those benefits will more than
equal the compounded amount of the taxes deferred by the deduction
of the owners' contribution to their IRAs.  In contrast with Social
Security, the distribution of IRA benefits does not require taxing
our children's and grandchildren's income.  Universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, as embodied in Individual Investment Accounts,
can and must become the strong financial bastion for current and
future generations.
<P>
 
<P>
The financial soundness of tax-deductible IRAs rests on the solid
rock of free enterprise.  Unlike IRAs, the financial soundness
of Social Security rests upon the power of government to tax,
and to tax again and again.  Such taxation progressively weakens,
not strengthens, our nation and its Social Security promises.
<P>
There is no effective prefunding with Social Security; the system
merely collects and redistributes taxes.  No basic economic growth
is created from Social Security, as is true of tax-deductible
IRAs.  Individual Investment Accounts, as proposed herein, help
create and generate economic self-reliance.  Social Security does
the opposite.

<h2><center><I><B>The Unlocking Of Fringe Benefit Handcuffs</B></I></center>
</h2>

<hr>
<P>
Our nation's economy is rapidly changing character as new businesses
emerge, older businesses down-size, global competition and opportunities
increase, and people become more independent and mobile due to
rapid technology changes.  This has direct and indirect repercussions
on employment practices, including employer-provided fringe benefits.
<P>
The legendary business analyst and writer, Peter Drucker, in a
recent article about existing employer fringe benefit plans, likened
them to the old fashioned &quot;company store&quot; where employees
were bound to employers, via the products, services, and credits
these stores provided.
<P>
Under today's economic conditions in a very competitive national
and global economy, employer fringe benefit plans have often become
the &quot;company store&quot; handcuffs that keep employees from
exploring new areas of employment.  This &quot;locking in&quot;
operates to the detriment of the employees' economic position
in life, as well as to the detriment of the employer and our nation's
economy.  Handcuffs can tie two people together even if both need
release.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can greatly change this
existing pattern of employer-provided fringe benefit plans for
the better.  And, there would be no need for government mandates
or controls.
<P>
For example, an employer could decide (and/or bargain) to replace
some part, or all, of its existing fringe benefit program by diverting
the costs of one or more of these plans into the employees' wages
or salaries.  The employees, as owners of unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs, would receive this welcome wage increase and, in turn, deposit
it within their unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Using his or her IRA, the individual could purchase fringe benefit-type
coverage(s) to fit his or her particular needs or desires.  By
allowing tax deductions for premiums and/or benefit payments paid
from the IRA, these tax effects could parallel those now found
under employer-sponsored plans.
<P>
Interestingly, the Administration's 1994 &quot;Health Reform Proposal&quot;
included a provision that premium payments made by &quot;self-employed&quot;
persons would be fully tax-deductible.  This is the same approach
that could be used when universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs
are used to replace an employer-provided fringe benefit.
<P>
Consider these advantages of an IRA-based, individualized, fringe
benefit alternative:
<P>
  It enhances an individual employee's personal responsibility
for himself and his family in many ways.  For example, some persons
may choose &quot;high deductibles&quot; and &quot;major medical&quot;
insurance, while self-insuring the less onerous, but administratively
expensive, costs of medical care.
<P>
 Other persons may want or need more or less life insurance than
his or her employer provides.  Some people may choose a long-term
sickness insurance program that's not otherwise available through
the employer.  Alternatively, too, the diverted wages can be saved
in the tax-deductible IRA without replacing the employer-provided
coverage, as might be the case of a young, single employee in
good health.
<P>
 When one considers that a 10%, 20%, 30%, and up, wage increase
can flow from such a basic change in employee benefit plan structures,
it becomes obvious that far more efficient wage/benefits structures
are obtainable without increasing the costs of doing business.
<P>
  In short, the use of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs as a means
to provide individualized fringe benefits is fiscally sound, very
flexible, and will be very attractive to many employees and employers
alike.
<P>
  Without question, too, the &quot;personal costs/benefits received&quot;
relationship between the IRA owner-buyer and the fringe benefit
provider will greatly enhance claims control and reduce the costs
of coverage.  Spending one's own IRA account money for &quot;coverage&quot;
and &quot;care,&quot; as contrasted with spending from an unlimited
employer or insurer fund, makes a very big &quot;cost control&quot;
difference.
<P>
  Employers may find it desirable to be relieved of the very heavy
burden of choosing, designing, administering, monitoring, and
paying for the plans they now offer.  The employer's overall costs
can be the same, but the diversion of benefit plan costs to wages
can be far more useful to the employee-and the employer.  Certainly,
the employer's &quot;benefit cost&quot; diversion to &quot;wages&quot;
creates a more controllable cost from both the employer and the
user perspective.
<P>
  Clearly, the existing employer-based structure to provide fringe
benefit plans has been stretched to the breaking point in many,
if not most, situations.  Most employers are, after all, in the
business of making products and services, not designing and administering
fringe benefits to fit each employee's particular needs.  This
is true of most all employers regardless of their size.
<P>
  IRA-based fringe benefits do not prohibit employers, unions,
associations, independent providers, such as insurers and Blue
Cross, etc. (or groups thereof), from offering plans to employees,
members, or individuals that will enable the employee (IRA owner)
to select the plan(s) that best fits his or her needs and desires.
 Such sponsored plans will be able to provide the discounts normally
associated with high volume business.
<P>
  Unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-based fringe benefits also help
solve the very serious problem of &quot;benefits portability&quot;
when an employee changes employers, moves geographically, and/or
retires.  Obviously, too, the universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
attributes of an IRA-type plan would greatly facilitate the personal
pre-funding of post-retirement coverages that are so vitally important
to our current and future senior citizens.
<P>
  There will be those in the government and in the private sector
who will claim that employees will wastefully spend the fringe
benefit costs diverted to tax-deductible IRAs.  However, people
need, and should have, the responsibility for their own actions-and
the vast majority of our citizens will welcome this.  There will
always be those who need help, but our localities, private institutions,
and charities are in a far better position to provide that help.
 This will be particularly true when personal saving is released
from the senseless bondage of double taxation.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs create a whole new environment
for imaginative, sound ways in which our citizens can personally
assume more responsibility and opportunity for their own current
and future &quot;financial&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; needs.
 These needs and desires embrace both a &quot;saving&quot; and
&quot;protection&quot; element that can best be decided at a personal
and family level.  And, of course, these needs and desires of
an individual, or family, will undoubtedly change over the years
as circumstances change.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type plans that can provide fringe benefits offer the maximum,
sound flexibility to meet these emerging changes from both the
employee's and employer's perspective.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs also provide each employer
with the opportunity to re-think the design of its fringe benefits
programs not only in regards to the company's objectives, but
those of its employees, too.  In contrast, replacing the &quot;company
store&quot; with the &quot;government's store&quot; for health
care coverage is a disastrous retreat from the sound, emerging,
very competitive trends of the future.
<P>
The attractive option of combining universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs with individually selected &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;protection&quot;
alternatives makes absolute sense.

<h2><center><I><B>Family</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>

Personal saving is not just an economic matter for our nation; personal
saving helps build the strong sinews of family life. Family life is, and
should be, the strongest, most cohesive economic force within any nation. 
<P>
Parents, particularly, are always striving to better their lives, in no
small part in order to better help their children and other family
members.  The act of saving creates a storehouse of economic values for
future enjoyment or needs that can smooth and enhance family life. 
<P>
After all, our nation's economic strength and values must always represent
the aggregate economic strengths and values of individuals and their
families, not vice versa. 
<P>
Too often we have seen tax policy mistakenly curtail the individual's and
the family's ability and responsibility to accumulate savings. As a
result, without savings, individuals and families gradually, but
inexorably, become dependent on others or on the state. 
<P>
The ordinary income tax is the classic example of a slow, but
sure, progressive tax abuse of saving.  Other examples include
the misguided imposition of caps and limits on IRAs and on benefit
plans.  Such benefit plans provide advance funding and protection
against economic calamity.
<P>
Plain common sense and the traditional American drive for self-reliance
dictate that it is far better to permit individuals and families
to accumulate the maximum possible tax-deferred savings and investment
they can achieve.  People can better build their own lives and
protections without government interference or dole.  Not only
does this provide more freedom from economic fear, it adds joy,
purpose, and far greater economic health to everyone's life.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs provide each individual,
and his or her family, a far superior way to fulfill those innate
responsibilities to save and invest for their future needs and
desires.  These family needs, desires, and responsibilities are
intertwined among generations stretching over many years and should
not be curtailed by unwise taxation.

<h2><center><I><B>Wealth</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
The word &quot;wealth&quot; has many connotations.  Too often,
financial wealth is interpreted negatively, thereby implying that
wealth is not desirable.  Or, that perhaps wealth above some level
is too much.
<P>
Obviously, too, financial &quot;wealth&quot; is easily interpreted,
as they say, in &quot;the eyes of the beholder.&quot;  Great wealth
to one person may be little wealth to another.
<P>
Regardless of personal feelings as to what is &quot;wealth,&quot;
from a financial perspective it is important for everyone to recognize
that savings, regardless of amount, are wealth.  And, having savings,
i.e., wealth, regardless of amount, is good for everyone-the person
who has it, those who use it directly or indirectly, and our nation.
<P>
We all prefer to live in a wealthy nation-and the wealth of a
nation is derived from the wealth of its people-not the other
way around.  The financial wealth of people can only arise from
saving (not consuming) and its fruitful use.  When people borrow,
they borrow someone else's saving.
<P>
Saving, and its growth, produces wealth.  Thus, it makes absolute
sense for governments-via their sovereign power-to encourage private
saving, and its growth, by every person.  Needless to say, for
our government to needlessly punish saving via the ordinary income
tax is crazy, self-defeating, and an abuse of power.
<P>
The growth of wealth invested via private enterprise should have
no bounds-for anyone-as amply demonstrated in this analysis. 
Government misconceptions concerning the taxation of wealth, and
its accumulation, must change-and change promptly-for everyone's
sake, including the government's.  
<P>
And, the accumulation of wealth (or its maintenance) must not
be constrained by notions that wealth existing at death above
some artificially set level must be captured by government (via
estate taxes, etc.), because the wealth is &quot;too high,&quot;
or because of some artificial notion promoted by some economists
of &quot;life-cycle&quot; taxation.  This usually means that if
the government didn't collect enough taxes while you lived, the
government should get the balance when you die.
<P>
From the government's fiscal perspective, with IRA-type saving,
death should be no more of a taxable event than an investment
transaction.  After all, inherited savings, i.e., wealth, will
continue to create production, jobs, rising standards of living,
more taxes, as well as prospective spending power for the owners
thereof.  Progressive estate tax rates applied to saving, like
the ordinary income tax, cut off the government's fiscal nose
to spite its face.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs avoid estate taxes through
the ongoing deferral of the income taxes on invested wealth. 
In due course, all withdrawals will be taxed at progressive income
tax rates.  This clearly maintains sound tax policy and accumulated
saving.
<P>
Wealth, small or large, is of great value to everyone, directly
and indirectly, including the government.  Certainly, to have
the government snatch away as an additional tax up to 55% of a
person's, or a family's, hard-earned investment growth (wealth)
at the time of death can destroy a lifetime of energetic, productive
work, and/or force individuals and families into nonproductive
(except to avoid the tax) tax avoidance methods.  The rational
taxation of saving, whereby the government maximizes its tax potential,
is to tax saving only when it's consumed.
<P>
<I>Unfortunately, the largest, persistent predator of wealth is
the irrational sovereign power of government.  Eternal vigilance
and diligence is required by each and every voter/taxpayer to
protect their wealth, and to nourish it.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>Entitlements</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
So-called &quot;entitlements&quot; are government spending programs
that grow automatically without adequate cost control or constraint.
 Typically, these programs are initiated for modest and humanitarian
reasons.  However, their potential future costs are usually unmeasured,
measured improperly, or ignored.  Further, once established, people
become accustomed to their availability, and the benefits provided
become political magnets for enhancement due to inflation, demographic
changes in the population, and the political power of recipients.
 In short, with the passage of time, they become &quot;entitlements.&quot;
<P>
Three existing entitlement programs-Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid,
and federal welfare benefits-involve huge, ever-increasing costs
that, in aggregate when combined with interest on the national
debt, exceed the government's &quot;discretionary&quot; spending
over which it can, if it wishes, exercise control.  The growth
of these entitlement costs is alarming.
<P>
The funding of entitlement programs can only come from one contributing
source-taxpayers.  When these programs were initiated, the then-existing
contributor/recipient ratio was high (many more taxpayers were
contributors then recipients), and the level of benefits was low.
 With the passage of time, the contributor/recipient ratio has
grown much smaller, and the level of benefits has grown much larger.
 This has created an explosion of ever-increasing costs that are
borne by an ever-diminishing segment of the voter/taxpayer population.
 
<P>
Such costs can only be funded by raising taxes or by increased
governmental borrowing.  Income taxes and payroll taxes typically
transfer the economic values generated by one group of taxpayers
to another group as, for example, when younger people's payroll
taxes are used to fund older people's health care costs and pensions.
 Borrowing to cover these costs unethically passes these costs
to another generation.  
<P>
Regardless of the source of funds (tax or borrowing), these uncontrolled
entitlement spendings extract free-market capital from the marketplace.
 This, in turn, makes the economy progressively weaker, thereby
leading to a political/economic climate that fosters further enhancements
of entitlement programs.  This becomes a gradual, but never-ending,
spiral downward toward economic stagnation, unfair inter-generational
transfer payments via the tax code, and ultimate disaster.
<P>
Changing the way our nation taxes saving so that saving is promoted
and not punished can dramatically change the human/economic dynamics
that lead to these entitlements.  Taxpayers will be far better
able to accumulate assets for their retirement and life's potential
needs for health care and welfare.  Not only will free markets
grow more rapidly, thereby enhancing living standards and employment
growth, the need and pressures for entitlement programs will diminish.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can do wonders by helping
to remove the ever-increasing and divisive cost burden of entitlements
from our nation's shoulders.

<h2><center><I><B>&quot;Trickle-Down Economics&quot; And &quot;Tax Loopholes
For The Rich&quot;</h2></B></I></center>

<hr>
<P>
Both of the above inflammatory labels have been used to thwart
legislative attempts to improve, expand, and increase the allowable
tax deduction levels of IRAs.  These labels ignore the facts.
<P>
It is correct, of course, that higher-bracket taxpayers also gain
with tax-deductible IRAs.  However, as so clearly shown in this
analysis, this gain is derived solely from the removal of a crushing,
self-defeating, double and triple tax burden on saving that's
imposed by the progressive ordinary income tax.  This tax irrationally
and progressively wipes out the saving accumulations of all taxpayers.
 And, the higher the bracket, the more irrational the second layer
of tax becomes.
<P>
The ordinary income tax should not be applied to saving, because
it is progressively destructive to the government's tax revenues,
as well as the taxpayers' and our nation's wealth.  Under the
ordinary income tax, the higher the tax bracket, the greater the
destruction to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
High-bracket taxpayers should be encouraged to make unlimited,
tax-deducted contributions to IRAs.  Not only does the government
receive far higher tax revenues, the availability of investment
capital for the users of capital (in any tax bracket) is greatly
increased.  This is vital to our nation's economy.
<P>
And, it has been clearly demonstrated in many forums that the
bulk of the benefits derived from increased capital flow to labor.
 The more capital a worker has to work with, the higher is the
worker's productivity, the greater is the demand for his or her
labor, and the higher is his or her real wage rate.  In fact,
if capital doesn't increase more rapidly than labor, productivity,
employment, and real wage rates will not advance.  Increasing
the amount of capital per worker requires reducing the cost of
capital, and that requires reducing the cost of saving.  That's
what tax-deductible IRAs do.  Lowering the cost of capital will
also reduce the cost of government debt.
<P>
Small businesses, entrepreneurs, and job seekers will surely benefit
greatly from capital growth, as will all other taxpayers, both
directly and indirectly.  Without question, the slogans &quot;trickle-down
economics&quot; and &quot;tax loopholes for the rich,&quot; when
applied to universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, are nothing
but complete red herrings.

<h3>March, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join The Heritage 
Foundation after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.<P>
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isnt the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business communitys pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted usso far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolutionfocus and closure are critical.<p>

  By "lower," we do not mean "bad."  The bliss of marriage 
consists in part in the sexual union of spouses.  That union 
is, in the human species, elevated and inspired by the 
rational and moral union that married people enjoy.  A 
lifetime of commitment, chosen and not dictated by 
instinct, sustained by determination in the face of obstacles, 
is the specifically human satisfaction of human sexual 
relations.  In that context, the human family is a reflection 
of the divine nature of man.

  A national marketing survey indicates that the average 
homosexual enjoys a household income of more than 
$55,400, a figure $23,000 higher than the average American 
household.  Homosexuals are far more likely to hold a 
college degree, and far more likely to work in a professional 
or managerial position than average Americans.  They are 
more than four times as likely to travel overseas, or to earn 
over $100,000 annually.  See "Overcoming a Deep-Rooted 
Reluctance, More Firms Advertise to Gay Community," in 
The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1991, p. B-1.  
  On the other hand, for a brief clear response to 
homosexuals who try to bend the Bible to support their 
case, see Harry V. Jaffa, Homosexuality and the Natural Law 
(Claremont, California: The Claremont Institute, 1990), p. 
31; for a summary of studies exploding the 10-percent myth,

  Wall Street Journal, March 31, 1993, p. A-14, and John 
Billy et al., "The Sexual Behavior of Men in the United 
States," Family Planning Perspectives, March/April 1993, 
pp. 52-60; for an argument that homosexuality is "curable" 
and not etched in genetic stone, see  Mark Hartwig, "Is 
Homosexuality Destiny or Choice?" Focus on the Family 
Citizen, Nov. 16, 1992, pp. 12-14.
  For a complete account, see William Tucker, "Revolt in 
Queens," The American Spectator, February 1993, pp. 26-

  Amendment 2, which received 54 percent of the popular 
vote, read as follows:  "Shall there be an amendment to 
Article II of the Colorado Constitution to prohibit the state 
of Colorado and any of its political subdivisions from 
adopting or enforcing any law or policy which provides that 
homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation or conduct, or 
relationships constitutes or entitles a person to claim any 
minority or protected status, quota preference or 
discrimination?"

equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of 
individuals";  James Madison, in urging the First Congress of 
the United States to adopt a bill of rights, noted that 
"independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in 
a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights."  1 Annals 
of Congress (Gales and Seaton, eds., 1834), p. 457.  For the 
Progressive view see J. Allen Smith, The Spirit of American 
Government, pp. 299-300: "In carrying out the original 
intent of the Constitution with reference to property the 
courts have developed and applied the doctrine of vested 
rights-a doctrine which has been used with telling effect for 
the purpose of defeating democratic reforms."
  Robert E. Brown, Charles Beard and the Constitution: A 
Critical Analysis of "An Economic Interpretation of the 
Constitution" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1956).  
Using the same data that was used by Beard, Brown was able 
to show that as many members of the "predator classes" 
opposed the Constitution as supported it.
  In his essay "On the Jewish Question," Marx had pointed 
out that progressive taxes can be used by the state as an 
effective means to abolish private property:  "when men 
strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, 
the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy 
religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish 
private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, 
or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds 
to abolish life, by the guillotine" (emphasis original).  Robert

  In 1927, the Progressive historian Vernon Parrington 
made this remarkable reinterpretation of the American 
Founding: "The substitution of 'pursuit of happiness' for 
'property' [in the Declaration of Independence] marks a 
complete break with the Whiggish doctrine of property 
rights that Locke had bequeathed to the English middle 
class, and the substitution of a broader sociological 
conception; and it was this substitution that gave to the 
document the note of idealism which was to make its appeal 
so perennially human and vital."  In the view of Parrington, 
the radical welfare state had been present in America's most 
authoritative documents from the very beginning!  Main

  She received $663 in cash from Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children (AFDC) and $139 in food stamps (Lance 
Izumi, ''Welfare in California: Too Much to Too Many," 
Claremont Institute Briefing #1992-19, October 27, 1992, p. 
3). The cash equivalent of her free health care was $450. 
(According to the California Department of Personnel 
Administration, the state paid $430 in 1992 to Foundation 
Health for HMO coverage for an employee family of three. I 
added $20 because Foundation coverage is more restrictive 
than Medicare and MediCal.) Her Section 8 housing voucher 
was worth $565. (According to HUD, the average one-
bedroom apartment in Los Angeles costs $704 in rent; I 
estimate $60 in utilities for a total of $764; a Section 8 
certificate is worth $764 minus 30% of cash income: $663 X 
30% = $199, and 764 minus 199 is 565.) Thanks to Jennifer

* Editors' Note: The idea for this appendix arose during a 
November 1992 segment of the television interview show, 
"Meet the Press."  Its purpose, like that of Appendix A, is to 
demonstrate that Bible-based religious faith is perfectly 
compatible with the principles and traditions of American 
democracy.  Indeed, it is much more so than the facile 
moral relativism of modern liberals.

<center><h2>"IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS</h2></center>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong>--- "At a time when the latest statistics indicate marijuana use among teen-<br><br>agers is up 37% and as we face a national crisis on drug abuse, Bill Clinton fiddles while Rome <br><br>burns talking about tobacco use," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. <br><br>Keene. "The way the Clinton Administration and its liberal allies portray it, tobacco is the greatest <br><br>scourge affecting children since the dawn of time and nothing short of a full-blown crackdown by <br><br>the Federal government can solve it. But the real problem is drug abuse and all its associated evils, <br><br>and the Clinton Administration has exhibited a scandalous indifference to the appalling increase in <br><br>illegal drug use."
<p>Keene noted that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services statistics released earlier this month show overall drug abuse among teens is up 78% between 1992 and 1995.  Marijuana use by teen-agers is up 37%, LSD use is up 54%, and cocaine use is up 166%.  He also pointed to a second new government report showing hospital emergency room visits resulting from marijuana abuse is up 96%.  Before Clinton took office, teen-age drug abuse had declined for a decade according to a third survey, conducted by <em>USA Today</em>.
<p>"What's really at work here is a cynical attempt to gain political mileage at the expense of addressing the real problem," Keene continued.  "The Administration, knowing it lacks credibility when it comes to waging the real war -- the war on drugs -- thinks it can cover itself with a phony war on tobacco.
<p>"As early as the 1960's and 1970's, the science was conclusive about the hazards of illegal drug use," Keene said. "But the then-youthful liberals who today occupy top positions in Washington, Hollywood and elsewhere ridiculed the dangers of marijuana and rejected society's disdain over 'hard' drugs.  They agitated to decriminalize marijuana cutlivation, possession and use.  They attacked, then as now, conservatives and other advocates of traditional cultural and moral values.  Today, as adults, they minimize and rationalize their own dalliances in the illegal drug scene.  For example, the President did not say that his own marijuana experimentation was wrong because it was illegal, or dangerous, or manifested anti-social behavior -- he excused himself by saying that he 'didn't inhale.'
<p>"No one, not even the tobacco companies, who are clearly on record about it, think it's a good idea for young people to smoke," Keene added.  "But the liberal establishment's election-year hysteria over tobacco is hypocritical in light of its record on illegal drug policy.  After all, the permissive social and political attitudes of liberalism gave birth to the drug culture.  Many liberals seem unwilling to offer more than lip service when it comes to fighting it and belittle those who try -- as former First Lady Nancy Reagan can attest from experience.  Should anyone take this Administration seriously in its 'holy war' against tobacco in light of disturbing reports of illegal drug use among the White House staff? What moral authority does the President -- a cigar smoker -- bring to bear? Why is the Administration bent on expanding government power and imposing new layers of regulation on the American people in this instance while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the critical problem of illegal drug use?
<p>"The American people should be asking tough questions," Keene concluded. "If the Administration should make a Federal case out of anything, it's national drug policy. Apparently Clinton has none, since the statistics speak for themselves. We therefore urge the Administration to wake up to the real and growing threat of illegal drug abuse and stop offering political sideshows to sidestep its real responsibilities."

<h2>FLAT TAX, SALES TAX, WHATEVER: FOCUS MUST STAY ON<br>
JUNKING CURRENT NIGHTMARISH TAX SYSTEM, ACU SAYS </h2>
</center>

<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--- "Some conservatives favor a flat tax, others support a national sales or
value-added tax, still others have different ideas on how best to pay for the legitimate
functions of government. The main thing is, we must not allow differences over those approaches
from causing the tax reform movement to lose sight of the real goal: elimination of the current
Federal income tax non-system, with its enormous bureaucracy, byzantine rules and regulations,
and abuses and outrages. That's why ACU is happy to join forces with those who also recognize
the importance of staying focused on the larger objective," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the
American Conservative Union (ACU), at a "Commitment to Tax Reform" press conference in
Washington, D.C., hosted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
<P>
     "This year's Tax Freedom Day- - May 7 - - was the latest ever," Keene continued. "When you
add in the hidden costs of government, such as regulations and other expensive burdens,
Americans must labor until July 3 before they're in the clear and able to keep all of what they
work hard to earn. That's an outrage to cause every American's blood to boil. The 105th Congress
cannot allow this level and scope of taxation to continue. The current tax structure is
hopelessly beyond repair and the only sane, fair thing to do is scrap it entirely.
<P>
     "ACU has already launched its own long-term project with the objective of abolishing the
IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized the Federal income tax. Yet that does not
mean we cannot join with our friends who argue persuasively for a flat tax in saying with them
that what exists now is a nightmare that must end and that the American people deserve tax
justice," Keene concluded. "The issue is no longer whether or not to end taxation as we know it,
but how soon we will get there. Once we get there, we may find that a flat tax is the way to go,
or that the best option is the national sales tax, or that some other approach is better.
Whatever the outcome, we simply must not lose sight of the objective, we simply must not let
Congress dodge the issue any longer, and we simply must make sure that the American people don't
stop pressing for reform."

conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters,

<h2>ON TAX FREEDOM DAY, ACU URGES 16TH AMENDMENT REPEAL </h2>
</center>

<p>


 
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "It's Tax Freedom Day. Starting now, Americans can keep what they 
work so hard to earn after having spent the past four months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax 
bill," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. "With this year's Tax 
Freedom Day being the latest ever, the need for comprehensive tax reform has never been greater. 
That's why ACU is making tax reform its top long-term priority." 
<p>    Keene said that a cornerstone of the ACU effort will be a grassroot-oriented lobbying and 
public education campaign to rally support for repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which instituted the Federal income tax. 
 
 <p>    "Federal spending, the deficit, the national debt, and the growth of government have been 
spiralling out of control for decades," Keene said. "While the current Republican Congress has 
shown more determination to attack those problems than any in modern times, we have a liberal 
President who refuses to break with the past - - he vetoes every important reform and every 
serious attempt to bring needed change to the way Washington does business. Since the surest way 
to stop the big spenders is to not let them get their hands on the money, the current tax system 
has to go. The enormous tax-gathering bureaucracy, the byzantine rules and regulations, and all 
the abuses and outrages that go with it simply cannot be fixed. The slate must be wiped clean by 
repealing the 16th Amendment, and a sane, fair, workable means of paying for the essential 
functions of government should replace it." 
 
 <p>    Keene said ACU's strategy includes national "Town Meetings" on the tax reform issue, 
distribution of hundreds of thousands of citizen petitions to Congress calling for repeal of the 
16th Amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, direct lobbying of Congress, 
cooperation with public interest groups also interested in tax reform, and other projects. 

<p>     "The issue is no longer whether to drastically reform our tax non-system, but when," 
Keene added, noting that the issue was a major topic among GOP Presidential candidates and 
continues to rank high on the agendas of key Congressional leaders.  
 
 <p>    "ACU is preparing to buckle down for the long haul," Keene concluded. "We know it may 
take a few years for Congress and the states to complete the process of repeal and for a 
national consensus to be reached on a new and better tax system. ACU's job will be to help make 
sure that Washington does the right thing for the taxpayer, and we'll stay on the job for as 
long as it takes." 
 
<p>     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying 
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide 
range of issues before the Congress.

<title>WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?</title>

<h2> WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?<br>  
                    SURPRISE! IT'S TED KENNEDY </h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "Ted Kennedy built a career out of portraying every problem, however 
minor, as a crisis of mammoth proportions requiring immediate, massive government intervention. 
How ironic, then, that this same Ted Kennedy is the only one standing in the way of further 
Congressional action on S.1028, the health care legislation of which he is the chief 
co-sponsor," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Obviously, 
the Senator from Massachusetts isn't the least reluctant to fiddle while Rome burns when it 
suits his liberal political agenda." 
 
<p>     Keene referred to Kennedy's thus-far-successful parliamentary ploy blocking the 
appointment of Senate conferees on S.1028, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. Kennedy's 
delaying tactic is an attempt to pressure Senate leaders into not adding supporters of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs) to the proposed list of conferees. 
 
<p>     "Kennedy and his fellow ultra-liberals really aren't interested in true reform, which MSAs 
represent," Keene continued. "They only want to give the American people another dose of the 
same old Big Government elixir. They want to maintain government power and control, limit health 
care choices, and micromanage health care decision-making by patients, health care 
professionals, and the private sector. MSAs offer consumer choice, not government control - - 
and that is why the liberals oppose them. 
 
<p>     "In his vendetta against MSAs - - the most promising health care insurance reform idea 
proposed in years - - Kennedy shows he's all too willing to play inside-the-Beltway politics 
with people's health care. This is hypocrisy at its worst. The American people should insist 
that Sen. Kennedy either get on board for true reform, or get out of the way and let the rest of 
the American people's elected representatives deal with this issue promptly," Keene concluded. 
 
<p>     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots 
conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, 
it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>AX GAS TAX, ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "A few months ago, President Clinton admitted that he raised taxes too
much and that it was a mistake. That's all the more reason why he should start making amends
now by supporting the growing movement in Congress to repeal his unnecessary 4.3-cent
gasoline tax. If not, the least he ought to do is make a public commitment not to veto a repeal,"
said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. 
<P>
     "The current increases in gasoline prices stem from many factors," Keene added, "and as
the marketplace deals with them, prices will eventually decrease - - but only to a point. The
marketplace can't make tax burdens disappear. The public has been forced to get along with less
thanks to Clinton's various tax increases. ACU says it's high time government went on a diet,
and a good place to start is by junking the Clinton gas tax."        
<P>
     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots conservative lobbying
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies Congress on

<h2>REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, <br>
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</h2>
</center>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "The tax-and-spend crowd couldnt escape this time," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene, commenting on the tax limitation Constitutional amendment vote in the House of Representatives this week. "This was a real test of who wants to make it harder for the government to get its hands on the peoples money and who is a big spender. By and large, Republicans passed the test and the Democrats failed."
Republicans voted 219 to 24 to support limits on the taxes government takes. Democrats voted for business as usual by a vote of 160 against tax limits and only 16 for tax limits.
<P>
"All it takes is a simple plurality to raise taxes and increase spending," Keene said. "Because its so easy for Congress to spend other peoples money, thats why were in the fiscal mess we face today. If Congress claims to be serious about getting taxation and spending under control, then it should be prepared to vote for serious measures to do that. The Tax Limitation Amendment was just such a measure. Were pleased that it won the support of a majority in the House, but disappointed that it fell short of the necessary two-thirds. 
<P>
"We urge the American people to ask some tough questions of Congressmen who opposed this measure, to find out why they think it should continue to be so easy to tax, spend, run up the deficit and expand the national debt," Keene continued. "They also should ask these politicians, especially Democrats, why they insist on maintaining a tax-and-spend policy so out of control that Congress needs to pass a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Isnt it more sensible to change that system so that we dont have to pass laws to protect people from it?"
<P>


Keene rejected a chief argument of opponents that limiting the ability to raise taxes means   restricting the ability of Congress to use taxation as one way to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
<P>
"Too many tax-and-spend liberals think taxes first, spending cuts last - - if they think of spending cuts at all. If you give politicians easy access to the money, theyre going to spend it and then some. The answer is to cut off the gravy train. Americans already pay plenty in taxes. Even if Democrats and a few Republicans dont get it, the American people do: cut government spending and stop raising taxes. The two go hand in hand. ACU will keep up the pressure and work to make sure that next time, there will indeed be enough votes to enact this important remedy," Keene said.
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the countrys oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization, with nearly one million members and supporters.

<font size=3><b>The Impact Of The Ordinary Income Tax On Saving<br>
by <a href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a></b></font><br>
<hr>

<b>Executive Summary</center></b>
<P>
The financial strength of taxpayers at all economic levels, as
well as the financial strength of our government and our nation,
is being increasingly eroded year after year by the taxation of
private savings and investment growth.  A change from the ordinary
income tax treatment of saving to an expanded IRA-type tax treatment
of saving would benefit the economy, the taxpayer, and ultimately
the Treasury, too, by promoting higher rates of saving and economic
growth.  An example based on historical market returns on savings
will illustrate this fact.
<P>
Two taxpayers invested $100 of after-tax income in an actual mutual
fund on January 1, 1926.  Sixty-seven years later on 12/31/92
both taxpayers sold their fund.  This sixty-seven year period
included depressions, recessions, wars, and good times, too. 
This period also provides a reasonable illustration of what the
reward to saving might be in the many decades ahead.
<P>
Let's assume that one taxpayer, Larry Lo-bracket, was always in
the 15% tax bracket, and the other, Harry Hi-bracket, was always
in the 50% tax bracket (many, if not most, of those years had
tax brackets exceeding 50%).  On 12/31/92 Larry's $100 investment
was worth $57,708 and Harry's was only worth $9,195.  These compare
with values of $141,940 and $241,296 if Larry's and Harry's income
and investment <I>had not been subjected to the ordinary income
tax.</I>
<P>
In short, the ordinary income tax reduced Larry's otherwise invested
capital by 59% and Harry's by 96%!  Interestingly, Larry Lo-bracket's
loss was <I>four</I> times his tax bracket, and Harry Hi-bracket's
loss was <I>two</I> times his tax bracket!
<P>
In contrast, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, Larry would
have avoided the 15% tax ($17.65) on his income, and, thus, his
investment would have been $117.65.  Harry would have avoided
the 50% tax ($100) on his income, and his investment would have
been $200.00.  These larger investments provide the proper IRA
comparison with a $100 after-tax investment by each taxpayer under
the ordinary income tax.
<P>
Larry's <I>after-tax</I> value under the IRA-type plan on 12/31/92
would have been $120,649, <I>as would have Harry's.</I>  The $120,649
after-tax value for each man equals 85% of the $141,940 untaxed
value for Larry and 50% of the $241,298 untaxed value for Harry
(see above).  Larry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(15%), and Harry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(50%).  This is fair and proper taxation.
<P>
<I>As illustrated, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, both
men had the same after-tax value, $120,649, because each man's
out-of-pocket contribution consisted of $100, with the government
deferring its tax, i.e., $17.65 for Larry and $100 for Harry.</I>
<P>
Upon the IRA withdrawal on 12/31/92, the government not only recovered
its full tax deferral ($17.65 for Larry &amp; $100 for Harry),
it also enjoyed the entire untaxed, free-market investment return
on these tax deferred amounts.  While collecting the full free-market
growth on these IRA tax deductions, the government gave up the
yearly taxation of investment return and realized gain that it
would have otherwise collected under the ordinary income tax.
 <I>It is this yearly ordinary income tax on investment return
that punishes saving so harshly, and it is solely this second
layer of tax that is properly removed by tax-deductible IRAs.</I>
<P>
As illustrated above, each $100 of a taxpayer's IRA-type <I>net</I>
saving (i.e., <I>net</I> of the tax that's deferred) will enjoy
the same investment growth from the same investment <I>regardless
of tax bracket</I>.  This is so, because there is no further tax
on the <I>net</I> saving.  In short, this means that all of every
taxpayer's investment return and realized gain derived from <I>net
</I>IRA saving is received totally tax free.  This is sound economics,
as well as sound and fair tax treatment, because every dollar
of private saving adds equal economic value to our nation's success,
regardless of the source of the saving, be it from Larry Lo-bracket
or from Harry Hi-bracket.
<P>
The <I>new</I> saving generated by such a proper reversal of our
nation's existing and punitive ordinary income tax treatment of
saving will be very large and ongoing.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax destroys each taxpayer's investment
values that would otherwise be available for his or her own future
use.  The ordinary income tax also concurrently destroys the capital
available for the economy as a whole.  After all, capital saved
and invested by each taxpayer is used over and over again by others,
thereby generating more production, more jobs, and more taxes.
<P>
The negative bias of the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
has led to an increasing Congressional awareness that corrective
legislation must take place.  As a result, bipartisan legislation,
the Individual Investment Account Act, S. 929 and H.R. 3179, has
been sponsored in the 103rd Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA)
and Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA).  Briefly, this Act establishes
IRA-type accounts that permit-
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions by any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>No tax on the account's investment return or realized gain.<p>
<LI>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes
are paid solely upon withdrawals.<p>
<LI>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's
tax basis.<p>
<LI>Up to $15,000 of tax-deferred &quot;rollover&quot; for first-time
home buyers.  The tax basis of the home is reduced by the rollover.<p>
<LI>The proceeds from the sale of a primary residence may be rolled
over without tax into the tax-deferred IRA-type account, including
the $125,000 tax-free home sale proceeds after age 55.  The account's
tax basis is increased by the former residence's tax basis and
the $125,000 tax-free proceeds.<p>
<LI>The tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the
proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.
</UL>
<P>
These universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans without
penalty taxes and forced distributions will create such an upsurge
in new saving that any revenue loss will soon be outweighed by
the tax revenue gains arising from a greatly increased saving
rate.  Such increased saving leads to more investment, more production,
reduced costs of capital, more jobs, a higher standard of living,
and yes-more tax collections from sound economic growth.
<P>
The dynamic economic gains that flow from universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs can be measured in trillions of dollars of
increased GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  And, these GDP gains
translate into net dynamic tax revenue gains vs. the ordinary
income tax.  An appropriate report by the respected economics
consulting firm, Fiscal Associates, and included herein as Appendix
B, forecasts the static and dynamic economic results flowing from
the proposed legislation.
<P>
For example, three years after the adoption of universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, a healthier economy would bring in about
$17 billion in new federal tax revenue.  This would offset all
but about $10 billion of static revenue loss, as measured in the
erroneous &quot;tax expenditure&quot; manner utilized by government
analysts.  Within eight years, the real dynamic gains would (a)
fully offset the government's erroneous static revenue losses
and (b)<I> increase most taxpayers' after-tax income by approximately
15% to 20%.</I>  The bulk (85%) of this increase in after-tax
income would flow to taxpayers (including joint returns) with
adjusted gross incomes of under $100,000 per year.
<P>
Further, in a relatively short period of time (years 2000 - 2010),
annual GDP would be $500 billion to $1 trillion higher than otherwise,
thereby creating up to an additional two million more jobs than
otherwise.  Because of faster economic growth, annual tax revenues
would gradually grow each year to 30 billion dollars higher than
otherwise by the year 2010.  By the year 2060, GDP would be $32
trillion higher than otherwise and over 5 million more jobs than
otherwise would be created.
<P>
It is relevant to point out that the government relies upon its
staff-formulated &quot;static&quot; tax expenditure figures when
tax legislation is being considered.  This static tax expenditure
methodology is seriously flawed in that, among other things, it
ignores rational taxpayer reactions to tax law change.
<P>
Moreover, the government's 1995 Budget document admits for the
first time that the present value of its static IRA tax expenditure
figures for 1994 overstates IRA costs by over three times!  Thus,
it can be observed that not only is the government's static method
for measuring revenue loss flawed, the government's own numbers,
even using its own erroneous static method, are three times too
high!  In real life, the more realistic &quot;dynamic&quot; tax
revenue forecasts, as portrayed in this analysis, are superior.
 
<P>
Enacting universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans has
many very favorable, interrelated consequences for taxpayers,
our government, and our nation.  Similarly, there are often-heard
and generally superficial objections to expanding IRA-type plans.
These consequences and objections are addressed individually
and thoroughly in the &quot;perspectives&quot; section of this
analysis.
<P>
<U><I><b><center>Conclusions</I></U></b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving and investing
imposes enormous, ever-growing economic losses on our nation.
The net result is an ongoing compounding of economic injury to
savers, workers, users of capital, and the Treasury itself.<p>
<LI>The existing governmental tax revenue estimation methods that
neglect the dynamics of saving, and hence completely mismeasure
the tax revenue impact of tax-deductible IRA-type plans, are a
major driving force of our nation's erroneous tax policy as applied
to saving.<p>
<LI>The government's existing methods of estimating tax revenues
from IRA-type plans must be scrapped in favor of a more accurate
estimating process.<p>
<LI>The next sixty-seven years of savings and investment results
will have economic ups and downs not unlike the past sixty-seven.
Thus, the economic results, as portrayed in this analysis, that
flow from continuing the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
are a reasonable harbinger of a dismal economic future for our
nation if this irrational taxation of saving is not corrected
promptly.  On the other hand, tax-deductible IRA-type saving helps
everyone-including the user of capital, the government, and our
nation-not just the taxpayer.<p>
<LI>IRA-type plans must be improved, expanded, and promoted.<p>
<LI>Rather than limiting and discouraging the use of tax-deductible
IRA-type plans by taxpayers, the government should remove all
tax impediments to these plans and extol their use by everyone.<p>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving creates an ever-growing
atrophy of the economic strength of taxpayer/voters, the users
of capital, government, and our nation.  Expanded and improved
tax-deductible IRA-type plans will reverse this economic emaciation
and create sound, robust growth.

The political leaders of Hanoi were assured a joyful 20th 
Anniversary of their victory over South Vietnam after 
unwrapping a priceless gift.  It was a retrospective book of 
our involvement in Southeast Asia, authored by former 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, in which one line 
takes precedence over all others:  . . .We were wrong, 
terribly wrong.

<P>
President Clinton, not unexpectedly, has praised the 
book and commended the courage it took to write it.

<P>
Don't for a moment believe that this is a book of self-
deprecation.  It is, instead, a book in which the author 
misses few opportunities to praise himself, even including 
a picture of a mountain he climbed in Wyoming.  He 
modestly concedes that President Johnson wrote in a letter 
that the President never liked or admired anyone more 
than Robert McNamara.  

<P>
It is written in the same kind of confusion in which he 
served as Secretary of Defense:  one sentence contradicts 
another sentence, one paragraph impugns another 
paragraph, one point is made with strength, and then 
nurtured with weakness.  Those with whom he worked, 
including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, are criticized 
and complimented all at once.  It appears to be his way of 
covering all bases.  Mr. McNamara even devotes one short 
paragraph in praise of the Americans who gave their lives 
in Vietnam.  (It's on page 333 for those who may easily 
miss it.)

<P>
He further writes  that I do not know to this day 
whether I quit or was fired.  Maybe it was both. Maybe.  
Everything seems to be uncertain.  Nevertheless, when all 
the contradictory points, incidents, and dialogues are put 
aside, McNamara clearly blames President Johnson for 
not accepting much of  McNamara's wisdom.

<P>
The book, by its own omissions, encourages the spread 
of an American amnesia, a disease with which President 
Clinton has already been stricken.  Robert McNamara 
stops his history when he departed his job, thereby 
conveniently leaving out the evidence that we were not 
wrong, terribly wrong in becoming involved, but instead 
that our Congress was wrong, terribly wrong during the 
two-and-one-quarter years after our military came home.  
Those two-and-one-quarter years have been wiped from 
America's memory as our amnesia makes us believe that 
when our troops left, Vietnam fell.

<P>
It was January of 1973 when our military engagement 
ended under the Paris peace accords in which both sides 
agreed to be permitted to make periodic replacement of 
armaments, munitions and war material which have been 
destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cease-
fire, on the basis of piece-for-piece. . . .  North Vietnam 
replaced their losses on a four-to-one ratio rather than 
keeping the agreement of piece-for-piece, and the 94th 
Congress of the United States voted against supplying any 
replacements for South Vietnam's losses, stopping all aid 
of any kind to both Cambodia and South Vietnam, making 
defeat inevitable.  In April of 1975, both nations fell.

<P>
We signed those accords because Chapter Four, 
Article Nine of the agreement states that the South 
Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political 
future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and 
democratic elections under international supervision.  
Article Eleven stipulates the insurance of the democratic 
liberties of the people; personal freedom, freedom of 
speech, freedom of the press, freedom of meeting, 
freedom of organization, freedom of residence, freedom of 
work.

<P>
None of this is recorded in the McNamara book, nor 
will President Clinton remind the American people of 
those accords when, as expected, he gives diplomatic 
recognition to a government that to this day refuses to 
keep its word on an agreement that was the very reason we 
left Vietnam.

<P>
By McNamara concluding the book where he does 
there is no mention of the horrors that came about when 
the communists won the war.  There is not even a footnote 
recording the over one million fleeing boat people, the 
genocide in Cambodia, or the post-war concentration 
camps in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The morality of 
what we tried to do has been proven by the immorality of 
the victors.

<P>
In the chapter entitled <B>The Lessons of Vietnam</B>, he 
generously sets in print his recommendations for future 
foreign policy.  With the depth of a single piece of saran-
wrap, we are told that we should achieve a nuclear-free 
world in which multilateral decision-making takes place 
within a burden-sharing context, while we assure 
preservation of the global environment.  That should work. 

<P>
It's entirely possible that waiting for Robert McNamara 
to mature may take more time than patience will allow.  It 
is my hope, however, that the time will come when  he 
will review what he wrote in the mid-1990s and conclude 
that his anniversary gift to Hanoi was wrong, terribly 
wrong.

What should every schoolchild know about the history of this land of liberty we call America?  The National History Standards Project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Education Department, attempted to provide an answer to this
question; however, their report, released in late 1994, contains serious omissions and amusing political correctness.  In response, the Family Research Council prepared <I> Let Freedom Ring!, </I>an outline of U.S. history that avoids political fashion and emphasizes real knowledge of America's past.

   <H1>Hitler vs. The United Nations</H1>
   <h2>Liberty and the Bosnian Conflict</h2>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

Hitler was born sixty years too early to serve his ambitions.  Had he come to power in the 1990s instead of the 1930s, he would have won.

<p>
In the 1990s he would have been faced with the United Nations organization and the current leadership of the United States, and they would have offered little resistance.  I do not mean to suggest that they would have done nothing:

<p>
The U.N. forces would have stood at the railway stations, monitoring the families that were split apart among screams and tears.  U.N. monitors would also have stationed themselves outside Buchenwald and Dachau to monitor smoke when it was seen coming from the crematoriums.  But their orders would have been not to take a side in the conflict.

<p>
The United States leadership would adamantly oppose any aid to Great Britain on the grounds that it would "Americanize" the war, and the President would reject any weapons going to the underground movements in Europe, saying this would only "cause the death of innocent civilians."

<p>
In the 1990s the U.S. Presidents foreign policy has turned the nation into a Maxi-Switzerland, with his perception of our military as little more than a uniformed Peace Corps.  But its not only the administration.  Prominent voices in the opposition party are saying that engagement in Bosnia would not be in our national interest.  Are they saying the prevention of genocide would not be in the interest of the people of the United States?  And both major political parties concur that we must not send in U.S. ground troops to help the 
victims of Serbian aggression.

<p>
Without the will, our power (if we still have it), means nothing.  Militarily, Rule Number One is never to announce what <i>will not</i> be done.

<p>
The larger tragedy of contemporary times is that the word "peace" is given more importance than the word "liberty."  As is always the case when peace takes precedence over liberty, neither are achieved.  It is only when liberty is paramount that liberty and peace can both be realized.

<p>
President Lincoln could have had peace easily, saving 500,000 American lives.  He could have done that by ordering U.S. troops from Fort Sumter and allowing South Carolina and any other state to secede from the Union.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt could have had peace if on the morning of December 8, 1941 he would have asked Congress, not for a Declaration of War, but for a Declaration of Accommodation with the Axis powers, as an Asian and European War would not be worth the death of one more American.  And we would have had peace.

<p>
President Bush could have had peace in this decade by allowing Sadam Hussein to keep his troops in Kuwait and to allow him entry into Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman.  Surely Sadam Hussein would have sold us oil as he would have needed the dollars.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
In all cases there would have been the peace of the slave for the many, the peace of the master for the few, and the peace of the grave for the rest.

<p>
As President Clinton rejects any troops to protect the Bosnian civilians, he does not rule out 25,000 U.S. troops to safeguard the U.N. forces.  Why does he care more about the uniformed who were misplaced there by the U.N. than about the civilians who were born there--or who went there to be in a U.N. "safe area"?

<p>
What should we do?

<p>
Ignore the U.N.  Lift the arms embargo.  And with or without NATO, bomb all military targets of the Serbs, including all missile deployments, all anti-aircraft sites, all roads, supply lines, bridges, and arms factories, whether in Bosnia or Serbia, all the way to Belgrade with no privileged sanctuaries.  (The lesson we should have learned from the Vietnam war.)  And we should be willing to send in ground troops if necessary after the bombing, and make our willingness known.

<p>
Why should we do this?

<p>
Because were alive at this time.  Our obligation as human beings is to stop the atrocities of which we once said, "Never again."

<p>
But we said that a long time ago.  It was, after all, more than a half century ago that Hitler encountered a difficulty too large for him to overcome. The difficulty was that back then there were leaders in the world who held liberty as the most cherished human right.
